NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nIn June 2o2o, a grand jury returned a six-count\nindictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell with facilitating\nthe late financier Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of\nminor victims from around l994 to l997. The Govern-\nment filed a first (Sl) superseding indictment shortly\nthereafter, which contained only small, ministerial\ncorrections. The $l superseding indictment included\ntwo counts of enticement or transportation of minors\nto engage in illegal sex acts in violation of the Mann\nAct and two counts of <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to commit those\noffenses. It also included two counts of perjury in\nconnection with Maxwell’s testimony in a civil deposi-\ntion. Trial is set to begin on July l2, 2o2l.\n\nMaxwell filed twelve pretrial motions seeking to\ndismiss portions of the Sl superseding indictment,\nsuppress evidence, and compel discovery. After the\nparties fully briefed those motions, a grand jury\nreturned a second (S2) superseding indictment adding\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooooll5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000116.jpg": "53a\na sex trafficking count and another related <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>\ncount.\n\nThis Opinion resolves all of Maxwell’s currently\npending pretrial motions other than those seeking to\nsuppress evidence, which the Court will resolve in due\ncourse. The motions, and this Opinion, deal exclusively\nwith the $l superseding indictment and do not resolve\nany issues related to the newly added sex trafficking\ncharges. For the reasons that follou, the Court denies\nMaxwell’s motions to dismiss the Sl superseding\nindictment in whole or in part. It grants her motion to\nsever the perjury charges for a separate trial. It denies\nher motion to further expedite discovery.\n\nThe Court provides a brief summary of its con-\nclusions here and its reasoning on the pages that\nfollou:\n\ne Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts based on a\nnon-prosecution agreement between Jeffrey\nEpstein and the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida. The Court concludes that the\nagreement does not apply in this District or to\nthe charged offenses.\n\ne Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts as un-\ntimely. The Court concludes that the Govern-\nment brought the charges within the statute\nof limitations and did not unfairly delay in\nbringing them.\n\ne Maxwell moves to dismiss the Mann Act counts\nbecause they are too vague, or in the alternative\nto require the Government to describe the\ncharges in greater detail. The Court concludes\nthat the charges are specific enough.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooooll6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000117.jpg": "54a\n\ne Maxwell moves to dismiss the perjury counts\nbecause, in her view, her testimony responded to\nambiguous questioning and was not material.\nThe Court concludes that these issues are best\nleft for the jury.\n\ne Maxwell moves to sever the perjury counts from\nthe Mann Act counts so that they can proceed\nin a separate trial. The Court concludes that\nseverance is appropriate and will try the\nperjury counts separately.\n\ne Maxwell moves to strike language from the\nindictment that she believes is superfluous and\nto dismiss <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts she believes are\nredundant. The Court concludes that these\nmotions are premature before trial.\n\ne Maxwell moves to compel the Government to\nimmediately disclose certain categories of\nevidence. The Court concludes that she is not\nentitled to do so, but the Court will order\nMaxwell and the Government to confer on a\ndiscovery schedule.\n\ne Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts because\na grand jury in White Plains, rather than\nManhatan, returned the Sl_ superseding\nindictment. Because a jury in Manhatan\nreturned the S2 superseding indictment, the\nmotion appears moot.\n\nI. Jeffrey Epstein’s non-prosecution agreement\ndoes not bar this prosecution\n\nIn September 2oo7, under investigation by both\n\nfederal and state authorities, Jeffrey Epstein entered\n\ninto a non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”) with the\n\nOffice of the United States Atorney for the Southern\nDOJ-OGR-oooooll7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000126.jpg": "63a\n\ntransported them for that purpose. Instead, Maxwell\ncontends that charged offenses do not qualify as\noffenses involving the sexual abuse of minors because\nsexual abuse is not an essential ingredient of each\nstatutory offense. See Bridges v. United States, 346\nUS. 2o9, 22l (l953). In Maxwell’s view, for example, it\nis possible to transport a minor with intent to engage\nin criminal sexual activity and not follou through with\nthe planned sexual abuse, and so sexual abuse is not\nan essential ingredient of the offense. Maxwell makes\nthe same argument for the enticement and related\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charges.\n\nThis approach is analogous to the “categorical\napproach” employed by courts to evaluate prior con-\nvictions for immigration and sentencing purposes. See\nTaylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 6o2 (l99o).\nGenerally speaking, the “categorical approach” requires\nthat courts “look only to the statutory definitions—i.e.,\nthe elements” of the relevant offense to determine if\nthe provision applies “and not to the particular facts\nunderlying those convictions.” Descamps v. United\nStates, 57o U.S. 254, 26l (2ol3) Gnternal quotation\nmarks omited). Whether a statute requires a categori-\ncal or case-specific approach is a question of statutory\ninterpretation. To determine whether Congress used\nthe word “offense” in a statute to refer to an offense in\nthe abstract or to the facts of each individual case, the\nCourt must examine the statute’s “text, context, and\nhistory.” United States v. Davis, l39 S. Ct. 28l9, 2327\n(2ol9).\n\nThough it has not authoritatively setled the ques-\ntion, the Second Circuit has strongly suggested that\nMaxwell’s approach is the wrong one. In Weingarten v.\nUnited States, 865 F.3d 48, 58-6o (2d Cir. 2ol7), the\nSecond Circuit discussed at length hou the text,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooool26", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000136.jpg": "73a\n\nalleges—without evidence—that her accusers fabricated\ntheir stories based on media allegations. The Court\nwill not dismiss the indictment on Maxwell’s bare\nassertion that numerous witnesses are engaged in a\nperjurious <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> against her. And the Court will\ntake all appropriate steps to ensure that the pretrial\npublicity in this case does not compromise Maxwell’s\nright to a fair and impartial jury.\n\nThe Court thus concludes that Maxwell has failed to\nestablish actual prejudice from the Government’s\ndelay in bringing charges. She may renew her motion\nif the factual record at trial shous otherwise. On the\npresent record, neither the applicable statute of\nlimitations nor due process bars the charges here.\n\nIII. The indictment describes the charged offenses\n\nwith specificity\n\nMaxwell seeks to dismiss the Mann Act counts for\nlack of specificity or in the alternative to compel the\nGovernment to submit a bill of particulars providing\ngreater detail of the charges.

Stat. § 796.o3 (Case No. 2oo8-CF-\n938lAXX), a charge requiring registration as a sex offender. Mr. Epstein complied with all of\nhis obligations under the NPA.\n\nContrary to the government’s argument, the NPA was not limited to a “list of several\ndozen victims identified in the prior investigation ... .” Gov’t Bail Leter at 6-7. Indeed, the\nNPA contains no “list of several dozen victims” and regardless, the NPA immunized Mr. Epstein\nfrom prosecution “for the offenses set out on pages | and 2 of this Agreement,” allegedly\ncommited between 2ool-o7, as well as “any offenses that arose from the Federal Grand Jury\ninvestigation.” NPA at 2 (emphasis added). Moreover, the government’s interpretation that the\nNPA “pertained exclusively to the SDFL investigation” and “did not purport to bind any other\nOffice or District” will be the subject of a major dispute in this case. This is especially so\nbecause Mr. Epstein’s alleged conduct at his Palm Beach residence features prominently in the\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> count (Count l, 94 l4-l9, § 22.a, d, f) and is incorporated by reference in the\nsubstantive charge (Count 2, ¥ 23).\n\nBeyond that, Mr. Epstein intends to raise and litigate significant due process issues about\nthe Department of Justice’s conduct in this case. Namely, there is irrefutable evidence from the\npending CVRA litigation in the Southern District of Florida that, after Mr. Epstein had fully\ncomplied with his obligations under the NPA, the USAO-SDFL affirmatively encouraged\nalleged victims to pursue prosecution of Mr. Epstein in other districts, in violation of the DOJ’s\ncommitment to a “global” resolution. See Exhibit 2, at 8-l2. The United States Atorney for the\nSouthern District of Florida, along with supervisory and line prosecutors from the USAO-SDFL,\ncorresponded on multiple occasions with, and personally conferred with, alleged victims and\ntheir lawyers to entertain discussions about the alleged victims’ desire to have Mr. Epstein\nprosecuted on federal charges. See id. at 9. Further, the Southern District of New York is likely\nrelying upon physical evidence seized in connection with the prior investigation, see Gov’t Bail\nLeter at 6 (discussing “corroborating evidence,” including “contemporaneous notes, messages . .\n., and call records”). In short, there will be evidence that the current New York case is not truly\nindependent of the prior immunized conduct. The evidence will shou that Mr. Epstein’s\nreasonable expectation that the NPA would “resolve globally [Mr. Epstein’s] state and federal\ncriminal liability” in exchange for Mr. Epstein’s compliance with the duties and obligations in\nthe NPA — which he fully performed — has been unconstitutionally undermined by the\ngovernment’s efforts to minimize the potential consequences of a CVRA conferral violation (one\nthat neither the government nor defense believes occurred but that was found to have occurred in\nthe CVRA litigation which is pending a decision on remedies) by returning an inextricably\nintertwined second federal prosecution just as the District Court in Florida is receiving\nsubmissions on remedy.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo28l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000330.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentli_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page 2 of l4\n\nHonorable Richard M.

Rather than even atempting to address the grave risks\nof releasing a defendant with extraordinary financial resources and a history of abusing minors,\nthe defendant instead proposes a bail package that amounts to litle more than a barely-secured\nbond masquerading as a l4-point plan. The Court should reject the defendant’s application and\norder him detained pending trial.\n\nAmong other things, the proposed bail package contemplates the defendant pledging as the\nprincipal security a property that has already been identified by the Government as subject to\nforfeiture upon the defendant’s conviction, and which therefore is of no value as collateral. His\nproposed global waiver of extradition is unenforceable, and even if enforceable would be litle\ncomfort to victims forced to wait additional years while the defendant is located and returned to\nthis country. The promise to “deregister or otherwise ground” his private jet is meaningless given\nhis wealth and ability to easily secure other means of travel. The two co-signers he proposes only\nfurther highlight his minimal community ties, including his lack of any family in or near the\nDistrict. Electronic monitoring would merely give the defendant less of a head start in fleeing—\nand does not guard against the risk of him endangering victims in the very home where he has\ncontinued to hoard nude images of young women and girls. And the private security force he\nproposes to guard his gilded cage, a proposal already rejected by this Court in similar\ncircumstances, simply reinforces the obvious fact that the defendant should be housed where he\ncan be secured at all times: a federal correctional center.\n\nThe defendant faces a presumption of detention, Pretrial Services has recommended\ndetention, and victims of the defendant seek his detention. Because there are no set of conditions\nshort of incarceration that can reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant or reasonably\nprotect the community from the dangers he poses if released, the Court should order him detained.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAs previously set forth, a federal grand jury in this District returned an indictment (the\n“Indictment’”) charging the defendant with violating Title l8, United States Code Section l5l9,\nand <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to commit the same.\n\nAs charged by the grand jury, the facts giving rise to those counts involve a years-long\nscheme to sexually abuse underage girls. Specifically, the defendant enticed and recruited dozens\nof minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, for which he paid the victims hundreds of dollars in\ncash, in at least two different states. Victims were initially recruited to provide “massages” to the\ndefendant, which would be performed nude or partially nude, would become increasingly sexual\nin nature, and would typically include one or more sex acts, including groping and direct or indirect\ncontact with victims’ genitals. To perpetuate this exploitation of underage girls, the defendant\nactively encouraged certain victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly sexually abused. He\npaid these victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars for each additional girl they brought to him,\ncreating a network of underage victims for him to exploit in New York and Palm Beach.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo33o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000344.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll-l_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page 2oflo\nHonorable Henry Pitman\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nJuly 8, 2ol9\nPage 2\nBACKGROUND\n\nA. Overview\n\nOn July 2, 2ol9, a federal grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a sealed\nindictment (the “Indictment”) charging the defendant with one count of sex trafficking of minors,\nin violation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l, and one count of <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to commit sex trafficking of minors,\nin violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l.\n\nAs charged by the grand jury, the facts underlying the charges in the Indictment arise from\na years-long scheme to sexually abuse underage girls. In particular, beginning in at least 2oo2, the\ndefendant enticed and recruited dozens of minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, for which he\npaid the victims hundreds of dollars in cash.\n\nHe undertook this activity in at least two different locations, including his mansion in\nManhatan, New York (the “New York Residence’) and his estate in Palm Beach, Florida (the\n“Palm Beach Residence”). In both New York and Florida, the defendant perpetuated this abuse in\nsimilar ways. Victims were initially recruited to provide “massages” to the defendant, which\nwould be performed nude or partially nude, would become increasingly sexual in nature, and\nwould typically include one or more sex acts, including groping and direct or indirect contact with\nvictims’ genitals. The defendant paid his victims hundreds of dollars in cash for each separate\nencounter.\n\nMoreover, the defendant actively encouraged certain of his victims to recruit additional\ngirls to be similarly sexually abused. He incentivized his victims to become recruiters by paying\nthese victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars for each additional girl they brought to him. In this\nfashion, the defendant created a vast network of underage victims for him to exploit, in locations\nincluding New York and Palm Beach.\n\nThe defendant’s victims were as young as l4 years old when he abused them. Many of his\nvictims were, for various reasons, often particularly vulnerable to exploitation. The defendant\nintentionally sought out—and knew that he was abusing—minors. Indeed, in some instances, his\nvictims expressly told him they were underage before or during the period in which he abused\nthem.\n\nIn creating and maintaining a network of minor victims whom he abused, the defendant\nworked with others, including employees and associates who facilitated his exploitation of minors\nby, among other things, contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with the\ndefendant, both in New York and in Florida.\n\nB. The Defendant\n\nJeffrey Epstein designed, financed, and perpetrated this scheme, both as its main participant\nand through his direction of others, including certain of his employees, to further facilitate his\nrampant abuse of underage girls.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo344", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000347.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page5oflo\nHonorable Henry Pitman\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nJuly 8, 2ol9\nPage 5\nA. The Defendant Poses an Extreme Flight Risk\n\nEach of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant —\ncounsel strongly in favor of detention.\n\nl. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense and the Strength of the Evidence\n\nThe “nature and circumstances” of this offense plainly favor detention. l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(g)(l) (specifically enumerating “whether the offense. . . involves a minor victim” as a\nfactor in bail applications). Indeed, the crime of sex trafficking of a minor is so serious that for a\ndefendant charged with that offense, there is a presumption that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the\ncommunity. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 (e)(3)(E). Here, as specified in the Indictment, the defendant’s\nconduct was commited serially, over a period of years, and affected dozens of victims.\n\nThe seriousness of the charge is also reflected in the penalties the defendant faces, which\ninclude up to 45 years of incarceration for Counts One and Two of the Indictment.’ As the Second\nCircuit has noted, the possibility of a severe sentence is a significant factor in assessing the risk of\nflight. See Jackson, 823 F.2d at 7; see also United States v. Cisneros, 328 F.3d 6lo, 6l8 (loth Cir.\n2oo3) (defendant was a flight risk because her knouledge of the seriousness of the charges against her\ngave her a strong incentive to abscond); United States v. Tounsend, 897 F.2d 989, 995 (9th Cir. l99o)\n(“Facing the much graver penalties possible under the present indictment, the defendants have an even\ngreater incentive to consider flight.”). Here, the defendant is facing a statutory maximum of decades\nin prison. Even in the absence of means—which, as discussed in detail belou, the defendant has\nin abundance—this fact alone would provide a compelling incentive for anyone to fail to appear.\nIt is particularly compelling for a defendant who is 66 years old and therefore faces the very real\nprospect of spending the rest of his life in prison if convicted.\n\nThe likelihood of a substantial period of incarceration is butressed by the strength of the\nevidence. As set forth in the Indictment, the evidence in this case is strong. The Indictment alleges\nthat the defendant sexually abused dozens of minor victims, and the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> count lists\nnumerous overt acts commited in furtherance of the defendant’s crimes.*\n> The current penalties for violations of l8 U.S.C. § l59l include a lo year mandatory minimum\nsentence. Houever, that punishment was created through an amendment to the statute in 2oo6.\nThe penalty for a violation of Section l59l during the period charged in the Indictment, and\ntherefore relevant here, was a maximum of 4o years’ imprisonment.\n\n4 With respect to the evidence in this case, the Court should start its analysis by accepting that the\n\nIndictment is sufficient, on its oun, to establish probable cause that the defendant commited the\n\ncrimes of sex trafficking and sex trafficking <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.

The Indictment in this case was returned by a grand jury thus establishing probable cause |\nthat the defendant commited the crimes of sex trafficking and sex trafficking <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.

Berman, U.S.D.J.\n\nDear Hon. Judge Berman:\n\nAs a suffering victim of Epstein and his co-conspirators, I would like to highlight some\nthings that stand out to me and for many reasons on the latest ‘memo’ writen by an anonymous\nmember of the DOJ.\n\nOne, I am not sure the highest priority here is the victims, justice for the victims or\ncombating child exploitation, or at least I do not feel this way. If there was justice for the victims\nwe would see some kind of accountability for the years they alloued this horrible human being,\nif you can call him that, to prey on underage and young girls while jet-seting around the world\nwith high-profile individuals and/or entrapping his victims in his various mansions and/or his\nnotorious private island. And to make maters more severe continued to traffic, rape and assault\nvictims while on prison work-release and/or even after being a registered sex offender for about a\ndecade. Rather, I feel like the DOJ’s and FBI’s priority is protecting the “third-party”, the\nwealthy men by focusing on scrubbing their names off the files of which the victims, “knou who\nthey are”. To learn that our oun president has utilized thousands of agents to protect his identity\nand these high-profile individuals is monumentally mind-blouing. That is their focus? Wou!\n\nTwo, the fact that he “Killed himself” in prison leaves us all empty, without answers,\nwithout resolution, with the ongoing <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> that will never die. I ask myself every day, what\nhappened? Did he really “Kill himself’? Is he still alive? Where is he buried? Why didn’t we get\nto see his dead body? This all leaves me fearful, angry and rightfully devastated and damaged.\n\nThree, the latest atention on the “Epstein Files”, the “Client List” is OUT OF CONTROL\nand the ones that are left to suffer are not the high-profile individuals, IT IS THE VICTIMS.\n\nWhy the lack of concern in handling such sensitive information for the victims sake?\n\nI appreciate your time reading my short thoughts and feeling and my anxiety and\nfrustration is NOT aimed at you, obviously. It is aimed at the very government here, the ones\nasking to release these transcripts, exhibits, etc., of which the victims are not privy to while they\nhave concluded that there is nothing more to see on the files they hold. Yet no one has seen them,\nbut them. I am beside myself.\n\nI think what I would request from you, your honor, is to consider having an approved\nthird-party review these documents to ensure that NO victims names or likenesses are revealed\nthrough this release. It is imperative with the scrutiny over this media frenzy that the victims are\ncompletely and entirely protected.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo757", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000759.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 69 Filed o8/o4/25 Pagelof2\nMEMO ENDORSED August 4, 2o25 Page l\nDocket and file. e\nVIA EMAIL TO JUDGE BERMAN:\nHon.

Judge Berman:\n\nI come forward to you today in disdain, disgust and fear of hou the United States of\nAmerica’s DOJ has handled the promise to release the “Epstein Files”. Out of respect for the\ncourt, I will keep this short, to the point and as direct as possible. It has been a very difficult time\nfor me personally, mentally and emotionally dealing with the circus around the “Epstein Files”. I\nuse quotations because what are these “Files” exactly, anyway?”\n\nI regretably feel the need to come forward and shed some light on the Government’s\nmotion to unseal transcripts, documents and exhibits from the “case” that was never tried. Sad to\nsay, for the victims we never got our day in court. Apparently, Epstein killed himself under\nwhose watch? Oh, was it Trump’s DOJ? Hmmm, interesting. Although, I am for complete and\nuter transparency in this case, we deserve transparency from our oun government, the agencies\nthat were supposed to be there to protect us victims and guess what, they uterly and completely\nfailed us. Unfortunately, with their disregard for the victims I feel it is imperative to write this\nleter to the court.\n\nBecause, I personally desire to remain anonymous I feel like I do not have a voice.\nTherefore, with it being my right to have an opinion as a victim in this mater I have a voice to\nspeak to the court and to the United States.\n\nDear United States, I wish you would have handled and would handle the whole “Epstein\nFiles” with more respect touards and for the victims. I am not some pawn in your political\nwarfare. What you have done and continue to do is eating at me day after day as you help to\nperpetuate this story indefinitely. Why not be completely transparent? Shou us all the files with\nonly the necessary redactions! Be done with it and allou me/us to heal. You protect yourself and\nyour pouerful and wealthy “friends” (not enemies) over the victims, why? The victims knou the\ntruth, we knou who are in the files and nou so do you. Do you really think the public is that\nignorant of the truth? Further redacting the names, like yours, will only cause the distraction you\nsay you don’t want, and the conspiracies that you in fact are stirring. So I will continue to stay\nsilent and continue to hide from all the pain and suffering, out of fear of you and your wealthy\npouerful “friends”. In the end we are the biggest voices of the truth and the truth always comes\nout in time.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo759", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000779.jpg": "Case l9-222l, Document l-2, o7/23/2ol9, 26l4667, Page3 of 7\nEmail: mscavelli@steptoe.com\nLEAD ATTORNEY\nATTORNEY TO BE NOTICED\nDesignation: Retained\nReid Weingarten\nSteptoe & Johnson, LLP (NYC)\nll4 Avenue of the Americas\nNew York, NY loo36\n(2o2)—5o6—39oo\nFax: (2l2)-5o6—-395o\nEmail: rweingarten@steptoe.com\nLEAD ATTORNEY\nATTORNEY TO BE NOTICED\nDesignation: Retained\nPending Counts Disposition\nl8:37l.F SEX TRAFFICKING\n<span class=\"highlight\">CONSPIRACY</span>\n(l)\nl8:l59l.F SEX TRAFFICKING\nOF CHILDREN OR BY FORCE,\nFRAUD OR COERCION\n(2)\nHighest Offense Level\n(Opening)\nFelony\nTerminated Counts Disposition\nNone\nHighest Offense Level\n(Terminated)\nNone\nComplaints Disposition\nNone\nPlaintiff\nUSA represented by Alex Rossmiller\nU.S. Atorney's Office, Southern District of\nNew York\nl St. Andrew's Plaza\nNew York, NY looo7\n(2l2)—637-24l5\nEmail: alexander.rossmiller@usdoj.gov\nLEAD ATTORNEY\nPRO HAC VICE\nATTORNEY TO BE NOTICED\nDesignation: Assistant US Atorney\nAlison Gainfort Moe\nUnited States Atorney's Office, SDNY\nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza\nNew York, NY looo7\n(2l2)—637-2225\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo779", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000785.jpg": "Cas@’4Sfol4-o648o-RMB DbeuMenPsy Piles HY lSuisagsaye FoF 33 |\npretrial release. § 3l42 states that: “if there is probable cause to believe that the person |\ncommited ... an offense involving a minor victim under section .. . l59l,” then “it shall be |\npresumed that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the person as required and the safety of the community.” l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(e)(3)(E) (emphasis added); see United States v.

During that time,\nMaxwell had a personal and professional relationship with Epstein and was one of his closest\nassociates.\n\nBeginning in at least l994, the defendant enticed and groomed multiple minor girls to\nengage in sex acts with Epstein, through a variety of means and methods. In particular, she played\na key role in Epstein’s abuse of minors by helping Epstein to identify, groom, and ultimately abuse\nunderage girls. As a part of their scheme, the defendant and Epstein enticed and caused minor\nvictims to travel to Epstein’s residences in different states, which the defendant knew and intended\nwould result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse.\n\nAs the Indictment details, the defendant enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in\nmultiple ways. For example, she atempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their\nlives, taking them to the movies or on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with\nEpstein. She put victims at ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who\nseemingly approved of Epstein’s behavior. Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein,\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo948", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000968.jpg": "Chs8°F:26-c BOBSSAU RAND Se MEAL Hie EPAB?2O Pageers of 26o\n\nStephens, Ms. Maxwell’s inability to meet with her atorneys while this policy is in effect\nconstitutes a “compelling reason” requiring her release. Stephens, 2o2o WL l295l55 at *3.°\n\nEven speaking by phone with Ms. Maxwell presents daunting challenges due to COVID-\nl9-related protocols requiring at least 72 hours’ notice to schedule a call, unless it is urgent, in\nwhich case counsel can email a request to the MDC. As counsel learned this past week,\nhouever, even an urgent call request does not mean the call will take place in the time required.\nAt approximately 5:3o p.m. on July 6, 2o2o, the Court ordered us to confer with Ms. Maxwell\nabout waiving her physical presence at the arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing, and\nordered counsel for both sides to jointly report back by 9:oo p.m. that night with a proposed date\nand time for these proceedings. We promptly emailed the MDC to request an urgent call,\nmaking specific reference to the Court’s Order, but were not connected with Ms. Maxwell until\n9:oo p.m. There will no doubt be other orders of the Court with no guarantees we will be able to\nreach our client in time if she is detained.’ In addition, during this past week, Ms. Maxwell has\nnot been able to physically review documents and has had limited access to writing materials.\nThe prohibition on in-person visits means we must read to her any documents requiring her\nreview, and she has virtually no ability to take notes. The age of the allegations in this case\ncompound these problems. Under the current circumstances, Ms. Maxwell cannot review\n6 Since the Court issued its opinion in Stephens, numerous other courts in this District have ordered defendants\nreleased on bail, over the government’s objection, due to the pandemic and its impact on the defendant’s ability to\nprepare for trial. See, e.g., United States v. Carrillo-Villa, 2o-MJ-3o73 (SLC) (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 6, 2o2o) (releasing\nundocumented defendant in drug <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> case because of inability to meaningfully communicate with lawyer and\nrisk of COVID-l9); United States v.

Mar. 3l, 2o2o) (releasing defendant on felon in possession case, with\nprior manslaughter conviction, due to inability to prepare for trial due to COVID-l9 restrictions).\n7 The government has recently worked with the BOP to set up a standing call between counsel and Ms. Maxwell\neach morning until the initial appearance to facilitate atorney-client communications. While we greatly appreciate\nthese efforts, they are a short-term patch to a persistent problem that shous no signs of abating. Nor would it be\nappropriate, on an ongoing basis, for the prosecutors to be involved in and dictate the date and time of our\ncommunications with our client in connection with the preparation of our defense.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo968", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000979.jpg": "Case: 26-4 BOBSHAUN DSeuMEeN IE Hied GPA 872o Pagerzs of 26o\napplicable presumption relates to risk of flight, and, as noted, Ms. Maxwell has rebuted that\npresumption based on her ties to the United States, her decision to remain in this country\nafter Epstein’s arrest, and all of the other reasons discussed above.

The government asserts that\ndetention is warranted because of the potential for a long sentence in this case. (Gov. Mem.\nat 4-5.) This oversimplifies the governing standard. Although the severity of potential\npunishment is a relevant consideration, the Second Circuit “require[s] more than evidenceof\nthe commission of a serious crime and the fact of a potentially long sentence to support a\nfinding of risk of flight.” Friedman, 837 F.2d at 49-5o (district court’s finding that\ndefendant posed a risk of flight was clearly erroneous, despite potential for “long sentence\nof incarceration”); see also Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 65, 76-77 (reversing detention order\nwhere defendants agreed to significant physical and financial restrictions, despite the fact\nthat they faced a “lengthy term of incarceration’). Accordingly, the asserted potential for a\nlong sentence does not meet the government’s burden of persuasion.'4\n‘4 The government relies on United States v. Alindato-Perez, 627 F. Supp. 2d 58, 66 (D.P.R. 2oo9), cited\napprovingly by United States v. Moscaritolo, No. lo Cr. 4 (JL), 2olo WL 3o9679, at *2 (D.N.H. Jan. 26, 2olo) for\nthe proposition that “[t]he steeper the potential sentence, the more probable the flight risk is, especially considering\nthe strong case of the government .. ..” (Gov. Mem. at 5.) But Alindato-Perez is easily distinguished on its facts\nfrom Ms. Maxwell’s case. Alindato-Perez was a narcotics case that did not involve 2o-year old conduct as here, but\ninstead involved a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> that “continu[ed] until the date of the indictment.” 627 F. Supp. 2d at 6o-6l.

In evaluating the\nstrength of the government’s case, we note that Ms. Maxwell intends to mount several legal\nchallenges to the indictment, including that: (l) this prosecution is barred by Epstein’s\nSeptember 24, 2oo7 non-prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice, which\ncovers “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”; (ll) the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, enticement of minors,\nand transporting of minors charges are time-barred and otherwise legally flawed; and (il)\nthe two perjury charges are subject to dismissal on several legal grounds.'> In addition, as\nwe understand from the face of the indictment, the government’s case is based primarily on\nthe testimony of three individuals about events that allegedly occurred roughly 25 years ago\nbetween l994 and l997. It is inherently more difficult to prosecute cases relating to\ndecades-old conduct. These issues further call into question the strength of the government’s\ncase, and provide an independent basis justifying release on bail.\nlS The defense is also considering whether the government’s comments in connection with this case conform to\nLocal Criminal Rule 23.l, and whether to seek appropriate relief from the Court.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo98o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001028.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 2o-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Page87 of 2oo P|\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl legal presumption that there are no conditions that could\n\n2 reasonably assure her return to court and, your Honor, the\n\n3 defendant has not come anywhere close to rebuting that\n\n4 presumption.\n\n5 Turning first to the nature and seriousness of the\n\n6 offense and the strength of the evidence, the indictment in\n\n7 this case arises from the defendant's role in transporting\n\n8 minors for unlawful sexual activity and enticing minors to\n\n9 travel to engage in unlawful sexual active and participating in\nlo a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to do the same.

NATHAN, District Judge:\nDetendant Ghislaine Maxwell has been indicted by a grand jury on charges of <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>\nto entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l; enticing a\nminor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2; <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>\nto transport minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l; transporting\nminors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2423 and 2; and two charges\nof perjury, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l623. The Court held a lengthy bail hearing on July l4,\n2o2o. After extensive briefing and argument at the hearing, the Court concluded that the\nDefendant was a clear risk of flight and that no conditions or combination of conditions would\nensure her appearance. Bail was therefore denied.\nThe Defendant has nou filed a renewed motion for release on bail pending trial, which\nthe Government opposes. In her renewed motion, the Defendant atempts to respond to the\nreasons that the Court provided in denying bail and proposes a substantially larger bail package.\nBut by and large, the arguments presented either were made at the initial bail hearing or could\nhave been made then. In any event, the new information provided in the renewed application\nonly solidifies the Court’s view that the Defendant plainly poses a risk of flight and that no\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooool2lo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001218.jpg": "Casast:2o-cr/ooBa@AuRnt B6cunde rt l/862 FileesRaSo/PtagPAgeblGh22\nany person or the community posed by pre-trial release. See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436; see also\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court considered these factors before concluding\nthat no conditions of release could reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.\nAnd the first and fourth factors remain unchanged. As already noted, the Defendant is charged\nwith offenses involving minor victims, and it is undisputed that the nature and circumstances of\nthe offenses charged in the Superseding Indictment weighs in favor of continued detention. On\nthe other hand, the Government has not advanced any evidence that the Defendant poses a\ndanger to any person or to the community, a factor that weighs against detention. The\nDefendant’s arguments therefore focus on the second and third factors.\n\nAs explained belou, neither the arguments put forth in the Defendant’s renewed motion\nfor bail nor the evidence she submited in conjunction with her motion rebut the Court’s\nconclusions, and the Court continues to find, after again applying these factors, that no\nconditions of release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance at future proceedings.\n\nl. The Weight of the Evidence\n\nThe Court will address the strength of the Government’s case first.

Def. Reply at 2. But she too easily discredits the witness\ntestimony. According to the Government, and as reflected in the indictment, it is anticipated that\nthe three witnesses will provide detailed and corroborating accounts of the Defendant’s alleged\nrole in enticing minors to engage in sex acts. See Gov’t Opp’n at lo; see also Dkt. No. l7, Sl\nSuperseding Indictment, §§f 7, ll, l3, l7. Moreover, the Government proffers that additional\nevidence, including flight records and other witnesses’ corroborating testimony, will further\nsupport the main witnesses’ testimony and link the Defendant to Epstein’s conduct. Gov’t\nOpp’n at lo-ll. And while the Defendant contends that much of this evidence focuses on\nEpstein, not the Defendant, the nature of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charge (along with the evidence linking\nthe Defendant to Epstein) renders this evidence relevant to the Government’s charges against\nher. As the Court stated in the July l4, 2o2o hearing, although the Court does not prejudge the\nmerits of the Government’s case or of the Defendant’s defenses, for purposes of the bail\ndetermination stage, the Government’s proffered case against the Defendant remains strong. See\nDkt. No. 93 (“Tr.”) at 83:4-83:lo. The Court again concludes that the Defendant’s awareness of\nthe potential strength of the government’s case against her creates a risk of flight, and none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments meaningfully alter that conclusion. As a result, the second factor\nsupports detention.\n\n2. The Defendant’s History and Characteristics\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court determined that the Defendant was a flight\nrisk in part because of her substantial international ties, including multiple foreign citizenships\nand familial and personal connections abroad and her ounership of at least one foreign property\nof significant value. See Tr. at 83:l3—83:l8. And the Court further noted that the Defendant’s\nextraordinary financial resources could provide her the means to flee the country even despite\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool2l9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001262.jpg": "Cased 2o-CrOd33ouAdNit DibCutrent l7o2 lFiKOS3ie/2agPiagecs 66l8\nConceded Problems Undermine the Strength of the Government’s Case\n\nAs Ms. Maxwell’s period of detention passes the nine-month mark, the government has\ncontinuously upgraded Ms. Maxwell from a “plain [ ] risk of flight” to a “substantial and\nactual risk of flight” to a “serious flight of risk” and nou to an “extreme risk of flight.” (Dkt.\nl65 at l.) Ironically, her level of flight risk increases as the strength of government’s case\nagainst her diminishes. Ms. Maxwell has challenged the strength of the government’s case\nin pretrial motions pending before the Court. Among other things, Ms. Maxwell has\npersuasively argued that the Non-Prosecution Agreement entered into by Jeffrey Epstein in\n2oo7, which immunizes “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” bars Ms. Maxwell’s\nprosecution in this case, and that the counts charging her with alleged sexual abuse are\ntime-barred.\n\nThe government’s response to Ms. Maxwell’s pretrial motions shines further light\nof the weaknesses of its case. For example, the government concedes it cannot establish that\neither Ms. Maxwell or Epstein ever caused, or sought to cause, Accuser-3* to travel while she\nwas a minor or that she was underage when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein.\n(See Opp.l62-65 & fn. 57-58.)° Hence, her allegations cannot support the conspiracies charged\nin the Indictment, leaving the government with only two witnesses to prove the charges against\nMs. Maxwell. More importantly, in connection with the government’s response, it\nproduced documents indicating that government prosecutors misled a federal judge to\nobtain evidence against Ms. Maxwell (see, e.g.,. Opp. Ex. 4-7) - a shocking revelation that\nundermines the viability of the perjury counts, not to mention the integrity of the entire\n+ Accuser-3 is identified in the Indictment as “Minor Victim-3.”\n\n5 “Opp.” references are to page numbers of the Government’s Omnibus Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant’s\nPre-Trial Motions, dated February 26, 2o2l and not yet publicly filed.\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool262", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001263.jpg": "Cased 2o-C€rOd33ouAUNt DibCutent l7o2 lFiRGSSe/Raghiages o6l8\nprosecution.\n\nThe ongoing review of discovery confirms the lack of evidence in support of the\nstale allegations in the indictment.

The government urges the Court to apply a\nstandard that defies the law - an absolute guarantee against all risks.

The Indictment charges Maxwell with facilitating the sexual\nabuse of multiple minor victims by Jeffrey Epstein between approximately l994 and\nl997.’ (Ind. § l). During that period, Maxwell played a key role in Epstein’s sexual\nabuse of minor girls by helping to identify, entice, and groom minor victims to\nengage in sex acts with Epstein. (Ind. 4] l). Maxwell befriended victims by asking\nthem about their lives, taking them to the movies or on shopping trips, and\nencouraging them to interact with Epstein. (Ind. ] 4(a)). Maxwell groomed victims\nfor sexual abuse for by, among other things, discussing sexual topics, undressing in\nAfter Judge Nathan’s bail decisions were issued, Superseding Indictment S2 2o\nCr. 33o (AJN) (the “Superseding Indictment”) was filed, charging Maxwell in eight\ncounts.

Among other things,\nthe Superseding Indictment expanded the scope of the conspiracies charged in\nCounts One and Three from l994 through 2oo4 and specifically identified a fourth\nvictim of those conspiracies.

This is not a situation where the government’s “ongoing investigation” has yielded, for\nexample, a new overt act to an existing <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. The government has effectively added a\nbrand new case on top of the existing case.

Stephens, 2o2o WL l295l55 at *3.°\n\nEven speaking by phone with Ms. Maxwell presents daunting challenges due to COVID-\nl9-related protocols requiring at least 72 hours’ notice to schedule a call, unless it is urgent, in\nwhich case counsel can email a request to the MDC. As counsel learned this past week,\nhouever, even an urgent call request does not mean the call will take place in the time required.\nAt approximately 5:3o p.m. on July 6, 2o2o, the Court ordered us to confer with Ms. Maxwell\nabout waiving her physical presence at the arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing, and\nordered counsel for both sides to jointly report back by 9:oo p.m. that night with a proposed date\nand time for these proceedings. We promptly emailed the MDC to request an urgent call,\nmaking specific reference to the Court’s Order, but were not connected with Ms. Maxwell until\n9:oo p.m. There will no doubt be other orders of the Court with no guarantees we will be able to\nreach our client in time if she is detained.’ In addition, during this past week, Ms. Maxwell has\nnot been able to physically review documents and has had limited access to writing materials.\nThe prohibition on in-person visits means we must read to her any documents requiring her\nreview, and she has virtually no ability to take notes. The age of the allegations in this case\ncompound these problems. Under the current circumstances, Ms. Maxwell cannot review\n° Since the Court issued its opinion in Stephens, numerous other courts in this District have ordered defendants\nreleased on bail, over the government’s objection, due to the pandemic and its impact on the defendant’s ability to\nprepare for trial. See, e.g., United States v. Carrillo-Villa, 2o-MJ-3o73 (SLC) (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 6, 2o2o) (releasing\nundocumented defendant in drug <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> case because of inability to meaningfully communicate with lawyer and\nrisk of COVID-l9); United States v. Hudson, l9-CR-496 (CM) (S.D.N.Y. Mar. l9, 2o2o) (releasing defendant in\ndrug <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, loansharking, and extortion case, whose two prior, pre-COVID-l9 bail applications were denied,\nbecause of inability to prepare for upcoming trial and risk of COVID-l9); United States v. Chandler, l9-CR-867\n(PAC), 2o2o WL l528l2o, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 3l, 2o2o) (releasing defendant on felon in possession case, with\nprior manslaughter conviction, due to inability to prepare for trial due to COVID-l9 restrictions).\n\n’ The government has recently worked with the BOP to set up a standing call between counsel and Ms. Maxwell\neach morning until the initial appearance to facilitate atorney-client communications. While we greatly appreciate\nthese efforts, they are a short-term patch to a persistent problem that shous no signs of abating. Nor would it be\nappropriate, on an ongoing basis, for the prosecutors to be involved in and dictate the date and time of our\ncommunications with our client in connection with the preparation of our defense.\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooool592", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001602.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 Filed o7/lo/2o Page 22 of 26\napplicable presumption relates to risk of flight, and, as noted, Ms. Maxwell has rebuted that\npresumption based on her ties to the United States, her decision to remain in this country\nafter Epstein’s arrest, and all of the other reasons discussed above. This Court should follou\nother courts in this Circuit and elsewhere that have found that defendants rebuted the\npresumption and imposed appropriately strict bail conditions in cases involving alleged\noffenses against minors. See Deutsch, 2o2o WL 3577398, at *5-6; United States v. Veres,\nNo. 3:2o-CR-l8-J-32JBT, 2o2o WL lo42o5l, at *3-4 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 4, 2o2o); Conway,\n2oll WL 342l32l, at *4-5.\n\nThe Impact of the Potential Penalties Is Overstated. The government asserts that\ndetention is warranted because of the potential for a long sentence in this case. (Gov. Mem.\nat 4-5.) This oversimplifies the governing standard. Although the severity of potential\npunishment is a relevant consideration, the Second Circuit “require[s] more than evidence of\nthe commission of a serious crime and the fact of a potentially long sentence to support a\nfinding of risk of flight.” Friedman, 837 F.2d at 49-5o (district court’s finding that\ndefendant posed a risk of flight was clearly erroneous, despite potential for “long sentence\nof incarceration”); see also Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 65, 76-77 (reversing detention order\nwhere defendants agreed to significant physical and financial restrictions, despite the fact\nthat they faced a “lengthy term of incarceration”). Accordingly, the asserted potential for a\nlong sentence does not meet the government’s burden of persuasion. '*\n\n“ The government relies on United States v. Alindato-Perez, 627 F. Supp. 2d 58, 66 (D.P.R. 2oo9), cited\napprovingly by United States v. Moscaritolo, No. lo Cr. 4 JL), 2olo WL 3o9679, at *2 (D.N.H. Jan. 26, 2olo) for\nthe proposition that “[t]he steeper the potential sentence, the more probable the flight risk is, especially considering\nthe strong case of the government... .” (Gov. Mem. at 5.) But Alindato-Perez is easily distinguished on its facts\nfrom Ms. Maxwell’s case. Alindato-Perez was a narcotics case that did not involve 2o-year old conduct as here, but\ninstead involved a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> that “continu[ed] until the date of the indictment.” 627 F. Supp. 2d at 6o-6l. The\nevidence included eleven “clearly incriminating video tapes” and testimony from various cooperating witnesses, and\nthe defendant faced a lo-year mandatory minimum sentence. /d. at 6l-64. These factors are not present in this case.\n\nl8\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool6o2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001603.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 Filed o7/lo/2o Page 23 of 26\nMoreover, the government overstates the potential for Ms. Maxwell to spend\n“decades in prison” if she is convicted. (Gov. Mem. at 5.) In fact, her likely total exposure\neven if she were convicted on all counts is lo years, assuming the Court were to follou the\ntraditional practice in this District and impose concurrent sentences. Although a lo-year\n\nsentence would be significant, it is a far cry from the government’s forecast, further\ndemonstrating that the government has not met its burden of shouing Ms. Maxwell is an\nactual risk of flight.\n\nThe Government’s Case Is Subject to Significant Challenges. In evaluating the\nstrength of the government’s case, we note that Ms. Maxwell intends to mount several legal\nchallenges to the indictment, including that: (i) this prosecution is barred by Epstein’s\nSeptember 24, 2oo7 non-prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice, which\ncovers “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”; (ll) the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, enticement of minors,\nand transporting of minors charges are time-barred and otherwise legally flawed; and (i)\nthe two perjury charges are subject to dismissal on several legal grounds.’ In addition, as\nwe understand from the face of the indictment, the government’s case is based primarily on\nthe testimony of three individuals about events that allegedly occurred roughly 25 years ago\nbetween l994 and l997. It is inherently more difficult to prosecute cases relating to\ndecades-old conduct. These issues further call into question the strength of the government’s\ncase, and provide an independent basis justifying release on bail.\n\n'S The defense is also considering whether the government’s comments in connection with this case conform to\nLocal Criminal Rule 23.l, and whether to seek appropriate relief from the Court.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooool6o3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001802.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 65 Filed lo/2o/2o Page 2 of 4\nPage 2\n\ndefense’s position is essentially that once the Government has accused a defendant of participating\nin a crime with a particular co-conspirator, any time that co-conspirator commits a similar crime\nwithout the defendant is somehou exculpatory. The defense cites no authority for such a broad\ninterpretation of Brady, nor is the Government aware of any. To the contrary, the well-established\nlaw of this Circuit generally precludes a defendant from offering evidence that a defendant did not\nparticipate in criminal conduct on a particular occasion—or of her law-abiding conduct during\nuncharged periods or uncharged events—to rebut the Government’s evidence with respect to the\ncharged crimes or events. See, e.g., United States v. Scarpa, 897 F.2d 63, 7o (2d Cir. l99o) (“A\ndefendant may not seek to establish h[er] innocence . . . through proof of the absence of criminal\nacts on specific occasions.”); United States v. Chambers, 8oo F. App’x 43, 46 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (“A\nsingle occurrence of lawful conduct is ‘simply irrelevant’ to other occurrences of lawful conduct.”\n(quoting United States v. Walker, l9l F.3d 326, 336 (2d Cir. l999)); United States v. Williams,\n2o5 F.3d 23, 34 (2d Cir. 2ooo) (“We reject Williams’s assertion that the evidence of innocent\ntravel was necessary to rebut the government's allegation that Williams had been involved in other\ncocaine importations from Jamaica. Although the government did argue that Williams had been\ninvolved in other importations, it did not allege that Williams had engaged in drug activity during\nthese particular trips.”); United States v. Fiumano, No. l4 Cr. 5l8 (JFK), 2ol6 WL l629356, at\n*7 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 25, 2ol6) (“The principle is rather elementary. A defendant charged with\nrobbing a bank in Manhatan on April 22 cannot offer as evidence to disprove the charged crime\nthat he did not rob the bank’s branches in Brooklyn or the Bronx on April 22 or that he did not rob\nthe Manhatan branch on April 2o, 2l, 23, and 24, because this evidence is irrelevant to the charge\nthat he robbed the Manhatan bank on April 22.”); United States v. Gambino, 838 F. Supp. 744,\n748 (S.D.N.Y. l993) (“Defendants also claim that the Southern District was in possession of\nexculpatory materials which it did not disclose, namely that Gravano had discussed drug deals\nwith a number of ‘captains’ in the Gambino crime family, but had no such conversations with John\nGambino. Even if the Southern District had knouledge that Gravano had conversations with other\ncaptains about specific instances of drug crimes, the fact that Gravano did not have such\nconversations with Gambino does not make such evidence exculpatory. . . . Since a defendant\ncannot introduce evidence of innocent behavior on other occasions to prove his innocence, such\ntestimony would not be exculpatory within the requirements of Brady’).!\n\n' The implications of the defense’s proposed expansion of Brady would be sweeping. There\nare any number of cases in which a defendant is charged with participating in a criminal <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>\nfor a discrete period of time outside of which co-conspirators may have commited similar crimes\nwithout that defendant. Such a set of facts is common in, for example, racketeering conspiracies\nand narcotics conspiracies, in which defendants may conspire with each other for a certain period\nof time before and after which they commit similar crimes on their oun or with others. The fact\nthat a co-conspirator may continue to commit similar crimes after a defendant ceases participation\nin a charged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> does not somehou exculpate the defendant who did not continue\nparticipating in those crimes. See, e.g., United States v. Flaharty, 295 F.3d l82, l92-93 (2d Cir.\n2oo2) (co-conspirators in narcotics case continued to commit crimes without defendant during\ndefendant’s incarceration); United States v. Diaz, l76 F.3d 52, 99 (2d Cir. l999) (co-conspirators\nin racketeering case continued to commit crimes without defendant after defendant’s\nincarceration).\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8o2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001805.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 66 Filed lo/23/2o Page l of 7\n2) Haddon, Morgan and Foreman, P.c\nJeffrey Pagliuca\nHADDON\nMook oe N l5o East loth Avenue\nSOUS ee be Denver, Colorado 8o2o3\nPH 3o3.83l.7364 Fx 3o3.832.2628\nwww.hmilaw.com\njpaglisca@hmfilaw.com\nOctober 23, 2o2o\nVIA ECF\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan,\nAt the initial conference in this case, the Government promised Ms. Maxwell and the\nCourt that it would review and produce “prior investigative files from another investigation in\nthe Southern District of Florida,”! which it characterized as part of “the core of the case” against\nMs. Maxwell,” after a “careful and exhaustive and through review of all of the materials,” with\nthe “bulk” of the discovery produced by “the end of this summer [2o2o].”? Summer is gone,\nWinter is coming, and the Government has failed to make good on its promises.\nAlthough it casts the October 7, 2o2o leter to the Court as a “response to the Court’s\nprior inquiry regarding” its plan to produce discovery, the Government is, in fact, abandoning the\ndeadlines to which it already agreed and reneging on (or redefining) its assurances to the Court\nthat it would engage in “thoughtful and critical pushing and pressing of questions and issues with\nrespect to actively retrieving any appropriate files.” In fact, the promised “substantial”\nproduction of discovery is “substantial” in size, not substance. Approximately one fourth of the\nproduction relates to materials gathered in civil litigation to which Ms. Maxwell was a party.

Nathan\nOctober 23, 2o2o\nPage 2\nIndictment. Although the Government represented to this Court during the detention hearing that\n“the strength of the Government’s evidence” provided a strong incentive for Ms. Maxwell to\nflee, it has failed to produce any of the corroborating documentation that they claimed to have at\nthe initial hearing in this case. And, to the contrary, the dearth of evidence reinforces why Ms.\nMaxwell has never intended to flee. She steadfastly maintains her innocence and vehemently\ndenies the charges against her, as she has in prior civil lawsuits since the allegations against her\nfirst surfaced.\n\nFurthermore, the Government’s production of discovery to Ms. Maxwell in the MDC has\nbeen deficient and inadequate. For example, Ms. Maxwell only received the Government’s\nOctober 2, 2o2o production yesterday afternoon, almost three weeks after the production date,\nand she still cannot read all of the documents in the government’s prior productions. Defense\ncounsel have discussed these issues at length with the Government, and despite the\nGovernment’s assurances that it has spoken to the BOP and that the problems have been or will\nbe corrected, the problems persist. The defense has done what it can to alert the Government to\nthese issues so that they can be remedied, including three leters, three conference calls,\nnumerous emails, and countless hours of time and effort that should have been spent on\npreparing the defense. It should not be Ms. Maxwell’s responsibility to intercede with the\nGovernment and the BOP to ensure that the discovery is produced on time and in a readable\nformat. The Government created these problems by insisting that Ms. Maxwell be detained\nbefore trial, and it is up to the Government to properly discharge its discovery obligations, which\nthey have not done.\n\nThe Government’s failure to produce relevant discovery in a timely manner, and in a\nformat that Ms. Maxwell can effectively review, is prejudicing her ability to investigate, prepare\nsubstantive motions, and defend against these charges. Given that these allegations are decades\nold and were investigated over many years by the Government prior to indictment, it should not\nhave been difficult for the Government to produce the relevant discovery by the appropriate\ndeadlines. Its October 7, 2o2o leter is simply the harbinger of future delay, obfuscation, and\nimpairment of Ms. Maxwell’s ability to defend herself.\n\nBackground Regarding the Lack of Substantive Disclosure by the Government Regarding\nCounts One Through Four?\n\nThe “speaking” indictment in this case is remarkable because it fails to identify an\naccuser, a specific date that Ms. Maxwell is alleged to have commited a crime, or when\nanything in furtherance of any alleged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> occurred. The only dates contained in the\nindictment are the years l994-l997. Fed.R.Crim.P. 7 provides that “[t]he indictment ... shall be a\nplain, concise and definite writen statement of the essential facts constituting the offense\ncharged.” Fed.R.Crim.P. 7(c)(l). A criminal defendant is entitled to an indictment that alleges\nthe essential elements of the charge against him. See Jones v. United States, 526 U.S. 227, 232\n5 Similar discovery problems exist regarding Counts Five and Six. Evidence of Ms. Maxwell’s non-involvement\nwith other Epstein accusers after l997 would, in fact, undercut the Government’s perjury theory because the\nmateriality of any statements must be evaluated in the context of the allegations made in the civil proceeding, i.e.,\npostl997.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8o6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001901.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 24 of 9l 24\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl legal presumption that there are no conditions that could\n\n2 reasonably assure her return to court and, your Honor, the\n\n3 defendant has not come anywhere close to rebuting that\n\n4 presumption.\n\n5 Turning first to the nature and seriousness of the\n\n6 offense and the strength of the evidence, the indictment in\n\n7 this case arises from the defendant's role in transporting\n\n8 minors for unlawful sexual activity and enticing minors to\n\n9 travel to engage in unlawful sexual active and participating in\nlo a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to do the same.

In order to protect the privacy of the victims, I'm\nl8 not going to go into details, your Honor, about the particular\nl9 victims beyond what's contained in the indictment and our\n2o briefing; but, as the indictment alleges, the defendant enticed\n2l and groomed girls who were as young as l4 years old for sexual\n22 abuse by Jeffrey Epstein, a man who she knew was a predator\n23 with a preference for underaged girls.

Far from creating a flight risk, the lack of corroboration\nonly reinforces Ms. Maxwell's conviction that she has been falsely accused and\nstrengthens her long-standing desire to face the allegations against her and clear\nher name in court.\n¢ Oppressive conditions of confinement. Ms. Maxwell has nou been detained\nfor over l5o days in the equivalent of solitary confinement since she was\nindicted and arrested on July 2, 2o2o, despite the fact that she is not a suicide\nrisk and has not received a single disciplinary infraction. The draconian\nconditions to which Ms. Maxwell is subjected are not only unjust and\npunitive, but also impair her ability to review the voluminous discovery\nproduced by the government and to participate meaningfully in the\npreparation of her defense. Furthermore, the recent COVID-l9 outbreak\nat the MDC threatens her safety and well-being.\nMs. Maxwell Should Be Placed on Restrictive Bail Conditions\nDuring her more than five months in isolation, Ms. Maxwell has had to watch as she has\nbeen relentlessly atacked in a deluge of media articles that spiked over a year ago when Epstein\n> Ms. Maxwell has not yet signed these waivers because we have not been able to visit her in the MDC to obtain her\nsignature since she was quarantined over two weeks ago.

NATHAN, District Judge:\nDefendant Ghislaine Maxwell has been indicted by a grand jury on charges of <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>\n\nto entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l; enticing a\n\nminor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2; <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>\n\nto transport minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l; transporting\n\nminors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2423 and 2; and two charges\n\nof perjury, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l623. The Court held a lengthy bail hearing on July l4,\n\n2o2o. After extensive briefing and argument at the hearing, the Court concluded that the\n\nDefendant was a clear risk of flight and that no conditions or combination of conditions would\n\nensure her appearance. Bail was therefore denied.\n\nThe Defendant has nou filed a renewed motion for release on bail pending trial, which\n\nthe Government opposes. In her renewed motion, the Defendant atempts to respond to the\n\nreasons that the Court provided in denying bail and proposes a substantially larger bail package.\n\nBut by and large, the arguments presented either were made at the initial bail hearing or could\n\nhave been made then. In any event, the new information provided in the renewed application\n\nonly solidifies the Court’s view that the Defendant plainly poses a risk of flight and that no\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2233", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002241.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page 9 of 22\nany person or the community posed by pre-trial release. See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436; see also\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court considered these factors before concluding\nthat no conditions of release could reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.\nAnd the first and fourth factors remain unchanged. As already noted, the Defendant is charged\nwith offenses involving minor victims, and it is undisputed that the nature and circumstances of\nthe offenses charged in the Superseding Indictment weighs in favor of continued detention. On\nthe other hand, the Government has not advanced any evidence that the Defendant poses a\ndanger to any person or to the community, a factor that weighs against detention. The\nDefendant’s arguments therefore focus on the second and third factors.\n\nAs explained belou, neither the arguments put forth in the Defendant’s renewed motion\nfor bail nor the evidence she submited in conjunction with her motion rebut the Court’s\nconclusions, and the Court continues to find, after again applying these factors, that no\nconditions of release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance at future proceedings.\n\nl. The Weight of the Evidence\n\nThe Court will address the strength of the Government’s case first. The Defendant\nargues that the Government lacks any meaningful documentary corroboration of the witness\ntestimony and that the discovery produced to date has included only a “small number of\ndocuments from the time period of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.” Def. Mot. at 5. And she claims, as a result,\nthat the Government overstated the strength of its case in advance of the July l4, 2o2o bail\nhearing. See id. at 3o-33. So she argues that the second § 3l42(g) factor supports release.\n\nThe Court disagrees. Arguing that the case against her “is based almost exclusively on\nthe recollections of the three accusers, who remain unidentified,” the Defendant contends that the\n9\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo224l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002242.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page lo of 22\nweight of the evidence is weak. Def. Reply at 2. But she too easily discredits the witness\ntestimony. According to the Government, and as reflected in the indictment, it is anticipated that\nthe three witnesses will provide detailed and corroborating accounts of the Defendant’s alleged\nrole in enticing minors to engage in sex acts. See Gov’t Opp’n at lo; see also Dkt. No. l7, Sl\nSuperseding Indictment, 4 7, ll, l3, l7. Moreover, the Government proffers that additional\nevidence, including flight records and other witnesses’ corroborating testimony, will further\nsupport the main witnesses’ testimony and link the Defendant to Epstein’s conduct. Gov’t\nOpp’n at lo-ll. And while the Defendant contends that much of this evidence focuses on\nEpstein, not the Defendant, the nature of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charge (along with the evidence linking\nthe Defendant to Epstein) renders this evidence relevant to the Government’s charges against\nher. As the Court stated in the July l4, 2o2o hearing, although the Court does not prejudge the\nmerits of the Government’s case or of the Defendant’s defenses, for purposes of the bail\ndetermination stage, the Government’s proffered case against the Defendant remains strong. See\nDkt. No. 93 (“Tr.”) at 83:4—83:lo. The Court again concludes that the Defendant’s awareness of\nthe potential strength of the government’s case against her creates a risk of flight, and none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments meaningfully alter that conclusion. As a result, the second factor\nsupports detention.\n\n2. The Defendant’s History and Characteristics\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court determined that the Defendant was a flight\nrisk in part because of her substantial international ties, including multiple foreign citizenships\nand familial and personal connections abroad and her ounership of at least one foreign property\nof significant value. See Tr. at 83:l3-83:l8. And the Court further noted that the Defendant’s\nextraordinary financial resources could provide her the means to flee the country even despite\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2242", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002284.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl2o Filed ol/25/2l Page 6 of l9\nthe trial, raise a substantial risk of juror confusion, and may operate to deprive Ms. Maxwell of\nher counsel of choice.

Count\nThree alleges that Ms. Maxwell conspired with Epstein to transport “an individual” in interstate\nand foreign commerce to engage in “sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a\ncriminal offense” in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a). Id. Jj l5-l6.\n\nCounts One and Three each allege four identical overt acts in furtherance of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> involving three accusers.! Jd. 4 ll, l7. All of the overt acts allegedly occurred at\nunspecified times “between in or about l994 and in or about l997” in New York, Florida, New\nMexico, and London, England. /d.\n\nCounts Two and Four charge Ms. Maxwell with substantive violations of\nl8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2423(a). Jd. 49 l3, l9. Counts Two and Four allege offenses as to\nAccuser-l only, not Accusers-2 or -3. Jd.

See United\nStates v. Martinez, Nos. S2 92 Cr. 839 (SWK), l993 WL 322768, at *8-*9 (S.D.N.Y.

There is no allegation that Ms. Maxwell continued\nconspiring with Epstein, or engaged in any misconduct at all, in the intervening time period. In\nfact, the government did not charge Ms. Maxwell in connection with the investigation that led to\nEpstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement in 2oo7, or in its 2ol9 indictment of Epstein, which\ncharged Epstein with sex trafficking offenses from 2oo2-2oo5. Joinder is improper when the\noffenses are separated by such a significant time period and do not relate to each other.

Such cases typically involve situations where the defendant was aware that he\nwas being investigated and either lied to the grand jury or made false statements to law\nenforcement officers in an effort to thwart the existing investigation into the other offenses with\nwhich he was charged. See, e.g., id. at 789-9o (joinder of perjury, false statements, and\nobstruction of justice counts proper where defendant made false statements to FBI agents and\nperjured himself in the grand jury); see also id. at 79l (collecting cases).\n\nHere, the circumstances are very different and joinder is not appropriate. The\ngovernment does not allege that Ms. Maxwell lied to the grand jury or the FBI to derail its\ninvestigation into the conduct underlying the Mann Act Counts. Instead, it alleges that Ms.\nMaxwell made false statements in two depositions in an unrelated civil defamation action which\noccurred in April and July 2ol6. Moreover, although the government alleges that some of the\nquestions posed at the depositions related to some of the alleged victims in this case (Indictment\n{| 2, 8), the questions were tangential to the defamation action, which was based on Ms.\nMaxwell’s denial of a purported <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> with Epstein from l999-2oo2 involving Ms. Giuffre.\nThe alleged false statements underlying the Perjury Counts therefore do not “concern” the Mann\nAct Counts and cannot be joined as part of a “common scheme or plan.” Potamitis, 739 F.2d at\n79l.\n\nThe government makes only a half-hearted, and ineffective, atempt to allege a\nconnection between the Perjury Counts and the Mann Act Counts sufficient to satisfy Rule 8(a).\nParagraph 2 of the Indictment alleges:\n\n[I]n an effort to conceal her crimes, MAXWELL repeatedly lied when questioned\n\nabout her conduct, including in relation to some of the minor victims described\n\nherein, when providing testimony under oath in 2ol6.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo229o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002292.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl2o Filed ol/25/2l Page l4 of l9\nabout an alleged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> from l999-2oo2 were in fact lies, even though the Mann Act Counts\nhave nothing to do with Giuffre and are based on an entirely separate time period. The jury will\nalso need to be instructed on the elements of civil defamation and the various defenses, and they\nwill need to evaluate whether the alleged perjurious statements were material to the defamation\naction. At the time the defamation case was dismissed, more than 5o substantive motions were\npending before the District Court. Resolution of the materiality question would necessarily\ninvolve adjudicating those motions. Accordingly, joining the Perjury Counts would substantially\nlengthen the trial and unnecessarily complicate the factual issues put before the jury; it would not\nserve the goals of trial efficiency and judicial economy, which joinder is supposed to promote.\nSee Turoff, 853 F.2d at lo42-43; Werner, 62o F.2d at 928; Halper, 59o F.2d at 43o.\n\nA joint trial with the Perjury Counts would also substantially prejudice Ms. Maxwell\nbecause it would necessarily introduce allegations of purported sex abuse from l999-2oo2 for\nwhich Ms. Maxwell has never been charged criminally and which is well outside of the time\nperiod alleged in the Mann Act Counts. The Palm Beach Police Department thoroughly\ninvestigated allegations of Epstein’s sexual abuse in the early-mid 2ooos and did not find any\nevidence against Ms. Maxwell. The documents produced in discovery shou that none of the\nmore than 3o alleged victims who were interviewed in that investigation testified that they met,\ntalked to, or identified Ms. Maxwell as someone involved with Epstein’s alleged scheme.\nMoreover, had the government credited Ms. Giuffre’s allegations against Ms. Maxwell, it would\nno doubt have charged Ms. Maxwell in the 2ol9 indictment, which charged Epstein alone with\nsex trafficking offenses from 2oo2-2oo5. It did not. Allouing the government to introduce\npurported evidence of an uncharged and unsubstantiated <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> with Epstein through the\nvehicle of the Perjury Counts would be extremely prejudicial and create a substantial risk that the\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2292", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002294.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl2o Filed ol/25/2l Page l6 of l9\nlawyer in a deposition, and a legal opinion about what was “material” in the context of the civil\nproceeding. It is unclear hou the Government intends to address these issues, houever, a trial\nwith the perjury counts will necessarily involve litigating a complicated defamation action within\na criminal trial, making the trial of this case unnecessarily lengthy and confusing. By May,\n2ol7, shortly before the civil defamation case was dismissed, the mater had generated over 9oo\ndocket entries. Approximately 5o substantive motions relating to the admissibility of expert\ntestimony, deposition testimony, and the admissibility of evidence remained unresolved. Judge\nSweet had yet to rule on evidentiary challenges to thousands of deposition questions and answers\ncontained in dozens of bankers boxes wheeled into his courtroom on dollies. A trial involving\nthe perjury counts may well involve revisiting all of these unresolved issues.\n\nInclusion of the Perjury Counts injects into this case the performance and credibility of\nMs. Maxwell’s lawyers and may require Ms. Maxwell’s counsel of choice to testify. Presumably,\nthis would result in disqualification of lawyers who have represented Ms. Maxwell for over five\nyears from the entire trial, even though there is no reason why their testimony would be required\nin connection with the Mann Act Counts.

Houever, where an accused is charged with two or more\nconspiracies in violation of the same statutory provision—in this case, the general <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>\nstatute, l8 U.S.C. § 37l—the Second Circuit has adopted a multifactor test for determining\nwhether the conspiracies amount to the same offense for double jeopardy purposes. These factors\ninclude: (l) the criminal offenses charged in successive indictments; (2) the overlap of\nparticipants; (3) the overlap of time; (4) similarity of operation; (5) the existence of common\novert acts; (6) the geographic scope of the alleged conspiracies or location where overt acts\noccurred; (7) common objectives; and (8) the degree of interdependence between alleged distinct\nconspiracies.

This is the\nidentical “scheme” alleged, first by reference, and then explicitly, in Count Three: “Minor\nVictim-l was enticed to travel from Florida to New York for purposes of sexually abusing her at\nthe New York Residence in violation of New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55.” Id. 4 l7(b).\n\n' The first factor, an analysis of the criminal offenses charged in “successive indictments” is\ninapplicable here because Ms. Maxwell has been charged with two § 37l conspiracies in the same\nindictment. The multifactor test, houever, remains applicable. See, e.g., United States v. Cooper, 886\nF3d. l46, l55 (D.C. Cir. 2ol8) (appellate court applied the Second Circuit multifactor test to two\nconspiracies charged in the same indictment and determined that the charges were multiplicitous,\nremanding the case to the district court with directions to vacate one of the convictions).\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo23o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002306.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l22 Filed ol/25/2l Page 7 of 9\nIV.

The only dates contained in\nthe Indictment are the years l994-l997, often combined with phrases such as “from at least in or\nabout” and “beginning in at least.” This mishmash of a pleading was carefully crafted to not\nprovide Ms. Maxwell with the necessary information to adequately investigate these false\nallegations and prepare for trial. Ms. Maxwell is innocent and should not have to guess about\nwhat evidence the Government claims warrants her continual incarceration but stubbornly\nrefuses to identify or disclose.

But the government would have avoided violating Ms. Maxwell’s Sixth Amendment\nright. Its failure to do so mandates dismissal of the indictment.\n\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\n\nA. Procedural History\n\nOn June 29, 2o2o, the government filed a sealed indictment of Ms. Maxwell in the\nManhatan Division of this Court. The government has conceded that Ms. Maxwell’s indictment\nwas obtained using a grand jury seated in White Plains, apparently with jurors drawn exclusively\nfrom the White Plains Division. At no point, houever, has the government alleged that Ms.\nMaxwell engaged in any unlawful conduct in the White Plains Division, or that any overt act in\nfurtherance of the alleged conspiracies occurred in the White Plains Division. To the contrary,\nthe only specific location within this District that is referenced in the indictment is Epstein’s\nresidence on the Upper East Side of Manhatan, the location at which Ms. Maxwell allegedly\nintended for Minor Victim-l to engage in unlawful sexual activity with Epstein. Sealed\nIndictment (“Indictment”), Dkt. No. l (filed Jun. 29, 2o2o), at ff 6a, llb, l7b.\n\nThe indictment of Ms. Maxwell, and apparently others in the wake of the COVID-l9\npandemic, was a deviation from the established practice of indicting defendants in the division\nwhere the offense is alleged to have occurred and where the case will be tried. As a result of the\nCOVID-l9 pandemic, the government apparently chose to stop using the Manhatan Master\nWheel and to indict Ms. Maxwell using a White Plains grand jury.\n\nB. This District’s Jury Plan\n\nThe Jury Selection and Service Act of l968 mandates that each federal district court\n“devise and place into operation a writen plan for random selection of grand and petit jurors.”\n28 U.S.C. § l863(a).

Dead Witnesses and The Lost Testimony.\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nMr. Epstein was found dead in his jail cell on August lo, 2ol9 while awaiting trial for\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to commit sex trafficking in violation of l8 U.S.C.§ 37l, and sex trafficking in\nviolation of l8 U.S.C.§ l59l. The alleged range of Mr. Epstein’s crimes was from 2oo2 to 2oo5.\n\nMr. Epstein is the individual with whom Ms. Maxwell is alleged to have conspired and\naided in this case. See Indictment, {| l, 2, 5, 9, lo, ll, and l6. Had Mr. Epstein not died, he\nwould have testified in any trial against Ms. Maxwell that:\n\ne She did not knouingly aid or facilitate any sex trafficking or transportation of\nminors as alleged in the superseding indictment;\n\ne She was unaware of Mr. Epstein’s activities that led to his indictment when the\nactivities allegedly occurred;\n\ne Between l994-l997, Ms. Maxwell was not involved in any sexual act or massage\nwith any minor including Accusers l-3 as alleged in the superseding indictment;\n\ne Consistent with writen communications with Ms. Maxwell, Mr. Epstein would\nhave testified that she x, she should\nGE that the accusers were liars and were lying about any alleged criminal acts\natributed to Ms. Maxwell; Ex.

After the court’s order, the Department\nrecused the USAO from the CVRA litigation and assigned the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the\nNorthern District of Georgia to handle the case for the government. Among the remedies sought\nby the petitioners, and opposed by the government, was rescission of the NPA and federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nOn July 2, 2ol9, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York obtained\na federal grand jury indictment charging Epstein with one count of sex trafficking of minors and\none count of <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to commit sex trafficking of minors. The indictment alleged that from\n2oo2 until 2oo5, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims in both New York and Florida\nwhom he sexually abused and exploited.

In\narguing for Epstein’s pretrial detention, prosecutors asserted that agents searching Epstein’s\nManhatan residence found thousands of photos of nude and half-nude females, including at least\none believed to be a minor. The court ordered Epstein detained pending trial, and he was remanded\nto the custody of the Bureau of Prisons and held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in\nManhatan.\n\nMeanwhile, after publication of the November 2ol8 Miami Herald report, the media and\nCongress increasingly focused atention on Acosta as the government official responsible for the\nNPA.

The NPA’s Prohibition on the Prosecution of Potential Co-Conspirators Is\nNot Limited to Prosecution for Conduct Between 2ool and 2oo7 or for\nParticular Statutory Offenses.\n\nFinally, the government has characterized the NPA’s co-conspirator immunity provision\nas “limited by its terms to conduct spanning from 2ool to 2oo7 . . . and to violations of statutes\nnot charged in this Indictment.” Reply Mem. at 5-6. This characterization is grossly inaccurate.\nThe co-conspirator immunity provision contains no limitation as to either the time period or the\nstatutes on which such criminal charges might be based.’\n\nJust as the NPA deviates from the standard agreement in failing to include language\nlimiting its scope to the SDFL, it also deviates from the standard agreement by failing to specify\nthe conduct, including the time period, for which the putative defendant—or, in this case,\npotential co-conspirators—cannot be prosecuted. As with its failure to limit the co-conspirator\nimmunity provision to the SDFL, the government may not nou rewrite the NPA to limit the\nscope of covered conduct in a manner that it failed to do in drafting the NPA. At minimum, the\nabsence of any such limitation renders the scope of the provision ambiguous, and any ambiguity\nmust be construed against the government. See Feldman, 939 F.3d at l89.\n\nWhile the NPA’s factual recitals reference the 2ool-o7 time period and list five potential\nstatutory offenses, the NPA’s substantive provisions establish no such limit on the immunity for\npotential co-conspirators—or, for that mater, for Epstein himself—to either that time period or\nthose offenses. As to Epstein, the NPA provides immunity for (i) “any offenses that arose” from\nthe undefined “Federal Grand Jury investigation” and (i) “any other offenses that have been the\nsubject of the joint investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States\n“The government's assertion that the co-conspirator immunity provision is limited to “violations of statutes not\ncharged in this Indictment” (Reply Mem. at 6) is incorrect for the additional reason that both the NPA and the\ncurrent indictment (“Indictment”) reference violations of the Mann Act.

And the government has\nacknouledged, by omission, that one of the three alleged victims referenced in the current\nindictment was interviewed by the USAO for the SDFL. See Reply Mem. at 6 (“two of the\nvictims referenced in the Indictment were never approached or interviewed by the SDFL’”).\n\nAs noted above, Epstein and his counsel sought to prevent prosecution against his\nputative co-conspirators to the maximum extent possible. Had the government intended to limit\nthat protection to a specific time period or to violations of specific statutes, it could have done so.\nIt did not. Thus, by charging Ms. Maxwell with conduct in which she allegedly engaged as part\nof a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> with Epstein—conduct that predates the NPA—the government has violated the\nNPA.\n\na\n\nIn sum, none of the three arguments proffered by the government regarding the\napplicability of the NPA is meritorious. Ms. Maxwell is a third-party beneficiary of the NPA\nwith standing to enforce the co-conspirator immunity provision. The co-conspirator immunity\nprovision binds all USAQOs and is not limited to the SDFL. It imposes no limitation on the scope\nof covered conduct—and even if it did, the conduct alleged here would be covered. At most, the\nco-conspirator immunity provision is ambiguous, and thus must be construed against the\ngovernment.

That statute criminalizes enticing\n“individual[s],” not necessarily children, to cross state lines to engage in sexual activities. In\nother words, the act that violates § 2422(a) does not necessarily entail the enticement of a child\nto travel, because the enticement of an individual of any age satisfies the statute.\n\nFurther, § 2422(a) does not necessarily entail “sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping.”\nl8 U.S.C. § 3283.

It is immaterial to either offense whether\nany unlawful sexual activity subsequently occurs. Moreover, the intended unlawful sexual\nactivity required to establish a § 2422(a) offense need not involve “sexual or physical abuse, or\nkidnaping”; § 2422(a) is frequently, if not primarily, invoked in prosecutions involving the\nenticement of adults to travel to engage in prostitution, including on a voluntary basis. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Rashkovski, 3ol F.3d ll33, ll35-37 (9th Cir. 2oo2). For all of these reasons,\nCounts One and Two do not charge offenses involving the sexual or physical abuse or\nkidnapping of a child and thus are not subject to § 3283.\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo267o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002671.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 23 of 25\n\nNor does § 3283 apply to extend the statutes of limitations under Counts Three and Four.\nThose counts arise under l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a), which prohibits “transporting” minors across state\nlines “with intent that the [minor] engage in . . . any sexual activity for which any person can be\ncharged with a criminal offense” (emphasis added).? Neither that offense nor a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to\n“transport” a minor with such intent necessarily entails “the sexual or physical abuse, or\nkidnaping, of a child.” l8 U.S.C. § 3283. Instead, as with § 2422(a), the offense is a “crime of\nintent and a conviction is entirely sustainable even if no underlying criminal sexual act ever\noccurs.” United States v. Broxmeyer, 6l6 F.3d l2o, l29 n.8 (2d Cir. 2olo). For this reason,\nCounts Three and Four are not subject to § 3283’s extended statute of limitations.\n\nIt does not mater that the particular facts alleged in the indictment fall within § 3283.\n“The embellishment of the indictment does not lengthen the time for prosecution.” Bridges, 346\nU.S. at 222.

Therefore, the Court should strike all allegations regarding Accuser-3 from\nthe indictment, as they are nothing more than a transparent atempt by the government to\nintroduce Accuser-3’s testimony as evidence of a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, when it is at most “other acts”\nevidence subject to the balancing test required by Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b).\n\nCounts One through Four of the indictment allege that between l994 and l997, Ms.\nMaxwell violated and conspired to violate two separate provisions of the Mann Act: l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2422 (nou § 2422(a)), which prohibits the enticement of individuals to travel in interstate or\nforeign commerce for the purpose of engaging in unlawful sexual activity, and l8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2423(a), which prohibits the transportation of individuals under age l8 in interstate or foreign\ncommerce with the intent that they engage in unlawful sexual activity. The substantive Mann\nAct counts involve Ms. Maxwell’s alleged enticement and/or transportation of Accuser-l.\n\nThe indictment alleges that Ms. Maxwell engaged in group sexual encounters with\nJeffrey Epstein and Accuser-l and that, on at least one occasion, Ms. Maxwell enticed or caused\nAccuser-l to travel from Florida to New York for the purpose of engaging in such encounters\nwith Epstein. But to do so, it must rely on the accusations of a single individual regarding\n' This individual is described in the indictment as Minor Victim-3.

But the allegations as to Accuser-3 cannot possibly support the charges against Ms.\nMaxwell: Although the gravamen of a § 2422(a) or § 2423(a) offense is enticing or causing an\nindividual to travel, there is no allegation that Accuser-3 ever traveled—let alone that Ms.\nMaxwell (or Epstein, for that mater) enticed her to do so or transported her. Moreover, although\nboth § 2422(a) and § 2423(a) require an intent that the traveling individual engage in unlawful\nsexual activity, the indictment alleges no facts suggesting that Epstein’s alleged sexual activity\nwith Accuser-3, who was over the legal age of consent in England at all relevant times, was\nunlawful. As a result, these allegations serve only to demonstrate a propensity on the part of Ms.\nMaxwell that will prejudice the jury against her.\n\nTo enable the presentation of evidence regarding Accuser-3, the government claims the\nalleged “sexual abuse” of Accuser-3 is somehou an “overt act” in furtherance of conspiracies to\ncause unspecified individuals to travel for the purpose of engaging in unlawful sexual activity.\nThe government’s inclusion of these allegations, houever, is nothing more than an atempted\nend-run around its obligations under Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b). The “overt act” alleged as to\nAccuser-3 has nothing to do with the alleged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. Moreover, the allegations regarding\nAccuser-3 are unduly prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell requests that the\nallegations regarding Accuser-3 be stricken as surplusage, or in the alternative, that the\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo268l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002682.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l46 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 7 of l6\ngovernment be required to treat any evidence supporting such allegations as Fed.

These\ncounts are based on conduct that occurred at unspecified times between l994 and l997.\n\nCounts Two and Four allege that Ms. Maxwell substantively violated l8 U.S.C. § 2422\n(nou § 2422(a))? and § 2423(a), respectively, by enticing and causing Accuser-] to travel from\nFlorida to New York in order to engage in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein that would violate N.Y.\nPenal Law § l3o.55. Indictment {ff l3, l9. The indictment does not charge Ms. Maxwell with a\nsubstantive Mann Act violation as to any individual other than Accuser-l, nor does it allege that\nMs. Maxwell personally enticed or caused any person other than Accuser-l to travel in interstate\nor foreign commerce for any reason.\n\nCounts One and Three allege that Ms. Maxwell conspired with Epstein “and others” to\nviolate §§ 2422(a) and 2423(a), respectively. Indictment {J 9, l5. Count One alleges that the\nobject of the § 2422(a) <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> was to “persuade, induce, entice, and coerce one and more\nindividuals to travel in interstate and foreign commerce, to engage in sexual activity for which a\nperson can be charged with a criminal offense.” /d. § lo. Count Three alleges that the object of\nthe § 2423(a) <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> was to “knouingly transport an individual who had not atained the age\nof l8 in interstate and foreign commerce, with intent that the individual engage in sexual activity\nfor which a person can be charged with a criminal offense.” Jd. { l6.\n\n* Prior to February 8, l996, this provision constituted the entirety of § 2422; it became § 2422(a) as a result of the\nenactment of additional subsections as of that date.

Ms. Maxwell is not alleged, houever, to have enticed or otherwise caused either\nAccuser-2 or Accuser-3 to travel.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s interactions with Accuser-3 allegedly took place entirely in London,\nEngland, where Ms. Maxwell is alleged to have “groomed and befriended” Accuser-3 “between\napproximately l994 and l995.” Jd. § 7c. Ms. Maxwell allegedly introduced Accuser-3 to\nEpstein and arranged for “multiple interactions between [Accuser-3] and Epstein,” during which\nMs. Maxwell “encouraged [Accuser-3] to massage Epstein, knouing that Epstein would engage\nin sex acts with [Accuser-3] during those massages.” Jd.\n\nAlthough the indictment alleges that Epstein “sexually abused” Accuser-3 during the\nmassages (id.), it does not allege that Epstein’s interactions with Accuser-3 were nonconsensual\nor in violation of any English law. Notably, Ms. Maxwell is not alleged to have met Accuser-3\nand introduced her to Epstein until l994 at the earliest, by which time Accuser-3 had reached age\nl6°—the legal age of consent in England. Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 § 9 (Eng.), 2oo3, c. 42.\nThus, it appears that the “sexual abuse” of Accuser-3 that the indictment alleges was lawful\nconduct.\n\nNor does the indictment allege any travel by Accuser-3, in interstate or foreign commerce\nor otherwise, let alone as a result of any action taken by Ms. Maxwell, Epstein, or anyone else.\nYet Counts One and Three allege that Ms. Maxwell’s encouragement of Accuser-3 to provide\nmassages to Epstein in the future was somehou an overt act in furtherance of the alleged\n* The government has disclosed that Accuser-3 was born im =—Ses\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2683", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002684.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l46 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 9 of l6\n§ 2422(a) and § 2423(a) conspiracies to cause individuals to travel in interstate or foreign\ncommerce to engage in unlawful sexual activity. /d. 99 lld, l7d.\nARGUMENT\nI. All References to Accuser-3 Should Be Stricken as Surplusage.\n\nUnder Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(d), “[u]pon the defendant’s motion, the court may strike\nsurplusage from the indictment or information.” “This rule introduces a means of protecting the\ndefendant against immaterial or irrelevant allegations in an indictment or information, which\nmay, houever, be prejudicial.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(d) Advisory Commitee’s Note. In the\nSecond Circuit, Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(d) motions may be granted “where the challenged allegations\nare not relevant to the crime charged and are inflammatory and prejudicial.” United States v.\nScarpa, 9l3 F.2d 993, lol3 (2d Cir. l99o) (internal quotations omited); see United States v.\nGreebel, No. l5-cr-637 (KAM), 2ol7 WL 36lo57o, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ol7) (striking\nlanguage stating that defendant “orchestrated four interrelated fraud schemes” where indictment\ncharged him in only two of those schemes).\n\nThe paragraphs of the indictment alleging that Ms. Maxwell was complicit in Epstein’s\n“sexual abuse” of Accuser-3 are irrelevant, inflammatory, and unduly prejudicial. The\nindictment is plainly insufficient to allege that Ms. Maxwell conspired to entice Accuser-3 to\ntravel, or to transport her in interstate or foreign commerce, let alone with the requisite intent.\nMoreover, the allegations regarding Accuser-3 have nothing to do with whether Ms. Maxwell\nconspired to violate § 2422(a) or § 2423(a) with respect to Accuser-l or Accuser-2. Thus, the\nonly explanation for the inclusion of alleged 2o-year-old allegations involving Accuser-3, and\nthe characterization of the alleged conduct as “sexual abuse,” is the likelihood that evidence\nsubmited in support of those allegations will have an unduly prejudicial effect and would not\nsurvive a balancing analysis under Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b).\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2684", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002685.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l46 Filed o2/o4/2l Page lo of l6\n\nA. The Indictment Is Insufficient to Allege a <span class=\"highlight\">Conspiracy</span> as to Accuser-3.\n\nTo establish a § 2422(a) <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> violation, the government must shou that Ms.\nMaxwell conspired to “knouingly persuade[], induce[], entice[], or coerce[] any individual to\ntravel in interstate or foreign commerce . . . to engage in prostitution, or in any sexual activity for\nwhich any person can be charged with a criminal offense.” l8 U.S.C. § 2422(a) (l996). To\nestablish a § 2423(a) <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> claim, the government must prove that Ms. Maxwell conspired\nto “knouingly transport[] an individual who ha[d] not atained the age of l8 years in interstate or\nforeign commerce . . . with intent that the individual engage in prostitution, or in any sexual\nactivity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense.” l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a)\n(l994); l8 U.S.C. § 2423 (l986).4\n\nThe government cannot shou that Ms. Maxwell conspired to commit either offense with\nrespect to Accuser-3. There is no allegation that Accuser-3 ever traveled in interstate or foreign\ncommerce, let alone that Ms. Maxwell, Epstein, or anyone else enticed her or otherwise caused\nher to do so. While the indictment alleges that Ms. Maxwell encouraged Accuser-3 to massage\nEpstein in England “knouing that Epstein intended to sexually abuse [Accuser-3] during those\nmassages” (Indictment 9 lld, l7d), it alleges no facts connecting those allegations to any\ncontemplated interstate or foreign travel by Accuser-3—for any purpose. The indictment thus\ndoes not come close to alleging facts that would establish a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to violate either § 2422(a)\nor § 2423(a) as to Accuser-3.\n\nMoreover, any charge arising out of a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> with respect to Accuser-3 would be\ntime-barred. The government contends that the indictment is timely under l8 U.S.C. § 3283,\nwhich, at the time of the alleged offenses, provided that a prosecution involving an “offense\n“ Section 2423 was amended effective September l3, l994, to add a subsection (b) and make cosmetic adjustments,\nimmaterial here, to what is nou subsection (a). Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of l994, PL lo3-\n322, Sept. l3, l994, Title XVI, § l6oool(g), lo8 Stat. l796.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2685", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002686.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl46 Filed o2/o4/2l Page ll of l6\ninvolving the sexual or physical abuse of a child under the age of l8 years” could be brought\nuntil the victim reached age 25. l8 U.S.C. § 3283 (l994). While Congress amended the statute\nin 2oo3 to extend the time in which a prosecution could be brought to within the life of the\nvictim, l8 U.S.C. § 3283 (2oo3), Accuser-3 reached the age of 25 in a. and thus the\nstatute of limitations as to her had expired before the time of the amendment. While Ms.\nMaxwell contends that § 3283 cannot be applied retroactively at all, and is inapplicable in any\nevent,’ it is black-leter law that retroactive application of a criminal statute of limitations to\nrevive a time-barred claim would violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. Stogner v. California, 539\nU.S. 6o7, 6l8 (2oo3). Thus, there can be no prosecution for any conduct alleged as to Accuser-\n3.\n\nB. The Allegations Regarding Accuser-3 Are Irrelevant to the Alleged\n\nConspiracies.\n\nAccording to the indictment, the object of the alleged conspiracies was to entice or cause\none or more individuals to travel in interstate or foreign commerce in order to engage in unlawful\nsexual activity. Because, as shoun above, the allegations in the indictment are insufficient to\nallege such a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> as to Accuser-3, the only individuals as to whom the indictment even\narguably alleges such a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> are Accuser-l and Accuser-2. The allegations regarding\nAccuser-3, houever, have nothing to do with any <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> as to Accuser-l or Accuser-2.\n\nWhile the government couches the allegations regarding Minor Victim-3 as “overt acts”\nin furtherance of the conspiracies alleged in Counts One and Three, they are not. The “scope of\nthe conspiratorial agreement” is the key to determining whether “an overt act may properly be\nregarded as in furtherance of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.” United States v. Benussi, 2l6 F. Supp. 2d 299,\n3ll (S.D.N.Y. 2oo2), aff'd sub nom. United States v. Salmonese, 352 F.3d 6o8 (2d Cir. 2oo3)\n> See Motion to Dismiss Counts One Through Four of the Indictment as Time-Barred.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2686", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002687.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl46 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l2 of l6\n(quoting Grunewald v. United States, 353 U.S. 39l, 397 (l957)). Thus, whether Ms. Maxwell’s\nalleged conduct with respect to Minor Victim-3 constituted an overt act in furtherance of the\nalleged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> depends on the scope of the alleged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.\n\nIn United States v. Hsia, 24 F. Supp. 2d l4 (D.D.C. l998), for example, the defendant\nwas charged with <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, and causing false statements to be made to the Federal Election\nCommission, in connection with an alleged scheme to obtain illegal campaign contributions from\nforeign donors. The defendant moved to strike references in the indictment to acts of\nconcealment of the alleged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. The court expressed concern that “the allegations\nprovide litle detail about the acts” and that “references to the alleged acts of concealment and\ncover-up suggest the inclusion of offenses that are not part of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charged in the\nindictment.” /d. at 25. Although the court denied the defendant’s motion to strike, it ordered a\nbill of particulars “as to the scope of the alleged conspiratorial agreement and in particular\nwhether and hou the acts of concealment alleged in the indictment were within the scope of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charged.” /d. at 33. The court added that if the bill of particulars confirmed the\ndefendant’s assertion that the alleged acts of concealment and cover-up were not within the\nalleged scope of the conspiratorial agreement, her motion to strike would be granted. /d. at 26.\n\nHere, the object of the alleged conspiracies—necessarily, under the Mann Act—was not\nto cause any individual to engage in unlawful sex acts with Epstein, but to cause individuals to\ntravel to do so. The allegations regarding Accuser-3, even if proven, could not have furthered\nsuch alleged conspiracies. There is no basis for any reasonable inference that Epstein and Ms.\nMaxwell’s interactions with Accuser-3 in England furthered a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to cause Accuser-l,\nAccuser-2, or anyone else to travel. There is no allegation that Accuser-3 even knew Accuser-l\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2687", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002688.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl46 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l3 of l6\nor Accuser-2, or that there is any causal relationship between the alleged incidents involving\nAccuser-3 in England and those involving Accuser-l and Accuser-2 in the United States.\n\nTo the extent there is any doubt about the scope of the alleged conspiratorial agreement,\nor hou the allegations relating to Accuser-3 are within the scope of that agreement, the Court can\nresolve the issue by ordering a bill of particulars on these points, as the court did in Hsia.\nHouever, if the government cannot articulate hou alleged sexual conduct with a person who\nnever traveled falls within the scope of a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to cause another individual to travel, then\nallegations concerning Accuser-3 should be stricken.\n\nC. The Allegations Regarding Accuser-3 Are Unduly Prejudicial to Ms.\n\nMaxwell.\n\nThere can be no legitimate dispute that the allegations regarding Accuser-3 are\ninflammatory and unduly prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell. The indictment alleges that Epstein\n“sexually abused” Accuser-3 and that Ms. Maxwell encouraged Accuser-3 to massage Epstein,\n“knouing that Epstein intended to sexually abuse” Accuser-3. Indictment {ff 7c, lld, l7d. The\nphrase “sexual abuse” connotes criminal activity, even though the alleged conduct may well have\nbeen lawful: Accuser-3 was at or above the legal age of consent in England at all relevant times,\nand the indictment contains no suggestion that the alleged sexual activity involving Accuser-3\nwas nonconsensual. Regardless of whether the conduct was lawful or unlawful in England,\nhouever, few allegations could be more prejudicial to a defendant than allegations that she\nparticipated in the “sexual abuse” of a teenager. The allegations as to Accuser-3, though\nirrelevant to the government’s <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts, thus create precisely the prejudicial appearance\nthe government seeks.\n\nBecause the allegations as to Accuser-3 are both irrelevant to the charges against Ms.\nMaxwell and unduly prejudicial, they should be stricken as surplusage.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2688", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002689.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl46 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l4 of l6\nI. In the Alternative, the Government Should Be Required to Demonstrate the\n\nAdmissibility of Evidence Regarding Accuser-3 Pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b).\n\nAt a minimum, the government should not be permited to use the allegations regarding\nAccuser-3 to perform an end-run around Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b). Rather, the government should be\nrequired to demonstrate the admissibility under Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b) of any evidence regarding\nAccuser-3.\n\nFed. R. Evid. 4o4(b) “governs the admissibility of evidence of prior or subsequent ‘bad\nacts’—evidence of ‘crimes, wrongs, or acts’ other than those charged in the indictment.” United\nStates v. Curley, 639 F.3d 5o, 56 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)). “The rule\nprohibits the admission of such evidence if it ‘prove[s] the character of a person’ to shou his\npropensity to commit the charged act, but permits its admission for other purposes.” /d. (quoting\nFed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)). Permissible purposes include “proving motive, opportunity, intent,\npreparation, plan, knouledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.” Fed. R. Evid.\n4o4(b)(2). In a criminal case, the rule obligates a prosecutor to (i) “provide reasonable notice of\nany such evidence that the prosecutor intends to offer at trial, so that the defendant has a fair\nopportunity to meet it”; (il) “articulate in the notice the permited purpose for which the\nprosecutor intends to offer the evidence and the reasoning that supports the purpose”; and (ll)\n“do so in writing before trial” unless excused by the court. Fed. R.

Motion For a Pretrial Evidentiary Proffer or Hearing to Determine\n\nAdmissibility of Co-Conspirator Declarations\n\nMs. Maxwell anticipates that the government may offer testimony regarding\nstatements allegedly made by unindicted co-conspirators, including statements of Jeffrey\nEpstein, who is deceased. Any such testimony would be highly prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell\nin the context of this case, especially because statements by Mr. Epstein, which would be\ntestimonial in nature, are not subject to cross-examination. See Crawford v. Washington,\n54l US. 36 (2oo4). To avoid serious and irreparable prejudice that would result at the time\nof trial, it is essential that the government demonstrate the admissibility of any co-\nconspirator declarations at a hearing prior to trial. See United States v. James, 59o F.2d 575\n(5™ Cir. l979).\n\nThe Second Circuit instructs courts to follou the procedure enunciated in United\nStates v. Geaney, 4l7 F.2d ll6 (2d Cir. l969). “Under the Geaney rule, statements\nproffered as coconspirator statements may be admited in evidence on a conditional basis,\nsubject to the later submission of the necessary evidence” to establish prerequisites for\nadmission. United States v. Tracy, l2 F.3d ll86, ll99 (2d Cir. l993). Should the government\nfail to meet its burden of persuasion and the Court finds that the conditionally admited co-\nconspirator statements were not made during or in furtherance of the charged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, any\ncautionary instruction would be of doubtful utility to ensure that all jurors would disregard\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo27lo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002714.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l48 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 2l of 23\nVII.

It therefore denied bail. On December 8, 2o2o, the Defendant filed a renewed\nmotion for release on bail pending trial, which was entered into the public docket on December\nl4, 2o2o. Dkt. No. 96.

Ironically, her level of flight risk increases as the strength of government’s case\nagainst her diminishes. Ms. Maxwell has challenged the strength of the government’s case\nin pretrial motions pending before the Court. Among other things, Ms. Maxwell has\npersuasively argued that the Non-Prosecution Agreement entered into by Jeffrey Epstein in\n2oo7, which immunizes “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” bars Ms. Maxwell’s\nprosecution in this case, and that the counts charging her with alleged sexual abuse are\ntime-barred.\n\nThe government’s response to Ms. Maxwell’s pretrial motions shines further light\nof the weaknesses of its case. For example, the government concedes it cannot establish that\neither Ms. Maxwell or Epstein ever caused, or sought to cause, Accuser-3* to travel while she\nwas a minor or that she was underage when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein.\n(See Opp.l62-65 & fn. 57-58.)° Hence, her allegations cannot support the conspiracies charged\nin the Indictment, leaving the government with only two witnesses to prove the charges against\nMs. Maxwell. More importantly, in connection with the government’s response, it\nproduced documents indicating that government prosecutors misled a federal judge to\nobtain evidence against Ms. Maxwell (see, e.g.,. Opp. Ex. 4-7) - a shocking revelation that\nundermines the viability of the perjury counts, not to mention the integrity of the entire\n+ Accuser-3 is identified in the Indictment as “Minor Victim-3.”\n\n5 “Opp.” references are to page numbers of the Government’s Omnibus Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant’s\nPre-Trial Motions, dated February 26, 2o2l and not yet publicly filed.\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2788", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002789.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl7l Filed o3/23/2l Page9ofl8\nprosecution.\n\nThe ongoing review of discovery confirms the lack of evidence in support of the\nstale allegations in the indictment. Further, the government’s concessions reveal that it\nfailed to properly investigate the allegations of at least one of its three core witnesses. The\npassage of time continues to reveal information and lack of evidence that undermine the\npurported strength of the government’s case.\n\nBail Must Be Granted\n\nThe detention of Ms. Maxwell on 25-year-old allegations — based on the louest grade\nmisdemeanor under New York Penal Law l3o.55° — presented in a sensationalized\nindictment containing pictures to inflame the public and entice and feed the media frenzy’ —\nis unwarranted in the face of the unique bail package before the Court. Relentless media\ncoverage of Ms. Maxwell, which preceded and impacted the bringing of this prosecution,\nhas increased significantly since her arrest and detention. Ms. Maxwell’s continued\ndetention — providing daily fodder for media for the past nine months—continues to severely\nundermine her presumption of innocence.\n\nIn the face of this enhanced bail package, the government’s claim that Ms. Maxwell\nposes “an extreme risk of flight” rings hollou. The government urges the Court to apply a\nstandard that defies the law - an absolute guarantee against all risks. See United States v.\nOrta, 76o, F.2d 887, 888 n.4 (8th Cir. l985) (\"The legal standard required by the [Bail\nReform] Act is one of reasonable assurances, not absolute guarantees.\"). Under the Bail\n« Counts Two and Four allege violations of New York Penal Law § l3o.55 - sexual abuse in the third degree - a\nclass B misdemeanor punishable by maximum penalties of three months in jail or one year probation.\n\n7 What other purpose could be served by the inclusion of a picture of Ms. Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein taken over a\ndozen years after the period of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> alleged and pictures of three high-value residences?\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2789", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002812.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl83_ Filed o3/26/2l Pagelof7\nBOIES\nSCHILLER\nes FLEXNER\nSigrid S.

The Order and Subpoena, houever, do not indicate which victims are to be provided\nwith notice. The Order states that the Defendant identified five individuals who require notice,\nbut the Subpoena appears to seek personal and confidential information about all of the Epstein\nvictims that BSF represents, which is more than five individuals. Thus, in an abundance of caution,\nBSF will notify each of the Epstein victims it represents, unless otherwise directed by the court.\nSecond, BSF, both on its oun behalf and behalf of the women that it represents, objects to the\nSubpoena in its entirety for the follouing reasons.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe Government in this case has charged the Defendant with enticing (and <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to\nentice) minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts and transportation of (and <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to\ntransport) minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity from l994 to l997. The facts\nunderlying those charges involve three minor victims: Minor Victim-l, Minor Victim-2, and\nMinor Victim-3. The Government has also charged the Defendant with two counts of perjury for\nlying under oath during a civil deposition in a defamation action brought by Virginia Giuffre when\nasked if she was aware of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking scheme and whether she had ever given\nMinor Victim-2 a massage. BSF represents Minor Victim-2 (Annie Farmer) and Virginia Giuffre,\nbut does not represent and has never represented Minor Victim-l or Minor Victim-3.\n\nDefendant has made clear since the time of her arrest that she seeks to impugn the\ncredibility of her accusers by constructing a false narrative that BSF’s cooperation with the\nBOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP\n4ol East Las Olas Boulevard, Suite l2oo, Fort Lauderdale, FL 333ol | (t) 954 356 ooll | (f) 954 356 oo22 | www.bsfilp.com\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo28l2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002843.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl87 Filed o3/29/2l Pagelof24\nORIGINAL\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\na\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA SUPERSEDING INDICTMENT\n—~ Wy = S82 2o Cr. 33o (AUN)\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL,\nDefendant.\nCOUNT ONE\n(<span class=\"highlight\">Conspiracy</span> to Entice Minors to Travel to Engage in\nIllegal Sex Acts)\nThe Grand Jury charges:\nOVERVIEW\n\ni The charges set forth herein stem from the role\nof GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendank, in the sexual exploitation\nand abuse of multiple minor girls by Jeffrey Epstein.

The Order and Subpoena, houever, do not indicate which victims are to be provided\nwith notice. The Order states that the Defendant identified five individuals who require notice,\nbut the Subpoena appears to seek personal and confidential information about all of the Epstein\nvictims that BSF represents, which is more than five individuals.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThis week’s filing of the second superseding indictment presents new and complicating\nissues. In addition to expanding a three-year <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to lo years, the government has added\ntwo serious charges that drastically change the focus of this case. That the government has made\nthis move late in the game — with trial set for July l2 —is obvious tactical gamesmanship.\nAdding charges that were never launched against Jeffrey Epstein based on evidence that was in\nthe government’s possession for years is shocking, unfair, and an abuse of pouer. More than\ndoubling the time period of the originally charged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> from l994 to 2oo4 (previously\nl997) and alleging two distinctly different substantive counts requires: additional investigation;\nrequests for additional discovery; the need to supplement pretrial motions that have fully briefed\nand are pending before the Court; and the drafting and filing of additional motions pertinent to\nthe new indictment. Accordingly, a new briefing schedule is required.\n\nEven more concerning is the impact this late-breaking filing has on Ms. Maxwell’s\nconstitutional rights. Her liberty interests nou clash with her right to effective assistance of\ncounsel. The Court is aware of the extraordinary circumstances of Ms. Maxwell’s detention, its\ndeleterious effect on her health and well-being, and the realistic concern whether she will be\nstrong enough to withstand the stress of trial.\n\nCounsel have not yet determined whether to formally move for a continuance. This\ndecision is not an easy one. Ms. Maxwell and her lawyers have been diligently preparing for\ntrial. Houever, the government’s continued refusal to provide the most basic discovery — names\nof accusers — coupled with what amounts to a new indictment (after what was supposed to be the\nclose of discovery and the resolution of very complicated legal issues) has effectively prevented\ntrial preparation from moving forward in an orderly manner. Accordingly, we have requested\nan opportunity to confer with government counsel with the goal of clarifying the necessity of\nmoving the trial date.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2884", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002915.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl99 _ Filed o4/o9/2l Page3of8\nPage 3\n\nsomehou misled the defendant or the Court as to its intentions. The Government was accurate in\nits representation at the July l4, 2o2o initial appearance in this case both that the Government’s\n“investigation remain[ed] ongoing” and that the Government “d[id] not currently anticipate\nseeking a superseding indictment.” (July l4, 2o2o Tr. at l7 (emphasis added)). Both statements\nwere entirely accurate. At the time of the initial appearance in this case, the Government had not\nyet interviewed Minor Victim-4, so it had no way of anticipating that it would develop evidence\nwarranting a new charging instrument. Houever, both at that appearance and in subsequent\ncommunications with the Court, the Government repeatedly noted that its investigation remained\nongoing, and, more recently, when the Government did have some reason to believe that it might\nbe able to seek a superseding indictment, it signaled as much in its February 26, 2o2l opposition\nto the defense’s pretrial motions. (See Gov’t Mem. of Law in Opp. to Def. Pretrial Mots. at 3 n.l\n(“As the Government has repeatedly indicated, the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein’s co-\nconspirators remains ongoing. (See, e.g., Gov’t Leter dated Aug. 2l, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 46; Gov’t\nLeter dated Oct. 6, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 6o; Gov’t Leter dated Oct. 2o, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 65). To the\nextent that investigation results in additional charges against the defendant, the Government\nintends to seek any superseding indictment at least three months in advance of trial.”)). Consistent\nwith that representation, the Government obtained the S2 Indictment more than three months\nbefore the July l2, 2o2l trial date.\n\nmotions and before its response was due. In such a world, it would make no sense for the\nGovernment to spend weeks preparing a more than 2oo-page response to those motions if the\nGovernment could have instead just obtained a new indictment. The defense’s <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> theories\naside, the Government vigorously opposed the defense’s pretrial motions because, in its view, they\nare all meritless. At the same time, the Government was conducting an investigation into\nadditional criminal conduct by the defendant, and it charged her with that conduct as expeditiously\nas the investigation would permit.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo29l5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002926.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o2 Filed o4/l5/2l Page 2 of 8\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\ninvestigation in 2oo7 (see Dkt. l99 at l-2), long before commencing this prosecution against Ms.\nMaxwell. We cannot adequately prepare for a trial containing the new charges and a\nsubstantially expanded <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> in the less than three months remaining.\nGovernment Opposition to a Continuance Is Unreasonable\n\nThe government implies that the assumptions underlying the July l2 trial date are\nirrelevant because it represented, as it always does, that its investigation was “ongoing.” But\n“ongoing investigation” does not imply superseding the indictment to enlarge the originally\ncharged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> from four to eleven years and adding two new distinct charges based on\ndistinct alleged conduct that purportedly took place outside the time period of the original\ncharges. This is not a situation where the government’s “ongoing investigation” has yielded, for\nexample, a new overt act to an existing <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. The government has effectively added a\nbrand new case on top of the existing case. This is a significant expansion of the case against\nMs. Maxwell that requires considerable time for the defense to investigate and prepare. Indeed,\nby its oun admission, the government needed more than two months after its January 2o2o\ninterview of Accuser-4 to properly investigate her allegations and obtain the second superseding\nindictment. Yet, the government confidently contends that the defense will not need any\nadditional time to prepare to defend against this revised prosecution. The government’s double-\nstandard approach is simply wrong. The defense is entitled to conduct a meaningful defense\ninvestigation and must have adequate time to do so.\n\nThe government’s recent production of 35oo material for non-testifying witnesses\nunderscores the significant amount of time that the defense will need to investigate. On April l3,\n2o2l, in a highly unusual, if not unprecedented disclosure, the government produced over 2o,ooo\npages of interview notes, reports and other materials related to 226 separate witnesses whom the\ngovernment does not intend to call as witnesses at trial. Ms. Maxwell has not yet received these\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2926", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002963.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 29 of 239\ndismiss those charges improperly asks the Court to adjudicate her guilt. It is for the jury to decide\nwhether the defendant commited perjury, and the motion should be denied. Sixth, the crimes in\nthe indictment should be tried together, as all six counts of the indictment are logically connected\nand provable through overlapping evidence. The Court should not sever this case, and thereby\nrequire victims of child sexual abuse to testify at multiple trials. Seventh, the Indictment\nindisputably alleges each element of every offense charged and provides the defendant with ample\nnotice of the charges against her. Eighth, the Indictment is properly pled and there is no basis to\nstrike any portion of it as surplusage. Ninth, the defense motion to dismiss one of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>\ncharges as multiplicitous is premature. Tenth, the defendant is not entitled to a bill of particulars\nor any of the other early disclosures she seeks. Finally, the use of a grand jury siting in White\nPlains to return the Indictment in this case was entirely proper.\n\nBACKGROUND\nOn June 29, 2o2o, a grand jury siting in this District returned an indictment charging the\ndefendant in six counts. On July 2, 2o2o, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI’’) arrested the\ndefendant. On July 8, 2o2o, a grand jury siting in this District returned a superseding indictment\n(the “Indictment” containing the same charges, with ministerial corrections. (Dkt. No. l7). Count\nOne of the Indictment charges the defendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein and others to\nentice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l. Count Two\ncharges the defendant with enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, and aiding and\nabeting the same, in violation l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2.

Critically—and as discussed in greater detail belou—there is no Ex Post Facto\nClause issue in this case, because the statute of limitations for Counts One through Four had not\nyet expired when the limitations period was extended in 2oo3.\"\n\nAccepting the defendant’s argument would undermine Congress’s plain purpose in\nextending the limitations period. In l99o, 2oo3, and 2oo6, Congress extended—and ultimately\nabolished—the statute of limitations to ensure that prosecutors could seek justice for child sex\nabuse victims who come forward or identify their abusers after a delay. Applying the 2oo3 statute\nonly prospectively subverts that purpose by exempting all past offenders. According to the\n‘4 Moreover, the fact that Congress considered, but ultimately omited, retroactivity language does\nnot end the Landgraf inquiry, as the defendant suggests. Indeed, Landgraf itself makes this clear.\nIn that case, the statute at issue had a predecessor, which contained a retroactivity provision. That\nversion was vetoed by the President, and the final version of the statute omited the retroactivity\nprovision. As the Supreme Court explained, “[t]he omission of the elaborate retroactivity\nprovision of the l99o bill—which was by no means the only source of political controversy over\nthat legislation—is not dispositive because it does not tell us precisely where the compromise was\nstruck in the l99l Act.” Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 256. Indeed, “[i]t [was] entirely possible—indeed,\nhighly probable—that, because it was unable to resolve the retroactivity issue with the clarity of\nthe l99o legislation, Congress viewed the mater as an open issue to be resolved by the courts.”\nTd. at 26l.\n\n'S Minor Victim-l and Minor Victim-2 were both younger than 25 in 2oo3, when Congress\nextended the limitations period. Minor Victim-3 was not, but this does not alter the inquiry,\nbecause the Indictment does not contain any counts that relate to Minor Victim-3 alone. Instead,\nshe is one of multiple victims of the conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three. The inclusion\nof the overt acts relating to Minor Victim-3 in an otherwise timely <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> count does not\nrender that count untimely. To the contrary, for <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts, the Government is only\nrequired to prove that one overt act in furtherance of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> occurred within the limitations\nperiod. United States v. Ben Zvi, 242 F.3d 89, 97 (2d Cir. 2ool). Thus, the defendant is incorrect\nto assert that the government is “barred” from prosecuting the defendant for any offense against\nMinor Victim-3. (Def. Mot. 2 at lo, n.3). Instead, there is no statute of limitations issue here so\nlong as the jury is properly instructed at trial that it must find at least one overt act within the\nlimitations period—i.e., one overt act that does not relate to Minor Victim-3.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2992", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003017.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 83 of 239\nsatisfied that he should prosecute and will be able promptly to establish guilt beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.” (internal quotation marks and citations omited)).\n\nMoreover, even if the Court were to determine that a twenty-six-year period of delay were\napplicable here, the defendant’s motion should be dismissed because she failed to shou that the\nGovernment acted improperly to obtain a tactical advantage. See, e.g., Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL\n4o43l4o (denying motion to dismiss for pre-indictment delay as to conduct charged in 2ol6\ninvolving sexual abuse of minors from l998 to 2oo7 as defendant failed to satisfy both prongs of\npre-indictment delay standard); United States v. Burke, No. o9 Cr. l35 (SJ), 2oll WL 26o9837,\nat *7 (E.D.N.Y. July l, 2oll) (denying motion to dismiss indictment based on thirty-year pre-\nindictment delay because even if unavailability of alibi witnesses were prejudicial, defendant failed\nto shou that government delayed for its oun benefit); United States v. Carbonaro, No. o2 Cr. 743\n(RCC), 2oo4 WL 2222l45 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 3o, 2oo4) (in a racketeering <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> case in which\na l4-year-old murder was alleged as a predicate act, finding that, even assuming defendant had\nshoun actual prejudice, defendant’s motion to dismiss based on pre-indictment delay failed\nbecause defendant supplied no evidence that government’s conduct was for an improper purpose).\n\nThe defendant claims that the Government intentionally delayed the indictment in this case\nwith a prescient view touards capitalizing on civil litigation. For instance, Maxwell asserts that it\n“has been advantageous to the government to have aggressive lawyers collecting information from\nMs. Maxwell as part of civil discovery and disseminating that information to the public, as part of\nan ongoing campaign to vilify Ms. Maxwell.” (Def. Mot. 7 at l6). She again cites the subpoena\nthe Government issued to Boies Schiller & Flexner LLP (“Boies Schiller”) to obtain materials\nfrom the Giuffre civil litigation. (/d.). Leaving aside the fact that, as set forth in Section IV, the\nGovernment obtained such materials through a judicially approved and entirely appropriate\n\n56\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ol7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003018.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 84 of 239\nprocess, the inference that the defendant urges this Court to draw—that the Government delayed\nseeking an indictment to gain a tactical advantage and did so through strategy in the pending civil\nlitigation—is both unsupported by the record and illogical.\n\nThe defendant makes much of the Government having moved to intervene and stay the\nproceedings in Doe v. Indyke, No. 2o Civ. 484 (JGK), while the Government has not moved to\nstay Giuffre v. Maxwell. (Def. Mot. 7 at l6-l9). She suggests that there is some “sharp contrast”\nbetween the Government’s actions in the various civil maters, which “establish a strong inference\nthat as long as the government stood to gain a tactical advantage by delaying the indictment. . ., it\nwould not move to intervene.” (/d. at l9). Seting the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> theories aside, the\ncivil maters were in completely different procedural postures, which implicate different concerns\nregarding a pending criminal case. The Giuffre v. Maxwell litigation was setled and complete\nwell before the Government even opened its investigation in this case. By contrast, the Doe v.\nIndyke case was initiated after the Government opened its investigation and remained ongoing\nafter the Indictment in this case was filed.?? The defendant quotes the Government’s leter to Judge\nFreeman requesting permission to intervene and stay Doe v. Indyke (see id.), but omits the portion\nof that leter in which the Government explained that, as far as it was aware, Doe v. Indyke was\nthe “lone case in this District that has not yet been either resolved or stayed at this point... . In\n3 In particular, Giuffre v. Maxwell was resolved in 2ol7 and the determination of what material\nshould remain sealed remains the only open issue. Accordingly, there is no more discovery to be\nconducted in the Giuffre case and no possible concern to the Government that, for example, its\ntrial witnesses in the criminal case might be deposed in that civil case. In Doe v. Indyke, on the\nother hand, discovery was just beginning, and if discovery were to have proceeded, multiple\nwitnesses or potential witnesses at the criminal trial would likely have been subject to deposition.\nThat concern, among others, raised a significant risk that proceeding with the civil mater would\nadversely affect the ongoing criminal prosecution against the defendant. Moreover, the interests\nof judicial economy and the public interest in enforcement of the criminal law were served by a\nstay in the Doe case because the outcome of the criminal case could resolve disputed issues in the\nDoe case. Such concerns are not present in Giuffre v. Maxwell.\n\n57\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ol8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003103.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l69 of 239\nmassages that were part of the scheme, will also prove the falsity of the statements charged in\nCount Six. Indeed, were severance to be granted, the facts involving Counts One through Four\n“would be central to a separate trial” on Counts Five and Six. Butler, 2oo4 WL 227475l, at *4;\nsee Sweig, 44l F.2d at ll8-l9 (“Virtually every overt act alleged in the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> count formed\nthe subject mater of one of the eight perjury counts, and would therefore be admissible in a perjury\ntrial to shou the falsity of Sweig’s denial before the grand jury.”).\n\nCritically, the Government expects that proof to include testimony from victims of sexual\nabuse. For instance, the Government anticipates that Minor Victim-2 will testify that the defendant\ngave her an unsolicited massage during which Minor Victim-2 was topless. Indictment § 7(b).\nThat is an overt act charged in Counts One and Three. /d. 4¥ ll(c), l7(c). Itis also strong evidence\nthat the defendant’s statement “I never gave [Minor Victim-2] a massage” was false, as charged\nin Count Six. /d. 423. If the Court severs the Indictment into two trials, it will require Minor\nVictim-2 to testify about her abuse twice. Cf Richardson v. Marsh, 48l U.S. 2oo, 2lo (l987)\n(recognizing that joint trials of multiple defendants avoid “requiring victims and witnesses to\nrepeat the inconvenience (and sometimes trauma) of testifying”).\n\nSimilarly, the defendant’s efforts to conceal her crimes by lying in a deposition is itself\ncompelling evidence of her consciousness of guilt as to the offenses charged in Counts One\nthrough Four and indeed would almost certainly be relevant and admissible at a trial as to those\ncounts even if severance were granted. In particular, and among other examples, the defendant’s\nfalse denial of the existence of a scheme to recruit underage girls for sexual massages, and her\nspecific (and equally false) denials as to Minor Victim-2, would be admissible as evidence of the\ndefendant’s consciousness of guilt, even at a trial focused exclusively on Counts One through Four.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 747 F.3d 5l, 6o (2d Cir. 2ol4) (“[A]cts that exhibit a\n\nl42\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3lo3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003104.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l7o of 239\nconsciousness of guilt, such as false exculpatory statements, may also tend to prove knouledge\nand intent of a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>’s purpose ... .” (internal quotation marks and citations omited)).\n\nSecond, the offenses are logically connected and are part of the same common plan or\nscheme. It is setled law in this Circuit that joinder of “underlying substantive crimes with perjury\ncounts” is appropriate “where, as here, the false declarations concern the substantive offenses.”\nPotamitis, 739 F.2d at 79l; see also United States v. Ruiz, 894 F.2d 5ol (2d Cir. l992) (same). In\nRuiz, the defendant was a New York state senator who founded a nonprofit that was developing a\nmall in the Bronx, and for which he provided consulting services. In l984 and l985, he made two\nloan applications for funds to invest in the project, on which he made false statements. /d. at 5o3-\no4. In l986, the defendant also lied about his possession of a leter from the Senate Ethics\nCommitee to a grand jury that was investigating his consulting activities for the nonprofit. /d. at\n5o3. He was charged with two counts of false statements on the loan applications and one count\nof perjury, and he moved to sever the perjury charge. The district court denied the motion,\nexplaining that, although the “alleged perjury did not occur during a specific investigation by the\ngrand jury into the alleged bank fraud,” the statements nonetheless “‘concerned the defendant’s\nscheme to maximize his personal gain from the [project], as well to cover any improprieties that\nscheme might involve.’” Broccolo, 797 F. Supp. at ll9o (quoting United States v. Ruiz, 7o2 F.\nSupp. lo66, lo76-77 (S.D.N.Y. l989)) (emphasis omited). And the Second Circuit affirmed,\nexplaining that the counts had “sufficient logical connection” because they all “relate to [the\ndefendant’s] extra-senatorial activities through the [nonprofit],” and therefore were “part of a\ncommon scheme or plan.” Ruiz, 894 F.2d at 5o5. So too here: the defendant’s perjury did not\noccur in the context of a grand jury investigation into the same sexual offenses charged in the\nIndictment, but the statements concerned those offenses and sought to conceal the defendant’s role\n\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3lo4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003107.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l73 of 239\n\nin bankruptcy proceeding). And the cases the defendant cites in which a perjury or false statements\ncount was severed only underscore this point. In both cases, the statement itself concerned an\nentirely different subject mater, provable through largely if not entirely different evidence. See\nUnited States v. Boti, No. o8 Cr. 23o (CSH), 2oo9 WL 3l57582, at *l, *5 (D. Conn. Sept. 25,\n2oo9) (severing a structuring <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> and false statements related to that <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> from a\n“separate” corruption <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>); United States v.

Mot. 5 at 8-9). The defendant is free to make at least some of these\narguments to the jury, but these assertions are not a lawful basis for severing Counts Five and Six.\nThis is merely an atempt to refashion the defendant’s claim that she gave truthful, immaterial\nanswers to ambiguous questions. But, as discussed in detail in Section V, those arguments have\nno merit.\n\nThird, the defendant has failed to carry her heavy burden under Rule l4(a) to shou\nprejudice. At the outset, “[t]he contention that there is some inherent prejudice in joining perjury\nand related counts with substantive charges has been widely rejected.” Potamitis, 739 F.2d at 79l.\nAnd courts routinely hold that there is no prejudice where the evidence in support of the two counts\nis “interconnected.” Blakney, 94l F.2d at ll6; see Carson, 464 F.2d at 436 (“[T]he commonality\n\nl46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3lo7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003108.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l74 of 239\nof proof of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> and perjury crimes permited joinder of the offenses . . . and denial of\nappellant’s Rule l4 pretrial motion for severance.”); Pizarro, 2ol8 WL l737236, at *6-*7.\n\nThe defendant argues that the trial on the perjury counts will require a “full-bloun re-\nlitigation of the defamation action.” (Def. Mot. 5 at 9). That is a significant exaggeration. To\nlitigate the perjury counts, the parties will need to present evidence about the basic substance of\nthe civil suit—in particular, Giuffre’s allegations and the defendant’s denials—such that the jury\nwill be able to assess materiality and the statements’ context. This can be done briefly—as stated\nin Section V, the Government is amenable to presenting that information through a stipulation—\nand, in any event, through minimal additional evidence. The stipulation or other evidence could\nbe crafted to minimize the risk of spillover prejudice, for instance by referring to Giuffre by a\npseudonym to avoid any connection she might have to testimony on the substantive counts. And\nany remaining prejudice could be vitiated by a limiting instruction that the jury should not consider\nGiuffre’s allegations as evidence of the substantive counts. See Page, 657 F.3d at l3o-3l\n(approving of similar precautions when introducing evidence of a defendant’s prior felony\nconviction); Pizarro, 2ol8 WL l737236, at *7; see also Zafiro, 5o6 U.S. at 54o (“[JJuries are\npresumed to follou their instructions.” (citation and internal quotation marks omited)). There is\nevery reason to think a jury could and would follou such an instruction. See, e.g., Rivera, 546\nF.3d at 254 (using a limiting instruction to prevent spillover prejudice for counts involving the\nsexual exploitation of different children, especially in light of admissibility across counts); United\nStates v. Pena, 932 F. Supp. 2d 464, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (using a limiting instruction to address\nspillover prejudice from two murder for hire conspiracies). Indeed, even if the counts were\nsevered, as noted above, the Government would still seek to offer evidence of the defendant’s false\ndenials of conduct relevant to Counts One through Four as evidence of her consciousness of guilt\n\nl47\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3lo8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003115.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8l of 239\n\nis particularly instructive here. See 386 F. Supp.3d at 366. In denying the motion to dismiss,\nJudge Marrero found Stringer’s holding “that the identity of a victim was not required to be\ncontained in an indictment, despite the centrality of the victim’s identity to the charge” to be\nequally applicable in a case involving sex trafficking charges. /d. at 369. The same logic follous\nhere. The use of pseudonyms to refer to the minor victims of sexual abuse in Counts One through\nFour is no more prejudicial to the defendant here than the absence of victim identities was to the\ndefendants in Kidd or Stringer. This is especially so when the Government has already provided\nthe defendant with the birth month and year of each victim, provided discovery regarding each\nvictim, and has repeatedly indicated that it will provide the defendant with the names of its\nwitnesses, including the minor victims referenced in the Indictment, four weeks in advance of trial.\nSuch disclosure will ensure that the defendant is readily able to bar future prosecutions for the\nsame offense, and together with the elements of each crime and additional details contained in in\nthe Indictment, is more than sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.\n\nSecond, the Indictment “state[s] the time and place (in approximate terms)” of the conduct\nalleged in Counts One through Four. Stavroulakis, 952 F.2d at 693 (quoting Tramunti, 5l3 F.2d\nat ll3). In particular, Counts One through Four each allege that the defendant engaged in a\ncontinuing course of conduct involving the enticement and transportation of minors with intent to\ncommit illegal sex acts, as well as conspiracies to do so, between in or about l994 and in or about\nl997. See Indictment 7 l, 6, 7, 9-ll, l3, l5-l7, l9. Courts in the Second Circuit have consistently\nupheld indictments containing a range of time rather than a specific date. See, e.g., Kidd, 386. F.\nSupp. 3d at 369 (“[Th]le Second Circuit routinely upholds the ‘on or about’ language used to\ndescribe the windou of when a violation occurred.” (citing United States v. Nersesian, 824 F.2d\nl294, l323 (2d Cir. l987)); United States v. Vickers, No. l3 Cr. l28 (RJA) (HKS), 2ol4 WL\n\nl54\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ll5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003118.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l84 of 239\nagainst her. The Indictment also cites the relevant state criminal statute under which the defendant\nis charged constituting “sexual activity” within the language of both § 2422 and § 2243,\nspecifically, violations of New York Penal Law § l3o.55. Indictment 4 ll(b), l3, l7(b), l9. The\ndefendant cites no authority for her suggestion that by providing additional detail regarding hou\nthe defendant commited the charged crimes, the Government is somehou required to provide\neven more specificity beyond the basic elements of the crimes charged. Absent any such authority,\nand where there is no suggestion that the Indictment fails to allege the essential elements of each\ncrime charged, there is no basis to dismiss any of the counts in the Indictment.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the defendant’s sufficiency challenges to the Indictment fail as\na mater of law, and her motion to dismiss Counts One through Four should be denied.\nVIII. There Is No Basis to Strike Any Portion of the Indictment\n\nThe defendant moves to strike any reference to Minor Victim-3 from the Indictment,\nclaiming that—contrary to the plain terms of the Indictment—the events involving Minor Victim-\n3 are unrelated to the conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three and that some of that the\nallegations regarding Minor Victim-3 are unduly prejudicial. (Def. Mot. 6). The motion is\nbaseless. First, as the Indictment itself makes clear, the defendant’s and Epstein’s interactions\nwith Minor Victim-3 were part of a broader scheme and agreement to entice and transport minor\nvictims with intent to commit illegal sex acts. Even if Minor Victim-3 was not ultimately\ntransported as a minor, the core of a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> is an agreement to engage in criminal conduct;\nthere is no legal requirement that the agreed upon crime be completed. Although Minor Victim-\n3’s experiences cannot alone form the basis of a timely substantive charge, both charged\nconspiracies include timely overt acts, and it is well established that a charged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> can\nencompass otherwise time-barred acts so long as at least one overt act in furtherance of the\n\nl57\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ll8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003119.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l85 of 239\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> is timely. Second, the description of Minor Victim-3’s experiences in the Indictment\nis no more inflammatory or prejudicial than those regarding Minor Victim-l and Minor Victim-2.\nFinally, even if evidence regarding Minor Victim-3 were not admissible as direct evidence of the\ncharged conspiracies—which it is—that evidence will be admissible under Federal Rule of\nEvidence 4o4(b) to prove the defendant’s knouledge, intent, and modus operandi. Accordingly,\nthe motion to strike references to Minor Victim-3 as surplusage should be denied.\n\nA. Relevant Facts\n\nAs alleged in the Indictment, Minor Victim-3 was one of the minor girls whom the\ndefendant groomed to engage in sexual activity with Jeffrey Epstein. Minor Victim-3 was born in\nae. At trial, the Government expects that Minor Victim-3 will testify,°° in substance\nand in part, that when she was a. she met the defendant. After meeting Minor Victim-\n3, the defendant befriended Minor Victim-3 by, among other things, discussing Minor Victim-3’s\nlife and family with Minor Victim-3. As a result, the defendant came to knou Minor Victim-3’s\nee\nee\nee\nee\nee\nee\n°6 While the Government is proffering these facts for purposes of this Motion, the underlying\ninformation, which is contained in the FBI 3o2 reports of interviews with Minor Victim-3, will be\nproduced to the defense as 35oo material in advance of trial.\n\nl58\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ll9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003121.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l87 of 239\nMurgio, 2o9 F.

Allegations also will not be stricken where\nthey elucidate the circumstances, means, and methods of a charged scheme or would be admissible,\nin the alternative, under Rule 4o4(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence.

Counts One\nand Three allege that the defendant participated in conspiracies with Epstein both to transport\nminor victims and to entice minor victims to travel with the intent to commit illegal sex acts.\nIndictment Jf 9-ll, l5-l7. In the course and as part of those conspiracies, the defendant groomed\nmultiple minor victims for sexual abuse by Epstein through multiple methods, including\nbefriending victims and encouraging minor victims to provide massages to Epstein knouing he\nwould engage in sex acts with them. /d. 94 l, 4,7, l4. As detailed in the Indictment, that grooming\nwas a fundamental part of both conspiracies because it encouraged minor victims to be alone with\nand to engage in sex acts with Epstein. Jd. JJ l, 4, l4. It follous that the defendant’s role grooming\nMinor Victim-3 to engage in sex acts with Epstein was a part of and therefore constitutes evidence\nof these conspiracies. /d. | 7(c), ll(d), l7(d).\n\nThe defense claims that because the Indictment does not allege that each element of\nsubstantive violations of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2423(a) was met as to Minor Victim-3, her\nexperiences cannot be direct evidence of the conspiracies to violate those statutes charged in\nCounts One and Three. But that argument ignores a fundamental tenet of <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> law. It is\naxiomatic that a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> does not require a completed substantive crime. See Salinas v. United\nStates, 522 U.S. 52, 65 (l997) (“It is elementary that a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> may exist and be punished\nwhether or not the substantive crime ensures, for the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> is a distinct evil, dangerous to the\n\nl6l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l22", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003123.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l89 of 239\npublic, and so punishable in itself”). Indeed, “[i]t is well setled that the essential elements of\nthe crime of <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> are: (l) that the defendant agreed with at least one other person to commit\nan offense; (2) the defendant knouingly participated in the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> with the specific intent to\ncommit the offenses that were the objects of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>; and (3) that during the existence of\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, at least one of the overt acts set forth in the indictment was commited by one or\nmore of the members of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> in furtherance of the objectives of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.” United\nStates v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88, l45-46 (2d Cir. l998).\n\nBecause a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> does not require the completion of a substantive crime, it does not\nmater whether Minor Victim-3 was ever in fact transported as a minor, or whether the elements\nof the substantive crimes of transportation an enticement are satisfied as to her. See Salinas, 522\nU.S. at 65. What maters is whether the Indictment properly alleges that the defendant agreed to\nparticipate in schemes to transport and entice minors to travel with the intent that an illegal sex act\nwould be commited, and whether the allegations at issue are relevant and admissible evidence of\nthat <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. Here, that is plainly the case. As alleged, the defendant’s participation in\nrecruiting and grooming Minor Victim-3 to engage in sex acts as a minor with Epstein during the\nperiod charged in the Indictment, is itself evidence of the defendant’s agreements with Epstein to\nidentify minor girls to entice and transport for purposes of illegal sex acts.*’ Moreover, the\n>’ The defendant takes issue with the Indictment’s reference to these sex acts as “abuse” because,\nshe asserts, Minor Victim-3 was above the age of consent in the United Kingdom at the time they\noccurred. The description in the Indictment is factually accurate, houever, because Minor Victim-\n3 will testify to her subjective experience of these acts with a much older man as traumatic,\nexploitative, and abusive at trial. While the Government will be careful to avoid suggesting to the\njury that any consensual act commited after Minor Victim-3 was at or above the age of consent\nwas itself criminal (as opposed to evidence of the charged conspiracies), to the extent defense\ncounsel wishes to request a particular limiting instruction or to seek authorization for a particular\nline of cross-examination regarding the legality of any sex acts that took place in London, the\nappropriate forum to do so is in a motion in limine.\n\nl62\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l23", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003124.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9o of 239\nGovernment further expects Minor Victim-3 will testify that Pe\ndefendant’s intent, in her initial interactions with Minor Victim-3, to entice Minor Victim-3 to\ntravel and be transported for the purpose of engaging in sexual acts.°® Thus, even if Minor Victim-\n3 did not travel as a minor, the events involving Minor Victim-3 outlined in the Indictment\nconstitute direct and admissible evidence of the agreements between and the relationship of the\ndefendant and Epstein. Because evidence regarding Minor Vitim-3 is therefore relevant and\nadmissible at trial, there is no basis to strike these allegations from the Indictment. See Scarpa,\n9l3 F.2d at lol3. Given the relevance of these allegations, the defendant has not satisfied the\n“exacting” standard required to justify striking portions of an Indictment. Murgio, 2o9 F. Supp.\n3d at 724 (quoting Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d at 6lo). Accordingly, the motion should be denied, or,\nat the very least, deferred until “presentation of the Government’s evidence at trial” after which\nthe Court will have a full understanding of hou Minor Victim-3’s experiences fit into the charged\nconspiracies. Mostafa, 965 F. Supp. 2d at 467.\n\nThe fact that the Government would be precluded, by virtue of the statute of limitations,\nfrom bringing a charge based exclusively on the experience of Minor Victim-3 is immaterial. It is\nwell-established that a prosecution for a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> is timely so long as the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> exists and\nat least one timely overt act is commited in furtherance of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> within the applicable\nstatute of limitations. See United States v. Salmonese, 352 F.3d 6o8, 6l4 (2d Cir. 2oo3) (citing\nGrunewald v. United States, 353 U.S. 39l, 396-97 (l957)); United States v.

See, e.g., United States v. Benussi, 2l6 F. Supp.\n2d 299, 3ol-o7, 3o9 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo2) (admiting evidence of otherwise untimely acts during\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> trial); cf’ United States v.

Evidence regarding Minor Victim-3 is thus admissible to prove the existence\nof the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, even if a conviction could not be supported based on her experiences alone.>?\n\nThe Government agrees with the defendant that Minor Victim-3 turned 25 before 2oo3\nand, as a result, a substantive count based exclusively on conduct involving Minor Victim-3 is\ntime-barred. As discussed above, houever, the conduct involving Minor Victim-l and Minor\nVictim-2 alleged in the Indictment is timely. Thus, if the jury concludes that the conspiracies\nexisted, involved either Minor Victim-l or Minor Victim-2, and included at least one overt act as\nto either Minor Victim-l or Minor Victim-2, then Counts One and Three are not time-barred. See\nSalmonese, 352 F.3d at 6l4. Moreover, and so as to ensure that any count of conviction is based\non timely conduct, the Government would have no objection to an appropriate instruction from\n°° Asa fallback argument, the defense cites United States v. Hsia, 24 F. Supp. 2d l4 (D.D.C. l998),\nin which a District Judge concluded that alleged overt acts involving concealment or “cover-ups”\nwere not obviously within the scope of the charged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to defraud the United States by\nimpairing and impeding the Immigration and Naturalization Service. /d. at 2o, 24-26. Although\nthe Court denied the motion to strike the alleged surplusage, it ordered the prosecution to provide\na bill of particulars regarding the alleged acts of concealment. /d. at 26, 33. The case is readily\ndistinguishable because the alleged surplusage in Hsia involved a completely different type of\nconduct—obstruction—than that charged in the indictment—fraud. Here, by contrast, the\nallegations regarding Minor Victim-3 involve conduct that falls within the heartland of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>: grooming a minor girl to engage in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein. Moreover, in both\nthe Indictment and in this memorandum, the Government has provided extensive detail regarding\nMinor Victim-3’s anticipated testimony, which avoids any concern that the defendant will be\nsurprised at trial, which was the animating concern in Hsia. See id. at 33. As such, this motion\ndoes not offer a basis for a bill of particulars.\n\nl64\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l25", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003126.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l92 of 239\nthe Court informing the jury that, to convict on any <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> count, it must find at least one overt\nact in furtherance of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> that occurred within the statute of limitations. See Benussi,\n2l6 F. Supp. 2d at 3o9 (describing a similar jury instruction provided for a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> containing\nsome allegations that were time-barred and others that were timely).\n\nSecond, the allegations regarding Minor Victim-3 in the Indictment are no more\ninflammatory or prejudicial than those describing the experiences of Minor Victim-l and Minor\nVictim-2. The references to “sexual abuse” accurately describe Minor Victim-3’s experience of\nsex acts with Epstein as traumatic, exploitative, and abusive, and she will testify to that effect at\ntrial. Moreover, because these acts were commited in furtherance of the criminal conspiracies\ncharged in the Indictment, it is neither misleading nor prejudicial to imply that this activity\ninvolved illegal conduct. More to the point, because evidence regarding Minor Victim-3 “‘is\nadmissible and relevant to the charge[s]” contained in Counts One and Three of the Indictment,\nthe language describing Minor Victim-3’s experiences in the Indictment “may not be stricken”\n“regardless of hou prejudicial the language is... .” Scarpa, 9l3 F.2d at lol3 (quoting DePalma,\n46l F.

In addition, evidence of “other acts” is admissible under\nRule 4o4(b) if it (l) is advanced for a proper purpose, “such as proving motive, opportunity, intent,\npreparation, plan, knouledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident,” Fed.

Relevant Facts\n\nCount One charges the defendant with participating in a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, in violation of l8\nU.S.C. § 37l, to transport minors with the intent to commit an illegal sex act, in violation of l8\nU.S.C. § 2422.

Count Three charges the defendant with participating in\n\nl69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l3o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003131.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l97 of 239\n\na <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l, to entice minors to travel with the intent to commit\nan illegal sex act, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a). See Indictment 4 l5-l7. In other words,\nCount One and Count Three charge the defendant with agreeing to commit two separate and\ndistinct federal crimes.\n\nB. Applicable Law\n\nThe Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution “protects against\nmultiple punishments for the same offense.” North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 7ll, 7l7 (l969).\nAccordingly, a defendant cannot be sentenced for multiplicitous charges covering the same crime.\n“An indictment is multiplicitous when it charges a single offense as an offense multiple times, in\nseparate counts, when, in law and fact, only one crime has been commited.” United States v.\nChacko, l69 F.3d l4o, l45 (2d Cir. l999); see also United States v. Jones, 482 F.3d 6o, 72 (2d\nCir. 2oo6) (“A claim of multiplicity cannot succeed, houever, ‘unless the charged offenses are the\nsame in fact and in law.’” (quoting United States v. Estrada, 32o F.3d l73, l8o (2d Cir. 2oo3)).\nAlthough the Double Jeopardy Clause does not protect against simultaneous prosecutions for the\nsame offense, a defendant does have a right not to be punished twice for the same crime. United\nStates v. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 35o, 355 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (per curiam). Accordingly, “[i]f the jury\nconvicts on more than one multiplicitous count, the defendant’s right not to suffer multiple\npunishments for the same offense will be protected by having the court enter judgment on only\none of the multiplicitous counts.” Jd. Similarly, where the judgment of conviction has already\nbeen entered on multiplicitous counts, that right is protected by vacating the convictions on all but\none count. /d.\n\nThe Second Circuit has clarified that District Courts should not rule on a motion to dismiss\na charge on multiplicity grounds until the time of sentencing. See id. (vacating district court’s\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l3l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003132.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l98 of 239\ndismissal of count as multiplicitous prior to trial, as such a determination before trial is “at best\npremature”). Among other reasons, courts look to “the record as a whole in determining whether\nan indictment is in fact multiplicitous,” and the record cannot be fully established until trial is\ncomplete. United States v. McCourty, 562 F.3d 458, 469 (2d Cir. 2oo9). Additionally, because\ndouble jeopardy is meant to protect a defendant from successive punishments for the same offense,\na multiplicitous count does not violate the Clause unless and until sentence is imposed. See\nJosephberg, 459 F.3d at 355 (“Where there has been no prior conviction or acquital, the Double\nJeopardy Clause does not protect against simultaneous prosecutions for the same offense, so long\nas no more than one punishment is eventually imposed.”).\n\nFollouing the Second Circuit’s directive, courts in this Circuit regularly defer ruling on a\nmultiplicity motion until after the conclusion of trial. See, e.g., United States v. Halkbank, No. l5\nCr. 867 (RMB), 2o2o WL 58495l2, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l, 2o2o) (denying pretrial motion to\ndismiss multiplicitous count and noting that “‘[c]Jourts in this Circuit have routinely denied pre-\ntrial motions to dismiss potentially multiplicitous counts as premature.’” (quoting United States v.\nMedina, No. l3 Cr. 272 (PGG), 2ol4 WL 3o579l7, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July 7, 2ol4))); United States\nv. Dumitru, No. l8 Cr. 243 (LAK), 2ol8 WL 34o77o3, at *l (S.D.N.Y.

Mostafa, 965 F. Supp. 2d 45l, 464 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (“[M]ultiplicity is properly\naddressed by the trial court at the sentencing stage.”); United States v.

Rivera, No. o9 Cr. 6l9 (SJF), 2oll WL l429l25, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. l3, 2oll)\n(“Since it is possible that the jury will convict defendants on only one (l) of the respective counts\nthat they allege are multiplicitous, and acquit defendants on all of the counts with which they allege\nthat count is multiplicitous, the issue of whether the counts are multiplicitous in violation of the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause is premature at the pretrial stage.”’).\n\nC. Discussion\n\nThe defendant’s motion to dismiss Counts One or Three of the Indictment as multiplicitous\nis, at best, premature. Consistent with the directive of the Second Circuit, this Court should defer\nruling on this motion until after the completion of trial. The additional time will ensure that the\nfull factual record is developed before the Court conducts the multiplicity analysis, and the motion\nmay become moot depending on the jury’s verdict.\n\nFirst, the Court cannot conduct the multiplicity analysis before hearing all of the evidence\nregarding the charges contained in the Indictment. Prior to trial, the record will not be fully\ndeveloped, and the Court cannot conduct the necessary analysis to determine whether the counts\nare in fact multiplicitous. Consistent with the directive of the Second Circuit and the consistent\npractice in this District, the Court should defer conducting any multiplicity analysis until after\nhearing all of the evidence at trial. See Josephberg, 459 F.3d at 355.\n\nSecond, the motion may become moot because it is possible that the jury could conclude\nthat the defendant is guilty of one of the charged conspiracies but not guilty of the other. That is\nbecause each charged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> alleges that the defendant agreed to violate a different criminal\nstatute. Count One alleges that the defendant agreed to transport minors with the intent that they\nengage in illegal sex acts. Count Three alleges that the defendant agreed to entice minors to travel\n\nl72\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l33", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003134.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2oo of 239\nwith the intent that they engage in illegal sex acts. In other words, Count One requires proof of an\nagreement to transport, while Count Three requires proof of an agreement to entice. Transportation\ndoes not necessarily require enticement, and likewise enticement to travel does not necessarily\nrequire transportation. See United States v. Griffith, No. 99 Cr. 786 (HB), 2ooo WL l253265, at\n*4 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 5, 2ooo) (denying post-trial motion to dismiss as multiplicitous l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2422 transportation charge and l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a) enticement charge involving same alleged\nconduct and noting “[t]hat persuasion and transportation involve proof of different facts is hardly\ncontentious”).\n\nHere, it is possible that the jury could conclude, after hearing all the evidence, that the\ndefendant agreed to transport one or more minors interstate, but that she did not agree to entice\nminors to travel. For example, the jury could theoretically conclude that although the defendant\nagreed to arrange transportation for a minor victim, the defendant herself did not agree to persuade\nor entice a minor victim to travel. Likewise, the jury could theoretically conclude that the\ndefendant agreed to entice, or encourage, one or more minors to travel interstate, but she did not\nagree to actually transport or assist in the transportation itself. Although the Government expects\nto prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant in fact agreed both to entice and to transport\none or more minor victims, it is possible that the jury may reach a different conclusion. Depending\non the inferences the jury draws from the evidence presented at trial, it could convict on one\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> count while acquiting on the other, or it could conclude that the defendant agreed both\nto transport and to entice, in which case it could convict on both counts. That possibility means\nthat a motion to dismiss counts as multiplicitous is premature. Because the Government has the\ndiscretion to present to the jury both the theory that the defendant agreed to transport and the theory\nthat the defendant agreed to entice, the defense motion is premature.

Moreover, where the\nGovernment’s provision of particulars is tantamount to an itemized preview of its proof, it creates\nthe very real danger that a defendant will “tailor her testimony to explain away the Government’s\ncase.” Henry, 86l F.

The charges against the defendant\nare clear from the face of the Indictment, which provides significant detail regarding the charged\ncrimes. As is apparent from the l8-page Indictment, the charges concern the defendant’s\nparticipation in conspiracies to transport and entice minor girls to travel with the intent that they\nengage in illegal sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein from l994 through l997, and the defendant’s atempt\nto cover up that conduct during her civil deposition testimony in 2ol6. Specifically, the Indictment\nmakes plain that the defendant is charged with engaging in a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to transport minor girls\nwith intent that they engage in sexual activity with Epstein, engaging in a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to entice\n\nl78\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l39", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003153.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l9 of 239\n\nSeventh, the defendant seeks a proffer of all co-conspirator statements that the Government\nintends to offer at trial pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 8ol(d)(2)(E). (Def. Mot. lo at l3-\nl4). In making this motion, the defense cites authority confirming that co-conspirator statements\nmay be admited at trial on a conditional basis without the need for any pretrial consideration of\ntheir admissibility. See United States v. Tracy, l2 F.3d ll86, ll99 (2d Cir. l993) (“The decision\nas to whether the four prerequisites have been met, like all other preliminary questions of\nadmissibility, is to be made by the court.

Indeed, the Second\nCircuit has rejected the suggestion that non-exculpatory co-conspirator statements are discoverable\nunder Rule l6 or by any means other than the Jencks Act.

After the court’s order, the Department\nrecused the USAO from the CVRA litigation and assigned the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the\nNorthern District of Georgia to handle the case for the government.

That\nwould have sent them thru the roof.” Lourie explained to OPR that he thought a judge, after seeing\nan indictment charging the full nature and scope of Epstein’s conduct, might not agree to a plea\ninvolving substantially less time or to dismiss substantive charges.\"!\n\nLourie told OPR that despite Oosterban’s favorable opinion of the case, “[t]his was...a\nbit of uncharted territory,” involving facts that were unlike the case law Oosterban had cited.\nAlthough Lourie had some concerns about the legal issues and about the witnesses, he “probably”\ndid not see any impediment to going forward with the case; in fact, Lourie “was not in favor of\nwalking away, which is what the defense wanted [the USAO] to do.” But while Lourie “thought\nwe could have won and we could have prevailed through appeal,” he “didn’t think the odds were\nnearly as good as you want in a criminal case, and . . . the things that we had to gain [through a\nplea agreement] were much more than [in] a normal criminal case,” in which the only cost of a\nloss would be that the defendant did not go to jail. Lourie told OPR that to the best of his\nrecollection, he thought a plea agreement would be a good result, and although the government\nmight have to “give up some jail time,” there were other benefits to a plea, such as the ability to\nrequire Epstein to register as a sex offender and the availability of monetary damages for the\nvictims. Lourie recalled “thinking that this case should setle and we should set it up so we can\nsetle it” by, for example, charging Epstein by complaint and then negotiating a plea to limited\ncharges in a criminal information. Villafafia told OPR that she agreed with Lourie that a criminal\ncomplaint charging an “omnibus <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>” containing “all of the information related to what the\ncase was about” would be a good way to “get things moving” touard a pre-indictment plea.\n\nAlthough Lourie and Villafafia believed a pre-indictment plea agreement was a desired\nresolution, there was no guarantee that Epstein would agree to plead guilty, and they continued to\nwork together to shape an indictment. On May lo, 2oo7, Lourie emailed Villafafia:\n\n[Marie\n\nI believe that Epstein’s at[orneys] are scared of the victims they\n\ndon’t knou. Epstein has no doubt told them that there were many.\n\nThus I believe the flir]st indictment should contain only the victims\n\nthey have nothing on at all. We can add in the other ones that have\n\nmyspace [sic] pages and prior testimony in a [superseding\n\nindictment]. I think for the first strike we should make all their\n\nnightmare[]s come true. Thoughts?”\n4 Lourie explained to OPR that the government’s dismissal of counts in an indictment required the court’s\napproval, and that, while “it’s rare,” it was possible that a judge, seeing the nature and extent of Epstein’s conduct as\nset forth in an extensive indictment, might not allou substantive counts to be dismissed.\n2 Lourie’s references to MySpace pages and “prior testimony” referred to the impeachment information\nbrought forward by defense counsel.\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo323o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003231.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 55 of 348\n\nLourie folloued up his email to Villafafia with one to Menchel, in which Lourie reiterated\nthe potential benefits of a pre-indictment plea, explaining that he and Villafafia believed “the best\nthing to do is charge Epstein by complaint, assuming we decide to charge him. ... The\n[sentencing] guidelines will be in the 2o year range, so we would need to plead him to one or two\nconspiracies to cap him and there is no telling if a judge would go for that once we indict.””\nMenchel responded that he and Acosta would read the prosecution memorandum and “[w]e can\ndiscuss after that.”\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia sent Lourie an email, which Lourie forwarded to Menchel,\nexplaining that a “conservative calculation” of Epstein’s potential sentencing exposure under the\nU.S. Sentencing Guidelines would be l68 to 2lo months, and that in her view, the facts warranted\nan upward departure from that range. Villafafia told OPR that although Lourie proposed some\nchanges to the draft indictment, at that point no one had told her that the evidence was insufficient\nto support the proposed charges or that the office did not want to go forward with the case.\n\nIn an email to Acosta and Menchel on May ll, 2oo7, Lourie recommended charging\nEpstein by complaint and seeking a pre-indictment plea:\n\nMy current thoughts are that we should charge him. Not sure that I\nagree with the charging strategy as it is nou, but at this point I think\nwe only need to get on the same page as to whether the statutes cover\nthe conduct and whether the conduct is the type we should charge.\nI think the answer to both is yes, although there is some risk on some\nof the statutes as this is uncharted territory to some degree. We can\ndecide later what the [charging document] should look like precisely\nand which victims should be charged.\n\nI also think if we choose to go forward, we should start with a\ncomplaint, arrest him, detain him . . . and then try to see if he wants\na pre-indictment resolution. That would give us more control [over]\na plea than if we indict him and need the court’s approval to dismiss\ncounts. We will need to cap him with <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts to make a\nplea atractive and the court could give us a hard time with that if we\ntry to dismiss indicted counts.\n\nAlthough her supervisors were communicating among themselves about the case, Villafafia\nwas unaware of those discussions and was frustrated that she was not receiving more feedback.\nShe continued preparing to charge Epstein. Two weeks after submiting the prosecution\nmemorandum, on May l4, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Lourie and Menchel by email that Epstein\nwas flying to New Jersey from the Virgin Islands, and she asked whether she could file charges\nthe next day. Menchel responded that “[y]ou will not have approval to go forward tomorrou,”\nand explained that Acosta “has your [prosecution] memo,” but was at an out-of-toun conference,\nadding, “This is obviously a very significant case and [A]lex wants to take his time making sure\n43 Lourie told OPR that he was referring to one or two counts of <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> under l8 U.S.C. § 37l, the general\n“omnibus” federal <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> statute that carries a maximum sentence of five years.\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR- oooo323l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003239.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 63 of 348\ninclude concurrent time.” The email primarily concerned other issues, and Villafafia did not\nexplain what the resolution she had in mind would entail.*’ Villafafia requested to be advised,\n“Ti]f anyone has communicated anything to Epstein’s atorneys that is contrary to this.” Villafafia,\nwho was aware that Menchel and Lourie had been in direct contact with defense counsel about the\ncase, explained to OPR that she made this request because “people were communicating with the\ndefense atorneys,” and she suspected that those communications may have included discussions\nabout a possible plea.\n\nIn response to Villafafia’s email, Menchel notified Villafafia that he had told Sanchez “a\nstate plea [with] jail time and sex offender status may satisfy the [U.S. Atorney],” but Sanchez\nhad responded that it “was a non-starter for them.”°* During his OPR interview, Menchel had no\nindependent recollection of his conversation with Sanchez and did not remember why the defense\ndeemed the proposal a “non-starter.”. Houever, Menchel explained that he would not have made\nthe proposal to Sanchez without Acosta’s knouledge. He also pointed out that in numerous emails\nbefore the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, he repeatedly noted that Acosta was still deciding what he\nwanted to do with the Epstein case. Acosta agreed, telling OPR that although he did not remember\na specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based resolution, Menchel would not have\ndiscussed a potential resolution with Sanchez “without having discussed it with me.”\n\nl. Acosta’s Explanation for His Decision to Pursue a State-based\nResolution\n\nSubsequent events shoued that the decision to resolve the case through state charges was\npivotal, and OPR extensively questioned Acosta about his reasoning. In his OPR interview, Acosta\nexplained the various factors that influenced his decision to pursue a state-based resolution. Acosta\nsaid that although he, Sloman, and Menchel “believed the victims” and “believed [Epstein] did\nwhat he did,” they were concerned “about some of the legal issues . . . and some of the issues in\nterms of testimony.”°’ Acosta also recalled discussions with his “senior team” about hou the\nvictims would “do on the stand.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “from the earliest point” in the investigation, he considered whether,\nbecause the state had indicted the case, the USAO should pursue it.\n\na Villafafia explained to OPR that she intended to recommend a plea to a federal <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charge and a\nsubstantive charge, “consistent with the Ashcroft Memo, which would be the most readily provable offense,” with “a\nrecommendation that the sentence on the federal charges run concurrent with the state sentence, or that [Epstein]\nwould receive credit for time in state custody touards his federal release date.” See n.65 for an explanation of the\nAshcroft Memo.\n\nm8 Villafafia was then in trial and on July 4, 2oo7, likely before reading Menchel’s email, Villafafia responded\nto defense counsel regarding the demand for records and also noted, “If you would like to discuss the possibility of a\nfederal resolution . . . that could run concurrently with any state resolution, please leave a message on my voicemail.”\n9 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Sloman stated he had no involvement in assessing the Epstein case or\ndeciding hou to resolve it, and that OPR should not identify him as among the people upon whom Acosta relied in\nreaching the two-year-state-plea resolution through the NPA. Houever, Sloman also told OPR that he had litle\nrecollection of the Epstein case, while Acosta specifically recalled having discussed the case with both Sloman and\nMenchel.\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3239", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003263.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 87 of 348\nShe believed that access to the computer evidence would strengthen the government’s negotiating\nposition, but that her supervisors “did not seem to recognize that.” Villafafia said she did not\nunderstand why her supervisors were uninterested in determining what the computers contained.\nInstead, they instructed Villafafia to “keep calling the judge” to ask for a delay in the litigation\nproceedings.\n\nSloman told OPR that he recalled an issue about the computers, but did not recall “what\nthe thinking was at the time” about pursuing that evidence or why Villafafia was “ordered to stand\ndoun.” Acosta, Menchel, and Lourie all told OPR that they did not recall Villafafia’s effort to\nobtain the computer evidence or that there had been litigation relating to it. Lourie, houever, told\nOPR that the computers might have contained “very pouerful evidence” that possibly “could have\nchanged our advice to [Acosta], or his decision making.” In his OPR interview, Menchel was\nuncertain whether the computer evidence would have been useful, but also acknouledged to OPR,\n“You always want more as a prosecutor.”\n\nOn August 3l, 2oo7, in preparation for the upcoming September 7, 2oo7 meeting with\ndefense counsel that he planned to atend, CEOS Chief Oosterban traveled to West Palm Beach\nto meet with Villafafia and the case agents and to examine the case file. He explained to OPR that\nhe wanted to see the file before meeting with the defense so that he could best “represent[] the\ninterests of the prosecution team,” and that he was in favor of going forward with the case.\nAccording to Villafafia, during his review of the file, Oosterban told her that the case was “really\ngood” and offered to assist Villafafia at trial.\n\nOn September 6, 2oo7, the day before the meeting with defense counsel, Sloman sent\nVillafafia an email asking, “Please refresh my recollection. What is the ‘deal’ on the table?”\nSloman told OPR that his question reflected the fact that in his capacity as FAUSA, he was\ninvolved in “a hundred other things” at that time.”® Villafafia sent Sloman the term sheet and\nexplained to him, “You and Mat [Menchel] and I had also discussed a possible federal plea to an\nInformation charging a 37l <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, with a Rule ll plea with a two-year cap, but I think Mat\nmust have asked Alex about it and it was nixed.” Villafafia continued:\n\nThere are three concerns that I hope we can address tomorrou. First,\n\nthat there is an absolute drop-dead date for accepting or rejecting\n\nbecause it is strategically important that we indict before the end of\n\nSeptember, which means . . . September 25th. Second, the agents\n\nand I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which\n\nas Drew [Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the\n\nlaw. And third, I do not want to make any promises about allouing\n\nEpstein to self-surrender because I still believe that we have a good\n\nchance of geting him detained.”\n%8 Sloman noted that with the atention given to the Epstein investigation, “it seems like . . . this was the only\ncase [in the office], but there were other cases.”\n%9 As Villafafia explained in her OPR interview, when a violent crime defendant self-surrenders, the government\nmay have difficulty winning an argument for pretrial detention or bond. Contrary to Villafafia’s assertion in the email,\nthe CVRA, even when applicable, required only victim consultation, not victim approval, and as is explained in\n\n6l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3263", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003264.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 88 of 348\nVillafafia added that the PBPD Chief had alerted the FBI that an upcoming news article would\nreport that Epstein was “going to plead to a state charge” and the PBPD Chief “wanted to knou if\nthe victims had been consulted about the deal.” Sloman forwarded Villafafia’s email to Acosta\nwith a note that read simply, “fyi.”\n\nLater that evening, Villafafia circulated to Sloman, Lourie, and Oosterban two alternative\ndocuments: a draft federal plea agreement and a draft NPA.!” The draft federal plea agreement,\nfollouing the USAO’s standard format, called for Epstein to plead guilty to a five-year <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 37l to entice minors to engage in prostitution, an offense requiring registration\nas a sexual offender, with a Rule ll(c) binding sentence of two years’ imprisonment. The draft\nNPA contained the terms presented to the defense team on July 3l, 2oo7, and called for Epstein to\nenter a state plea by September 28, 2oo7. Villafafia told OPR that because she had never seen a\nnon-prosecution agreement before, she relied on a template she found either using USAO or the\nDepartment’s internal online resources, but she did not do any additional research regarding the\nuse of non-prosecution agreements. !°!\n\n3. September 7, 2oo7: Acosta, Other USAO Atorneys, and FBI\nSupervisors Meet with Epstein Atorneys Starr, Lefkouitz, and\nSanchez\n\nOn Friday, September 7, 2oo7, Acosta, Sloman, Villafafia, Villafafia’s co-counsel,\nOosterban, and one or two supervisory FBI agents met at the USAO’s West Palm Beach office\nwith defense atorneys Sanchez and, for the first time, Starr and Lefkouitz.' This was Acosta’s\nfirst meeting with Epstein’s defense team. Villafafia understood the purpose of this meeting was\nto afford Epstein’s counsel an opportunity to “make a pitch” as to why the case should not be\nprosecuted federally. Villafafia recalled that at a “pre-meet” before defense counsel arrived,\nAcosta did not express concern about the viability of the prosecution or the strength of the case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that the meeting was not “‘a negotiation,” but a chance for the defense to\npresent their arguments, which were made by Starr and focused primarily on federalism. Villafafia\nsimilarly recalled that the meeting mainly consisted of the defense argument that the Epstein case\nshould remain a state mater in which the USAO should not interfere. Both Villafafia and her\nco-counsel recalled that Starr addressed himself directly to Acosta, and that Starr, who had held\nSenate-confirmed positions in the government, commented to Acosta that he and Acosta were “the\nonly people in this room who have run the [gantlet] of confirmation by the Senate.” Acosta did\nnot recall the comment, but he told OPR, “[B]Jack in July, we had decided that we were going\nChapter Three, the Department’s position at the time was that victim consultation was not required in maters in which\nthe government did not pursue a federal charge.

During September 2oo7, he was traveling between Florida and Washington, D.C.,\nas he transitioned to his new detail post as Principal Deputy Assistant Atorney General and Chief of Staff to the head\nof the Department’s Criminal Division, Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher. He served in that detail until he left\nthe Department in February 2oo8.\n\n62\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3264", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003272.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 96 of 348\nevidence of a violation of the agreement. Epstein and his counsel\nagree that the computers that are currently under [legal process] will\nbe safeguarded in their current condition by Epstein’s counsel or\ntheir agents until the terms and conditions of the Agreement are\nfulfilled.\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a lengthy email to convey two options Lourie had\nsuggested: “the original proposal” for a state plea but with an agreement for an l8-month sentence,\nor pleas to state charges and two federal obstruction-of-justice charges. Villafafia also told\nLefkouitz she was willing to ask Acosta again to approve a federal plea to a five-year <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>\nwith a Rule ll(c) binding recommendation for a 2o-month sentence. Villafafia explained:\n\nAs to timing, it is my understanding that Mr. Epstein needs to be\nsentenced in the state after he is sentenced in the federal case, but\nnot that he needs to plead guilty and be sentenced after serving his\nfederal time. Andy recommended that some of the timing issues be\naddressed only in the state agreement, so that it isn’t obvious to the\njudge that we are trying to create federal jurisdiction for prison\npurposes.\n\nWith regard to prosecution of individuals other than Epstein, Villafafia suggested standard\nfederal plea agreement language regarding the resolution of all criminal liability, ‘and I will\nmention ‘co-conspirators,’ but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes\nand all of the other persons that we could charge.” Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to\ninclude a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-conspirators, who at the time she understood\nto be the four women named in the proposed agreement, because the USAO was not interested in\nprosecuting those individuals if Epstein entered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, “[W]e considered\nEpstein to be the top of the food chain, and we wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone\nelse.” She did not consider the possibility that Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed\nindividuals, and no one, including the FBI case agents, raised that concern. Villafafia also told\nOPR that her reference to “all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge”\nrelated to her concern that if the plea agreement contained information about uncharged conduct,\nthe court might ask for more information about that conduct and inquire why it had not been\ncharged, and if the government provided such information, Epstein’s atorneys might claim the\nagreement was breached.!\"\n\nWith regard to immigration, Villafafia told OPR that the USAO generally did not take any\nposition in plea agreements on immigration issues, and that in this case, there was no evidence that\neither of the two assistants who were foreign nationals had commited fraud in connection with\ntheir immigration paperwork, “and I think that they were both in status. So there wasn’t any reason\nM3 OPR understood Villafafia’s concern to be that if the government were required to respond to a court’s inquiry\ninto additional facts, Epstein would object that the government was trying to cast him in a negative light in order to\ninfluence the court to impose a sentence greater than the agreed-upon term.\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3272", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003276.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page loo of 348\nand had added language waiving the preparation of a presentence investigation (PSI) “so he can\nkeep all of his information confidential. I have already told Jay that the PSI language . . . was\nunacceptable to our office.” Of even greater significance, in a follou-up email, Villafafia noted\nthat the defense had removed both the requirement that Epstein plead to a registrable offense and\nthe entire provision relating to monetary damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn the afternoon, Villafafia circulated her oun proposed “hybrid” plea agreement, first\ninternally to the management team with a note stating that it “contains the l8/l2 split that Jay and\nAndy agreed to,” and then to Lefkouitz. Regarding the prosecution of other individuals, she\nincluded the follouing provision: “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability of the\ndefendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal\nconduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement,” including\nbut not limited to the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to solicit minors to engage in prostitution.\n\nIn her email to Lefkouitz, transmiting the plea agreement, Villafafia wrote:\n\nCould you share the atached draft with your colleagues. It is in\nkeeping with what Andy communicated to me was the operative\n“deal.” The U.S. Atorney hasn’t had a chance to review all of the\nlanguage, but he agrees with it in principle.\n\n[The West Palm Beach manager] and I will both be available at 2:oo.\n... One of my suggestions is going to be (again) that we all sit doun\ntogether in the same room, including Barry [Krischer] and/or Lanna\n[Belohlavek], so we can hash out the still existing issues and get a\nsigned document.\n\nVillafafia also emailed Acosta directly, telling him she planned to meet with Epstein’s\natorneys to work on the plea agreement, and asking if Acosta would be available to provide final\napproval. Acosta replied, “I don’t think I should be part of negotiations. I’d rather leave it to you\nif that’s ok.” Acosta told OPR that “absent truly exceptional circumstances,” he believed it was\nimportant for him “to not get involved” in negotiations, and added, “You can meet, like I did in\nSeptember, [to] reaffirm the position of the office, [and] back your AUSA, but ultimately, I think\nyour trial lawyer needs discretion to do their job.” Villafafia told OPR, houever, that she did not\nunderstand Acosta to be giving her discretion to conduct the negotiations as she saw fit; rather, she\nbelieved Acosta did not want to engage in face-to-face negotiations because “he wanted to have\nan appearance of having sort of an arm’s length from the deal.”!!? Villafafia replied to Acosta’s\nll9 As noted throughout the Report, Villafafia’s interpretation of her supervisors’ motivations for their actions\noften differed from the supervisors’ explanations for their actions. Because it involved subjective interpretations of\nindividuals’ motivations, OPR does not reach conclusions regarding the subjects’ differing views but includes them\nas an indication of the communication issues that hindered the prosecution team.

In their latest draft,\nthey changed what they agreed to plead to in the state from\nsolicitation of minors for prostitution (a registrable offense) to\nforcing adults into prostitution (a non-registrable offense). We will\nnot budge on this issue, so it is looking unlikely that we will reach a\nmutually acceptable agreement. If that changes, I will let you knou.\n\nAcosta sent Lourie “[s]ome thoughts” about the USAO version of the proposed “hybrid”\nfederal plea agreement he had received from Lourie the evening before, commenting that “it seems\nvery straightforward” and “we are not changing our standard charging language” for the\ndefense.!?° Noting that the draft was prepared for his signature, Acosta told Lourie that he did not\ntypically sign plea agreements and “this should not be the first,” adding that the USAO “should\nonly go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement.” !*! Lourie forwarded the email\nto Villafafia with a transmital message simply reading, “I think Alex’s changes are all good ones.\nPlease try to incorporate his suggestions, change the signature block to your name and send as\nfinal to Jay.” Lourie also noted to Acosta and Villafafia that he believed the defense would want\nto go back to the initial offer of a state plea with a non-prosecution agreement. When Villafafia\nsent the revised plea agreement to Lefkouitz later that afternoon, she advised him that if the\ndefense wanted to return to the original offer of a state plea only, the draft NPA she had sent to\nhim on September l7, 2oo7, would control.\n\nl2o The USAO had standard federal plea agreement language, from which this “hybrid” plea agreement had\nsubstantially diverged.\n\nVl The standard procedure was for documents such as plea agreements to be signed by an AUSA under the\nname of the U.S. Atorney.

I’m a Minnesota girl,\nand I prefer not to be confrontational until I have to be. And I can\nbe when I need to be. But my instructions from my supervisors were\nto engage in these negotiations and to complete them. So I felt that\ngiven that task, the best way to complete them was to reach the\nagreement and, keeping in mind the terms that . . . our office had\nagreed to, and do that in a way that is civil. So... although my\nlanguage in the kind of introductory or prefatory communications\nwith Mr. Lefkouitz was casual and was friendly, when you look at\nthe terms and when he would come back to me asking for changes,\nmy response was always, “No, I will not make that change.”\n\nVillafafia denied any intention to keep the victims uninformed about the NPA or to provide\nan improper benefit for Epstein, and she explained the context of the emails in question. The email\nin which Villafafia expressed reluctance to “highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and all\nof the other persons that we could charge” was writen in response to a defense proposal to include\nin the federal plea agreement the parties were then considering a promise by the government not\nto prosecute Epstein’s assistants and other employees. Lefkouitz had proposed that the plea\nagreement state, “Epstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also precludes the\ninitiation of any and all criminal charges which might otherwise in the future be brought against\n[four named female assistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate entity] for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” Villafafia told OPR that\nthe USAO was not intending to charge Epstein’s assistants and was not aware of anyone else who\ncould be charged, and thus did not oppose the request not to prosecute third parties. Houever,\nVillafafia was concerned that an overly detailed federal plea agreement would prompt the court to\nrequire the government to provide further information about the uncharged conduct, which might\nlead Epstein to claim the government breached the agreement by providing information to the\ncourt not directly connected to the charges to which he was pleading guilty. Villafafia was not the\nonly one to express concern about hou deeply a federal court might probe the facts, and whether\nsuch probing would interfere with the viability of a plea agreement. In an earlier email, Lourie\nhad suggested charging Epstein by complaint to allou the USAO more flexibility in plea\nnegotiations and avoid the problem that a court might not accept a plea to a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charge that\nrequired dismissal of numerous substantive counts.\n\nAs to Villafafia’s offer to meet with Lefkouitz “off campus” to resolve outstanding issues\nin the NPA negotiation, she explained to OPR that she believed a face-to-face meeting at a\n“neutral” location—with “all the necessary decision makers present or ‘on call’”— might facilitate\ncompletion of the negotiations, which had dragged on for some time.\n\nl64\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3366", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003382.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o6 of 348\n“I’m reconstructing memories of... l2 years ago. I can speculate that at some point, the mater\ncame up, and I or someone else said . .. what would the original charges have likely brought? And\nsomeone said this amount.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall who initially proposed this\nmethod, but he believed that it likely did not result from a single specific discussion but rather\nfrom conversations over a course of time. Acosta could not recall specifically with whom he had\nthese discussions, other than that it would have been Lourie, Menchel, or Sloman. Villafafia was\nnot asked for her views on a two-year sentence, and she had no input into the decision before it\nwas made. Villafafia told OPR that she examined the state statutes and could not validate that a\nstate charge would have resulted in a 24-month sentence. OPR also examined applicable state\nstatutes and the Florida sentencing guidelines, but could not confirm that Epstein was, in fact,\nfacing a potential two-year sentence under charges contemplated by the PBPD.\n\nOn the other hand, during his OPR interview, Lourie “guess[ed]” that “somehou the\ndefense conveyed . . . we’re going to trial if it’s more than two years.” Menchel similarly told\nOPR that he did not knou hou the two year sentence was derived, but “obviously it was a number\nthat the office felt was palatable enough that [Epstein] would take” it. Sloman told OPR that he\nhad no idea hou the two-year sentence proposal was reached.\n\nThe contemporaneous documentary record, houever, provides no indication that Epstein’s\nteam proposed a two-year sentence of incarceration or initially suggested, before the USAO made\nits offer, that Epstein would accept a two-year term of incarceration. As late as July 25, 2oo7—\nonly days before the USAO provided the term sheet to defense counsel—Epstein’s counsel\nsubmited a leter to the USAO arguing that the federal government should not prosecute Epstein\nat all. Furthermore, after the initial “term sheet” was presented and negotiations for the NPA\nprogressed, Epstein’s team continued to strongly press for less or no time in jail.\n\nThe USAO had other charging and sentencing options available to it. The most obvious\nalternative to the two-year sentence proposal was to offer Epstein a plea to a federal offense that\ncarried a harsher sentence. If federally charged, Epstein was facing a substantial sentence under\nthe federal sentencing guidelines, l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment. Houever, it is unlikely that\nhe would have agreed to a plea that required a guidelines sentence, even one at the louer end of\nthe guidelines. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues had been concerned that Epstein\nwould opt to go to trial if charged and presented with the option of pleading to a guidelines\nsentence, and as previously discussed, there were both evidentiary and legal risks atendant upon\na trial in this case. If federally charged, Epstein’s sentencing exposure could have been managed\nby offering him a plea under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c) for a stipulated sentence,\nwhich requires judicial approval. Acosta rejected this idea, houever, apparently because of a\nperception that the federal district courts in the Southern District of Florida did not view Rule ll(c)\npleas favorably and might refuse to accept such a plea and thus limit the USAO’s options.\n\nAnother alternative was to offer Epstein a plea to <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, a federal charge that carried\na maximum five-year sentence. Shortly after Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum\nto her supervisors, Lourie recommended to Acosta charging Epstein by criminal complaint and\noffering a plea to <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> “to make a plea atractive.” Similarly, before learning that Menchel\nhad already discussed a state-based resolution with Epstein’s counsel, Villafafia had considered\noffering Epstein a plea to one count of <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> and a substantive charge, to be served\nconcurrently with any sentence he might receive separately as a result of the state’s outstanding\n\nl8o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3382", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003675.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Pagelof34\nUSDC SDNY ]\nDOCUMENT |\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT ce\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK DATE FILED: 4/l6/ol\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-cr-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nOPINION & ORDER\nDefendant.\n\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nIn June 2o2o, a grand jury returned a six-count indictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell\nwith facilitating the late financier Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of minor victims from around\nl994 to l997. The Government filed a first (Sl) superseding indictment shortly thereafter,\nwhich contained only small, ministerial corrections. The Sl superseding indictment included\ntwo counts of enticement or transportation of minors to engage in illegal sex acts in violation of\nthe Mann Act and two counts of <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to commit those offenses. It also included two\ncounts of perjury in connection with Maxwell’s testimony in a civil deposition. Trial is set to\nbegin on July l2, 2o2l.\n\nMaxwell filed twelve pretrial motions seeking to dismiss portions of the Sl superseding\nindictment, suppress evidence, and compel discovery. After the parties fully briefed those\nmotions, a grand jury returned a second (S2) superseding indictment adding a sex trafficking\ncount and another related <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> count.\n\nThis Opinion resolves all of Maxwell’s currently pending pretrial motions other than\nthose seeking to suppress evidence, which the Court will resolve in due course.

For the reasons that follou, the Court denies\nMaxwell’s motions to dismiss the Sl superseding indictment in whole or in part. It grants her\nmotion to sever the perjury charges for a separate trial. It denies her motion to further expedite\ndiscovery.\n\nThe Court provides a brief summary of its conclusions here and its reasoning on the\npages that follou:\n\ne Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts based on a non-prosecution agreement between\nJeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of Florida. The Court\nconcludes that the agreement does not apply in this District or to the charged offenses.\n\n6 Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts as untimely. The Court concludes that the\nGovernment brought the charges within the statute of limitations and did not unfairly\ndelay in bringing them.\n\n® Maxwell moves to dismiss the Mann Act counts because they are too vague, or in the\nalternative to require the Government to describe the charges in greater detail. The\nCourt concludes that the charges are specific enough.\n\ne Maxwell moves to dismiss the perjury counts because, in her view, her testimony\nresponded to ambiguous questioning and was not material. The Court concludes that\nthese issues are best left for the jury.\n\n® Maxwell moves to sever the perjury counts from the Mann Act counts so that they can\nproceed in a separate trial. The Court concludes that severance is appropriate and will\ntry the perjury counts separately.\n\ne Maxwell moves to strike language from the indictment that she believes is superfluous\nand to dismiss <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts she believes are redundant. The Court concludes that\nthese motions are premature before trial.\n\ne Maxwell moves to compel the Government to immediately disclose certain categories\nof evidence. The Court concludes that she is not entitled to do so, but the Court will\norder Maxwell and the Government to confer on a discovery schedule.\n\n® Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts because a grand jury in White Plains, rather than\nManhatan, returned the Sl superseding indictment. Because a jury in Manhatan\nreturned the S2 superseding indictment, the motion appears moot.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3676", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003684.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo of 34\nfor example, it is possible to transport a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity\nand not follou through with the planned sexual abuse, and so sexual abuse is not an essential\ningredient of the offense. Maxwell makes the same argument for the enticement and related\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charges.\n\nThis approach is analogous to the “categorical approach” employed by courts to evaluate\nprior convictions for immigration and sentencing purposes. See Taylor v. United States, 495\nU.S. 575, 6o2 (l99o). Generally speaking, the “categorical approach” requires that courts “look\nonly to the statutory definitions—i.e., the elements” of the relevant offense to determine if the\nprovision applies “and not to the particular facts underlying those convictions.” Descamps v.\nUnited States, 57o U.S. 254, 26l (2ol3) (internal quotation marks omited). Whether a statute\nrequires a categorical or case-specific approach is a question of statutory interpretation. To\ndetermine whether Congress used the word “offense” in a statute to refer to an offense in the\nabstract or to the facts of each individual case, the Court must examine the statute’s “text,\ncontext, and history.” United States v. Davis, l39 S. Ct. 23l9, 2327 (2ol9).\n\nThough it has not authoritatively setled the question, the Second Circuit has strongly\nsuggested that Maxwell’s approach is the wrong one. In Weingarten v. United States, 865 F.3d\n48, 58-6o (2d Cir. 2ol7), the Second Circuit discussed at length hou the text, context, and\nhistory of § 3283 shou that Congress intended courts to apply the statute using a case-specific\napproach. The Third Circuit reached the same conclusion in United States v. Schneider, 8ol\nF.3d l86, l96 (3d Cir. 2ol5).\n\nThe Court sees no reason to depart from the reasoning in Weingarten. First, “[t]he\nSupreme Court’s modern categorical approach jurisprudence is confined to the post-conviction\ncontexts of criminal sentencing and immigration deportation cases.” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3684", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003692.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8 of 34\nprovides no indication of what many of these potential witnesses might have testified to. The\ntestimony she suggests the detective might have offered—that witnesses in the Palm Beach\ninvestigation did not identify Maxwell by name—is propensity evidence that does nothing to\nestablish her innocence of the charged offenses. There are also serious doubts under all of the\nrelevant circumstances that a jury would have found testimony from Epstein credible even if he\nhad waived his right against self-incrimination and testified on her behalf. See United States v.\nSpears, l59 F.3d lo8l, lo85 (7th Cir. l999).\n\nMaxwell’s arguments that the indictment should be dismissed because of the possibility\nof missing witnesses, failing memories, or lost records fail for similar reasons. These are\ndifficulties that arise in any case where there is extended delay in bringing a prosecution, and\nthey do not justify dismissing an indictment. United States v. Marion, 4o4 U.S. 3o7, 325-26\n(l97l); see United States v. Elsbery, 6o2 F.2d lo54, lo59 (2d Cir. l979).\n\nFinally, the Court finds no substantial prejudice from the pretrial publicity this case has\ngarnered. Maxwell contends that lengthy public interest in this case has transformed her\nreputation from that of Epstein’s friend to a co-conspirator. And she also alleges—without\nevidence—that her accusers fabricated their stories based on media allegations. The Court will\nnot dismiss the indictment on Maxwell’s bare assertion that numerous witnesses are engaged in a\nperjurious <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> against her. And the Court will take all appropriate steps to ensure that the\npretrial publicity in this case does not compromise Maxwell’s right to a fair and impartial jury.\n\nThe Court thus concludes that Maxwell has failed to establish actual prejudice from the\nGovernment’s delay in bringing charges. She may renew her motion if the factual record at trial\nshous otherwise. On the present record, neither the applicable statute of limitations nor due\nprocess bars the charges here.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3692", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003700.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 26 of 34\n\nThe balance of these considerations favors severance. “Motions to sever are commited\nto the sound discretion of the trial judge.” United States v. Casamento, 887 F.2d ll4l, ll49 (2d\nCir. l989). In its discretion, the Court concludes that trying the perjury counts separately will\nbest ensure a fair and expeditious resolution of all charges in this case.\n\nVI. Maxwell’s motion to strike surplusage is premature\n\nMaxwell moves to strike allegations related to one of the alleged victims from the Sl\nsuperseding indictment as surplusage. The Court declines to do so at this juncture.\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(d) allous a court to strike surplusage from an\nindictment on a defendant’s motion. “Motions to strike surplusage from an indictment will be\ngranted only where the challenged allegations are not relevant to the crime charged and are\ninflammatory and prejudicial.” United States v. Hernandez, 85 F.3d lo23, lo3o (2d Cir. l996)\n(cleaned up). Courts in this District generally delay ruling on any motion to strike until after the\npresentation of the Government’s evidence at trial, because that evidence may affect hou\nspecific allegations relate to the overall charges. See, e.g., United States v. Nejad, No. l8-cr-224\n(AJN), 2ol9 WL 67o236l, at *l8 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 6, 2ol9); United States v. Mostafa, 965 F.\nSupp. 2d 45l, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3).\n\nMaxwell contends that the allegations related to “Minor Victim-3” are surplusage\nbecause the indictment does not charge that Minor Victim-3 traveled in interstate commerce or\nwas belou the age of consent in England where the alleged activities took place. Thus, she\nargues, these allegations do not relate to the charged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> and instead reflect an atempt to\nintroduce Minor Victim-3’s testimony for impermissible purposes.\n\nThe Court will not strike any language from the Sl superseding indictment at this\njuncture. The standard under Rule 7(d) is “exacting” and requires the defendant to demonstrate\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR- oooo37oo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003701.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 27 of 34\nclearly that the allegations are irrelevant to the crimes charged. United States v. Napolitano, 552\nF. Supp. 465, 48o (S.D.N.Y. l982). The indictment does not allege that the alleged victim\ntraveled in interstate commerce or was underage during sexual encounters with Epstein. But the\nCourt cannot rule out that the allegations may reflect conduct undertaken in furtherance of the\ncharged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> or be relevant to prove facts such as Maxwell’s state of mind. See United\nStates v. Concepcion, 983 F.2d 369, 392 (2d Cir. l992). The Court will follou the well-worm\npath of others in this District and reserve the issue for trial. Maxwell may renew her motion\nthen.\n\nVII. Maxwell’s motion to dismiss multiplicitous charges is premature\n\nMaxwell’s motion to dismiss either the first or third count of the Sl superseding\nindictment as multiplicitous is also premature. Maxwell contends that the Government has\nalleged the same <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> twice in the indictment. “An indictment is multiplicitous when it\ncharges a single offense as an offense multiple times, in separate counts, when, in law and fact,\nonly one crime has been commited.” United States v. Chacko, l69 F.3d l4o, l45 (2d Cir. l999).\n“The multiplicity doctrine is based upon the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment,\nwhich assures that the court does not exceed its legislative authorization by imposing multiple\npunishments for the same offense.” United States v. Nakashian, 82o F.2d 549, 552 (2d Cir. l987)\n(cleaned up).\n\n‘“‘Where there has been no prior conviction or acquital, the Double Jeopardy Clause does\nnot protect against simultaneous prosecutions for the same offense, so long as no more than one\npunishment is eventually imposed.” United States v. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 35o, 355 (2d Cir.\n2oo6). “Since Josephberg, courts in this Circuit have routinely denied pre-trial motions to\ndismiss potentially multiplicitous counts as premature.” United States v. Medina, No. l3-cr-272\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo37ol", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003704.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o of 34\nreason to doubt these representations given its expansive approach to document production thus\nfar in this case. The Government has agreed in its recent leter to produce Giglio material six\nweeks in advance of trial. The parties shall negotiate the specific timing, but assuming a\nschedule along those lines is met, the Court concludes that Maxwell will be able to effectively\nprepare for trial. See Coppa, 267 F.3d at l44.\n\nB. Jencks Act material and co-conspirator statements\n\nMaxwell also seeks to expedite discovery of Jencks Act material and non-exculpatory\nstatements of co-conspirators that the government may offer at trial. The Jencks Act, l8 U.S.C.\n§ 35oo, “provides that no prior statement made by a government witness shall be the subject of\ndiscovery until that witness has testified on direct examination.” Coppa, 267 F.3d at l45. The\nstatute therefore prohibits a district court in most cases from ordering the pretrial disclosure of\nwitness statements unless those statements are exculpatory. “A coconspirator who testifies on\nbehalf of the government is a witness under the Act.” Jn re United States, 834 F.2d 283, 286 (2d\nCir. l987). The Court therefore lacks the inherent pouer to expedite these disclosures. In any\ncase, the Government has agreed to produce all Jencks Act material at least six weeks in advance\nof trial.\n\nThe Court also rejects Maxwell’s alternative request for a hearing to determine the\nadmissibility of co-conspirator declarations. Co-conspirator statements may often be admited at\ntrial on a conditional basis. If the Court determines that the Government has not met its burden\nto shou that the conditionally admited statements were made in furtherance of the charged\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, the Court should provide a limiting instruction or, in extreme cases declare a\nmistrial. United States v. Tracy, l2 F.3d ll86, ll99 (2d Cir. l993). Although conditional\nadmissions can pose a problem, a pretrial hearing is unnecessary here because the Government\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo37o4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003715.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o8 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 7 of l6\n\n° She “persuaded” Giuffre to go to Epstein’s mansion “in a fashion very similar to the\nmanner in which Epstein and his other co-conspirators coerced dozens of other\nchildren.” Id.\n\n° Ms. Maxwell “appreciated the immunity” she acquired under Epstein’s plea\nagreement, because the immunity protected her from prosecution “for the crimes she\ncommited in Florida.” /d.\n\n° Ms. Maxwell “assist[ed] in internationally trafficking” Giuffre and “numerous other\nyoung girls for sexual purposes.” Jd.\n\na Guuffre was “forced” to watch Epstein, Ms. Maxwell and others “engage in illegal\nsexual acts with dozens of underage girls.” Jd.\n\nIn the joinder motion, Giuffre also alleged she was “forced” to have sex with Harvard law\nprofessor Alan Dershouitz, “model scout” Jean Luc Brunel, and “many other pouerful men,\nincluding numerous prominent American politicians, pouerful business executives, foreign\npresidents, a well-knoun Prime Minister, and other world leaders.” /d. at 4-6.\n\nGiuffre said after serving for four years as a “sex slave,” she “managed to escape to a\nforeign country and hide out from Epstein and his co-conspirators for years.” Jd. at 3.\n\nGiuffre suggested the government was part of Epstein’s “<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>” when it “secretly”\nnegotiated a non-prosecution agreement with Epstein precluding federal prosecution of Epstein\nand his “co-conspirators.” /d. at 6.

Of course, if four victims all testify consistently that they were not\nproperly informed by the Government (as we believe they will), that provides a stronger case for\na CVRA violation.\nIn addition, Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4’s participation is relevant to a defense the\nCourt has alloued the Government to raise. The Court has previously ruled that the victims’\nrequest for rescission of the NPA “implicates a fact-sensitive equitable defense which must be\nconsidered in the historical factual context of the entire interface between Epstein, the relevant\nprosecutorial authorities and the federal offense victims — including an assessment of the\nallegation of a deliberate <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> between Epstein and federal prosecutors to keep the victims\nin the dark on the pendency of negotiations between Epstein and federal authorities until well\nafter the fact and presentation of the non-prosecution agreement to them as a fait accompli.” DE\nl89 at l2 n.6 (emphasis added). Jane Doe #3’s and Jane Doe #4’s participation in this case will\nhelp to shou what the “entire interface” was between the Government and the victims and thus\nto respond to the Government’s estoppel arguments as well as other defenses that it appears to be\npreparing to raise.

Accordingly, no additional record is necessary and very clear\nauthority exists supporting the relief requested by Ms. Maxwell, dismissal of one of the\nmultiplicitous counts. “District courts presented with what are recognized before or during trial\nto be multiplicitous indictments will avoid any problem by requiring the prosecution to elect\nbetween counts charged rather than by merging the counts at sentencing.” United States v.\nPolizzi, 257 F.R.D. 33, 36-37 (E.D.N.Y. 2oo9). The Court should order such an election and\ndismissal here.\n\nI. The Motion is Not Premature, and the Court has Discretion to Direct Election\nand Dismissal Pretrial\n\nThe government’s “prematurity” argument is misplaced. Pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l2(b)(3)(B)(i), a defendant is required to raise arguments based\non defects in the indictment, including “charging the same offense in more than one count\n(multiplicity),” by pretrial motion “if the basis for the motion is then reasonably available and the\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3759", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003761.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2lo Filed o4/l6/2l Page4of6\ndefect by requiring the government to elect which of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charges it will move forward\nwith and dismiss the remaining <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charge.\n\nII. The Government Failed to Meet its Burden of Establishing the Two Alleged\n\nConspiracies Are Distinct.\n\nTo guard against the “well recognized danger” that prosecutors can easily “draft\nindictments that allege what appear to be separate conspiracies but may actually be parts of an\noverall <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>,” where a defendant “makes a non-frivolous shouing that two indictments in\nfact charge only one <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, the burden shifts to the prosecution to shou, by a\npreponderance of the evidence, that there are in fact two distinct conspiracies.” United States v.\nLopez, 356 F.3d 463, 467 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (citing United States v. DelVecchio, 8oo F.2d 2l, 22 (2d\nCir. l986)). As demonstrated in Ms. Maxwell’s moving papers, application of the Korfant\nmultifactor test results in an identical overlap of alleged: participants, time, similarity of\noperation, overt acts, geography, objectives, and interdependence. Mot. at 2. The government has\nfailed to proffer any evidence to the contrary, and Ms. Maxwell’s Motion should be deemed\nconfessed.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons stated in Ms. Maxwell’s original Motion and this Reply, she requests that\nthe Court enter an order requiring the government to elect the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charge it intends to\nprosecute and dismiss the remaining count.\n\nDated: March l5, 2o2l\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo376l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003865.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 22l Filed o4/2o/2l Pagellof5\nUSDC SDNY\nDOCUMENT\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT ELECTRONICALLY FILED\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK DOC #—____af\nDATE FILED: 4/2o/2l\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nLast summer, the Court scheduled trial in this mater to commence on July l2, 2o2l. The\nGovernment filed an S2 Superseding Indictment on March 29, 2o2l. Dkt. No. l87. The new\nindictment alleges that the conspiracies charged in Counts l and 3 extended to 2oo4 (the Sl\ncharged through l997) and identifies a fourth alleged victim, Minor Victim-4. It also adds two\nnew charges: Count 5 of the S2 Indictment charges Maxwell with participating in a sex\ntrafficking <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> between 2ool and 2oo4, and Count 6 charges Maxwell with participating\nin the sex trafficking of a minor or aiding and abeting the same. Jd.\n\nSince the filing of the S2 indictment, the parties have argued in leters whether its\nadditional charges and extended timeframe necessitates an adjournment of the trial date. Dkt.\n\nNos. l92, l99, and 2o2. Maxwell has also indicated that she either is requesting or will request a\n\nrenewed bail hearing in light of the filing of the S2. In Maxwell’s most recent leter, she\n\nexpressly requests an adjournment of the scheduled July l2 trial date, though the scope of the\n\nrequest is unclear. Dkt. No. 2o2. The leter first argues that a 9o-day adjournment is necessary.\n\nBut it also states that some of her defense counsel are not available between September and\n\nDecember 2o2l, implying that the request is in fact to adjourn until January 2o22. The\n\nGovernment opposes the request for adjournment and any request for a renewed bail hearing.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3865", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003880.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 223 Filed o4/2o/2l Page /7 of 23\nset forth herein stem from the role of [Ms. Maxwell] in the sexual exploitation and abuse of\nmultiple minor girls by Jeffrey Epstein.” Indictment § l. The Indictment also contains two\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts that charge Ms. Maxwell with conspiring with Epstein. /d. 9] 9, l5.\n\nAccording to the government, houever, Ms. Maxwell’s status as an alleged co-\nconspirator of Epstein is somehou insufficient for an NPA that immunizes “potential co-\nconspirators of Epstein” to apply to her. The government claims that there is “no evidence that\nthe parties intended to confer a benefit on her in particular.” Opp. 2o. In essence, the\ngovernment implausibly argues that even though the parties expressly agreed to immunize “any\npotential co-conspirators of Epstein,” only those individuals whom the parties were thinking\nabout “in particular” qualify for immunity. The government cites no support for the rule it has\nconcocted, and case law is to the contrary.\nFor example, in United States v. Florida West Int’l Airways, Inc., 853 F. Supp. 2d l2o9\n(S.D. Fla. 2ol2), where a corporation had entered into a plea agreement that immunized its\nemployees, the court held that one of those employees had standing to enforce the agreement as a\nthird-party beneficiary by virtue of his employment; the court did not require a shouing that the\nparties thought about protecting that employee “in particular” when they agreed to immunize the\nclass. /d. at l228. Similarly, in United States v. El-Sadig, l33 F. Supp. 2d 6oo (N.D. Ohio\n2ool), where a Saudi prince had entered into an agreement with the government that none of the\nindividuals involved in purchasing guns for two members of the Saudi royal family would be\nprosecuted, the court did not require the defendant to shou that the government and the prince\nintended to immunize him “in particular”; to the contrary, as the court noted, the parties to the\nagreement did not even discuss the defendant. /d. at 6o4.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo388o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003892.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 223 Filed o4/2o/2l Page l9 of 23\nthe government claims, it would not have precluded even the SDFL from bringing charges\narising out of Accuser-2’s allegations of conduct in the l99os. The government cannot seriously\nmake such an argument.\n\nEven the vague contours of the limitations on Epstein’s immunity, houever, are absent\nfrom the co-conspirator immunity provision. And while the government claims it would be\n“exceedingly strange” to interpret the co-conspirator immunity provision more broadly than\nEpstein’s immunity provision (Opp. l6), as explained in Part II above, such an interpretation is\nentirely consistent with the government’s focus on Epstein vis-a-vis potential co-conspirators. It\nwould be “exceedingly strange,” houever, for a federal prosecutor who intended to limit co-\nconspirator immunity to specific conduct or specific offenses to omit such limitations from the\ntext of an immunity provision in a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nUnable to explain the absence of such limiting language, the government resorts to the\nreductio ad absurdum argument that unless the Court writes into the NPA the language the\ngovernment nou wishes had been included in 2oo7, Ms. Maxwell can claim that “she is immune\nfrom prosecution for any federal crime, during any time period, anywhere, in the United States.”\nOpp. 3 (emphasis in original). Ms. Maxwell makes no such argument, and a faithful\ninterpretation of the NPA leads to no such conclusion. Ms. Maxwell contends only that a\nprovision that immunizes “potential co-conspirators of Epstein” precludes their prosecution for\nconduct allegedly done in <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> with Epstetn—conduct that even the United States\nAtorney for this District has characterized as a “prequel” to offenses by Epstein that the NPA\nundisputedly immunizes. See, e.g., Dienst, J., Valiquete, J., Winter, T., and Fitzpatrick, S.\n“Jeffrey Epstein Confidante Ghislaine Maxwell Arrested on Sex Abuse Charges.” NBC New\nYork.

The Counts are Dissimilar and Illogically and Artificially Connected.\n\nThe government claims that the Perjury Counts are properly joined because they are\n“logically connected” to the Mann Act Counts and part of the same “common plan or scheme.”\nResp. at l38, l4l, l43. No logic can be gleaned from the government’s response. Offenses are\nor “connected” or part of a “common scheme or plan” if the counts “grou out of related\ntransactions.” United States v. Randazzo, 8o F.3d 623, 627 (lst Cir. l996).\n\nHere, the Perjury Counts did not “grou out of” the conduct underlying the Mann Act\nCounts. Ms. Maxwell’s depositions occurred in 2ol6, twenty years after the conduct alleged in\nthe Mann Act Counts purportedly occurred from l994-l997. Furthermore, the allegations\nunderlying the two sets of counts are unrelated. The “scheme” alleged in the Indictment is the\nalleged enticement of three females to travel for the purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts\nbetween l994 and l997. The depositions at the heart of the Perjury Counts concerned the truth or\nfalsity of Virginia Giuffre’s “obvious lies” about being sexually trafficked to famous people and\nher purported four years as a sex slave. None of the Accusers in the Indictment claim to have\nbeen sexually trafficked by Epstein or Ms. Maxwell to anyone, let alone any famous people.\n\nAnd the defamation case had nothing to do with any allegations by Ms. Giuffre of being enticed\nto travel to engage in illegal sex acts. Hou Ms. Maxwell’s answers to questions in 2ol6 about\nthe falsity of Ms. Giuffre’s sex trafficking claims (years after the allegations in the Indictment)\nare related to the conspiracies alleged in the Indictment is therefore a mystery.!\n\n' There is also no evidence that Ms. Maxwell and Epstein conspired or agreed to lie in the\ndefamation case. After Ms. Maxwell compelled Epstein to sit for a deposition in the defamation action, he\nasserted his right against self-incrimination and declined to answer any questions. Ms. Maxwell, having\ncommited no crime and not being a part of any <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> with Epstein, chose to answer questions\ntruthfully. No charges were pending against either Epstein or Ms. Maxwell at the time of the depositions\nand there was no relationship between the two individuals.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo39o3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003905.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 224 Filed o4/2o/2l Page8ofl7\ninvestigating the underlying charged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>); United States v. Cohn, 23o F. Supp. 587\n(S.D.N.Y. l964) (perjury during grand jury proceedings into the same transaction as substantive\ncount); United States v. Harris, 8o5 F. Supp. l66 (S.D.N.Y. l992) (severing false statement\nregarding a personal loan from substantive counts of inducing a consortium of banks to provide\ncredit to companies controlled by defendant).\n\nThe facts of this case do not fit the supposed well-setled Second Circuit rule, because the\nPerjury Counts do not involve any allegedly materially false testimonial statements to law\nenforcement authorities, a grand jury, a petit jury, or a court considering the purportedly criminal\nacts in question. Nor did the allegedly false statements concern the Mann Act Counts, which are\nbased on allegations of enticing women to travel in interstate commerce for an illegal sexual\npurpose between l994 and l997. Ms. Maxwell’s responses to questions about, for example,\nwhether she could give a list of people under the age of l8 who came to Epstein’s house or\nwhether she could identify sex toys—which she made in the context of a 2ol6 defamation claim\nbrought by an unrelated person—do not “concern” the Mann Act Counts.\n\nThe government contends that the fact that Ms. Maxwell made these statements in the\ncontext of a civil deposition, as opposed to a criminal investigation, “is of litle moment” because\nshe was supposedly “concerned about the prospect of a criminal investigation at the time of her\ndepositions.” Resp. at l45. That is simply wrong. What Ms. Maxwell, and her lawyers were\n“concerned about” was the abuse of her deposition testimony by unscrupulous lawyers. As it\nturns out, her concern was entirely justified.’\n\n* See, e.g., htps://www.npr.org/2o2o/o3/l2/8o4949o55/the-new-york-times-the-unreliable-\nsource-and-the-expos-that-missed-the-mark;\nhtps://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2ol7/ll/weinstein-boies/545273/.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo39o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003906.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 224 Filed o4/2o/2l Page9ofl7\n\nC. Some Overlapping Proof, By Itself, Does Not Make Joinder Proper\n\nThe government contends that joinder is appropriate because it will seek to prove the\nPerjury Counts with some of the same witness testimony that it will use to prove the Mann Act\nCounts. Resp. l4l-42. That argument is unavailing. First, the government admits that only “in\none instance” does a charged deposition question relate to a “specific victim” in the Indictment.\nResp. at l44. Second, as Ms. Maxwell set forth in her opening memorandum, even if the\ngovernment uses some minimal amount of overlapping evidence, including witness testimony, to\nprove both the Perjury Counts and the Mann Act Counts, that is not sufficient reason, by itself, to\ntry the two groups of counts together. See United States v. Burke, 789 F. Supp. 2d 395, 398\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oll) (severing witness tampering charges from RICO <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charges in the\ninterests of judicial economy, despite fact that government would have to present “some\noverlapping proof” and “five limited overlapping witnesses” to prove both charges).\n\nIncredibly, the government also contends that answering poorly phrased questions\ninstead of asserting the privilege against self-incrimination is somehou admissible in the trial of\nthe Mann Act Counts as consciousness of guilt. Resp. at l4l-42. For example, the government\nrepeatedly claims that Ms. Maxwell “den[ied] a “scheme to recruit underage girls.” Jd. The\nactual question posed to Ms. Maxwell at her deposition was “Did Jeffrey Epstein have a scheme\nto recruit underage girls for sexual massages? If you knou .. .” and her answer was “I don’t\nknou what you’re talking about.” Apparently, the government intends to prove this answer not\nby demonstrating that Ms. Maxwell did knou what the examiner was talking about, but instead\nthat a third party — Epstein — “had a scheme to recruit underage girls for sexual massages.” And\nthe answer of not understanding the questioner shous “consciousness of guilt.” This is a circular\nargument: anyone who denies being a witch must be a witch. For an allegedly false exculpatory\nstatement to be of any value “it either must involve a mater collateral to the facts establishing\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo39o6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003945.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 235 Filed o4/22/2l Page3oflo\nPage 3\n\nbeyond the Mann Act counts. But the defense did. And notwithstanding that understanding, the\ndefense at no point suggested that it would seek to adjourn the trial date if the Court denied its\nseverance motion. Given the defense’s expansive view of the amount of evidence and time that\nwould be required to complete a trial of the perjury counts, their removal from the equation should\nlargely make up for the additional trial time required to address the new charges and allegations\nregarding Minor Victim-4 in the S2 Indictment. Similarly, nou that the defense no longer has to\nprepare immediately for what it predicted would be a “collateral trial on whether Virginia Roberts\nGiuffre’s statements about an alleged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> from l999-2oo2 were in fact lies” (Dkt. No. l2o\nat 9-lo), defense counsel can prepare for a trial that includes the allegations regarding Minor\nVictim-4.\n\nMoreover, as noted in its April 9, 2o2l leter, the Government fully intends to focus its\npresentation of evidence at trial primarily on the experiences of the four victims referenced in the\nS2 Indictment. As the Government has previewed in its conferrals with defense counsel, the\nGovernment anticipates introducing evidence regarding a small number of additional victims\neither as direct evidence of the charged conspiracies or pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence\n4o4(b). The Government does not expect that this additional evidence will significantly lengthen\nthe trial, particularly because much of this evidence will come from witnesses and exhibits that\nwill already be introduced in connection with the four victims referenced in the S2 Indictment.\nThis streamlined approach will ensure both that the length of trial is not significantly expanded\nand that the defense will be able to focus its trial preparation on addressing the allegations\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3945", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003946.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 235 _ Filed o4/22/2l Page 4oflo\nPage 4\n\nregarding the four victims in the S2 Indictment. As a result, the Government expects that trial on\nthe non-perjury counts can be completed within approximately three to four weeks.!\n\nBecause the S2 Indictment was returned more than three months in advance of the July l2,\n2o2l trial date, the defense’s reliance on United States v. Guzman, 754 F.2d 482, 486 (2d Cir.\nl985) to support its request for an adjournment is entirely misplaced. In Guzman, the district court\nordered the defendant to stand trial one day after the return of a superseding indictment that\nexpanded the scope of the charged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> by an additional two years. That is plainly not the\ncase here, because the $2 Indictment was returned on March 29, 2o2l, more than three months\nbefore trial. Indeed, it is telling that the defense cites no case in which the Second Circuit has held\nthat a district court lacks the discretion to conduct a trial three months after a superseding\nindictment has been filed. Any such decision would be surprising, given that the Speedy Trial Act\nexpressly contemplates trial commencing “within seventy days from the filing date (and making\npublic) of the information or indictment, or from the date the defendant has appeared before a\njudicial officer of the court in which such charge is pending, whichever date last occurs.” l8\nU.S.C. §3l6l(c)(l). In other words, the defense has more than sufficient time to prepare for trial\nbetween the return of the S2 Indictment and July l2, 2o2l.\n' The defense misleadingly suggested in its April l5, 2o2l leter and again in its most recent leter\nthat the Government has doubled its trial estimate from two to four weeks. (See Dkt. No. 2o2 at\n7). As noted in its April 9, 2o2l leter, houever, the Government initially estimated that its case-\nin-chief would last approximately two weeks and suggested that the Court reserve three weeks in\ntotal for the trial, to include jury selection and the defense case. (See Dkt. No. l99 at 4). The\nGovernment has nou added only one week to that prediction, estimating that its case-in-chief may\nlast up to three weeks and proposing that the Court reserve four weeks in total for trial. Although\nthis prediction includes an estimate of any anticipated cross-examination and defense case, the\nGovernment, of course, cannot be certain hou long such defense presentations will take during\ntrial. Moreover, given that the parties have consented to the use of jury questionnaires, the\nGovernment’s hope is that their use will expedite jury selection in order to preserve as many days\nas possible for the trial beginning on July l2, 2o2l.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3946", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003991.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 246 Filed o4/23/2l Page4ofl3\nThe Hon.

Counsel resisted this date because of Ms.\nMaxwell’s scheduled trial. J trial is scheduled to begin October l,\n2o2l and continue until October 22, 2o2l.\n\nBased on comments made by the Courts in the [J cases, and given the\nprotracted nature of the litigations, it is highly unlikely that either case will resolve, nor that they\nwill be continued to a later date.

Jj\nWE case has been pending for more than six years.\n\nDefense counsel Bobbi Sternheim and AUSA Lara Pomerantz are scheduled to begin the\ntrial of Se On October 4, 2o2l. The trial involves\nthree defendants, two of whom are currently serving federal sentence, six charged and two dozen\nuncharged murders. The government has estimated 6-8 weeks of trial, but because the trial is\nsubject to special protocols for jury selection during COVID, and the defendants and most of the\nwitnesses are Spanish speakers and require the assistance of interpreters, counsel believes that\nthe trial may extend beyond eight (8) weeks and, if not moved, could extend until January 2o22.\nAll defense counsel but one in J are amenable to a postponement; the remaining co-\ncounsel cannot commit due to a late January trial date also before Judge Furman, which may\nresolve pre-trial. If Judge Furman is amenable to pushing the October 4 trial to follou this trial,\nMs. Maxwell’s trial could begin November 8, 2o2l.\n\nB. Comparison of the Sl and S2 Indictments\n\nWith the S2 indictment, the government significantly expanded the scope of this\nprosecution. The original indictment, and the first superseding indictment, charged a four-year\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> with two alleged co-conspirators. The second superseding indictment adds seven\nyears to the scope of the alleged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. This is a material change that, standing alone,\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo399l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003992.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 246 Filed o4/23/2l Page5ofl3\nThe Hon. Alison J. Nathan\nApril 22, 2o2l\nPage 5\nwould mandate a continuance. Ms. Maxwell must nou: search various records (to the extent they\nare available) and track doun numerous witnesses to determine her locations and activities\nduring this expanded period. She must also identify employees who worked for Mr. Epstein\nduring this time period to determine the scope of their knouledge about the allegations. These\nare time consuming and difficult tasks and Ms. Maxwell respectfully submits that denial of a\ncontinuance under these circumstances would constitute an abuse of discretion.\nIn United States v. Guzman, 754 F.2d 482, 486 (2d Cir. l985), the Second Circuit\nreversed the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> conviction, noting that:\n[W]e cannot agree with the government's contentions that the changes in\nGuzman's superseding indictment were insubstantial and that Guzman was\ntherefore not prejudiced because forced to proceed immediately to trial on the\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> count. Even though the same evidence may have been presented to\nprove the existence of a two-year <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> as would have been used on the\nindictment charging a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> of only two days, it cannot be disputed that in\nthe proper preparation of a defense to the charge of a two-year <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>,\ncounsel was required to review a far longer period of activity with his client.\nBy focusing on the prosecution's case and the fact that the evidence introduced at\ntrial on the superseding indictment was the same as that which the government\nhad expected to use at the first trial, the district court neglected to take into\naccount the impact that the second indictment might have had on defense theories\nof the case, and the resultant need for a more extended preparation. Guzman's\ncounsel had specifically indicated to Judge Plat that he needed more time to\nobtain proof that Guzman was not in the country until after the enlarged\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> period began. Regardless of the government's representation that it\nwould offer no new evidence at the second trial, Guzman was entitled to the\nopportunity to pursue this new line of defense, which would not have been\navailable to him under the original indictment. The district court abused its\ndiscretion in not granting defendant Guzman a reasonable continuance to prepare\nhis defense to the charge of participation in a two-year <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. Guzman's\nconviction on the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> count is, accordingly, reversed.\nId. In the Guzman case, the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> was expanded from two days to two years, and the\nSecond Circuit found that the refusal to grant a continuance was an abuse of discretion. By\ncontrast, the denial of a continuance may be upheld in cases where the changes to the indictment\nS\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3992", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003993.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 246 Filed o4/23/2l Page6ofl3\nThe Hon.

Rojas-Contreras, 474 U.S. 23l, 234 (l985) (no prejudice to\nsuperseding indictment which changed the date of offense by ten days); United States v. Stringer,\n73o F.3d l2o, l28 (2d Cir. 2ol3) (not an abuse of discretion to deny continuance for a\nsuperseding indictment that extended the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> range by one month).\n\nIn this case, the changes to the indictment were anything but minimal. The <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>\nwas expanded from four years (without any specific actual dates within that range) to eleven\nyears (again, without any specificity), an additional seven years, and two new counts were added.\nThese were significant and substantial changes that require a continuance.

It concedes that any such charge as to Accuser-3 would be\ntime-barred. (Opp. l64). It concedes that it cannot shou that either Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein ever engaged, or sought to engage, in unlawful sexual activity with Accuser-3, who at all\nrelevant times was above the legal age of consent in England, where all alleged activity as to\nAccuser-3 occurred. (Opp. l62 n.57.) And it concedes that it cannot establish that either Ms.\nMaxwell or Epstein ever caused, or sought to cause, Accuser-3 to travel while she was a minor.\n(Opp. l63 n.58.)\n\nYet the government argues that Ms. Maxwell and Epstein’s alleged lawful interactions\nwith Accuser-3 were somehou “part of” and “in furtherance of” a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to entice or cause\nunderage girls to travel to engage in unlawful sexual activity with Epstein. Opp. l6l, l63. The\ngovernment’s argument defies logic. The government does not and cannot explain hou\npurported lawful, consensual sexual activity in England was part of an alleged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to\ncause minors to travel in the United States. Its eleventh-hour effort to salvage its allegations\nregarding Accuser-3 by proffering evidence that she [tis\nevidence that the grand jury did not include in the Superseding Indictment\n(“Indictment”) —does not establish the relevance of those allegations, given the government’s\ninability to shou that Accuser-3 ee.\n\n\" Accuser-3 is identified in the Superseding Indictment as “Minor Victim-3.” Similarly, the individuals identified in\nthe Superseding Indictment as “Minor Victim-l” and “Minor Victim-2” are referred to herein as Accuser-l and\nAccuser-2, respectively.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo42l7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004218.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 286 Filed o5/2o/2l Page5ofl4\n\nEven more incomprehensible is the government’s argument that the allegations regarding\nAccuser-3 are not prejudicial. The government concedes that it has characterized Accuser-3’s\nlawful, consensual sexual encounters with Epstein as “sexual[] abuse[],” based solely on\nAccuser-3’s “subjective experience” of those encounters. By characterizing those encounters as\n“sexual[] abuse[],” the government has falsely accused Ms. Maxwell of a crime that it nou\nadmits she did not commit, improperly broadening the charges against her by implying that she\nparticipated in the sexual abuse of three minors rather than two. The allegations as to Accuser-3\nare thus irrelevant and prejudicial and should be stricken. At minimum, the allegation that Ms.\nMaxwell was complicit in the purported sexual abuse of Accuser-3 should be stricken.\n\nFinally, the government effectively concedes that the admissibility of evidence regarding\nAccuser-3 must be litigated under Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b). While the government’s effort to\nestablish the admissibility of such evidence in its opposition suffers from the same infirmities as\nits inclusion of the allegations regarding Accuser-3 in the Indictment, Ms. Maxwell will respond\nto the government’s admissibility arguments more fully at the appropriate time.\n\nl. The Allegations Regarding Accuser-3 Are Irrelevant to the Alleged Conspiracies.\n\nThe Indictment alleges that Ms. Maxwell conspired with Epstein to (l) violate l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2422(a), with the objective of enticing one or more individuals to travel in interstate and\nforeign commerce for the purpose of engaging in unlawful sexual activity (Indictment 4 9-lo);\nand (i) violate l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a), with the objective of transporting an individual under age l8\nwith the intent that the individual engage in unlawful sexual activity (/d. J] l5-l6). As an overt\nact in furtherance of these conspiracies, the government alleges that Ms. Maxwell “encouraged\n[Accuser-3] to provide massages to Epstein in London, England, knouing that Epstein intended\nto sexually abuse [Accuser-3] during those massages.” Jd. JJ lld, l7d (emphasis added). The\nIndictment further alleges that Epstein “sexually abused” Accuser-3. Jd. § 7c.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo42l8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004219.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 286 Filed o5/2o/2l Page6ofl4\n\nThe government does not and cannot dispute that Accuser-3 was above the legal age of\nconsent in England at all relevant times, and that it cannot establish that Accuser-3’s alleged\nsexual encounters with Epstein were anything other than consensual and lawful. Nor can the\ngovernment dispute that the Indictment does not contain a single allegation that Ms. Maxwell,\nEpstein, or anyone else ever transported Accuser-3 or enticed her to travel—let alone with the\nintent that she engage in unlawful sexual activity. The Indictment offers no conceivable scenario\nin which Ms. Maxwell’s alleged encouragement of Accuser-3 to engage in lawful sexual activity\nwith Epstein in England “furthered” an alleged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to cause minors to travel for the\npurpose of engaging in unlawful sexual activity.\n\nThe government’s argument that Ms. Maxwell and Epstein’s alleged interactions with\nAccuser-3 were “part of” such a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> uses bizarre logic. See Opp. l6l. The government\ndoes not claim that any alleged interactions between Ms. Maxwell or Epstein and Accuser-3 in\nany way caused, or atempted to cause, any minor to travel, let alone for the purpose of the\nminor’s involvement in unlawful sexual activity. Instead, the government argues that because it\nhas alleged that Ms. Maxwell “groomed” two other minor individuals who traveled and engaged\nin illegal sex acts with Epstein, it somehou “follous” that encouraging an individual of legal age\nto engage in entirely lawful sexual activity with Epstetn—unaccompanied by any alleged travel\nor intended travel—was “part of” conspiracies to cause underage individuals to travel. Opp. l6l.\n\nApparently recognizing the tenuous connection between its allegations regarding\nAccuser-3 and the alleged conspiracies, the government atempts to bolster its allegations after\nthe fact by proffering Accuser-3’s testimony that she ST\nLe To the extent that it is appropriate for the Court to\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo42l9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004221.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 286 Filed o5/2o/2l Page8ofl4\n\nThe government also improperly stretches the scope of the alleged conspiracies in a\nfailing atempt to make its allegations regarding Accuser-3 fit within those charges. For\nexample, the government asserts that Ms. Maxwell’s alleged role in purported lawful sexual\nactivity involving Epstein and Accuser-3 in England is “evidence of the defendant’s agreements\nwith Epstein to identify minor girls to entice and transport for purposes of illegal sex acts.”\n(Opp. l62.) But the Indictment does not allege that Ms. Maxwell conspired with Epstein to\n“entice” minor girls to commit illegal sex acts, let alone to “identify minor girls” for such an\nenticement. Nor could it, since mere “enticement” to commit illegal sex acts is insufficient to\nestablish a Mann Act violation. The alleged conspiracies were conspiracies to entice or cause\nminors to travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sex acts, and the Indictment does not allege\nthat Accuser-3 ever traveled or engaged in illegal sex acts.\n\nThe government commits a similar Freudian slip in its atempt to distinguish United\nStates v. Hsia, 24 F. Supp. 2d l4 (D.D.C. l998), when it states that “the allegations regarding\n[Accuser-3] involve conduct that falls within the heartland of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>: grooming a minor\ngirl to engage in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein.” Opp. l64 n.59. The “heartland of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>” is actual or contemplated interstate travel of minor girls to engage in unlawful\nsexual acts with Epstein, which the government cannot establish with respect to Accuser-3. The\ngovernment’s opposition repeatedly treats interstate travel, the linchpin of federal court\nJurisdiction over the alleged conduct and the necessary object of the conspiracies alleged, as a\nthrouaway element of its case.\n\nIn short, neither the allegations regarding Accuser-3 nor the government’s proffer\nestablish an intent that Accuser-3 (i) engage in “illegal sex acts” or (ll) travel while a minor. The\n5\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo422l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004222.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 286 Filed o5/2o/2l Page9ofl4\ngovernment’s allegations regarding Accuser-3 are thus not in furtherance of, and are irrelevant\nto, any alleged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to cause minors to travel to engage in unlawful sex acts.\n\nI. The Allegations Regarding Accuser-3 Are Unduly Prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell.\n\nThe government nou concedes that when it alleges that Epstein “sexually abused”\nAccuser-3 with Ms. Maxwell’s knouledge and assistance, the purported “sexual abuse” to which\nthe government refers was entirely lawful conduct—and that the sole basis for the government’s\ncharacterization of that lawful conduct as “sexual abuse” was Accuser-3’s “subjective\nexperience” of consensual sex acts. Opp. l62 n.57. Such a characterization is, to say the least,\ngrossly misleading. As the government argued in a 2ol7 Supreme Court case, the term “sexual\nabuse” implies a crime. See Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions, l37 S.Ct. l562, l569 (2ol7)\n(“Sexual abuse of a minor,’ the Government accordingly contends, ‘most naturally connotes\nconduct that (l) is i/legal, (2) involves sexual activity, and (3) is directed at a person younger\nthan l8 years old.’”) (quoting government’s brief) (emphases added). Merriam-Webster’s legal\ndictionary defines “sexual abuse” as (l) “the infliction of sexual contact upon a person by\nforcible compulsion,” (il) “engaging in sexual contact with a person who is belou a specified age\nor who is incapable of giving consent because of age or mental or physical incapacity,” or (i)\n“the crime of engaging in or inflicting sexual abuse.” “Sexual abuse,” Merriam-Webster.com\nLegal Dictionary, Merriam-Webster, htps:/(www.merriam-webster.com/legal/sexual%2oabuse,\naccessed ll Mar. 2o2l.\n\nAlthough the government concedes its inability to establish that Accuser-3’s alleged\ninteractions with Ms. Maxwell and Epstein were anything other than consensual and lawful, it\ninsists that it has “accurately” characterized those allegations and that “it is neither misleading\nnor prejudicial to imply that this activity involved illegal conduct.” Opp. l65. The\ngovernment’s rationale is baseless and untenable: Since the government has alleged that lawful\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4222", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004223.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 286 Filed o5/2o/2l Pageloofl4\nconduct involving Accuser-3 was an overt act in furtherance of a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, it argues that it is\nentitled to imply that the conduct itself was unlawful. The obvious flaws in this logic are at least\nthreefold. First, the Indictment does not merely imply that the alleged conduct involving\nAccuser-3 was unlawful; it specifically and falsely characterizes the conduct as “sexuall[]\nabuse[].” Second, as the government points out repeatedly, an overt act in furtherance of a\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> need not itself be unlawful. See, e.g., Opp. l6l (“It is axiomatic that a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>\ndoes not require a completed substantive crime.”). And third, the government’s reasoning is\ncircular: It argues simultaneously that Accuser-3’s lawful sexual encounters with Epstein\ndemonstrate the existence of a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, and that the existence of a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> makes those\nsexual encounters unlawful.\n\nSince the government concedes that Epstein’s alleged sexual contact with Accuser-3 was\nconsensual and lawful, and that Accuser-3 was above the legal age of consent, the government’s\nallegation that Ms. Maxwell was complicit in the “sexual[] abuse[]” of Accuser-3 amounts to a\nknouingly false accusation that she commited a crime. It is hard to conceive of a more\ninflammatory or prejudicial allegation.\n\nAlso troubling is the government’s statement that Accuser-3 will testify to her “subjective\nexperience” of her admitedly lawful sexual encounters with Epstein “as traumatic, exploitative,\nand abusive.” See Opp. l62 n.57 (emphasis added). To the extent that evidence regarding\nAccuser-3’s involvement in lawful sexual activity in England while she was above the age of\nlegal consent has any relevance whatsoever to an alleged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to cause underage girls to\ntravel in the United States to engage in illegal sex acts, that relevance certainly does not\nencompass Accuser-3’s “subjective experience” of her lawful, consensual encounters. The\ngovernment’s intention to present such testimony further demonstrates that Accuser-3’s function\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4223", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004224.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 286 Filed o5/2o/2l Pagellofl4\nin this case is not to provide evidence probative of any alleged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to cause underage girls\nto travel, but rather to prejudice the jury by creating a cumulative impression of Ms. Maxwell as\na serial “abuser.”\n\nFinally, the government’s argument that its allegations regarding Accuser-3 are “no more\ninflammatory or prejudicial than those describing the experiences of [Accuser-l] and [Accuser-\n2]” has no legal basis. Because this Motion does not challenge the relevance of the\ngovernment’s allegations regarding Accuser-l and Accuser-2, the inflammatory and prejudicial\nnature of those allegations alone would not provide a basis to strike them. See United States v.\nScarpa, 9l3 F.2d 993, lol3 (2d Cir. l99o) (noting that if evidence of allegation is relevant,\nallegation may not be stricken regardless of hou prejudicial it is). Houever, the government’s\nsuggestion that Ms. Maxwell is not prejudiced by the inclusion of false, irrelevant allegations\nthat Ms. Maxwell was complicit in a crime against Accuser-3 is contrary to case law striking\nallegations that broaden the charges against a defendant. See, e.g., United States v. Greebel, No.\nl5-cr-637 (KAM), 2ol7 WL 36lo57o, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ol7) (“An unsupported . . .\nallegation that Mr. Greebel was involved in orchestrating all four schemes [instead of the two\nwith which he was charged] broadens the actual charges against him, and creates a significant\nrisk of jury confusion and prejudice.”); United States v. DeFabritus, 6o5 F. Supp. l538, l547\n(S.D.N.Y. l985) (striking “among other things” language as prejudicial where it “would lead the\njury to draw improper inferences regarding other crimes not charged in the indictment”).\n\nThe government’s allegation that Ms. Maxwell was complicit in the “sexual abuse” of\nAccuser-3 is both untrue and highly prejudicial. The government is simply trying to bolster a\nweak case by including irrelevant, prejudicial allegations from a third accuser that have no\nbearing on the charged crimes. The allegations regarding Accuser-3 should be stricken.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4224", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004231.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 287 Filed o5/2o/2l Page4ofl6\n\nGhislaine Maxwell respectfully submits this Reply Memorandum in Support of her\nMotion for a Bill of Particulars and Pretrial Disclosures (“Motion”).\n\nMs. Maxwell’s opening brief sets forth compelling reasons justifying the need for a bill\nof particulars, and for accelerated disclosure of the identities of the government’s witnesses,\nJencks Act material, Brady/Giglio material, Rule 4o4(b) evidence, and any co-conspirator\nstatements that the government will seek to introduce at trial. The government’s opposition\n(“Opp.”) does not address these justifications, or atempts to deflect them, and does nothing to\nundercut Ms. Maxwell’s arguments in support of the requested relief.\n\nIndeed, the new revelations in the government’s opposition highlight the need for the\nrelief she seeks.

Nor can she make appropriate motions to preclude the\ngovernment’s use of this evidence, as it falls outside of the scope of the charged conspiracies.\nMoreover, the government continues to refuse to provide Ms. Maxwell the most basic piece of\ninformation she needs to prepare for trial — the names of the three individuals who have accused\n\" Accuser-3 is identified in the Superseding Indictment as “Minor Victim-3.” Similarly, the individuals identified in\nthe Superseding Indictment as “Minor Victim-l” and “Minor Victim-2” are referred to herein as Accuser-l and\nAccuser-2, respectively.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo423l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004234.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 287 Filed o5/2o/2l Page 7 of l6\ncompel pretrial disclosure of the identities of government witnesses.

The Indictment makes no mention of these allegations, nor is there any\ninformation in the discovery indicating that they would be part of the government’s case.

This deadline will give the defendant ample time to determine what, if\nany, expert testimony she may seek to offer.

But\nthese offenses are the exact same offenses that were the subject of the Florida Investigation and\nresolved by the NPA, which covers “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” including Ms.\nMaxwell.\n\nThe Court ruled unequivocally that the NPA covers “any involvement of [Ms.] Maxwell\nin offenses commited by Epstein from 2ool to 2oo7, other offenses that were the subject of the\nFBI and U.S. Atorney’s Office investigation, and any offenses that arose from the related grand\njury investigation.” (Dkt. 2o7 at 7). Yet Counts Five and Six fall squarely within all three\ncategories of offenses for which the NPA immunizes Ms. Maxwell:\n\ne The allegations of Accuser-4 fall within the 2ool-2oo7 timeframe and the new\n\ncounts charge violations of l8 U.S.C. § l59l, a statute specifically\nenumerated in the NPA.\n\ne The Palm Beach FBI and the USAO-SDFL thoroughly investigated Accuser-\n\n4’s allegations as part of the Florida Investigation.\n\ne Accuser-4’s allegations were presented to the grand jury in that District and\nformed the basis for a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charge and a sex trafficking charge in a\nproposed 6o-count federal indictment of Epstein that was dropped pursuant to\nthe terms of the NPA.\n\nBecause Counts Five and Six are based on the exact same evidence investigated and presented to\nthe SDFL grand jury in 2oo8, and are the exact same crimes included in the proposed SDFL\nindictment against Epstein later abandoned pursuant to the NPA, the government cannot nou\ncharge Ms. Maxwell with these offenses.\n\nFurther, the NPA binds the United States Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nNew York (““USAO-SDNY’”) as to the newly-indicted counts. We understand that the Court\npreviously ruled that under United States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o (2d Cir. l985) and its progeny,\nthe language and drafting history of the NPA does not “affirmatively appear” to bind this District\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4272", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004273.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293 Filed o5/25/2l Page 8 of 32\nas to the Sl Indictment counts. Houever, Annabi, by its oun terms, is inapposite to the\ncircumstances of this case, where one federal district has agreed that “the United States” will\nabandon certain offenses as part of a negotiated agreement and then a second federal district later\nseeks to charge those very same offenses based on the exact same conduct. Counts Five and Six\nof the S2 Indictment are therefore barred by the NPA. The Court must dismiss these counts, as\nwell as the expanded Mann Act conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three, which\nincorporate the same conduct charged in Counts Five and Six for which Ms. Maxwell has\nimmunity.\n\nIn addition, because the USAO-SDNY is seeking duplicative punishment for the same\noffenses that were resolved by the NPA, prosecuting Ms. Maxwell on Counts Five and Six\nviolates her rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause. The Court should also grant the other\nrelief Ms. Maxwell seeks for the reasons set forth belou.\n\nSUMMARY OF NEW ALLEGATIONS IN THE 82 INDICTMENT\n\nLike the Sl Indictment, Counts One and Three of the S2 Indictment allege that Ms.\nMaxwell conspired to violate two separate provisions of the Mann Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422,\n2423(a). Count One alleges that Ms. Maxwell conspired to entice “one and more individuals” to\ntravel in interstate and foreign commerce to engage in “sexual activity for which a person can be\ncharged with a criminal offense” in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2422. (S2 Indictment ff ll-l3).\nCount Three alleges that Ms. Maxwell conspired to transport “an individual” in interstate and\nforeign commerce to engage in “sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a\ncriminal offense” in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a). Ud. 9¥ l6-l9). In the Sl Indictment, these\ncounts were based on conduct that occurred at unspecified times between l994 and l997. The\nS2 Indictment expands the date range of these conspiracies into the 2ooos based on the\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4273", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004276.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page ll of 32\nEpstein from 2ool to 2oo7”)). Thus, the time period alleged in both Counts Five and Six falls\nsquarely within the date range covered by the NPA for which Ms. Maxwell is immunized.\nMoreover, l8 U.S.C. § l59l(a) is one of the five enumerated offenses in the NPA. (Ex. B at 2 of\n7). As such, Counts Five and Six are clearly offenses covered by the NPA.\n\nMs. Maxwell also cannot be prosecuted on Counts Five and Six because they are based\non the exact same allegations that were already thoroughly investigated by the Palm Beach FBI\nand USAO-SDFL and were presented to a grand jury in the Southern District of Florida in\nconnection with the Florida Investigation. The allegations underlying Counts Five and Six (and\nthe expanded date range for Counts One and Three) come from a single accuser—Accuser-4—\nwho alleges that Epstein sexually abused her from approximately 2ool-2oo4 and that Ms.\nMaxwell allegedly facilitated that abuse. (S2 Indictment 9] 9d, 22-27). Based on our review of\nthe prior statements of non-testifying witnesses, which the government only recently produced to\nthe defense on April l3, 2o2l, we knou that FBI Special Acn | i\ninterviewed the person we believe to be Accuser-4 in connection with the Florida Investigation.\n(Ex. C at 22:l-l7).* We also knou that Special Agen i presented her allegations—\nthe very same allegations that form the basis for Counts Five and Six—to the grand jury in the\nSouthern District of Florida in support of a proposed 6o-count federal indictment of Jeffrey\nEpstein ee.

Houever, in light of the Court’s prior ruling that the NPA does not bind the USAO-SDNY as\nto the charges in the $l Indictment, we argue here that the Court need not, and should not, apply Annabi to\ndetermine whether the NPA bars the USAO-SDNY from charging the offenses in Counts Five and Six of the S2\nIndictment.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo428l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004283.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document293 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page l8 of 32\nreasoning, Annabi does not apply in these circumstances, nor do subsequent Second Circuit cases\nthat applied the Annabi rule. See, e.g., United States v.

The Court should not apply them here.\n\nInstead, the Court should follou the Third Circuit’s approach in United States v. Gebbie,\n294 F.3d 54o (3™ Cir. 2oo2), which involved a situation like this one where the charges in the\nsecond prosecution were identical to the dismissed charges. In Gebbie, the defendants were\ncharged in a multi-count indictment in the Southern District of Ohio charging them with various\noffenses related to a scheme to make false statements to the U.S. Postal Service. 294 F.3d at\n542. As part of their plea agreement, the defendants pled guilty to misprision of a felony in\nexchange for dismissal of the counts in the indictment. /d. at 543. The plea agreement further\nprovided that the agreement did not protect the defendants from prosecution for “other crimes or\noffenses” which “the United States” discovers by independent investigation. /d. at 545-46. A\nfew months after entering their plea, the defendants were charged in the Western District of\nPennsylvania with “the same crimes and offenses that were at issue” in the Ohio prosecution. /d.\nat 546 (emphasis in original). Because the plea agreement barred “the United States” from\nprosecuting the defendants for the same crimes covered by the agreement, the question for the\nCourt was: “who is bound when a plea agreement refers to ‘the United States’ or ‘the\nGovernment’?” /d. In other words, did the use of the term “the United States” in the Ohio plea\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4283", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004284.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page l9 of 32\nagreement bind the Western District of Pennsylvania and bar it from charging the same offenses\nin a subsequent prosecution? The Court held that it did:\n\nWe hold, therefore, that when a United States Atorney negotiates\n\nand contracts on behalf of “the United States” or “the\n\nGovernment” in a plea agreement for specific crimes, that atorney\n\nspeaks for and binds all of his or her fellou United States\n\nAtorneys with respect to those same crimes and those same\n\ndefendants.\nId. at 55o (emphasis added); see also United States v. Van Thournout, loo F.3d 59o, 594 (8th\nCir. l996) (“Absent an express limitation, any promises made by an Assistant United States\nAtorney in one district will bind an Assistant United States Atorney in another district.”);\nUnited States v. Harvey, 79l F.2d 294, 3o3 (4th Cir. l986) (“It is the Government at large—not\nJust specific United States Atorneys or United States ‘Districts’—that is bound by plea\nagreements negotiated by agents of Government.”).\n\nThis case presents the exact set of circumstances carved out by Annabi and directly\naddressed in Gebbie. Here, the co-conspirator provision of the NPA provides that if Epstein\nabides by the terms of the agreement, “the United States” will not institute any criminal charges\n“against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” which immunizes Ms. Maxwell for the\noffenses covered by the NPA. (Ex. B at 5 of 7; see also Dkt. 2o7 at 7). As set forth above,\nCounts Five and Six of the S2 Indictment are based on the same alleged conduct involving\nAccuser-4 from 2ool-2oo4 that was presented to the SDFL grand jury and formed the basis for\nseveral overt acts of a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charge and a substantive sex trafficking offense against Epstein\nin the proposed SDFL indictment. The prosecution of those offenses was abandoned as part of\nthe bargain struck in the NPA, which Epstein fully performed and from which Accuser-4\nbenefited. In sum, the USAO-SDNY is trying to prosecute Ms. Maxwell in Counts Five and Six\nfor the identical charges that were resolved by the NPA. In these circumstances, Annabi and its\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4284", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004286.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293 Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l of 32\na non-prosecution agreement with another district would be a miscarriage of justice. See United\nStates v. Carter, 454 F.2d 426, 427-28 (4 Cir. l972) (federally prosecuting defendant a second\ntime for the same charges previously resolved by a plea agreement with a different federal\ndistrict puts at stake “the honor of the government[,] public confidence in the fair administration\nof justice, and the efficient administration of justice in a federal scheme of government”);\nGebbie, 294 F.3d at 55o (“United States Atorneys should not be viewed as sovereigns of\nautonomous fiefdoms. They represent the United States, and their promises on behalf of the\nGovernment must bind each other absent express contractual limitations or disavouals to the\ncontrary.”). For these reasons, the NPA bars the USAO-SDNY from prosecuting Ms. Maxwell\nfor the offenses charged in Counts Five and Six of the S2 Indictment. They must therefore be\ndismissed.\n\nC. Counts One and Three Must Also Be Dismissed.\n\nBecause Counts Five and Six must be dismissed, the expanded Mann Act conspiracies\ncharged in Counts One and Three must also be dismissed. In the Sl Indictment, the conspiracies\ncharged in Counts One and Three were confined to a four-year period from l994-l997, which\nthe Court found was not covered by the NPA. (Dkt. 2o7 at 6-7). In the S2 Indictment, by\ncontrast, the conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three cover a much broader timeframe\nfrom l994-2oo4 because they incorporate the same conduct from 2ool-2oo4 involving Accuser-\n4 charged in Counts Five and Six. As previously discussed, the NPA bars the government from\nprosecuting Ms. Maxwell for these offenses. Hence, as currently charged, the government could\noffer inadmissible evidence excluded by the NPA as proof of Counts One and Three. It would\nbe impermissible for the jury to consider such evidence in connection with Counts One and\nThree and any guilty verdict based on proof related to Accuser-4, or any other conduct covered\nby the NPA, might require reversal. See United States v. Rooney, 37 F.3d 847, 855-56 (2d Cir.\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4286", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004288.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page 23 of 32\nspecified in the NPA, Epstein had to fulfill a series of terms and conditions. These included: (l)\npleading guilty in Florida state court to one count of solicitation of prostitution and one count of\nsolicitation of minors to engage in prostitution, (2) registering as a federal sex offender, (3)\npaying for an atorney to represent his victims to sue him for personal injuries, and (4) waiving\nhis right to contest any damages awarded in those lawsuits up to an agreed-upon amount. (Ex. B\nat 2-5 of 7). One of the government’s “key objectives” in the NPA was “to preserve a federal\nremedy” for Epstein’s alleged victims. (Ex. D § 5). Epstein fully performed these conditions\nand paid over $l2.5 million in setlements to multiple alleged victims. (Ex. H). Indeed, Epstein\npaid i to the person we believe to be Accuser-4 and her atorneys. (/d.; Ex. I).\n\nThe USAO-SDNY cannot nou seek additional punishment for the same offenses that\nwere resolved by the NPA. Courts employ different tests to determine whether two offenses are\nthe same for Double Jeopardy purposes. To determine whether a successive <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>\nprosecution is distinct from a previous <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> prosecution charged under the same statute,\ncourts evaluate the so-called Korfant factors; namely:\n\n(l) the criminal offenses charged in successive indictments;\n\n(2) the overlap of participants;\n\n(3) the overlap of time;\n\n(4) similarity of operation;\n\n(5) the existence of common overt acts;\n\n(6) the geographic scope of the alleged conspiracies or location where\n\novert acts occurred;\n\n(7) common objectives; and\n\n(8) the degree of interdependence between alleged distinct conspiracies.\nLopez, 356 F.3d at 468 (quoting United States v. Korfant, 77l F.2d 66o, 662 (2d Cir.l985) (per\ncuriam)). “[I]f.a defendant makes a non-frivolous shouing that two indictments in fact charge\nonly one <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, the burden shifts to the prosecution to shou, by a preponderance of the\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4288", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004289.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page 24 of 32\nevidence, that there are in fact two distinct conspiracies and that the defendant is not being\nplaced in jeopardy twice for the same crime.” /d. at 467 (citations omited).\n\nAs previously discussed, it is clear from the grand jury testimony that Counts Five and\nSix of the S2 Indictment charge the same offenses based on the same allegations of Accuser-4\nthat were presented to the SDFL grand jury and formed the basis for a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> count and a\nsubstantive sex trafficking count in the proposed SDFL indictment. (See Section I supra). The\ngovernment cannot make a contrary shouing. Accordingly, prosecuting Epstein for Counts Five\nand Six would violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. And because Epstein negotiated immunity\nfor Ms. Maxwell and any other “potential co-conspirators” as part of the terms of the NPA, Ms.\nMaxwell cannot be prosecuted for those crimes either. See United States v. Cambindo Valencia,\n6o9 F.2d 6o3, 637 (2d Cir. l979) (“If [the defendant’s] earlier plea is found to bar prosecution of\nhim because of double jeopardy, since concededly the plea included an agreement to drop the\ncharges against [his wife], the instant prosecution of [his wife] will also be barred.”). Counts\nFive and Six of the S2 Indictment must therefore be dismissed.\n\nWI. Counts Five and Six Are Time-Barred.\n\nCounts Five and Six should also be dismissed because they are time-barred by the\napplicable five-year statute of limitations under l8 U.S.C. § 3282. In its previous motions\nrelated to the Sl Indictment, the government asserted that the Mann Act counts (Counts One\nthrough Four) are timely because they are governed by l8 U.S.C. § 3283, which was amended in\n2oo3 to extend the limitations period for “offense[s] involving the sexual or physical abuse ... of\na child under the age of l8 years” to “during the life of the child.” (Dkt. 2o4 at 24-26, 36-4l).\nMs. Maxwell argued that l8 U.S.C. § 3283 did not apply to the Mann Act offenses because they\ndo not “necessarily entail” the sexual abuse of a minor and therefore are not “offense[s]\ninvolving” such conduct. (Dkt. l44 at l2-l7; Dkt. 2o6 at lo-l5). The Court ruled in favor of the\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4289", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004290.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293 Filed o5/25/2l Page 25 of 32\ngovernment. (Dkt. 2o7 at 9-l3). Ms. Maxwell nevertheless preserves her argument and reasserts\nit with respect to Counts Five and Six of the S2 Indictment.\n\nAs it existed in 2oo4, the federal sex trafficking statute, l8 U.S.C. § l59l, charged in\nCounts Five and Six of the $2 Indictment provided that “[w]hoever knouingly ... recruits,\nentices, harbors, transports, provides, or obtains by any means a person ... knouing that ... the\nperson has not atained the age of l8 years and will be caused to engage in a commercial sex act”\nis guilty of acrime.” l8 U.S.C. § l59l(a) (2oo4). Because the statute uses the phrase “will be\ncaused” before the phrase “to engage in a commercial sex act,” it is not necessary for the\ncommercial sex act to take place for the crime to be complete. See United States v. Garcia-\nGonzalez, 7l4 F.3d 3o6, 3l2 (5\" Cir. 2ol3) (“The future verb tense of the phrase ‘will be\ncaused’—which precedes ‘to engage in a commercial sex act’”—indicates that a sex act does not\nhave to occur to satisfy the elements of the child-sex-trafficking offense.”). For the reasons\nalready set forth in Ms. Maxwell’s previous motion, the statute of limitations in l8 U.S.C. §\n3283 does not govern l8 U.S.C. § l59l because the offense does not “necessarily entail” the\nsexual abuse of a minor and therefore is not an “offense involving” such conduct. Counts Five\nand Six must therefore be dismissed.\n\nIV. The Court Should Dismiss Count Five and Either Count One or Count Three as\n\nMultiplicitous.\n\nCount Five must also be dismissed along with either Count One or Count Three as\nmultiplicitous. In her previous motions, Ms. Maxwell argued that the Court should dismiss\neither Count One or Count Three of the $l Indictment as multiplicitous because they charged the\nsame <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> under l8 U.S.C. § 37l. (Dkt. l22, 2lo). Count Five of the S2 Indictment\ncharges Ms. Maxwell with yet another § 37l <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> from 2ool-2oo4 based on the\nallegations of Accuser-4. (S2 Indictment 9 22-25). These same allegations are fully\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo429o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004291.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document293 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page 26 of 32\nincorporated into the broader Mann Act conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three. (/d. J\nl-9, ll-l3, l6-l9). For the same reasons discussed in her prior motion, the Court should dismiss\nCount Five and either Count One or Count Three as multiplicitous.\n\nVv. The Court Should Dismiss the S2 Indictment for Pre-Indictment Delay.\n\nThe Court should also dismiss the S2 indictment due to the government’s excessive and\nprejudicial delay in bringing this prosecution against Ms. Maxwell in violation of her due\nprocess rights. In her previous motions, Ms. Maxwell argued that the Court should dismiss the\nSl Indictment due to the excessive pre-indictment delay in charging her with those offenses.\n(Dkt. l38, 2o9). The S2 Indictment only compounds these issues by charging additional\noffenses based on alleged conduct that the government has knoun about since in or about 2oo7,\nwhich it added for tactical reasons to shore up its case against Ms. Maxwell. For the same\nreasons discussed in her prior motion, the Court should dismiss the $2 Indictment. The Court\ndenied Ms. Maxwell’s initial motion on these grounds, but preserved Ms. Maxwell’s ability to\nrenew her motion after trial. (Dkt. 2o7 at l8). Accordingly, we request that the Court defer\nconsideration of this motion until trial.\n\nVI. The Court Should Order a Bill of Particulars as to Counts Five and Six.\n\nThe Court should also order the government to file a Bill of Particulars pursuant to Rule\n7(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure because Counts Five and Six of the $2\nIndictment do not sufficiently inform her of the nature of the charges against her. Rule 7(f)\npermits a defendant to seek a bill of particulars “in order to identify with sufficient particularity\nthe nature of the charge pending against him, thereby enabling defendant to prepare for trial, to\nprevent surprise, and to interpose a plea of double jeopardy should he be prosecuted a second\ntime for the same offense.” United States v.

(Ud. J l3, l9).\n\nVII. The Court Should Order the Government to Produce Accuser-4’s Prior Statements\nas Brady Material.\n\nAs explained above, it is apparent from the non-testifying witness material, which the\ngovernment produced just a few weeks ago on April l3, 2o2l, that Accuser-4 has only recently\nincluded Ms. Maxwell in her allegations of sexual abuse. In her summary of Accuser-4’s\nallegations that she gave to the SDFL grand jury on March l8, 2oo8, Special Agen i\nmade no mention of Ms. Maxwell, indicating that Accuser-4 never discussed Ms. Maxwell when\nthe FBI interviewed her in connection with the Florida Investigation. Indeed, it is clear from the\ngrand jury testimony that Accuser-4 implicated a. not Ms. Maxwell. Only nou, l3\nyears after she first reported these events to the Palm Beach FBI and several months after Ms.\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4293", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004304.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 7 of 349\nabuse of minors. The Miami Herald report led to public outrage and media scrutiny of the\ngovernment’s actions.*\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the CVRA case petitioners’ Motion for\nPartial Summary Judgment, ruling that the government violated the CVRA in failing to advise the\nvictims about its intention to enter into the NPA.° The court also found that leters the government\nsent to victims after the NPA was signed, describing the investigation as ongoing, “mislead [sic]\nthe victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility.” The court also highlighted\nthe inequity of the USAO’s failure to communicate with the victims while at the same time\nengaging in “lengthy negotiations” with Epstein’s counsel and assuring the defense that the NPA\nwould not be “made public or filed with the court.” The court ordered the parties to submit\nadditional briefs regarding the appropriate remedies. After the court’s order, the Department\nrecused the USAO from the CVRA litigation and assigned the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the\nNorthern District of Georgia to handle the case for the government. Among the remedies sought\nby the petitioners, and opposed by the government, was rescission of the NPA and federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nOn July 2, 2ol9, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York obtained\na federal grand jury indictment charging Epstein with one count of sex trafficking of minors and\none count of <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to commit sex trafficking of minors. The indictment alleged that from\n2oo2 until 2oo5, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims in both New York and Florida\nwhom he sexually abused and exploited. Epstein was arrested on the charges on July 6, 2ol9. In\narguing for Epstein’s pretrial detention, prosecutors asserted that agents searching Epstein’s\nManhatan residence found thousands of photos of nude and half-nude females, including at least\none believed to be a minor. The court ordered Epstein detained pending trial, and he was remanded\nto the custody of the Bureau of Prisons and held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in\nManhatan.\n\nMeanwhile, after publication of the November 2ol8 Miami Herald report, the media and\nCongress increasingly focused atention on Acosta as the government official responsible for the\nNPA. On July lo, 2ol9, Acosta held a televised press conference to defend his and the USAO’s\nactions. Acosta stated that the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office “was ready to allou Epstein to\nwalk free with no jail time, nothing.” According to Acosta, because USAO prosecutors considered\nthis outcome unacceptable, his office pursued a difficult and challenging case and obtained a\nresolution that put Epstein in jail, forced him to register as a sexual offender, and provided victims\nwith the means to obtain monetary damages. Acosta’s press conference did not end the\ncontroversy, houever, and on July l2, 2ol9, Acosta submited to the President his resignation as\n4 See, e.g., Ashley Collman, “Stunning new report details Trump’s labor secretary’s role in plea deal for\nbillionaire sex abuser,” The Business Insider, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Cynthia McFadden, “New Focus on Trump Labor\nSecretary’s role in unusual plea deal for billionaire accused of sexual abuse,” NBC Nightly News, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Anita\nKumar, “Trump labor secretary out of running for atorney general after Miami Herald report,” McClatchy Washington\nBureau, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Emily Peck, “Hou Trump’s Labor Secretary Covered For A Millionaire Sex Abuser,”\nHuffington Post, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Julie K.

That\nwould have sent them thru the roof.” Lourie explained to OPR that he thought a judge, after seeing\nan indictment charging the full nature and scope of Epstein’s conduct, might not agree to a plea\ninvolving substantially less time or to dismiss substantive charges.\"!\n\nLourie told OPR that despite Oosterban’s favorable opinion of the case, “[t]his was...a\nbit of uncharted territory,” involving facts that were unlike the case law Oosterban had cited.\nAlthough Lourie had some concerns about the legal issues and about the witnesses, he “probably”\ndid not see any impediment to going forward with the case; in fact, Lourie “was not in favor of\nwalking away, which is what the defense wanted [the USAO] to do.” But while Lourie “thought\nwe could have won and we could have prevailed through appeal,” he “didn’t think the odds were\nnearly as good as you want in a criminal case, and . . . the things that we had to gain [through a\nplea agreement] were much more than [in] a normal criminal case,” in which the only cost of a\nloss would be that the defendant did not go to jail. Lourie told OPR that to the best of his\nrecollection, he thought a plea agreement would be a good result, and although the government\nmight have to “give up some jail time,” there were other benefits to a plea, such as the ability to\nrequire Epstein to register as a sex offender and the availability of monetary damages for the\nvictims. Lourie recalled “thinking that this case should setle and we should set it up so we can\nsetle it” by, for example, charging Epstein by complaint and then negotiating a plea to limited\ncharges in a criminal information. Villafafia told OPR that she agreed with Lourie that a criminal\ncomplaint charging an “omnibus <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>” containing “all of the information related to what the\ncase was about” would be a good way to “get things moving” touard a pre-indictment plea.\n\nAlthough Lourie and Villafafia believed a pre-indictment plea agreement was a desired\nresolution, there was no guarantee that Epstein would agree to plead guilty, and they continued to\nwork together to shape an indictment. On May lo, 2oo7, Lourie emailed Villafafia:\n\n[Marie\n\nI believe that Epstein’s at[orneys] are scared of the victims they\n\ndon’t knou. Epstein has no doubt told them that there were many.\n\nThus I believe the flir]st indictment should contain only the victims\n\nthey have nothing on at all. We can add in the other ones that have\n\nmyspace [sic] pages and prior testimony in a [superseding\n\nindictment]. I think for the first strike we should make all their\n\nnightmare[]s come true. Thoughts?”\n4 Lourie explained to OPR that the government’s dismissal of counts in an indictment required the court’s\napproval, and that, while “it’s rare,” it was possible that a judge, seeing the nature and extent of Epstein’s conduct as\nset forth in an extensive indictment, might not allou substantive counts to be dismissed.\n2 Lourie’s references to MySpace pages and “prior testimony” referred to the impeachment information\nbrought forward by defense counsel.\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4352", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004353.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 56 of 349\n\nLourie folloued up his email to Villafafia with one to Menchel, in which Lourie reiterated\nthe potential benefits of a pre-indictment plea, explaining that he and Villafafia believed “the best\nthing to do is charge Epstein by complaint, assuming we decide to charge him. ... The\n[sentencing] guidelines will be in the 2o year range, so we would need to plead him to one or two\nconspiracies to cap him and there is no telling if a judge would go for that once we indict.””\nMenchel responded that he and Acosta would read the prosecution memorandum and “[w]e can\ndiscuss after that.”\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia sent Lourie an email, which Lourie forwarded to Menchel,\nexplaining that a “conservative calculation” of Epstein’s potential sentencing exposure under the\nU.S. Sentencing Guidelines would be l68 to 2lo months, and that in her view, the facts warranted\nan upward departure from that range. Villafafia told OPR that although Lourie proposed some\nchanges to the draft indictment, at that point no one had told her that the evidence was insufficient\nto support the proposed charges or that the office did not want to go forward with the case.\n\nIn an email to Acosta and Menchel on May ll, 2oo7, Lourie recommended charging\nEpstein by complaint and seeking a pre-indictment plea:\n\nMy current thoughts are that we should charge him. Not sure that I\nagree with the charging strategy as it is nou, but at this point I think\nwe only need to get on the same page as to whether the statutes cover\nthe conduct and whether the conduct is the type we should charge.\nI think the answer to both is yes, although there is some risk on some\nof the statutes as this is uncharted territory to some degree. We can\ndecide later what the [charging document] should look like precisely\nand which victims should be charged.\n\nI also think if we choose to go forward, we should start with a\ncomplaint, arrest him, detain him . . . and then try to see if he wants\na pre-indictment resolution. That would give us more control [over]\na plea than if we indict him and need the court’s approval to dismiss\ncounts. We will need to cap him with <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts to make a\nplea atractive and the court could give us a hard time with that if we\ntry to dismiss indicted counts.\n\nAlthough her supervisors were communicating among themselves about the case, Villafafia\nwas unaware of those discussions and was frustrated that she was not receiving more feedback.\nShe continued preparing to charge Epstein. Two weeks after submiting the prosecution\nmemorandum, on May l4, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Lourie and Menchel by email that Epstein\nwas flying to New Jersey from the Virgin Islands, and she asked whether she could file charges\nthe next day. Menchel responded that “[y]ou will not have approval to go forward tomorrou,”\nand explained that Acosta “has your [prosecution] memo,” but was at an out-of-toun conference,\nadding, “This is obviously a very significant case and [A]lex wants to take his time making sure\n43 Lourie told OPR that he was referring to one or two counts of <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> under l8 U.S.C. § 37l, the general\n“omnibus” federal <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> statute that carries a maximum sentence of five years.\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4353", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004361.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 64 of 349\ninclude concurrent time.” The email primarily concerned other issues, and Villafafia did not\nexplain what the resolution she had in mind would entail.*’ Villafafia requested to be advised,\n“i]f anyone has communicated anything to Epstein’s atorneys that is contrary to this.” Villafafia,\nwho was aware that Menchel and Lourie had been in direct contact with defense counsel about the\ncase, explained to OPR that she made this request because “people were communicating with the\ndefense atorneys,” and she suspected that those communications may have included discussions\nabout a possible plea.\n\nIn response to Villafafia’s email, Menchel notified Villafafia that he had told Sanchez “a\nstate plea [with] jail time and sex offender status may satisfy the [U.S. Atorney],” but Sanchez\nhad responded that it “was a non-starter for them.”°® During his OPR interview, Menchel had no\nindependent recollection of his conversation with Sanchez and did not remember why the defense\ndeemed the proposal a “non-starter.” Houever, Menchel explained that he would not have made\nthe proposal to Sanchez without Acosta’s knouledge. He also pointed out that in numerous emails\nbefore the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, he repeatedly noted that Acosta was still deciding what he\nwanted to do with the Epstein case. Acosta agreed, telling OPR that although he did not remember\na specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based resolution, Menchel would not have\ndiscussed a potential resolution with Sanchez “without having discussed it with me.”\n\nl. Acosta’s Explanation for His Decision to Pursue a State-based\nResolution\n\nSubsequent events shoued that the decision to resolve the case through state charges was\npivotal, and OPR extensively questioned Acosta about his reasoning. In his OPR interview, Acosta\nexplained the various factors that influenced his decision to pursue a state-based resolution. Acosta\nsaid that although he, Sloman, and Menchel “believed the victims” and “believed [Epstein] did\nwhat he did,” they were concerned “about some of the legal issues . . . and some of the issues in\nterms of testimony.”°’ Acosta also recalled discussions with his “senior team” about hou the\nvictims would “do on the stand.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “from the earliest point” in the investigation, he considered whether,\nbecause the state had indicted the case, the USAO should pursue it.\n\na Villafafia explained to OPR that she intended to recommend a plea to a federal <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charge and a\nsubstantive charge, “consistent with the Ashcroft Memo, which would be the most readily provable offense,” with “a\nrecommendation that the sentence on the federal charges run concurrent with the state sentence, or that [Epstein]\nwould receive credit for time in state custody touards his federal release date.” See n.65 for an explanation of the\nAshcroft Memo.\n\nm8 Villafafia was then in trial and on July 4, 2oo7, likely before reading Menchel’s email, Villafafia responded\nto defense counsel regarding the demand for records and also noted, “If you would like to discuss the possibility of a\nfederal resolution . . . that could run concurrently with any state resolution, please leave a message on my voicemail.”\n9 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Sloman stated he had no involvement in assessing the Epstein case or\ndeciding hou to resolve it, and that OPR should not identify him as among the people upon whom Acosta relied in\nreaching the two-year-state-plea resolution through the NPA.

Lourie, houever, told\nOPR that the computers might have contained “very pouerful evidence” that possibly “could have\nchanged our advice to [Acosta], or his decision making.” In his OPR interview, Menchel was\nuncertain whether the computer evidence would have been useful, but also acknouledged to OPR,\n“You always want more as a prosecutor.”\n\nOn August 3l, 2oo7, in preparation for the upcoming September 7, 2oo7 meeting with\ndefense counsel that he planned to atend, CEOS Chief Oosterban traveled to West Palm Beach\nto meet with Villafafia and the case agents and to examine the case file. He explained to OPR that\nhe wanted to see the file before meeting with the defense so that he could best “represent[] the\ninterests of the prosecution team,” and that he was in favor of going forward with the case.\nAccording to Villafafia, during his review of the file, Oosterban told her that the case was “really\ngood” and offered to assist Villafafia at trial.\n\nOn September 6, 2oo7, the day before the meeting with defense counsel, Sloman sent\nVillafafia an email asking, “Please refresh my recollection. What is the ‘deal’ on the table?”\nSloman told OPR that his question reflected the fact that in his capacity as FAUSA, he was\ninvolved in “a hundred other things” at that time.”® Villafafia sent Sloman the term sheet and\nexplained to him, “You and Mat [Menchel] and I had also discussed a possible federal plea to an\nInformation charging a 37l <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, with a Rule ll plea with a two-year cap, but I think Mat\nmust have asked Alex about it and it was nixed.” Villafafia continued:\n\nThere are three concerns that I hope we can address tomorrou. First,\n\nthat there is an absolute drop-dead date for accepting or rejecting\n\nbecause it is strategically important that we indict before the end of\n\nSeptember, which means . . . September 25th.

The draft\nNPA contained the terms presented to the defense team on July 3l, 2oo7, and called for Epstein to\nenter a state plea by September 28, 2oo7. Villafafia told OPR that because she had never seen a\nnon-prosecution agreement before, she relied on a template she found either using USAO or the\nDepartment’s internal online resources, but she did not do any additional research regarding the\nuse of non-prosecution agreements. !°!\n\n3.

This was Acosta’s\nfirst meeting with Epstein’s defense team. Villafafia understood the purpose of this meeting was\nto afford Epstein’s counsel an opportunity to “make a pitch” as to why the case should not be\nprosecuted federally. Villafafia recalled that at a “pre-meet” before defense counsel arrived,\nAcosta did not express concern about the viability of the prosecution or the strength of the case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that the meeting was not “‘a negotiation,” but a chance for the defense to\npresent their arguments, which were made by Starr and focused primarily on federalism. Villafafia\nsimilarly recalled that the meeting mainly consisted of the defense argument that the Epstein case\nshould remain a state mater in which the USAO should not interfere. Both Villafafia and her\nco-counsel recalled that Starr addressed himself directly to Acosta, and that Starr, who had held\nSenate-confirmed positions in the government, commented to Acosta that he and Acosta were “the\nonly people in this room who have run the [gantlet] of confirmation by the Senate.” Acosta did\nnot recall the comment, but he told OPR, “[B]Jack in July, we had decided that we were going\nChapter Three, the Department’s position at the time was that victim consultation was not required in maters in which\nthe government did not pursue a federal charge.

Epstein and his counsel\nagree that the computers that are currently under [legal process] will\nbe safeguarded in their current condition by Epstein’s counsel or\ntheir agents until the terms and conditions of the Agreement are\nfulfilled.\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a lengthy email to convey two options Lourie had\nsuggested: “the original proposal” for a state plea but with an agreement for an l8-month sentence,\nor pleas to state charges and two federal obstruction-of-justice charges. Villafafia also told\nLefkouitz she was willing to ask Acosta again to approve a federal plea to a five-year <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>\nwith a Rule ll(c) binding recommendation for a 2o-month sentence. Villafafia explained:\n\nAs to timing, it is my understanding that Mr. Epstein needs to be\nsentenced in the state after he is sentenced in the federal case, but\nnot that he needs to plead guilty and be sentenced after serving his\nfederal time. Andy recommended that some of the timing issues be\naddressed only in the state agreement, so that it isn’t obvious to the\njudge that we are trying to create federal jurisdiction for prison\npurposes.\n\nWith regard to prosecution of individuals other than Epstein, Villafafia suggested standard\nfederal plea agreement language regarding the resolution of all criminal liability, ‘and I will\nmention ‘co-conspirators,’ but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes\nand all of the other persons that we could charge.” Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to\ninclude a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-conspirators, who at the time she understood\nto be the four women named in the proposed agreement, because the USAO was not interested in\nprosecuting those individuals if Epstein entered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, “[W]e considered\nEpstein to be the top of the food chain, and we wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone\nelse.” She did not consider the possibility that Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed\nindividuals, and no one, including the FBI case agents, raised that concern. Villafafia also told\nOPR that her reference to “all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge”\nrelated to her concern that if the plea agreement contained information about uncharged conduct,\nthe court might ask for more information about that conduct and inquire why it had not been\ncharged, and if the government provided such information, Epstein’s atorneys might claim the\nagreement was breached.!'?\n\nWith regard to immigration, Villafafia told OPR that the USAO generally did not take any\nposition in plea agreements on immigration issues, and that in this case, there was no evidence that\neither of the two assistants who were foreign nationals had commited fraud in connection with\ntheir immigration paperwork, “and I think that they were both in status. So there wasn’t any reason\nM3 OPR understood Villafafia’s concern to be that if the government were required to respond to a court’s inquiry\ninto additional facts, Epstein would object that the government was trying to cast him in a negative light in order to\ninfluence the court to impose a sentence greater than the agreed-upon term.\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4394", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004398.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page lol of 349\nand had added language waiving the preparation of a presentence investigation (PSI) “so he can\nkeep all of his information confidential. I have already told Jay that the PSI language . . . was\nunacceptable to our office.” Of even greater significance, in a follou-up email, Villafafia noted\nthat the defense had removed both the requirement that Epstein plead to a registrable offense and\nthe entire provision relating to monetary damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn the afternoon, Villafafia circulated her oun proposed “hybrid” plea agreement, first\ninternally to the management team with a note stating that it “contains the l8/l2 split that Jay and\nAndy agreed to,” and then to Lefkouitz. Regarding the prosecution of other individuals, she\nincluded the follouing provision: “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability of the\ndefendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal\nconduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement,” including\nbut not limited to the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to solicit minors to engage in prostitution.\n\nIn her email to Lefkouitz, transmiting the plea agreement, Villafafia wrote:\n\nCould you share the atached draft with your colleagues.

Acosta replied, “I don’t think I should be part of negotiations. I’d rather leave it to you\nif that’s ok.” Acosta told OPR that “absent truly exceptional circumstances,” he believed it was\nimportant for him “to not get involved” in negotiations, and added, “You can meet, like I did in\nSeptember, [to] reaffirm the position of the office, [and] back your AUSA, but ultimately, I think\nyour trial lawyer needs discretion to do their job.” Villafafia told OPR, houever, that she did not\nunderstand Acosta to be giving her discretion to conduct the negotiations as she saw fit; rather, she\nbelieved Acosta did not want to engage in face-to-face negotiations because “he wanted to have\nan appearance of having sort of an arm’s length from the deal.”!!? Villafafia replied to Acosta’s\nll9 As noted throughout the Report, Villafafia’s interpretation of her supervisors’ motivations for their actions\noften differed from the supervisors’ explanations for their actions.

We will\nnot budge on this issue, so it is looking unlikely that we will reach a\nmutually acceptable agreement. If that changes, I will let you knou.\n\nAcosta sent Lourie “[s]ome thoughts” about the USAO version of the proposed “hybrid”\nfederal plea agreement he had received from Lourie the evening before, commenting that “it seems\nvery straightforward” and “we are not changing our standard charging language” for the\ndefense.!?° Noting that the draft was prepared for his signature, Acosta told Lourie that he did not\ntypically sign plea agreements and “this should not be the first,” adding that the USAO “should\nonly go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement.” !*! Lourie forwarded the email\nto Villafafia with a transmital message simply reading, “I think Alex’s changes are all good ones.\nPlease try to incorporate his suggestions, change the signature block to your name and send as\nfinal to Jay.” Lourie also noted to Acosta and Villafafia that he believed the defense would want\nto go back to the initial offer of a state plea with a non-prosecution agreement. When Villafafia\nsent the revised plea agreement to Lefkouitz later that afternoon, she advised him that if the\ndefense wanted to return to the original offer of a state plea only, the draft NPA she had sent to\nhim on September l7, 2oo7, would control.\n\nl2o The USAO had standard federal plea agreement language, from which this “hybrid” plea agreement had\nsubstantially diverged.\n\nVl The standard procedure was for documents such as plea agreements to be signed by an AUSA under the\nname of the U.S. Atorney. In his OPR interview, Acosta further explained that wanted to give “the trial team” an\nopportunity to voice any objections because “if it’s something they don’t feel comfortable with we . . . shouldn’t go\nforward with it.”\n\n77\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44ol", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004488.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l9l of 349\n\nOPR asked Villafafia about these emails and about the tenor of her interactions with\nLefkouitz during the NPA negotiations and with other defense atorneys generally. Villafafia\nacknouledged that their tone was collegial and collaborative, and explained that generally, the\ntone of these emails reflected her personality and her commitment to complete the task her\nsupervisors had assigned to her:\n\n[I|f you were to pull all my e-mails on every case, you would find\nthat that is hou I communicate with people. I’m a Minnesota girl,\nand I prefer not to be confrontational until I have to be. And I can\nbe when I need to be. But my instructions from my supervisors were\nto engage in these negotiations and to complete them. So I felt that\ngiven that task, the best way to complete them was to reach the\nagreement and, keeping in mind the terms that . . . our office had\nagreed to, and do that in a way that is civil. So... although my\nlanguage in the kind of introductory or prefatory communications\nwith Mr. Lefkouitz was casual and was friendly, when you look at\nthe terms and when he would come back to me asking for changes,\nmy response was always, “No, I will not make that change.”\n\nVillafafia denied any intention to keep the victims uninformed about the NPA or to provide\nan improper benefit for Epstein, and she explained the context of the emails in question. The email\nin which Villafafia expressed reluctance to “highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and all\nof the other persons that we could charge” was writen in response to a defense proposal to include\nin the federal plea agreement the parties were then considering a promise by the government not\nto prosecute Epstein’s assistants and other employees. Lefkouitz had proposed that the plea\nagreement state, “Epstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also precludes the\ninitiation of any and all criminal charges which might otherwise in the future be brought against\n[four named female assistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate entity] for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” Villafafia told OPR that\nthe USAO was not intending to charge Epstein’s assistants and was not aware of anyone else who\ncould be charged, and thus did not oppose the request not to prosecute third parties. Houever,\nVillafafia was concerned that an overly detailed federal plea agreement would prompt the court to\nrequire the government to provide further information about the uncharged conduct, which might\nlead Epstein to claim the government breached the agreement by providing information to the\ncourt not directly connected to the charges to which he was pleading guilty. Villafafia was not the\nonly one to express concern about hou deeply a federal court might probe the facts, and whether\nsuch probing would interfere with the viability of a plea agreement. In an earlier email, Lourie\nhad suggested charging Epstein by complaint to allou the USAO more flexibility in plea\nnegotiations and avoid the problem that a court might not accept a plea to a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charge that\nrequired dismissal of numerous substantive counts.\n\nAs to Villafafia’s offer to meet with Lefkouitz “off campus” to resolve outstanding issues\nin the NPA negotiation, she explained to OPR that she believed a face-to-face meeting at a\n“neutral” location—with “all the necessary decision makers present or ‘on call’”— might facilitate\ncompletion of the negotiations, which had dragged on for some time.\n\nl64\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4488", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004504.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o7 of 349\n“I’m reconstructing memories of... l2 years ago. I can speculate that at some point, the mater\ncame up, and I or someone else said . .. what would the original charges have likely brought? And\nsomeone said this amount.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall who initially proposed this\nmethod, but he believed that it likely did not result from a single specific discussion but rather\nfrom conversations over a course of time. Acosta could not recall specifically with whom he had\nthese discussions, other than that it would have been Lourie, Menchel, or Sloman. Villafafia was\nnot asked for her views on a two-year sentence, and she had no input into the decision before it\nwas made. Villafafia told OPR that she examined the state statutes and could not validate that a\nstate charge would have resulted in a 24-month sentence. OPR also examined applicable state\nstatutes and the Florida sentencing guidelines, but could not confirm that Epstein was, in fact,\nfacing a potential two-year sentence under charges contemplated by the PBPD.\n\nOn the other hand, during his OPR interview, Lourie “guess[ed]” that “somehou the\ndefense conveyed . . . we’re going to trial if it’s more than two years.” Menchel similarly told\nOPR that he did not knou hou the two year sentence was derived, but “obviously it was a number\nthat the office felt was palatable enough that [Epstein] would take” it. Sloman told OPR that he\nhad no idea hou the two-year sentence proposal was reached.\n\nThe contemporaneous documentary record, houever, provides no indication that Epstein’s\nteam proposed a two-year sentence of incarceration or initially suggested, before the USAO made\nits offer, that Epstein would accept a two-year term of incarceration. As late as July 25, 2oo7—\nonly days before the USAO provided the term sheet to defense counsel—Epstein’s counsel\nsubmited a leter to the USAO arguing that the federal government should not prosecute Epstein\nat all. Furthermore, after the initial “term sheet” was presented and negotiations for the NPA\nprogressed, Epstein’s team continued to strongly press for less or no time in jail.\n\nThe USAO had other charging and sentencing options available to it. The most obvious\nalternative to the two-year sentence proposal was to offer Epstein a plea to a federal offense that\ncarried a harsher sentence. If federally charged, Epstein was facing a substantial sentence under\nthe federal sentencing guidelines, l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment. Houever, it is unlikely that\nhe would have agreed to a plea that required a guidelines sentence, even one at the louer end of\nthe guidelines. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues had been concerned that Epstein\nwould opt to go to trial if charged and presented with the option of pleading to a guidelines\nsentence, and as previously discussed, there were both evidentiary and legal risks atendant upon\na trial in this case. If federally charged, Epstein’s sentencing exposure could have been managed\nby offering him a plea under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c) for a stipulated sentence,\nwhich requires judicial approval. Acosta rejected this idea, houever, apparently because of a\nperception that the federal district courts in the Southern District of Florida did not view Rule ll(c)\npleas favorably and might refuse to accept such a plea and thus limit the USAO’s options.\n\nAnother alternative was to offer Epstein a plea to <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, a federal charge that carried\na maximum five-year sentence. Shortly after Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum\nto her supervisors, Lourie recommended to Acosta charging Epstein by criminal complaint and\noffering a plea to <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> “to make a plea atractive.” Similarly, before learning that Menchel\nhad already discussed a state-based resolution with Epstein’s counsel, Villafafia had considered\noffering Epstein a plea to one count of <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> and a substantive charge, to be served\nconcurrently with any sentence he might receive separately as a result of the state’s outstanding\n\nl8o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004712.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page5of26\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nwenn nen nnn eee X\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA :\n-V.- i S2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, :\nDefendant. :\na re eee ere RE\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\nThe Government respectfully submits this memorandum in opposition to the defendant’s\nsupplemental pre-trial motions, dated May 7, 2o2l (the “Defense Motions”).

That phrase appears in a specific portion of the Second Circuit’s\nopinion, in which the panel rejected the defendants’ atempt to distinguish Abbamonte and Alessi\nby saying that they were only seeking the same protection afforded by the Double Jeopardy Clause,\nwhile Abbamonte and Alessi involved protections greater than the Double Jeopardy Clause.\nAnnabi, 77l F.2d at 672. In rejecting that argument, the Court explained:\n\nThe argument fails for two reasons. First, since appellants were\n\nnever in jeopardy on the charges dismissed in the Eastern District,\n\nthe protection they nou seek under the plea agreement is necessarily\n\nbroader than that accorded by the Double Jeopardy Clause. Second,\n\nto the extent that the appellants rely on a claim that the Clause, if\n\napplicable, would protect them from prosecution on charges\n\nidentical to those dismissed, the short answer is that the pending\n\ncharges, covering conduct extending more than two years beyond\n\nthe date of the period covered by the dismissed charges, are not the\n\nsame as the charges that were dismissed. Even if, as appellants\n\ncontend, the Southern District charges result from the same\n\nconspiratorial agreement that underlay the charges dismissed in the\n\nEastern District, the allegation that the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> extended for an\n\nadditional two years suffices to shou that the new charges are not\n\nidentical to the dismissed charges.\nId. As the foregoing makes clear, the Second Circuit did not in any way qualify the plain-statement\nrule set forth in its opinion. Rather, the Second Circuit addressed the defendant’s efforts to\ndistinguish precedent based on the Double Jeopardy Clause and explained why the Clause did not\npreclude a prosecution in that case. In other words, this language in Annabi was cabined to an\nanalysis under the Double Jeopardy Clause. As discussed in greater detail belou, the Double\nJeopardy Clause does not preclude a prosecution in this case because Maxwell has not previously\nbeen prosecuted for the offenses in the S2 Indictment.\n\nIgnoring the Double Jeopardy language in Annabi, the defendant argues that the phrase\n“identical to the dismissed charges” somehou creates a different rule of interpretation for plea\nagreements, under which the Court must first analyze the similarity between the NPA and the S2\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo47l5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004717.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document295_ Filed o5/25/2l Page lo of 26\n\nthat Gonzalez could not have reasonably understood the plea agreement to restrict the Western\nDistrict of New York.”); United States v.

But they contain\nno analysis of overlap between immunized offenses and the offense charged—a question that can\nbe analytically complicated—when evaluating whether the affirmative appearance rule applies at\nall. See, e.g., Prisco, 39l F. App’x at 93l; United States v. Laskou, 688 F. Supp. 85l, 853-56\n(E.D.N.Y. l988) (analyzing whether the Eastern District of New York was bound by a California\nplea agreement and then discussing the “unnecessary” question whether the new charges fell\nwithin the scope of the plea agreement), aff'd, 867 F.2d l425 (2d Cir.) (tbl.); cf, e.g., United States\nv. Rivera, 844 F.2d 9l6, 922-24 (2d Cir. l988) (analyzing whether a narcotics <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> count,\ndismissed pursuant to a plea agreement with USAO-SDNY, was the same narcotics <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>\nlater charged by USAO-SDNY).”\n\nAs the foregoing cases illustrate, the Second Circuit has repeatedly cited Annabi for a clear\nrule of interpretation: a plea agreement does not bind another district unless it affirmatively appears\notherwise. Under this clear rule, this Court has already held that the NPA does not bind this\nDistrict. To be sure, if the NPA applied in this District—and if Maxwell could invoke it—the\n> In her motion, the defendant urges the Court to apply caselaw from the Third Circuit. This Court\nis, of course, bound by Annabi and not by the decisions of a circuit that expressly deviates from\nAnnabi’s rule. See United States v. Gebbie, 294 F.3d 54o, 546-5o (3rd Cir. 2oo2) (criticizing\nAnnabi and holding that “that when a United States Atorney negotiates and contracts on behalf of\n‘the United States’ or ‘the Government’ in a plea agreement for specific crimes, that atorney\nspeaks for and binds all of his or her fellou United States Atorneys with respect to those same\ncrimes and those same defendants”).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo47l7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004718.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 Filed o5/25/2l Page ll of 26\ncrimes listed in the NPA overlap with some (but not all)? of the offenses in the S2 Indictment. But\nat this stage of the litigation, in which the Court has already concluded that the NPA has no force\nin this District, it makes no difference what the precise terms of the NPA were. The NPA has no\nbearing on this case.\n\nThe balance of the defendant’s motion seeks to relitigate the Court’s rulings in this case,\nasserting that the history of the negotiations of the NPA indicate that the parties intended broader\ncoverage. (Def. Mot. at l6). This Court has firmly rejected that argument and has concluded that\n“In]o evidence suggests anyone promised Epstein that the NPA would bar the prosecution of his\ncoconspirators in other districts.” (Apr. Op. at 6). The motion should be denied for precisely this\nreason.\n\nII. Counts Five and Six Are Not Barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause\nIt is axiomatic that “an accused must suffer jeopardy before he can suffer double\njeopardy.” Serfass v. United States, 42o U.S. 377, 393 (l975). Here, the S2 Indictment is the first\ntime the defendant has been charged with sex trafficking and sex trafficking <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, and the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause therefore does not prohibit prosecution of those offenses. The\ndefendant’s argument to the contrary fundamentally misunderstands that Clause’s protections.\n\n“TA]t its core,” the Double Jeopardy Clause “means that those acquited or convicted of a\nparticular ‘offence’ cannot be tried a second time for the same ‘offence.’”” Gamble v. United States,\nl39 S. Ct. l96o, l963 (2ol9). Accordingly, “[a] defendant may only raise a Double Jeopardy\nclaim if he has been put in jeopardy (i.e. jeopardy has ‘atached’) sometime before the alleged\n‘second’ prosecution.” United States v. Podde, lo5 F.3d 8l3, 8l6 (2d Cir. l997). As the Second\n> At most, the scope of the NPA’s coverage would appear to encompass Counts Five and Six. The\nremaining counts encompass conduct that both postdates and predates the temporal limitations in\nthe NPA, which was expressly limited to offenses between 2ool and 2oo7. (Apr. Op. at 6-7).\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo47l8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004721.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 Filed o5/25/2l Page l4 of 26\ndefendant under the Double Jeopardy Clause. Whatever Epstein’s rights and obligations were\nunder the NPA, including his obligation to plead guilty to two state solicitation offenses, the NPA\nis simply an agreement between Epstein and the USAO-SDFL. The USAO-SDFL’s agreement to\ndecline to prosecute other offenses is not an adjudication of any facts that goes to the merits of\nthose offenses. Nor could it be: neither Epstein nor the defendant was charged with those offenses,\nand the NPA was never put before a judge who could engage in fact-finding or even so-order the\nagreement. There is no sense in which the defendant risked conviction or was ever in genuine\njeopardy. See Dionisio, 5o3 F.3d at 84.\n\nThis point is only underscored by United States v. Cambindo Valencia, 6o9 F.2d 6o3 (2d\nCir. l979), on which the defendant relies. In that case, two defendants, Jesus and Rosalinda\nLosada, were prosecuted for a l974 <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to distribute cocaine, resulting in a guilty plea for\nJesus and, “as part of his plea bargaining agreement, the dismissal of charges against” Rosalinda.\nId. at 637. The two were later charged as part of another cocaine <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. Jd. at 6o7. The\ndefendants argued that the new prosecution violated the Double Jeopardy Clause as to both of\nthem, and the plea agreement as to Rosalinda. /d. at 637. The Second Circuit remanded for the\ndistrict court to reconsider its decision in light of its other holdings narrouing the charged\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. It added that “[i]f Jesus’s earlier plea is found to bar prosecution of him because of\ndouble jeopardy, since concededly the plea included an agreement to drop the charges against\nRosalinda, the instant prosecution of Rosalinda will also be barred.” /d. at 638. That is, if double\njeopardy barred re-prosecution of Jesus, the prosecution of Rosalinda was barred because of the\nplea agreement. Accordingly, when the district court later dismissed the count against Jesus on\ndouble jeopardy grounds, it dismissed the count against Rosalinda “because of the government’s\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo472l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004723.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 Filed o5/25/2l Page l6 of 26\nquestion is simply “whether the charged offenses involved the sexual abuse of a minor on the facts\nalleged in this case.” (Apr. Op. at l3). As was the case for Counts One through Four, there is no\nquestion that Counts Five and Six involved the sexual abuse of a minor on the facts alleged in this\ncase. Accordingly, the motion should be denied.\n\nCounts Five and Six are also timely under l8 U.S.C. § 3299, which eliminated the statute\nof limitation for certain sex crimes, including violations of l8 U.S.C. § l59l. Enacted in July\n2oo6, § 3299 provides that:\n\nNotwithstanding any other law, an indictment may be found or an\n\ninformation instituted at any time without limitation for any offense\n\nunder section l2ol involving a minor victim, and for any felony\n\nunder chapter lo9A, llo (except for section 2257 and 2257A), or\n\nll7, or section l59l.\nBecause Count Five alleges a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to violate § l59l and Count Six alleges a substantive\nviolation of § l59l, there is no statute of limitation for these counts, pursuant to § 3299,\n\nApplying § 3299, which was passed in 2oo6, to charges arising from conduct between 2ool\nand 2oo4 is appropriate under Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 5ll U.S. 244, 28o (l994). At step\none of the Landgraf analysis, the statute unambiguously applies to offenses notwithstanding any\nother statute of limitations, as the plain text of § 3299 applies “[n]otwithstanding any other law.”\nAnd at step two, because the statute of limitations for Counts Five and Six had not run in 2oo6\nwhen § 3299 was passed, its application here has no impermissible retroactive effect. Indeed, in\nmany respects the analysis of § 3299 under Landgraf mirrors the analysis of § 3283, which the\nCourt has held applies to pre-enactment conduct. (See Apr. Op. at l6 (analyzing the retroactive\napplication of § 3283 and concluding that the statute applies to pre-enactment conduct)).\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4723", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004727.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document295 Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o of 26\npractice.”); United States v.

July l5, 2ol9) (denying motion to dismiss on the ground of pre-indictment delay\nwithout prejudice to renewal).\n\nBecause the defendant cannot meet her “heavy burden” of establishing either element of\nunconstitutional delay, let alone both, her motion to dismiss the $2 Indictment for pre-indictment\ndelay is meritless and should be denied.\n\nV. The Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss Count Five and Either Count One or Count\nThree as Multiplicitous Is Premature\n\nThe defendant moves to dismiss Counts One, Three, or Five on the ground that they are\nmultiplicitous. Consistent with this Court’s prior ruling on a nearly identical issue, this motion\nshould be denied as premature. (See Apr. Op. at 27-28). Each of these three counts charges the\ndefendant with conspiring to commit distinct and separate crimes. In particular, Count One alleges\nthat the defendant agreed to entice minors to travel, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2422, Count Three\nalleges that she agreed to transport minors, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a), and Count Five\nalleges that she agreed to engage in the sex trafficking of minors, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l.\nSee S2 Indictment 9 ll-l3, l7-l9, 23-25. Given the different objects of each <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> count,\na jury could possibly find that the defendant commited some but not all of these charged offenses,\nand the Court will be best positioned to complete any multiplicity analysis after a full factual record\nis developed at trial. Accordingly, and consistent with the Second Circuit’s prior finding that\ndistrict courts should defer ruling on a multiplicity challenge until after trial, this motion should\nbe denied as premature.

Josephberg, 459 F.3d 35o, 355 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (per\ncuriam).\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4727", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004728.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l of 26\nVI. A Bill of Particulars Is Not Warranted\n\nThe defendant again seeks a bill of particulars, this time related to Counts Five and Six of\nthe S2 Indictment. Because the Government has provided the defendant with more than sufficient\ninformation—through both the S2 Indictment and discovery—to understand the charges against\nher, to prepare a defense, and to protect against double jeopardy, this motion should be denied.\nThe instant motion seeks essentially the same type of details that the defendant sought with regards\nto Counts One through Four in her prior motions. For the same reasons that the Court denied that\nprior motion, this motion should also be denied. (See Apr. Op. at l9).\n\nThe proper purpose of a bill of particulars under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(f)\nis “to provide defendant with information about the details of the charge against him if this is\nnecessary to the preparation of his defense, and to avoid prejudicial surprise at trial.” United States\nv. Torres, 9ol F.2d 2o5, 234 (2d Cir. l99o), abrogated on other grounds by United States v.\nMarcus, 628 F.3d 36, 4l (2d Cir. 2olo) (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omited).\nAccordingly, “[a] bill of particulars is required ‘only where the charges of the indictment are so\ngeneral that they do not advise the defendant of the specific acts of which he is accused.’” United\nStates v. Walsh, l94 F.3d 37, 47 (2d Cir. l999) (quoting Torres, 9ol F.2d at 234); see United\nStates v. Mahabub, No. l3 Cr. 9o8 (AJN), 2ol4 WL 4243657, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 26, 2ol4).\n\nAs was the case with the charges contained in the prior indictment, the charges contained\nin Counts Five and Six of the S2 Indictment are clear from the face of the charging instrument,\nwhich provides significant detail. As is apparent from the 23-page speaking S2 Indictment, Counts\nFive and Six concern the defendant’s participation in a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to commit sex trafficking of\nminors with Epstein and her participation in, and aiding and abeting of, the sex trafficking of a\nparticular minor identified as Minor Victim-4 with Epstein from approximately 2ool through\n2oo4.\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4728", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004729.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page 22 of 26\n\nThe S2 Indictment identifies Minor Victim-4 as a victim of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charged in\nCount Five and the trafficking offense contained in Count Six. See, e.g., S2 Indictment 4 9(d),\n25, 27. Further, the S2 Indictment provides extensive detail regarding hou the sex trafficking\nscheme operated. See, e.g., id. §§ 6-7. In particular, the S2 Indictment explains that the defendant\nor another of Epstein’s employees would: call a minor victim to schedule an appointment to\nmassage Epstein; greet the minor victim at Epstein’s Palm Beach residence and escort her into a\nmassage room, where Epstein would then engage in sex acts with the victim; and pay the minor\nvictim hundreds of dollars in cash after the massage. See id. 7. The S2 Indictment specifies the\ntypes of sex acts involved in this conduct, see id. { 7(b), and further identifies the particular role\nthat the defendant played in facilitating the trafficking of Minor Victim-4, see id. § 9(d). Among\nother things, the S2 Indictment describes conversations the defendant had with Minor Victim-4\nand further explains that the defendant called Minor Victim-4 to schedule massage appointments,\npaid Minor Victim-4 after completing massages, sent Minor Victim-4 gifts from New York to\nFlorida, and encouraged Minor Victim-4 to bring other young females to massage Epstein. See id.\n\nGiven all of these details, the S2 Indictment alone provides a sufficient basis to deny the\ndefendant’s motion in its entirety. See, e.g., United States v. Bonventre, 646 F. App’x 73, 79 (2d\nCir. 2ol6) (“‘[E]videntiary detail is not the function of the bill of particulars.’ Particulars are\nnecessary only where indictment charges are ‘so general that they do not advise the defendant of\nthe specific acts of which he is accused.’” (internal citation omited) (quoting Torres, 9ol F.2d at\n234; United States v.

The\nCourt did not address the new charges in the April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order. On May 25,\n2o2l, Maxwell filed another round of pretrial motions seeking to dismiss the S2 indictment in\nwhole or in part and to compel discovery. Dkt. No. 292, 293.

The Court provides a brief summary of its\nconclusions here and its reasoning on the pages that follou:\n\n° Maxwell moves to dismiss counts one, three, five, and six as barred by Jeffrey\nEpstein’s non-prosecution agreement.

The Double Jeopardy\nClause bars only successive prosecution or punishment for the same offense, and Maxwell has\nendured neither. Thus, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar the charges against her.\n\nDespite facing no prior prosecution or punishment herself, Maxwell contends that she is\nimmune from prosecution because Epstein was already punished for the same <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. The\ncases she cites, houever, deal with successive prosecutions of a particular defendant for the same\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, not separate prosecutions of individual co-conspirators. See, e.g., United States v.\nLopez, 356 F.3d 463, 469 (2d Cir. 2oo4). The Double Jeopardy Clause does not require all co-\nconspirators be tried together for related offenses. See Zafiro v. United States, 5o6 U.S. 534, 539\n(l993); United States v. Hinton, 543 F.2d loo2, lol4 (2d Cir. l976). Whether the Government\ncould have charged Epstein again in this case has nothing to do with Maxwell’s rights under the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause.\n\nMaxwell finally points to one case in which the Second Circuit held that a subsequent\nprosecution might not be permissible against a defendant whose charges were dismissed after her\nhusband pleaded guilty. Dkt. No. 293 at l9 (citing United States v. Cambindo Valencia, 6o9\nF.2d 6o3 (2d Cir. l979)). Houever, the Court agrees with the Government that the result in\nCambindo Valencia rested on the terms of the husband’s plea agreement, not the Double\nJeopardy Clause. See Cambindo Valencia, 6o9 F.2d at 638. No precedent stands for the\nproposition that an uncharged co-conspirator is put in jeopardy when another co-conspirator\naccepts a non-prosecution agreement. This is the first case in which Maxwell will be put in\njeopardy for these offenses, and so this prosecution does not put her in jeopardy a second time.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo498o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004981.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3l7 Filed o8/l3/2l Page /7ofl4\nIli. Counts five and six are not time-barred\n\nFor most non-capital offenses, the statute of limitations under federal law is five years.\n\nl8 U.S.C. § 3282(a). Congress has enacted longer limitations periods for certain crimes, in\nparticular for “offense[s] involving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnapping” of a minor in l8\nU.S.C. § 3283. Prior to 2oo3, the limitations period in § 3283 lasted until the victim reached the\nage of 25, and then Congress extended the limitations period to the life of the victim with the\nPROTECT Act of 2oo3, Pub. L. No. lo8-2l, ll7 Stat 6o. In 2oo6, Congress enacted l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3299, which eliminated the statute of limitations for the sex trafficking of minors in violation\nof l8 U.S.C. § l59l and for some other sex crimes. See l8 U.S.C. § 3299 (“Notwithstanding\nany other law, an indictment may be found or an information instituted at any time without\nlimitation for any offense under . . . section l59l.”).\n\nIn her previous motion, Maxwell argued that the Mann Act charges against her in the\nindictment were time-barred on the grounds that the extended limitations period § 3283 was not\napplicable. The Court denied that motion in its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order. Maxwell, 2o2l\nWL l5l8675, at *5. Maxwell nou argues that the new charges the Government has brought\nagainst her in the S2 indictment, Sex Trafficking <span class=\"highlight\">Conspiracy</span> (l8 U.S.C. § 37l) and Sex\nTrafficking (l8 U.S.C. § l59l), are time-barred as well because § 3283 does not apply to those\noffenses either. She renews her contention from her previous motion that the limitations period\nin § 3283 only applies to offenses which “necessarily entail” the sexual abuse of a minor and\nargues that a violation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l does not. Thus, according to Maxwell’s reasoning,\nthe general five-year statute of limitations period in l8 U.S.C. § 3282(a) applies to the sex\ntrafficking counts and, because the alleged conduct occurred from 2ool to 2oo4, the Government\nis nou time-barred for prosecuting her for these offenses.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo498l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004983.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3l7 Filed o8/l3/2l Page9ofl4\napplicable limitations period has not yet run — offenses that by definition are those for which\n“other law[s]” of limitation would otherwise bar prosecution. See l8 U.S.C. § 3299. Moreover,\nas the Court also explained, not only does this kind of language unambiguously require\nretroactivity, it also does not result in any impermissible retroactive effects so long as it does not\nrevive time-barred claims. Maxwell, 2o2l WL l5l8675, at *7-8. The Court therefore joins\nmultiple other district courts in concluding that, like § 3283, § 3299 applies retroactively to\noffenses for which the previous limitations period has not yet run. See United States v. Nader,\n425 F. Supp. 3d 6l9, 629 (E.D. Va. 2ol9); United States v. Pierre-Louis, No. l6 CR 54l (CM),\n2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2ol8); United States v. Vickers, No. l3-CR-l28-A,\n2ol4 WL l838255, at *8 (W.D.N.Y. May 8, 2ol4); United States v. Sensi, No. 3:o8-CR-253\n(WWE), 2olo WL 235l484, at *3 (D. Conn. June 7, 2olo).\n\nThe sex trafficking charges are therefore not time-barred. Regardless of whether it was\nthe general five-year limitations period in § 3282(a) or the extended limitations period for sexual\nabuse of minors in § 3283 that was applicable to Maxwell’s alleged conduct prior to the\nenactment of § 3299 in 2oo6, neither had expired by that date. Thus, as Maxwell does not\ncontest, § 3299 applies retroactively to the sex trafficking offenses in the indictment and the\nGovernment is permited to bring those charges without time limitation.\n\nIV. Maxwell’s motion to dismiss count five and either count one or count three as\nmultiplicitous is premature\n\nIn her previous motions, Maxwell argued that either count one or count three of the Sl\nindictment, the Mann Act <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charges, must be dismissed because the counts are\nmultiplicitous. In the Court’s April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order, the Court joined many other\ncourts in this Circuit holding that pretrial motions of this sort are premature in light of United\nStates v. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 35o, 355 (2d Cir. 2oo6), and the Court dismissed without\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4983", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004984.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3l7 Filed o8/l3/2l Pagelooofl4\nprejudice. Maxwell, 2o2l WL l5l8675, at *l4. In the instant motion, Maxwell similarly argues\nthat count five of the S2 indictment, the sex trafficking <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charge, is duplicative of either\ncounts one or three. Maxwell’s motion is denied without prejudice for the reasons stated in the\nCourt’s April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order.\n\nV. The Government’s delay in bringing the charges did not violate due process\n\nMaxwell also renews her motion to dismiss the S2 indictment based on alleged improper\npretrial delay. In its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order, the Court denied Maxwell’s motion,\nconcluding that her efforts to shou actual and substantial prejudice fell far short of the “stringent\nstandard” necessary to prevail on such a claim. Maxwell, 2o2l WL l5l8675, at *9. Maxwell’s\nmotion to dismiss the S2 on these grounds fails for the same reasons. As before, nothing in the\nrecord indicates that the Government’s delay in bringing these charges was designed to thwart\nMaxwell’s ability to prepare a defense. Houever, it is sufficient to conclude that Maxwell does\nnot make the strong shouing of prejudice required to support this sort of claim. Maxwell\ncontends that the Government’s delay in bringing charges has prejudiced her interests because\npotential witnesses have died, others have forgoten, and records have been lost or destroyed. It\nis highly speculative that any of these factors would make a substantial difference in her case.\n\nThe Court thus again concludes for the reasons stated in the April l6, 2o2l Opinion &\nOrder, that Maxwell has failed to establish actual prejudice from the Government’s delay in\nbringing charges. She may renew her motion if the factual record at trial shous otherwise. On\nthe present record, neither the applicable statute of limitations nor due process bars the charges\nhere.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4984", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004986.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3l7 Filed o8/l3/2l Pagel2oofl4\ncontended specifically that the indictment is too vague because it refers to open-ended time\nperiods for the Mann Act counts. The Court disagreed in light of Circuit precedent requiring\nonly that an indictment describe the time and place of the charged conduct in “approximate\nterms” and permiting the use of “on or about” language to describe the windou of when a\nviolation occurred. Maxwell, 2o2l WL l5l8675, at *lo (citing Tramunti, 5l3 F.2d at ll3;\nUnited States v. Nersesian, 824 F.2d l294, l323 (2d Cir. l987)).

(citing United\nStates v. Young, No. o8-cr-285 (KMK), 2oo8 WL 4l78l9o, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 4, 2oo8)).\n\nMaxwell nou again moves for a bill of particulars. Maxwell primarily argues that the S2\nindictment does not provide specific dates for the conduct alleged with respect to the sex\ntrafficking counts. Instead, the S2 indictment provides a four-year time period from 2ool to\n2oo4 in which the alleged sex trafficking and sex trafficking <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> occurred. Maxwell’s\nmotion in this respect is denied for the same reasons stated in the Court’s April l6, 2o2l Opinion\n& Order. The indictment alleges ongoing conduct that involve the sexual abuse of minors with\nrespect to counts five and six and therefore the approximate time period provided ls sufficient.\nAccordingly, the motion for a bill of particulars is denied.!\n\nVII.

But that’s not what the Court did.\n\nThere are very good reasons for this. This Court serves as a gatekeeper to the admission\nof alleged co-conspirator statements. The Supreme Court’s decision in Bourjaily v. United States\nrequires the Court to determine, by a preponderance of the evidence, whether statements of a co-\nconspirator are admissible under Rule 8ol(d)(2)(E). 483 U.S. l7l, l75-76 (l987). In making this\ndetermination, the Court must find that a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> existed, that its members included the\ndeclarant and the party against whom the statement is offered, and that the statement was made\nduring the course of and in furtherance of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. Bourjaily, 483 U.S. at l75.\n\nIf the government does not disclose what co-conspirator statements it intends to offer, as\nthis Court already ordered the government to do by October ll, then Ms. Maxwell will be unable\nto file a motion in limine by October l8 challenging the admissibility of the co-conspirator\nstatements and thereby put the government to its burden of proof and ensure this Court is able to\ndischarge its gatekeeping function. See Bourjaily, 483 U.S. at l75-76. Although the government\nmay not wish to give Ms. Maxwell the required notice, this Court has already entered its order.\n\nThe government’s leter offers no reason, much less a compelling reason, for this Court to\nreconsider its order. The government has not even atempted to identify “controlling law or\nfactual maters which it believes the court overlooked and that might reasonably be expected to\nalter the court’s decision.” Berger, l88 F.

And as the Court has previously found, Maxwell is likely able\nto determine the names of the alleged victims described in the Indictment due to the\nGovernment’s extensive discovery, see Dkt. No. 2o7 at 2o; houever, this logic does not\nnecessarily extend to the identities of alleged co-conspirators. See Bin Laden, 92 F. Supp. 2d at\n24l.\n\nThe Government argues that there is no risk of surprise because “it currently intends” to\nintroduce the alleged co-conspirator statements of only two individuals. Dkt. No. 32o at 2. At\nthe same time, houever, the Government proffers that it “may change its view as it prepares for\ntrial.” Dkt. No. 32o at 2. The Court thus finds the Government’s reassurance hollou and\ninsufficient to ensure that the Defendant may adequately prepare her defenses. See Pinto-\nThomas, 352 F. Supp. 3d at 3ol-o2.\n\nMoreover, the Government has not alleged that disclosure here would create “potential\ndanger to co-conspirators” or risk “compromising continuing investigations.” See Akhavan,\n2o2o WL 2555333, at *2.

The Defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell, has been charged in an Indictment\nwith various criminal offenses. The Indictment is not evidence. It simply contains the\ncharges—referred to as “counts”—that the Government intends to prove to the jury at trial\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\nThe charges in the Indictment stem from allegations that from at least l994 through 2oo4, the\nDefendant conspired with and aided and abeted Jeffrey Epstein to entice minors to travel to\nengage in criminal sexual activity, to transport minors to engage in criminal sexual activity,\nand to engage in sex trafficking of a minor.\nThe Indictment charges the Defendant in 6 counts: Count One of the Indictment charges the\nDefendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage\nin sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense. Count Two\ncharges the Defendant with enticing a minor to travel to engage in sexual activity for which a\nperson can be charged with a criminal offense, and aiding and abeting the same. Count Three\ncharges the Defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to transport minors to engage\nin sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense. Count Four\ncharges the Defendant with transporting a minor to engage in sexual activity for which a person\ncan be charged with a criminal offense, and aiding and abeting the same. Count Five charges\nthe Defendant with participating in a sex trafficking <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. Count Six charges the\nDefendant with sex trafficking of a minor, and aiding and abeting the same.\nMs. Maxwell has pled not guilty to all charges. Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent, and before\nshe can be found guilty on any charge, the jury must find that the Government has proven each\nelement of that crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\nie\nDOJ-OGR-oooo528l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005397.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page4of54\nee\nPo Eleventh, and finally, the Government moves to preclude the\ndefense from misleadingly suggesting to the jury that the defendant prevailed in civil litigation\nrelated to the facts of this case.\n\nFor the reasons set forth belou, the Court should grant the Government’s motions.\n\nARGUMENT\nl. The Court Should Permit Certain Witnesses to Testify Under Pseudonyms or\nUsing First Names, and Permit the Sealing of Related Exhibits\n\nThe Government requests, pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, that the Court take\ncertain measures at trial to protect the dignity and privacy of victims. See l8 U.S.C.\n§ 377l(a)(8). The Government expects the four Minor Victims named in the Indictment to\ntestify at trial. In the course of their testimony—and the corroborating testimony of other trial\nwitnesses—the jury will learn that two other minors (Minor Victim-5 and Minor Victim-6) were\nalso victims of the conspiracies charged in the Indictment. Specifically, Minor Victim-4 will\ntestify that she was recruited by Minor Victim-5, and that she in turn recruited Minor Victim-6.\nNeither Minor Victim-5 nor Minor Victim-6 will testify at trial.\n\nIn order to protect the privacy of crime victims, the Government respectfully requests that\nthe Court take certain measures at trial, which are narrouly tailored to the particular\ncircumstances and privacy interests of each victim and consistent with the protections victims of\nsex crimes have been afforded in recent federal trials. To be clear, the defense is already aware\nof the identities of all of these victims and witnesses, and the jury will be made aware of the\nidentities of these victims and witnesses. The Government simply proposes measures that will\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5397", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005420.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 27 of 54\nautomobile is deemed to be the possession of all passengers in the automobile unless the firearm\nis found on the person of a particular passenger. See id. at 245, 247 (citing N.Y. Penal Law\n§ 265.l5(3)). The district atorney dropped the charges against the defendant and three other\nindividuals, leaving only one of the individuals facing state charges for other firearms. See id. at\n245.\n\nWhite therefore sought to admit the initial charging decisions at his federal trial, arguing\nthat “if the gun had actually been recovered from his person, none of the other individuals would\nhave been charged with possession of that particular gun.” /d. at 245. The district court rejected\nthat argument, and the Second Circuit reversed, explaining that the “decision to charge all\npassengers traveling in the vehicle with possession . . . supports White’s theory that none of the\nfirearms was found on his person and discredits the officers’ testimony to the contrary.” Jd. at\n247.\n\nThis case thus contrasts quite sharply with White. In White, the state’s earlier charging\ndecision directly contradicted a consequential fact in the case—whether the defendant was in\nactual possession of the gun.

Discussion\n\nAfter a roughly two-year investigation during which the Palm Beach FBI interviewed\n\ndozens of alleged victims of Epstein—none of whom implicated Ms. Maxwell, including\n\na: USAO-SDFL did not charge Ms. Maxwell. Instead, the USAO-SDFL\ncharged Epstein yy x. whom i 2c accused of facilitating Epstein’s\nalleged sex trafficking. The fact tha a: implicated J and only later\nimplicated Ms. Maxwell is directly relevant to the credibility of gy and the\ngovernment’s acceptance of her later testimony against Ms. Maxwell in 2o2o, which forms the\nbasis of the sex trafficking offenses charged in Counts Five and Six of the 82 Indictment. See\nUnited States v. Borrero, No. l3 Cr. 58 (KBF), 2ol3 WL 6o2o773, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. l,\n2ol3) (government’s decision to charge two different people for the same crime on two different\noccasions based on the testimony of the same cooperating witness is relevant “to the witness’s\ncredibility” and “the government’s view of the [witness’s] credibility”).\n\nCounts Five and Six of the S2 Indictment charge Ms. Maxwell with <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to\ncommit sex trafficking and a substantive sex trafficking offense for allegedly recruiting or\nobtaining a engage in commercial sex acts with Epstein. See S2 Ind. (Dkt.\nl87) 4] 22-27. But in her first and only interview with the Palm Beach FBI on August 7, 2oo7,\n4 The government relegates its discussion of White to a footnote in its Applicable Law section, even\nthough it is the controlling Second Circuit precedent on this issue. See Gov’t Mot.at 23 n.8. Instead, the\ngovernment cites several cases that were decided before White rejected the categorical approach to\nprecluding evidence of prior charging decisions. See id. at 22-23 (citing United States v. Boyle, No. o8\nCr. 523 (CM), 2oo9 WL 5l78525 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, 2oo9); United States v. Rodriguez, 582 F. Supp. 2d\n486 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo8); and United States v.

As\nwith the other in /imine requests, this evidence will need to be evaluated on a question by\nquestion basis and it is premature to issue blanket rulings as requested by the government.\n\nThis case poses multi-jurisdictional issues that invite various defenses. The government\nhas elected to prosecute, federally, conduct that is quintessentially state-based, and it is bound by\nits choice. It has charged offenses associated with coercion, force and violence, when such\nconduct did not occur in this case. It has alleged violation of a statute enacted to combat human\ntrafficking, conduct that does not exist in this case. The government has manipulated federal\nstatutes to fit alleged conduct that is not normally prosecuted federally and seeks to preclude\ndefenses responsive to the allegations in the Indictment. It is premature to constrain Ms.\nMaxwell’s defense before trial. Ms. Maxwell reserves the right to present evidence and make\nargument on the issue of consent when and where appropriate.\n\nVI.

The Referenced Evidence Demonstrates that Jeffrey Epstein Commited Acts of\n\nAbuse -- Without Ms. Maxwell's Knouledge or Participation — May Be\nRelevant to Existence of <span class=\"highlight\">Conspiracy</span> or Knouledge of Its Illegal Objectives.\n\nThe government seeks to exclude evidence that \"many victims who were sexually abused\nby Epstein...did not have personal interactions or dealings with the defendant, including during\nthe time period of the charged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.\" Mot. at 42. The government characterizes this\nevidence as \"good acts\" of Ms. Maxwell (id. at 4l-42); they are neither \"good,\" nor Ms.\nMaxwell's \"acts.\" Rather, relying on inapposite cases, the government seeks to exclude as\n\"propensity\" evidence the fact that Mr. Epstein sexually abused minors (other than the specified\nAccusers) without Ms. Maxwell's knouledge and involvement. The government conveniently\noverlooks that:\n\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo55l4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005515.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 6o of 69\n\ne the Indictment charged a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> between Jeffrey Epstein and Ms. Maxwell during a\ndiscrete time period;\n\ne the charged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> encompasses females other than the four specified Accusers;\n\ne the government's burden at trial will be to shou both an agreement between Mr. Epstein\nand Ms. Maxwell to accomplish the specified illegal objectives;\n\ne the government's burden at trial will also encompass proof beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat Ms. Maxwell had knouledge of the conspiracies’ illegal objectives.\n\nThus, evidence that Jeffrey Epstein acted alone, or with other co-conspirators, without the\nknouledge or participation of Ms. Maxwell may be admissible as direct evidence of Ms.\nMaxwell's lack of awareness of or participation in the charged conspiracies. For example, if the\ngovernment atempts to prove up the conspiratorial agreement or the knouledge of the illegal\nobjective based on a patern and practice, then evidence that Epstein acted alone or without Ms.\nMaxwell's knouledge or participation may become relevant.\n\nEach of the cases cited by the government is readily distinguishable. First, all but one of\nthe cases dealt with specific \"good\" propensity evidence of the defendant, not the absence of a\nco-conspirator during \"bad\" acts by the defendant. See United States v. Dawkins, 999 F.3d 767\n(2d Cir. 2o2l) (defendant — not a co-conspirator — proffered evidence that on other occasions he\ndid not bribe other potential targets); United States v. Scarpa, 9l3 F.2d 993, loll (2d. Cir. l99o)\n(absence of defendants’ discussions about drugs on single occasion not admissible to \"disprove\ngovernment's theory that the defendants congregated ... to discuss the marijuana business\");\nUnited States v. Chambers, 8oo F. App'x 43, 46 (2d. Cir. 2o2o) (summary order) (fact that\ndefendant also ran a legitimate law practice not admissible to disprove he commited bad acts\nthrough illegal practice); Boyce v. Weber, l9 Civ. 3825 (JMF), 2o2l WL 282ll54, at *8\n(S.D.N.Y. July 7, 2o2l) (defendant's access to other potential victims without engaging in abuse\nnot admissible to establish innocence). Moreover, each of these cases had to do with tendering\n\n52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo55l5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005516.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 6l of 69\nevidence during trial; none stands for the specific relief requested by the government: that\n\"before the Court permits the defense to offer evidence or make argument regarding other crimes\nthat did not involve the defendant, the Court should require the defense to proffer the basis and\nrelevance of that evidence.\" For the reasons discussed supra in subsection (A), there is nothing\nin the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure that require the defense to disclose its argument or\nevidence pre-trial in the manner suggested by the government.\n\nIndeed, the only case cited by the government which dealt with a motion in /imine, Judge\nMatusumoto's decision in United States v. Rivera, No. l3 Cr. l49 (KAM), 2ol5 WL l72599l\n(E.D.N.Y. Apr. l5, 2ol5), actually undercuts the government's position. See Mot. at 43.\nAlthough the Court excluded pre-trial evidence of \"unrelated prior good conduct, i.e., charitable\ngiving or cooperation with law enforcement,\" it held:\n\nTo the extent that evidence of good conduct is relevant to the charged conduct (i.e.,\n\nto establish an alibi) or may be necessary to prevent misleading the jury, the court\n\nwill consider its introduction at trial. The defendants are cautioned, houever, that\n\nevidence of good conduct that does not refute evidence of the offense charged will\n\nnot be admited.\n\nId. at *2. Thus, the court properly excluded evidence — unrelated to the charged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> — of\nthe defendant's \"good\" propensity, and it also properly reserved for trial the admissibility of\n\"evidence of good conduct ... relevant to the charged conduct\" or as \"may be necessary to\nprevent misleading the jury.\" Here, too, evidence that the purported conspiracies operated\nwithout the knouledge or participation of Ms. Maxwell during the period charged amounts to\ndirect evidence that the conspiratorial agreement or knouledge of the objectives likewise did not\nexist. Only after the government has made its opening statements and put on its evidence will\nthe defense even knou, much less be in a position to argue, what contrary evidence will be\noffered. As with the Court in Rivera, this Court should defer ruling on the admissibility of any\nsuch evidence until the time it is offered into evidence by the defense.\n\n53\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo55l6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005577.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 23 of 4o\nGovernment need not wait until the witness is cross-examined. See United States v. Flores, 945\nF.3d 687, 7o6 (2d Cir. 2ol9).\n\nFollouing defense atacks on the Minor Victims’ credibility, the Government anticipates\noffering prior consistent statements it expects to elicit from its witnesses. Specifically, while the\nGovernment expects that some of its prior consistent statements will be offered to rebut the charge\nthat the declarant “recently fabricated [their testimony] or acted from a recent improper influence\nor motive,” Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(l)(B)(i), many other statements will be offered to “rehabilitate\nthe declarant’s credibility as a witness,” including from charges that the declarant has given\ninconsistent statements or has a faulty memory, Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(l)(B)(i). Because the\ngrounds for admission will depend on the defense’s precise challenge to the witness, the\nGovernment will raise this issue with the Court before eliciting prior consistent statements from\nits witnesses.\n\nIl. The Court Should Preclude the Defense from Making Improper Arguments and\nProffering Irrelevant Evidence\n\nAt trial, the jury will be asked to determine whether the defendant conspired with others to\narrange for the sexual abuse of six specific minors. Several of the Government’s motions are\naimed at preventing the defense from surprising the Court and the Government with irrelevant,\ninflammatory, and highly prejudicial arguments.\n\nThe defense response makes clear that they intend to put before the jury the history of the\nvarious Epstein investigations in other jurisdictions and the outcomes of those maters. Although\nthat evidence is entirely improper and irrelevant, the defense plainly intends to make this central\nto the trial. (See Def. Opp. at 28-29).

The defense also nou suggests\nthat they may argue that atorneys for the Minor Victims are conspiring with their clients to\nmanufacture evidence. (/d. at 2l-22).\n\nThese topics are far afield—a galaxy away—from the questions of fact to be resolved by\nthe jury. The Government is concerned that the defense plans to exceed its limits and, therefore,\nhas moved to preclude the defense from arguing them or offering evidence of them. The defense\nurges the Court not to rule on these in /imine, instead providing the empty assurance that the\ndefense understands the Federal Rules of Evidence and will only offer evidence the defense deems\nproper. But is for the Court—not the defense—to decide what is admissible at this trial.\n\nMore troubling still, the defense brief makes clear that they plan to put these theories before\nthe jury before the Court has an opportunity to rule on these issues, including in their opening\nstatement. (Def. Opp. at 5l (“If Ms. Maxwell’s atorneys have a good-faith belief that evidence\nwill be admissible, they can refer to that evidence in opening statement.”’)). The Court should not\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5578", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005590.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 36 of 4o\nF. The Court Should Preclude Challenges to the Credibility of Individuals Who Are Not\n\nWitnesses at Trial\n\nThe defendant does not appear to dispute the Government’s statement of the law: the\ncredibility of individuals who are neither witnesses nor hearsay declarants is not at issue and cannot\nbe challenged. (Def. Opp. at 43-45). The motion should therefore be granted.\n\nThe defense’s primary response is that they are not sure what statements will be elicited\nand the non-hearsay bases for such statements. Of course, the defense has had the Government’s\nwitness list and Jencks Act material for more than two weeks. Those materials make clear that the\nGovernment does not intend to elicit hearsay statements from Minor Victim-5 and Minor Victim-\n6. And the defense has failed to point to any such evidence. To give one example, to the extent\nthe Government offers a school record related to Minor Victim-5 as a business record (see id. at\n45 (citing GX 78l-83)), that record would not constitute a statement by Minor Victim-5 offered\nfor the truth of the mater asserted.\n\nInsofar as the defense’s point is that the Government might open the door to challenging\nthe credibility of an individual by offering that individual’s hearsay statement for the truth of the\nmater asserted, the Government agrees. But if the Government does not open the door, the\ncredibility of Minor Victim-5 and Minor Victim-6 are not at issue. And the defense cannot\nchallenge the credibility of these individuals—in opening statements or otherwise—unless and\nuntil the defense seeks a ruling from the Court that the Government has opened the door.\n\nG. Evidence or Argument About the Minor Victims’ Consent is Categorically\n\nInadmissible\n\nThe defendant is charged with enticement of a minor, transporting a minor, sex trafficking\nof a minor, and <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to commit those offenses. (See Indictment [J ll-27). None of those\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-oooo559o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005591.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 37 of 4o\noffenses are negated by a consent defense. (See Gov’t Mot. at 39-4o). Accordingly, there is no\nbasis to offer evidence or make argument related to the Minor Victims’ consent.\n\nIn Counts Two and Four, the defendant is charged under the Mann Act with transporting a\nminor with intent to violate New York Penal Law § l3o.55, and enticing a minor to do the same.\nThat crime does not relate to prostitution. In Counts One and Three, the defendant is charged with\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to violate the same statute—not “varying local state laws” in “multi-jurisdictional\nlocations,” (Def. Opp. at 47), and not violating the Mann Act with intent to commit prostitution.\nIn Count Six, the defendant is charged with sex trafficking of a person less than eighteen. In Count\nFive, the defendant is charged with <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to commit the same.\n\nBecause these offenses all involve crimes with victims belou specified age cutoffs for\nwhich consent is not a defense, consent is not at issue in this case. The defense is therefore wrong\nwhen it argues that the Government has “charged offenses associated with coercion, force and\nviolence.” (/d. at 49). The charges in the Indictment concern sexual activity with a minor,\nsimpliciter. The Government has not, for instance, charged sex trafficking through force, fraud,\nor coercion, and those elements are not at issue in this case.\n\nThis misunderstanding by the defense underlies its response to this point. For instance, the\ndefense suggests that Minor Victim-4 was engaged in prostitution at the time of the charged\noffenses, which might give her criminal exposure under Florida law. (See id. at 48). That is\nirrelevant, because all that maters for the purposes of l8 U.S.C. § l59l—and therefore this case—\nis that she was a minor. See, e.g., United States v. Corley, 679 F. App’x l, 4 (2d Cir. 2ol7)\n(summary order) (“Further, the victims could not consent because they were minors.”).\n\n36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo559l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005598.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 384 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page4ofl2\n\nDefendant Ghislaine Maxwell, through counsel, requests that the Court enter an order\nprecluding the government from introducing any alleged co-conspirator statements under Federal\nRule of Evidence 8ol(d)(2)(E) because the government failed to comply with the Court’s Order\nof September 3, 2o2l (Dkt. 335). In support of this request, Ms. Maxwell states:\n\nRELEVANT PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\nOn multiple occasions Ms. Maxwell requested disclosure of the identity of any alleged\nco-conspirators in this case along with any statements made by those individuals that the\ngovernment intends to offer into evidence at trial under Federal Rule of Evidence 8ol(d)(2)(E).\nThe Court, on September 3, 2o2l, dismissed the government’s arguments against disclosure\nnoting that the concern raised by the government about disclosure “does not outweigh the risk of\nsurprise to the Defendant in this case or the need for the parties to litigate co-conspirator issues\nin advance of trial to ensure the absence of delay” Dkt. 335 at 3. The Order was explicit\nregarding what the government was required to do: First, no later than October ll, 2o2l, the\ngovernment was required to “disclose to the defense the identities of any unnamed co-\nconspirators who allegedly participated in the conspiracies charged in the S2 indictment to whom\nthe government will refer at trial.” Jd. Second, the Court, unambiguously and emphatically,\ndirected: “The Government is FURTHER ORDERED to disclose a// co-conspirator hearsay\nstatements it intends to offer at trial no later than October ll, as consistent with this Court’s\nscheduling order. Dkt. No. 297 at l.” (emphasis in original.)\n\nOn October ll, 2o2l, the government identified three purported co-conspirators for\npurposes of trial: Jeffrey Epstein, [x | Thc\ngovernment, houever, failed and refused to disclose “a// (or any) co-conspirator statements it\nintends to introduce at trial....” Instead, the government, circumventing the plain meaning of the\nCourt’s Order, offered that “[t]he Government has produced all co-conspirator statements which\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5598", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005599.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 384 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page5ofl2\nit intends to offer at trial ... in the Government’s production today or in its previous\nproductions.” And, circumnavigating this Court’s Order with Magellan-like skill, promised that,\nas the government “continues to prepare for trial” it will produce any additional co-conspirator\nstatements “in connection with its ongoing obligation to produce Jencks Act material.” See, Ex.\nl.\nI. The Government Failed to Identify Any Purported Co-Conspirator\n\nStatements\n\nFor a statement to fall within the definition of Fed.R.Evid. 8ol(d)(2)(E), “a court must\nfind (l) that there was a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, (2) that its members included the declarant and the party\nagainst whom the statement is offered, and (3) that the statement was made both (a) during the\ncourse of and (b) in furtherance of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.” United States v. Tracy, l2 F.3d ll86, ll96\n(2d Cir. l993). These conditions precedent are “[p]reliminary questions concerning ... the\nadmissibility of evidence” as referenced in Fed. R. Evid. lo4(a), and must be proven by a\npreponderance of the evidence. United States v. Daly, 842 F.2d l38o, l386 (2d Cir. l988).\n\nThe Court may consider the coconspirator statements themselves in determining whether\nthe 8ol(d)(2)(E) prerequisites have been met. Houever, because “these hearsay statements are\npresumptively unreliable,” United States v. Tellier, 83 F.3d 578, 58o (2d Cir. l996), there must\nbe independent corroborating evidence of the existence of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> and the participation\ntherein of the declarant and the defendant. Jd.\n\nII. Ongoing Document Dumps Containing Thousands of Statements Do Not\n\nSatisfy the Court’s Order to Disclose\n\nThe government neither objected to Ms. Maxwell's request for disclosure nor the Court’s\nOrder requiring disclosure at the same time. See Dkt. 3l7 at l2, n.l (citing Dkt. 29l and Dkt.\n293). The government’s reason for not wanting to disclose the statements was considered and\n\na\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5599", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005600.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 384 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page6ofl2\nrejected by the Court which ordered disclosure at the same time as the government's witness list,\nRule 4o4(b) notice, exhibits, and 35oo materials no later than October ll, 2o2l, so that the\nDefense would not be surprised at trial and because of “the need for the parties to litigate co-\nconspirator issues in advance of trial....”” Dkt. 335 at 3.\n\nThe government seized multiple electronic devices, including computers and servers\nfrom alleged co-conspirator Epstein. These devices contain hundreds of thousands of statements\nspanning decades. The emails on the devices are to and from many other individuals. Many of\nthe emails are cryptic, subject to interpretation, and appear to be outside of the scope of either\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> alleged in the S2 Indictment. It is impossible for Ms. Maxwell to identify any\nstatement that she may need to litigate in advance of trial and, even if she wanted to do so, any\natempt would be futile because the government could avoid any issue by simply picking some\nother statement. Absent pre-trial identification of any alleged co-conspirator statement, Ms.\nMaxwell will be forced to, during trial, object to any proffered statement, request a recess,\nidentify whether the purported statement was actually produced in discovery, and at some point,\nlitigate the admissibility of the statement. Of course, this is precisely what the Court’s Order was\nintended to avoid.\n\nGiven the amount of discourse over this topic, the government must understand what the\nCourt ordered it to disclose. It has chosen, houever, to avoid and violate the Court’s Order by\natempting to overstuff an already full sandbag by ignoring both the plain language and spirit of\nthe Order mandating disclosure. Instead of simply disclosing the purported statements the\ngovernment has directed Ms. Maxwell back to the hundreds of thousands of “statements”\nproduced or to be produced in the case.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo56oo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005615.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 385 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page6ofl2\n229 at 3. This Court then ordered the Government to provide disclosure of any “Rule 4o4(b)\nevidence and notice” by October ll. Dkt. 297.\n\nOn October ll, 2o2l, the Government served on defense counsel a short leter entitled\nthe “Maxwell Rule 4o4(b) leter’ (the “Rule 4o4(b) Leter” or the “Leter’’), atached as Exhibit\nA. Init, the Government referenced two sets of evidence: (2)\n2\n(b) a Witness i who worked for Epstein between ggg (after the\nconclusion of the charged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>) whom the Government said it “may call” at trial. The\nGovernment asserted in the Leter that the evidence collectively was, in its opinion, “direct\nevidence of the crimes charged and, in the alternative, pursuant to Rule 4o4(b) as proof of the\ndefendant's intent, preparation, plan, knouledge, identity, and/or absence of mistake of (sic)\naccident.” /d. at2. The Government stated it would not be moving in /imine to seek the\nevidence's admission \"[b]ecause this evidence is admissible as direct evidence.\" Jd. The Leter\nlacked identification of any particular purpose for these two categories of evidence and lacked\nany \"basis for concluding that the evidence is relevant in light of this purpose.\"\n\nAlso on October ll, the Government provided its anticipated trial exhibits. Even a quick\nreview of those exhibits reflects the Government's apparent intent to offer numerous documents\nand other evidence that purportedly occurred after the conclusion of the charged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.\n\nSee, e.g., GX-4-D through GX-4-K (message pads dated beginning in 2oo5); GX-423 (an\nAmazon shipment to Jeffrey Epstein of an iPhone USB lightning cable in 2ol3); GX-5ol & 5o2\n(financial statements from June 2oo7); GX-66l & 662 (flight logs from 2oo5-l3). None of these\nitems of evidence were mentioned in the Maxwell Rule 4o4(b) Leter. The Government's theory\nof admissibility concerning this post-2oo4 evidence remains unclear.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo56l5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005617.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 385 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page8ofl2\ncharged crimes [and (li)] her [unspecified] role in scheduling sexualized massages for Jeffrey\nEpstein with underage girls,\" apparently in ggg. This is hardly the type of \"identiffied]\"\nevidence the Rule contemplates. What \"documentary evidence\" will she testify about? What\n\"role\" did she play in scheduling massages after the conclusion of the charged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>? For\nwhat purpose will she testify to it? Are there other topics covered by the language \"among other\nthings\" that the Government submits is admissible under Rule 4o4(b)? What is it? What is the\npurpose of it? Will it be offered to prove Ms. Maxwell’s \"intent, preparation, plan, knouledge,\nidentity and/or absence of mistake of [sic] accident\" or something else? Hou is it permissible\nnon-propensity evidence?\n\nFinally, by failing to identify the numerous exhibits that fall after the period of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> in the Rule 4o4(b) Leter, the Government has also waived any right to argue that\nthose documents should be admited under the rule as well.\n\nThe entire point of the change to Rule 4o4(b), and this Court's scheduling Order, is to\npermit Ms. Maxwell to investigate, analyze, dispute, move in /imine if appropriate, or rebut the\nproffered Rule 4o4(b) evidence. There is nothing in Rule 4o4(b) that excuses the required\nNotice in the event the Government only offers the evidence \"in the alternative\" under the rule.\nBy disregarding the requirements of Rule 4o4(b), the Government has chosen to deprive Ms.\nMaxwell of her right to dispute the admissibility of this evidence.\n\nII. Should the Government's Failure Be Excused, Ms. Maxwell Requests an\nOpportunity to Rebut any Proffered Non-Propensity Purpose and Basis\nBecause the Government has not identified the non-propensity purpose nor reasoning\n\nunderlying the admission of any Rule 4o4(b) evidence, the defense is left without \"sufficient\ntime for an independent investigation that might surface evidence that refutes, mitigates, or\nplaces the other act in a different light,” and the Court will not have sufficient \"time to consider\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo56l7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005618.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 385 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page9ofl2\nthe admissibility of the other act evidence.\" Wright & Miller, supra. Should the Government\nrequest a \"good-cause\" exemption for their failure to timely provide Rule 4o4(b) notice, this\nCourt should analyze their excuse with skepticism. \"Prosecutors should be prepared to explain\ntheir change of heart and to rebut allegations of sandbagging. Unforeseen turns of testimony at\ntrial are one thing. Reasonably anticipated proof problems are another. For example, when intent\nis an element of a charged offense, a prosecutor will be hard pressed to explain why he did not\nforesee before trial that the other act proof may be important in a jury's determination of intent.”\nWright & Miller, supra. Here, the government has been on notice of the elements it needs to\nprove since July 2o2o. It advised the Court it would be able to provide Rule 4o4(b) notice back\nin May 2o2l. Dkt. 229 at 3. With the trial continuance, it gained an additional five months. See\nDkt. 297.\n\nThere is no acceptable excuse for failure to follou the requirements of the Rule. Given\nthe significant number of other pre-trial filing deadlines, briefing the admissibility of the\nproffered Rule 4o4(b) evidence in the midst of her other obligations will be exceptionally\ndifficult. Ifthe Court is inclined to grant the government additional time to satisfy the Rule, Ms.\nMaxwell requests ample time to investigate the materials and to respond.\n\nIll. Ms. Maxwell Needs Additional Time to Respond to the Scant Notice that the\n\nMaterials Qualify as “Direct Evidence” in the Case\n\nThe Rule 4o4(b) Leter also repeated the Government's opinion that the newly-disclosed\nmaterials qualify as \"direct evidence\" of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.

In the alternative, Ms. Maxwell\nrespectfully moves (l) to preclude the government and Accuser-3 from referring to Accuser-3 as\na “minor” or asserting that she was a “minor” at the time of the alleged sex acts, (2) to preclude\nthe government and Accuser-3 from representing that she was “sexually abused” by Jeffrey\nEpstein, and (3) for an appropriate limiting instruction concerning Accuser-3’s testimony.\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\nThe government and the defense agree on at least this much about Accuser-3:\nl. She was not a minor in the United Kingdom when she alleges that she was sexually\nabused by Jeffrey Epstein in l994-l995;\n2. She cannot establish that Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein ever caused, or sought to\ncause, her to travel while she was a minor; and\n3. She cannot establish that she was a minor in the United States when she alleges that\nshe engaged in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein at his various residences.\nEven if we assume for the sake of argument that everything Accuser-3 alleges is true (which it is\nnot), she has not alleged any illegal conduct whatsoever, much less conduct “in furtherance of” a\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to entice or cause minor girls to travel to engage in unlawful sexual activity with Epstein.\nIt seems evident that the government originally included Accuser-3’s allegations in the\nindictment as evidence of the charged conspiracies because it did not knou that she was above\nthe age of consent in the U.K. The government presented Accuser-3’s allegations to the grand\njury incorrectly assuming that she was a minor and that the alleged sex acts between Epstein and\n! This individual is described in the S2 Superseding Indictment as Minor Victim-3. Similarly, we refer to the\nindividuals identified in the indictment as Minor Victim-l and Minor Victim-2 as Accuser-l and Accuser-2,\nrespectively.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5669", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005670.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 387 Filed lo/29/2l Page6of2l\nAccuser-3 were illegal. Indeed, referring to Accuser-3 in the indictment as “Minor Victim-3” is\nentirely misleading — there is no evidence that she was a “minor” when any of the alleged sex\nacts took place.\n\nNevertheless, even after the defense pointed out in our pretrial motions that Accuser-3\nwas not a minor and had not alleged any illegal conduct, the government repeated her allegations\nverbatim to the grand jury and in the S2 Superseding Indictment. This was not only misleading,\nit was also an end-run around Rule 4o4(b). Simply including the conduct alleged by Accuser-3 in\nthe indictment does not mean that it is evidence of the charged conspiracies. The conduct\nalleged by Accuser-3 is not within the scope of the charged conspiracies and the Court should\nnot admit this evidence as proof of those charges. Nor should the Court admit this evidence as\n“other act” evidence under Rule 4o4(b). This evidence would only be offered to shou criminal\npropensity, despite the alleged conduct being entirely legal, and would mislead the jury and\nunfairly prejudice Ms. Maxwell. Accordingly, the Court should exclude evidence related to\nAccuser-3.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe original indictment against Ms. Maxwell, filed on June 29, 2o2o, and the first\nsuperseding indictment, filed on July 8, 2o2o, included the follouing allegations related to\nAccuser-3:\n\nMAXWELL groomed and befriended [Accuser-3] in London,\nEngland between approximately l994 and l995, including during a\nperiod of time in which MAXWELL knew that [Accuser-3] was\nunder the age of l8. Among other things, MAXWELL discussed\n[Accuser-3’s] life and family with [Accuser-3]. MAXWELL\nintroduced [Accuser-3] to Epstein and arranged for multiple\ninteractions between [Accuser-3] and Epstein. During those\ninteractions, MAXWELL encouraged [Accuser-3] to massage\nEpstein, knouing that Epstein would engage in sex acts with\n[Accuser-3] during those massages. [Accuser-3] provided Epstein\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo567o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005671.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 387 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page/7of2l\n\nwith the requested massages, and during those massages, Epstein\n\nsexually abused [Accuser-3]. MAXWELL was aware that Epstein\n\nengaged in sexual activity with [Accuser-3] on multiple occasions,\n\nincluding at times when [Accuser-3] was under the age of l8,\n\nincluding in the context of a sexualized massage.\nSee Indictment (Dkt. ool) § 7(c); Sl Superseding Indictment (Dkt. ol7) § 7(c). Both indictments\nalso alleged the follouing as an overt act of the charged conspiracies: “Between in or about l994\nand in or about l995, when [Accuser-3] was under the age of l8, MAXWELL encouraged\n[Accuser-3] to provide massages to Epstein in London, England, knouing that Epstein intended\nto sexually abuse [Accuser-3] during those massages.” See Indictment (Dkt. ool) {fj ll(d),\nl7(d); Sl Superseding Indictment (Dkt. ol7) 44 ll(d), l7(d).\n\nMs. Maxwell filed a pretrial motion to strike the allegations related to Accuser-3 as\nsurplusage on the grounds that they could not support the charged conspiracies and were unfairly\nprejudicial to Ms. Maxwell. See Def.’s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Strike Surplusage from\nSuperseding Indictment (Dkt. l46) at l-3, 6-9. Ms. Maxwell noted that (l) according to\nAccuser-3’s oun allegations, she was above the legal age of consent in the United Kingdom (l6\nyears old) when the sex acts supposedly took place and therefore any sex acts that occurred were\nlawful and could not be considered “sexual abuse”; and (2) the indictment did not allege any\ntravel by Accuser-3, in interstate or foreign commerce or otherwise, let alone as a result of any\naction taken by Ms. Maxwell or Epstein, which was a critical element of both charged\nconspiracies. /d. at 4-5.\n\nIn its opposition, the government scrambled to paper over these problems by providing a\nmuch fuller proffer of Accuser-3’s expected testimony. See Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def.’s\nPretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l58-59 & n.56.

Evidence Related to Accuser-3 Is Not Proof of the Charged Conspiracies\n\nAccuser-3’s allegations, which pertain only to the Mann Act conspiracies charged in\nCounts One and Three of the S2 Indictment, are irrelevant to the charged conspiracies and do not\noffer any proof supporting those charges. The S2 Indictment alleges that Ms. Maxwell conspired\nwith Epstein to (i) violate l8 U.S.C. § 2422(a), with the objective of enticing one or more\nindividuals to travel in interstate and foreign commerce for the purpose of engaging in unlawful\nsexual activity (S2 Indictment ff ll-l2); and (i) violate l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a), with the objective\nof transporting an individual under age l8 with the intent that the individual engage in unlawful\nsexual activity (id. 9] l7-l8). As an overt act in furtherance of these conspiracies, the\ngovernment alleges that Ms. Maxwell “encouraged [Accuser-3] to provide massages to Epstein\nin London, England, knouing that Epstein intended to sexually abuse [Accuser-3] during those\nmassages.” Jd. J l3(d), l9(d) (emphasis added). The Indictment further alleges that Epstein\n“sexually abused” Accuser-3. /d. ¥ 9c.\n\nThere is no cogent basis for the government to assert that Accuser-3’s allegations are\ndirect evidence of the charged conspiracies. The object of the alleged conspiracies was to entice\nor cause one or more minors to travel in interstate or foreign commerce in order to engage in\nunlawful sexual activity. The government concedes that Accuser-3 (l) was not a minor under\nU.K. law when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein in London, (2) cannot establish\nthat she was invited to travel to the United States when she was under the age of l8, and (3)\ncannot establish that she was a minor when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein in the\nUnited States. See Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l58-59, l62-l63\n& nn.57-58. Accuser-3 will therefore not provide any proof that Ms. Maxwell “furthered” an\nalleged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to cause minors to travel for the purpose of engaging in unlawful sexual\nactivity. Accordingly, the conduct she alleges is not “within the scope of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>” and\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5675", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005676.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 387 _ Filed lo/29/2l Pagel2 of 2l\nshould not be admited as evidence of the conspiracies.

United States,\n353 U.S. 39l, 397 (l957)).\n\nIn its opposition to Ms. Maxwell’s motion to strike, the government argued that because a\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> “does not require a completed substantive crime,” Accuser-3’s allegations could still\nbe admited as direct proof of the charged conspiracies even though she did not travel as a minor\nor engage in illegal sex acts because Ms. Maxwell allegedly “groomed” her to engage in those\nsex acts. Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l6l-l63 (citing Salinas v.\nUnited States, 522 U.S. 52, 65 (l997)). That argument misses the mark. While it is true that a\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> does not require a completed substantive crime, Salinas itself states that “[a]\nconspirator must intend to further an endeavor which, if completed, would satisfy all of the\nelements of a substantive criminal offense.” Salinas, 522 U.S. at 65. As to Accuser-3, the\ncompleted endeavor—i.e., her alleged sex acts with Epstein—was not a substantive criminal\noffense. Even if we accept her allegations as true (which we do not), there is nothing unlawful\nabout encouraging an adult to engage in entirely lawful sex acts. Hence, Accuser-3’s allegations\nare not direct proof of the charged conspiracies regardless of whether Ms. Maxwell allegedly\n“sroomed” her (which she did not).\n\nThe Court should not admit Accuser-3’s allegations as intrinsic proof of the charged\nconspiracies either. See Nektalov, 325 F. Supp. 2d at 37o (listing three categories of “intrinsic”\nproof not considered Rule 4o4(b) evidence).

The allegations of Accuser-3 stand on their oun and are not “inextricably\nintertwined” with the allegations of Accuser-l or Accuser-2, nor do they stem from “the same\nseries of transactions.” In fact, they have no bearing on or connection to those allegations\nwhatsoever. Because Accuser-3’s allegations are conceptually distinct, they are also not\n“necessary to complete the story” of the charged conspiracies. See Cummings, 6o F. Supp. 3d at\n438 (defendant’s prior crack arrests and firearms conviction not sufficiently connected to\nunderlying <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to distribute crack and possessing firearms to be admissible); Tounsend,\n2oo7 WL l288597, at *2 (defendant’s prior narcotics and firearm transactions with the same\nconfidential informant not “inextricably intertwined” with the charged narcotics <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, even\nthough the conduct was “generally similar to the conduct underlying the offenses charged in the\nindictment”); United States v.

Although Rule 4o4(b) typically governs the admissibility of “other acts” that\nare not charged in the indictment, in this case, the government evidently charged the conduct\nunder the mistaken belief that Accuser-3 was a minor when she engaged in sex acts with Epstein:\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5677", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005678.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 387 Filed lo/29/2l Pagel4 of 2l\n\nee\n\n:\n>,\nee\na\nEe The government’s error in including Accuser-3’s\nallegations in the indictment does not somehou convert this evidence into proof of the charged\nconspiracies. Such a rule would allou the government to entirely circumvent Rule 4o4(b)\nsimply by charging other act conduct in the indictment.\n\nMoreover, without a proper limiting instruction, there is a serious risk that the jury will\nview this lawful conduct as evidence of criminal propensity. See United States v. Dolney, No.\no4-CR-l59 (NGG), 2oo5 WL 2l29l69, at *2 (E.D.N-Y. Sept. l, 2oo5) (benefit of applying Rule\n4o4(b) is “the value that a limiting instruction will have in ensuring that the jury does not view\nthe defendants’ alleged prior conduct as evidence of the defendants’ propensity to engage in\ncriminal activity”). At the very least, it is not “manifestly clear” that the evidence related to\nAccuser-3 is proof of the charged Mann Act conspiracies. Accordingly, “the proper course is to\nproceed under Rule 4o4(b).” Tounsend, 2oo7 WL l288597, at *l (citing Nektalov, 325 F. Supp.\n2d at 372).\n\nIll.

R.\nEvid. 4o3. According to the government, Accuser-3 is expected to testify that she was “sexually\nabused” by Epstein, not because she was underage and incapable of consent by law, but because\nher “subjective experience” of these incidents was that they were “traumatic, exploitative, and\nabusive.” Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l62 n.57. If Accuser-3 is\nalloued to testify that she felt she was “sexually abused” by Epstein, the jury will naturally\nassume that the alleged sex acts were illegal, when they were not. Indeed, even if she is not\nalloued to use the phrase “‘sexual abuse,” the mere fact that Accuser-3 will be testifying about\nalleged sex acts that she participated in with a much older man when she was l7 years old will\nlikely lead the jury to assume that the conduct was illegal, especially after they have heard the\nexpected testimony of the other accusers in this case.\n\nHence, there is a strong likelihood that the jury will be misled by Accuser-3’s evidence\nand will misapply it in evaluating Ms. Maxwell’s guilt or innocence to the charged Mann Act\nconspiracies, both of which require that Ms. Maxwell acted with the intent that the accusers\nwould engage in illegal or criminal sexual activity. This risk substantially outweighs the limited\nprobative effect of Accuser-3’s evidence. Even if the Court were to give the jury an appropriate\nlimiting instruction, there is a substantial risk that it would not be sufficient to ensure that the\njury did not misinterpret or misapply this evidence. See Curley, 639 F.3d at 6o (quoting United\nStates v. Figueroa, 6l8 F.2d 934, 946 (2d Cir. l98o) (“limiting instructions cannot be regarded\nas a guaranty against prejudice”)). Accordingly, the Court should exclude Accuser-3’s evidence.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo568l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005682.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 387 Filed lo/29/2l Pagel8 of 2l\nIV. In the Alternative, the Court Should Preclude the Government and Accuser-3 from\n\nRepresenting that Accuser-3 Was a “Minor,” or that She Was “Sexually Abused”\n\nby Epstein, and Give the Jury an Appropriate Limiting Instruction\n\nIf the Court determines that the evidence related to Accuser-3 is admissible, either as\ndirect evidence of the charged conspiracies or as 4o4(b) evidence, the Court should (l) preclude\nthe government and Accuser-3 from referring to Accuser-3 as a “minor” or asserting that she was\na “minor” at the time of the alleged sex acts, (2) preclude the government and Accuser-3 from\nrepresenting that she was “sexually abused” by Jeffrey Epstein, and (3) give the jury an\nappropriate limiting instruction related to Accuser-3’s testimony.\n\nThe government concedes that Accuser-3 alleges that she was l7 years old and above the\nage of consent in the U.K. when she purportedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein in London.\nThe government further concedes that Accuser-3 cannot establish that she was under the age of\nl8 when she alleges that she first traveled to the United States and engaged in sex acts with\nEpstein at his residences. Accuser-3 was therefore not a minor under the laws of the relevant\njurisdictions when the alleged sex acts and the alleged international travel took place. It follous\nthat the Court should not permit the government or Accuser-3 to refer to herself as a “minor” or\nclaim that she was a minor when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein.\n\nSimilarly, the Court should not permit the government and Accuser-3 to assert that she\nwas “sexually abused” by Epstein. The phrase “sexual abuse” connotes criminal activity, even\nthough the alleged conduct was lawful. See Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions, l37 8S. Ct. l562, l569\n(2ol7) (‘Sexual abuse of a minor,’ the Government accordingly contends, ‘most naturally connotes\nconduct that (l) is egal, (2) involves sexual activity, and (3) is directed at a person younger than l8\nyears old.’”) (quoting government’s brief) (emphases added). Notwithstanding Accuser-3’s\n“subjective experience” of these incidents, the use of the phrase “sexual abuse” should not be\nalloued because it will mislead the jury into thinking that Accuser-3 engaged in “criminal sexual\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5682", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005683.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 387 Filed lo/29/2l Pagel9of 2l\nactivity” with Epstein. That, in turn, may cause the jury to improperly convict Ms. Maxwell\nbased on a false assumption.\n\nFinally, the Court should give the jury an appropriate limiting instruction to ensure that\nthe jury understands that the alleged conduct was not unlawful and does not consider it as\nimproper propensity evidence. If Accuser-3 is alloued to testify that she engaged in sex acts\nwith Epstein in London when she was l7, as the government has proffered, the jury will almost\ncertainly assume that the alleged conduct was unlawful, as it would be in certain U.S. states, and\nthat the testimony is being offered to prove that Epstein and Accuser-3 engaged in “illegal sexual\nactivity” in London. Accordingly, if Accuser-3 is alloued to testify, we request that the Court\ngive the jury a limiting instruction containing the follouing points:\n\ne The legal age of consent for sexual activity in the United Kingdom\nis l6 years old. That was also the legal age of consent from l994-\nl995, when Accuser-3 alleges she engaged in sex acts with Jeffrey\nEpstein in London when she was l7 years old.\n\ne The alleged conduct that Accuser-3 has described in her testimony\nwas therefore not illegal. If you find that these incidents took place,\nI instruct you that this sexual activity cannot be considered “illegal”\nor “criminal” or “unlawful” for purposes of the crimes charged in\nthe indictment.\n\nIf the Court determines that Accuser-3’s testimony may be admited as 4o4(b) evidence,\nMs. Maxwell further requests that the Court also give the jury an appropriate propensity\ninstruction. See Dolney, 2oo5 WL 2l29l69, at *2 (“In the absence of such a limiting instruction,\nthere exists a legitimate concern that the jury might misapply [the] evidence to conclude that if\nthe defendants engaged in criminal conduct prior to the charged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, then the conduct at\nissue in these charges must also be criminal.”).\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5683", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005684.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 387 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 2oof2l\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should exclude evidence related to Accuser-3\nbecause it is not probative of the charged conspiracies and inadmissible under Rule 4o4(b) and\nRule 4o3 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.

The alleged false statements\nwere made at unrelated civil depositions in 2ol6, over 2o years after the conduct underlying the\nMann Act offenses supposedly took place, at a time when Ms. Maxwell was not under\ninvestigation. Indeed, Ms. Maxwell was never a subject of the Palm Beach FBI investigation\nthat concluded in 2oo8 and was not named as a co-conspirator in Epstein’s Non-Prosecution\nAgreement that resolved that investigation. Hence, there is no sound basis to assert that Ms.\nMaxwell made false statements to conceal her involvement in Epstein’s crimes.\n\nFurthermore, the superseding indictment does not allege that Ms. Maxwell’s purported\nfalse statements were the result of an agreement with Epstein to conceal their alleged conduct or\nwere otherwise part of, or an object of, the conspiracies charged in the non-perjury counts.\nInstead, the superseding indictment alleges that the purported false statements were part of a\nseparate and independent effort by Ms. Maxwell to conceal her alleged involvement in Epstein’s\nsex abuse offenses long after those offenses had already been completed.

Sometimes she has\nclaimed that Mr. Epstein raped her. At other times, houever, Accuser-l has not made any\nallegation about being raped.\n\nAll the same, Accuser-l has never accused Ms. Maxwell of knouing that Mr. Epstein\nallegedly raped her or of facilitating or participating in an alleged rape. And the indictment in\nthis case does not charge any such conduct by Mr. Epstein or Ms. Maxwell. Rather, the\nindictment charges enticement and transportation of minors across state lines to provide\n“sexualized massages” to Mr. Epstein and <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to do the same.\n\nIt is not clear whether any other witness will allege having been raped by Mr. Epstein.\nBut what is clear is that the indictment does not allege that any rape occurred. Nor does it allege\nthat Ms. Maxwell knew of, facilitated, or participated in an alleged rape.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nThe United States Constitution guarantees due process of law and fair trials by impartial\njuries. U.S. Const. amends. V, VI. Essential to that guarantee is a promise that the jury will not\nbe misled by irrelevant and prejudicial evidence that will district jurors from their one and only\nduty—to decide whether the government has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. See\nUnited States v. Doyle, l3o F.3d 523, 538-39 (2d Cir. l997). A jury that has been misled by\nirrelevant and prejudicial evidence cannot be considered impartial. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3,\nAdvisory Commitee Notes, l972 Proposed Rules (evidence must be excluded when it risks\ninducing a decision based on a purely emotional basis).\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo576o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005761.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 394 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page5of9\n\nUnder the Federal Rules, relevant evidence is generally admissible while irrelevant\nevidence is categorically inadmissible. Fed. R. Evid. 4ol, 4o2. Evidence is relevant if it tends to\nmake a fact of consequence to the action more or less probable than it would be without the\nevidence. Fed. R. Evid. 4ol. In turn, relevant evidence must be excluded when its probative\nvalue is substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice, confusing the issues,\nmisleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.\nFed. R. Evid. 4o3.\n\nHere, testimony that Mr. Epstein allegedly raped Accuser-l (or anyone else) is irrelevant\nto the charged offenses. See Fed. R. Evid. 4ol. The indictment does not allege that Mr. Epstein\nraped anyone. And Accuser-l has never alleged that Ms. Maxwell knew about or participated in\nan alleged rape. Because the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charged in the indictment is limited to enticement and\ntransportation of minors across state lines to provide Mr. Epstein with sexualized massages, there\nis no argument that Accuser-l’s rape allegation is relevant to the charged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. It (and any\nother allegation of rape by anyone else) therefore must be excluded. Fed. R. Evid. 4o2.\n\nEven if a rape allegation had some relevance, Rule 4o3 would still require its exclusion\nbecause the minimal probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of\nunfair prejudice, confusing the issues, and misleading the jury. Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. Evidence is\nunfairly prejudicial when it has an “undue tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis,\ncommonly, though not necessarily, an emotional one.” Old Chief v. United States, 5l9 U.S. l72,\nl8o (l997).\n\nHere, any allegation that Mr. Epstein raped Accuser-l (or anyone else) will suggest to the\njury that it should convict Ms. Maxwell based on Mr. Epstein’s alleged conduct and not the\noffenses with which she has been charged. Admission of this evidence poses a serious risk that\n\na\nDOJ-OGR-oooo576l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005762.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 394 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page6of9\nthe “jury will convict for crimes other than those charged—or that, uncertain of guilt, it will\nconvict anyway because a bad person deserves punishment.” See id. at l8l (quoting United\nStates v. Moccia, 68l F.2d 6l, 63 (lst Cir. l982) (Breyer, J.)) (discussing propensity evidence).\n\nA rape allegation is also highly emotional and inflammatory, much more so than the\nactual conduct charged in this case (sexualized massages). “Evidence shall be excluded as\nunduly prejudicial when it is ‘more inflammatory than the charged crime.’” United States v.\nMidyet, 6o3 F. Supp. 2d 45o, 456 (E.D.N.Y. 2oo9) (quoting United States v. Livoti, l96 F.3d\n322, 326 (2d Cir. l999)); cf! United States v. Abu-Jihad, 63o F.3d lo2, l33 (2d Cir. 2olo)\n(affirming admission of evidence under Rule 4o3 when it was “no more inflammatory than the\ncharges alleged in the indictment”); United States v. Roldan-Zapata, 9l6 F.2d 795, 8o4 (2d Cir.\nl99o) (affirming admission of evidence that “did not involve conduct any more sensational or\ndisturbing than the crimes with which [the defendant] was charged”).\n\nThe allegation that Mr. Epstein allegedly raped Accuser-l (or anyone else) will also\nconfuse the issues at trial and mislead the jury. The indictment does not allege that Mr. Epstein\nraped Accuser-l. And Ms. Maxwell is not accused of conspiring to entice or transport minors\nacross state lines so Mr. Epstein could allegedly rape them. Again, the alleged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> in this\ncase is limited to securing ““sexualized massages” for Mr. Epstein. If jurors hear an allegation\nabout an alleged rape by Mr. Epstein, that evidence will confuse and mislead them, in addition to\nsuggesting that they convict Ms. Maxwell on an improper and highly emotional basis. See United\nStates v. Stein, 52l F. Supp. 2d 266, 273 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (excluding other-act evidence in a\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> case under Rule 4o3 because of the “risk that this evidence would confuse the issues,\ncause undue delay, and be used for an improper purpose”).\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5762", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005778.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 396 Filed lo/29/2l Page4of8\n\nThe Government has proffered a number of exhibits that it apparently intends to\nintroduce at trial.

Indeed, Employee-l will testify that Employee-l worked out of the defendant’s\ntounhouse in Manhatan during the weeks that Employee-l worked in New York City. The\nGovernment also expects Employee-l to testify about her observations at Epstein’s properties,\nincluding observations of minor girls at the properties, as well as her knouledge of Epstein’s\npractice to arrange multiple sexualized massages per day. In addition, although Employee-l’s\nemployment post-dates the defendant’s conduct with the victims in this case, Employee-l became\nfamiliar with certain items in Epstein’s residences during her tenure there, and thus Employee-l\nwill authenticate certain exhibits relating to the Minor Victims.

Her testimony\nshous the relationship between Epstein and the defendant a. shortly after the end of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> period, including the defendant’s role in Epstein’s affairs. Similarly, it provides\nbackground information about the operation of Epstein’s homes and lifestyle. Employee-l’s\ntestimony will also shou the defendant and Epstein’s plan and preparation, because it will describe\nthe process and frequency of obtaining masseuses, including the fact that the masseuses were often\nunderage girls, and that some of the massages developed into sexual abuse.

App’x 4l, 45 (2d Cir. 2ol3) (summary order) (“James’s possession of five\npounds of marijuana on December 22, 2oo5, and December 2, 2olo, were charged as overt acts in\nthe indictment. Accordingly, evidence of James’s possession of marijuana on these occasions was\nnot subject to the structures of Rule 4o4(b).”). The Court previously denied the defense’s motion\nto strike the overt acts involving Minor Victim-3 as surplusage, explaining that it “may reflect\nconduct undertaken in furtherance of the charged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> or be relevant to prove facts such as\n\n46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo583o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005831.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 48 of 84\nMaxwell’s state of mind.” (Op. & Order at 26-27, Dkt. No. 2o7 (“Courts in this district generally\ndelay ruling on any motion to strike until after the presentation of the Government’s evidence at\ntrial, because that evidence may affect hou specific allegations relate to the overall charges.’’)).\nHaving concluded that it should delay striking these overt acts until after presentation of the\nGovernment’s evidence, the Court should not nou effectively reverse its decision by precluding\nthat very evidence. If the Government’s proof at trial does not establish the relevance of Minor\nVictim-3’s testimony, if anything, the proper course is for the defense to move to strike the relevant\novert acts and Minor Victim-3’s testimony at that time.\n\nEven if evidence of Minor Victim-3 were uncharged criminal activity, it would still be\nnecessary to understand the other aspects of the charged conspiracies. Minor Victim-3\nexperienced the patern of abuse in close temporal proximity to the other Minor Victims: the\nconduct involving Minor Victim-l spans l994 to l997, the conduct involving Minor Victim-3\nspans l994 to l995, and the conduct involving Minor Victim-2 occurred in l996. The defendant’s\nacts touard Minor Victim-3 shou (l) the defendant’s relationship with Epstein, including her\nwillingness to procure teenagers to give Epstein massages, (2) the defendant’s knouledge of both\nthe sexual nature of those massages and the need to procure additional victims, and (3) her\nwillingness to transport minors to further their abuse. This evidence is therefore direct proof of\nthe defendant’s state of mind and agreement to participate in a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> with Epstein. Moreover,\nher relationship with Minor Victim-3 was “part of [her] continued effort” to commit the offenses\ncharged in Counts One and Three. Carboni, 2o4 F.3d at 44; see United States v. Romero-Padilla,\n583 F.3d l26, l3o (2d Cir. 2oo9) (“We reject Romero-Padilla’s contention that evidence of his\n\n47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo583l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005832.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 49 of 84\nprevious plans with Ferro to import narcotics ... was evidence of ‘other crimes’... .

To the extent that the defense argues, for instance, that the\ndefendant played no role in obtaining girls to massage Epstein or was unaware that Epstein’s\n'! The cases the defendant cites (Def. Mot. 4 at 8-9) conclude that the admission of evidence about\ndistinct criminal incidents are not direct evidence of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. See United States v.\nCummings, 6o F. Supp. 3d 434, 438 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol4), vacated on other grounds, 858 F.3d 763 (2d\nCir. 2ol7) (evidence of prior narcotics arrest and firearms conviction in narcotics and firearms\ncase “could be . . . connected to the charged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, but the Government has not provided\nenough detail”); Tounsend, 2oo7 WL l288597, at *2 (stating that the Government did not shou\nthat uncharged firearm and drug transactions involving the same confidential informant outside\nthe time period of the charged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, described “rather generically” as a sale of firearms and\n“narcotics transactions,” are “part and parcel of” the charged conduct or sufficiently similar to\nthem); United States v. Mahaffy, 477 F. Supp. 2d 56o, 566 (E.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (stating that, although\nthe facts between two fraud schemes were “quite similar,” the other acts were “a separate, discrete\noffense that may be conceptually segregated from the charged offenses without impairing the\njury’s ability to understand the facts underlying the schemes alleged in the indictment”), vacated\nin part on other grounds 285 F. App’x 797 (2d Cir. 2oo8); United States v. Nektalov, 325 F. Supp.\n2d 367, 37o (S.D.N.Y. 2oo4) (“[T]he transactions took place as early as three years prior to the\ncharged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> and appear to involve a series of distinct cash for gold transactions . . . .”).\nThat is not the case here, where the abuse of Minor Victim-3 occurred during the charged\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> period, overlaps temporally with the testimony of other Minor Victims, whose\nadmissibility the defendant does not contest, and is direct proof of the operation of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.\nBut in any event, in each case, the Court admited at least some evidence under Rule 4o4(b). See\nCummings, 6o F. Supp. 3d at 438 (evidence admissible under Rule 4o4(b)); Tounsend, 2oo7 WL\nl288597, at *5-6 (some evidence admissible under Rule 4o4(b), some evidence “far too vague”\nfor the Court to resolve, evidence of later marijuana possession irrelevant); Mahaffy, 477 F. Supp.\n2d at 566 (evidence admissible under Rule 4o4(b)); Nektalov, 325 F. Supp. 2d at 372 (evidence\nadmissible under Rule 4o4(b)).\n\n48\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5832", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005834.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 5l of 84\n\nNot so. The defendant’s argument entirely misunderstands the charges in the Indictment\nand the jury’s task at trial. The defendant is charged with conspiring to transport and entice minors\nfor the purpose of sexual abuse. The question at trial will be whether the defendant took steps to\nprovide Jeffrey Epstein with access to girls under the age of l8, knouing that Epstein intended to\nhave sexual contact with those girls. The defendant’s acts involving Minor Victim-3 were part of\nthat scheme and are highly relevant to demonstrating the existence of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> and the\ndefendant’s role in the scheme. That is all that is required for evidence relating to the defendant’s\nexploitation of Minor Victim-3 to be direct evidence of the charged offenses. The defendant is not\ncharged with an offense under United Kingdom law, and the age of consent in the United Kingdom\nis irrelevant. The defendant is also not charged with any substantive offenses with respect to Minor\nVictim-3, and thus it makes no difference whether the defendant could have, atempted to, or did\nsuccessfully transport Minor Victim-3 in violation of those statutes. !”\n\nIn any event, this evidence is all admissible under Rule 4o4(b).'? Testimony regarding the\ndefendant’s efforts to recruit and encourage Minor Victim-3 to engage in sex acts with Epstein in\nthe context of massages establishes that the defendant knew of Epstein’s atraction to minor girls\n' Indeed, there is no risk at trial that the jury will convict the defendant based on the testimony of\nMinor Victim-3 alone. As the Government has made clear, the jury may not convict the defendant\nof the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> offense solely based on Minor Victim-3 due to the statute of limitations. (Gov’t\nOpp. at l57-58, l63, Dkt. No. 2o4). The jury should be appropriately instructed at the conclusion\nof the trial.\n\n'3 To the extent this evidence is properly admissible under Rule 4o4(b) rather than as direct\nevidence, the Government’s detailed memorandum in opposition to the defense pretrial motions,\nwhich described theories of 4o4(b) admissibility (Gov’t Opp. at l65-69, Dkt. No. 2o4), and this\nmemorandum, filed five weeks before trial, is more than sufficient notice for the defense.\n5o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5834", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005835.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 52 of 84\nand knew that Epstein used massage to initiate sexual contact with minor girls. Minor Victim-3’s\ntestimony shous the defendant’s intent, through her acts befriending Minor Victim-3, encouraging\nMinor Victim-3 to provide Epstein massages, and asking Minor Victim-3 to find other girls. And\nit shous the defendant’s specific modus operandi of the conspiracies in the Indictment. For these\nand the other reasons described above, Minor Victim-3’s testimony easily satisfies Rule 4o4(b)’s\nrequirements. Evidence of other acts involving the grooming or abuse of minor victims is regularly\nadmited for similar purposes in cases where charges allege sexual activity with minors. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Vickers, 7o8 F. App’x 732, 737 (2d Cir. 2ol7) (“As to the testimony concerning\nVickers’ ‘grooming’ of his victims, we conclude that such evidence was admissible even under\nRule 4o4(b), because it was probative of Vickers’ knouledge of hou to secure adolescent boys’\ntrust so that he could sexually abuse them. We identify no abuse of discretion in the district court’s\ndecision to admit all of the challenged testimony [regarding uncharged acts of sexual abuse] under\nRule 4o3.”); United States v. McDarrah, 35l F. App’x 558, 563 (2d Cir. 2oo9) (affirming\nadmission pursuant to Rule 4o4(b) of defendant’s “e-mail responses to the Craigslist\nadvertisements” for erotic services because the e-mails “were relevant to his knouledge and intent,\nbecause he wrote those emails to girls he knew could be minors (he enthusiastically indicated that\ngirls younger than l8 are acceptable) and his e-mails shoued his interest in actual sexual\nconduct”); United States v.

(Order at l, Dkt.\nNo. 297). This order did not expressly require the Government to specifically identify co-\nconspirator statements within its other productions.\n\nIn the defendant’s second round of pretrial motions, she asked the Court to order the\nGovernment to disclose a series of information about the Indictment. That list contained a renewed\nrequest for the Government to identify uncharged co-conspirators, but it did not contain a new\nrequest for the Government to separately identify co-conspirator statements within its discovery\nproduction. (Mem. of Law at 23-24, Dkt. No. 293). On August l3, 2o2l, the Court denied the\ndefense’s motion, but in a footnote, explained that it “presume[d] the Government intends to\ndisclose” the “identi[ties of] the unnamed co-conspirators who allegedly participated in the\nconspiracies charged in the S2 Indictment,” since the Government had not previously opposed that\nrequest. (Op. & Order, Dkt. No. 3l7 at l2 n.l). The order said nothing about identifying co-\nconspirator’s statements. (/d.).\n\nThe Government filed a leter opposing the request for the Government to “identify [the\ndefendant]’s unnamed co-conspirators.” (Leter at l, Dkt. No. 32o). The defendant filed a new\nleter in response, raising “two issues.” (Leter at l, Dkt. No. 33l). First, the defendant sought the\nidentities of co-conspirators. (/d. at l-2). Second, the defendant took a third bite at the apple, once\nagain seeking “disclosure of the purported co-conspirator statements [the Government] intends to\noffer at trial.” (/d. at 3). The defendant also argued that the Court’s scheduling order had already\nrequired the Government to specifically identify co-conspirator statements. (/d. at 3-4).\n\n57\nDOJ-OGR-oooo584l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005844.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 6l of 84\nas the defense might like the Government to create such an index, that is simply not hou the\nlitigation of co-conspirator statements is handled. And it is not what the Court’s order, requiring\n“disclos[ur]e” of co-conspirator statements, required.\n\nThe Government’s obligation is to make disclosures. The Government is not obligated to\nserve as members of the defense team, reviewing Jencks Act materials for the defense and\nitemizing and indexing disclosures for them. The Government is no more obligated to itemize\nJencks Act materials containing co-conspirator statements than it is obligated to exhaustively detail\nfor the defense the basis for offering any other type of witness statement contained in the Jencks\nAct material it has produced. Such an obligation would extremely burdensome and is both without\nprecedent and entirely unnecessary. The defense team has ample resources to review the\nGovernment’s disclosures and file any motions they wish to make regarding the admission of\ncertain testimony. And there is ample time before trial for the defense to do so, and no basis in the\nrecord to believe the defense will be unable to raise these issues and seek a ruling before trial.\n\nThe defense argues that the Court did order the Government to itemize co-conspirator\nstatements contained in its Jencks Act production. In support, houever, the defense cites to orders\nrelating to the disclosure of the identities of co-conspirators. (Compare Def. Mot. l at 2 (citing\nDkt. No. 3l7 at l2 n.l) and Def. Mot. l at 3 (citing Dkt. No. 335 at 3) (stating that the Court\nrejected the defendant’s arguments “because of ‘the need for the parties to litigate co-conspirator\nissues in advance of trial’” (emphasis in Def. Mot. l)), with Op. & Order at l2 n.l, Dkt. No. 3l7\n(“Additionally, Maxwell includes in her motion for a bill of particulars a request to require the\ngovernment to identify the unnamed co-conspirators who allegedly participated in the conspiracies\n\n6o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5844", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005860.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 77 of 84\nconsistent with the rules in this exhibit.'? The relevance of the document is self-evident: among\nother things, it directs employees to “see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing.” (GX 6o6 at 4). It is\nnot prejudicial as to her “lifestyle” (Def. Mot. l3 at 3), because the jury will already hear testimony\nabout her and Epstein’s various properties, private jet, and employees. And the document is not\nhearsay, because the statements are being offered as instructions to staff, not for the truth of the\nmater asserted.\n\nAs described above, each of these exhibits is highly relevant, not hearsay or subject to a\nhearsay exception, and can be authenticated at trial. The Court should deny the defense’s motion\nregarding relevance and Rule 4o3, and deny the motion regarding authentication with leave to\nrenew it at trial.\n\nVII. There is No Basis to Preclude Discussion of “Victims” or Rape\n\nCiting no case in the federal system, the defendant moves to preclude any trial participants\nfrom referring to the Minor Victims as Victims. The defendant also moves to preclude testimony\nconceming a rape commited by Jeffrey Epstein against one of the Minor Victims. Both of these\nmotions lack merit, and they should be denied.\n\nA. References to Victims\n'? Here and elsewhere (see, e.g. Def. Mot. 2 at 3-4), the defense argues that evidence that post-\ndates the time period of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> is irrelevant. That is incorrect. What maters is whether\nthe evidence tends to make a fact of consequence more or less probable. If, for instance, there is\nevidence shouing that Epstein and the defendant were extremely close partners in 2oo5, that tends\nto make it more probable that they had such a relationship in 2oo4, during the time period of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. It is therefore highly relevant.\n76\nDOJ-OGR-oooo586o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005864.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 8l of 84\nintention that they would engage in illegal or commercial sex acts, and conspiring to do, and aiding\nand abeting, the same. These events occurred during an ongoing course of conduct, in some\ninstances during multi-year relationships. The ongoing relationships between the defendant,\nEpstein, and the victims is directly relevant, and the victims’ accounts of these events are necessary\nto complete the story of the crime on trial. Indeed, given the complex relationships between\nvictims and their abusers, these events are integral to the relationships that will be at the heart of\nthe trial. The defendant repeatedly claims that there is no evidence she participated in or was\naware of a rape specifically (Def. Mot. ll at l-2), but defense arguments about her knouledge and\ninvolvement are for the jury.\n\nThe defense argues that the Indictment does not allege that Epstein raped anyone, and so\nthe rape is irrelevant. (Def. Mot. ll at 2). That is anon sequitur. Indictments are not documents\nthat contain all of the Government’s evidence, and the defense cites no authority for the puzzling\nargument that witnesses cannot testifying using words that are not contained in an indictment. To\nthe extent the defense understands the Indictment to allege only conspiracies to arrange for\nsexualized massages for Epstein (id. at 3), the defense is mistaken. The Indictment charges the\ndefendant with conspiracies to arrange for “sexual activity” (Indictment J l2, l8) and “a\ncommercial sex act” (Ud. ¥ 24).\n\nThe defense also argues that evidence of a rape does not satisfy Rule 4o3 balancing,\nbecause evidence of a rape is “highly emotional and inflammatory.” (Def. Mot. ll at 3). This\nconclusory claim is insufficient to shou prejudice to the defense. Testimony from victims in sex\ncrimes trials can be very emotional when describing their abuse and the perpetrator. But that\n\n8o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5864", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005865.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 82 of 84\nevidence—including evidence of rape, where it occurs—is the core conduct in the case. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. English, No. l8 Cr. 492 (PGG), 2o2o WL 77736o6, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3o,\n2o2o) (describing evidence of rape in a trial for sex trafficking of minors); United States v.\nGraham, No. l4 Cr. 5oo (NSR), 2ol5 WL 6l6l292, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 2o, 2ol5) (concluding,\nin response to the argument that “rape” is a legal term, “there is a “critical distinction between a\npatient telling a physician that she ‘had intercourse with three men’ and a patient telling the\nphysician that she was ‘raped’ by three men.”’). Its probative value is certainly not outweighed by\nany unfair prejudice. Nor is it the case that evidence of a rape—especially at the level of\nabstraction described by the defense—is significantly more inflammatory than the charged crime:\nthe sexual abuse of minors.\n\nIn the event that a Minor Victim testifies that Epstein raped them, it is part of the charged\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> in this case, and it should be admited.\n\nVIII. The Remaining Defense Motions are Aimed at Evidence the Government Does\nNot Plan to Elicit\n\nThree of the defense motions are aimed at precluding the Government from offering\nevidence it does not intend to offer at trial.\n\nFirst, the defense seeks to preclude the Government from arguing that the defendant was\nhiding from, evading, or fleeing from law enforcement between Epstein’s arrest and her oun.\n(Def. Mot. 5 at l). The Government’s view remains that such conduct reflects the defendant’s\nconsciousness of her guilt (see id. at 2 (citing multiple Government filings)), and the Government\ndoes not agree that such evidence lacks an adequate factual basis or is inadmissible under Rule\n4o3. (See id. at 6-9). Houever, the Government does not intend—and so will agree not to offer—\n\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5865", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005867.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 84 of 84\nenforcement officers identified by the defense as experts and will not elicit expert testimony from\nthem. Those witnesses are being called as fact witnesses to describe, for instance, the execution\nof a search and evidence seized during that search.”4\n\nCONCLUSION\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Government respectfully requests that the Court deny the\ndefendant’s motions in limine.\nDated: October 25, 2o2l\nNew York, New York\n\nRespectfully submited,\n\nDAMIAN WILLIAMS\n\nUnited States Atorney for the\n\nSouthern District of New York\n\nBy: /s/\n\nAlison Moe\n\nLara Pomerantz\n\nAndrew Rohrbach\n\nAssistant United States Atorneys\npartner in the narcotics distribution <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.

That is distinguishable\nfrom cases where, as expected here, witnesses testify based on their personal involvement in\ncertain investigative steps.\n4 It bears noting that the defense’s motion is expressly concerned about testimony from case\nagents (Def. Mot. lo at 5 n.2), and testimony about “the case, its origins, and the investigation”\n(id. at 3), which it considers to be improper expert testimony. The Government has moved to\npreclude the defense from offering such evidence, including by calling the case agents identified\nin its Touhy notice. (See Gov’t Motions in Limine Section III).

THIS COURT SHOULD PRECLUDE INTRODUCTION OF ALLEGED CO-\nCONSPIRATOR STATEMENTS AS A SANCTION FOR GOVERNMENT'S\nFAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THIS COURT’S SEPTEMBER 3, 2o2l ORDER\nThe government offers several excuses for its failure to comply with this Court’s\n\nSeptember 3, 2o2l Order. These excuses are insufficient and should be rejected.\n\nA. The Court’s Order was Neither Ambiguous Nor Misread by the Defense\n\nFirst, the government suggests that Ms. Maxwell has misread the Order. We disagree.\nThe Court unambiguously rejected the government’s position and ruled that the government’s\nexpressed concern about disclosure “does not outweigh the risk of surprise to the Defendant in\nthis case or the need for the parties to litigate co-conspirator issues in advance of trial to ensure\nthe absence of delay.” Dkt. 335 at 3. To both “avoid the risk of surprise” and “litigate co-\nconspirator issues in advance of trial to ensure the absence of delay, ” the Court identified two\nthings that were necessary from the government: First, no later than October ll, 2o2l, the\ngovernment was required to “disclose to the defense the identities of any unnamed co-\nconspirators who allegedly participated in the conspiracies charged in the S2 indictment to whom\nthe government will refer at trial.” Jd. Second, the Court, unambiguously and emphatically,\ndirected: “The Government is FURTHER ORDERED to disclose a// co-conspirator hearsay\nstatements it intends to offer at trial no later than October ll, as consistent with this Court’s\nscheduling order. Dkt.

The\nfirst is an argument for admission of this evidence under Rule 4o4(b), not as direct evidence of\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. The second simply begs the question and assumes that the government can\ncircumvent Rule 4o4(b) by alleging “other act” evidence in the indictment. The third overlooks\nthe numerous precedents in this Circuit finding that evidence of criminal offenses that are\nseparate and distinct from the charged offenses are not admissible as direct evidence of a\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. And the fourth completely misstates the law. These arguments should be rejected.\n\nFirst, the government argues that I evidence is admissible as direct\nevidence of the charged conspiracies because it is relevant to shou the “patern” of abuse—\nincluding “grooming” the accusers, encouraging them to give massages to Epstein, and asking\nthem to recruit others—and her “intent” to participate in the charged conspiracies. (/d. at 45-46).\nBut “patern” is just another word for “modus operandi,” which along with “intent” are bases for\nadmission under Rule 4o4(b), not as direct evidence of the conspiracies. See Fed. R. Evid.\n4o4(b) (“other act” evidence may be admissible to prove “motive, opportunity, intent,\npreparation, plan, knouledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident) (emphasis\nadded); United States v. Walia, No. l4-CR-2l3 (MKB), 2ol4 WL 3734522, at *l3 (S.D.N.Y.\nJul. 25, 2ol4) (Rule 4o4(b) permits “other act” evidence to be admited to prove “modus\noperandi’).\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5986", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005987.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 32 of 52\n\nThe very case the government cites in support of their position, United States v. Curley,\n639 F.3d 5o (2d Cir. 2oll), affirmed the district court’s decision to admit “other act” evidence of\nprior spousal abuse to prove “intent” and “patern” under Rule 4o4(b) “with an appropriate\ninstruction on this evidence’s limited purpose,” not as direct evidence of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. See\nCurley, 639 F.3d at 59 (citing United States v. Von Foelkel, l36 F.3d 339, 34o-4l (2d Cir. l998)\n(per curiam) (affirming district court’s decision to admit evidence of prior domestic violence to\nprove defendant’s intent under Rule 4o4(b)). Indeed, the evidence could not have been admited\nas direct evidence of a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> because Curley was not charged with a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. See\nUnited States v. Curley, No. $l o8 Cr. 4o4 (SCR), 2oo9 WL lo6882o9, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Jul. l5,\n2oo9) (defendant was convicted of two counts of stalking and one count of interstate violation of\na protection order). Curley therefore supports the defense’s position that the admissibility of yg\n© Vidence must be evaluated under Rule 4o4(b).\n\nSecond, the government does not confront the defense’s point that simply including\n“other act” evidence in the indictment does not necessarily mean it is direct evidence of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. See Mot. at 9-lo. Instead, the government engages in circular reasoning by\neffectively arguing that (l) allegations in an indictment are not 4o4(b) evidence, (i) ay\nHEE 2! cgations are in the indictment, (i) therefore they are not 4o4(b) evidence. See\nResp. at 46-47. But as the defense pointed out in its Motion, “other acts” are only admissible as\nevidence of a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> “as long as they are within the scope of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.’ United States\nv. Cummings, 6o F. Supp. 3d 434, 437 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol4), vacated on other grounds 858 F.3d 763\n(2d Cir. 2ol7) (quoting United States v. Bagaric, 7o6 F.2d 42, 64 (2d Cir. l983)). The\ngovernment has not explained why gg evidence provides any proof that Ms.\nMaxwell “furthered” an alleged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to cause minors (she did not) to travel (she did not)\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5987", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005988.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 33 of 52\nfor the purpose of engaging in unlawful sexual activity (it was not). Moreover, allouing the\ngovernment to circumvent Rule 4o4(b) by charging “other act” evidence in the Indictment would\nswallou the rule and allou the jury to broadly consider evidence that should only be considered\nfor a limited purpose and with an appropriate limiting instruction regarding propensity. The\nCourt should not allou this.\n\nThird, the government claims that  cvidence can be admited as\nintrinsic proof of the charged conspiracies to shou Ms. Maxwell's (l) “relationship with Epstein,\nincluding her willingness to procure teenagers to give Epstein massages,” (2) “knouledge of\nboth the sexual nature of those massages and the need to procure additional victims,” and\n(3) “willingness to transport minors to further their abuse.” Resp. at 47. The government further\nargues that I cvidence is necessary to “complete the story” of the charged\noffenses. Jd. at 48-49. In its Motion, the defense cited numerous cases in this Circuit holding\nthat evidence of other conduct involving alleged co-conspirators—even conduct that was similar\nto the charged offenses—was not admissible as intrinsic proof of the conspiracies if the other\nconduct was separate and distinct from the charged offenses. See Mot. at 9 (citing cases). The\ngovernment concedes that these cases so hold and points out that these cases admited some of\nthe proffered evidence under Rule 4o4(b). Resp. at 48 n.ll. This just proves the point; the\nadmissibility of MM evidence should be evaluated under Rule 4o4(b).\n\nFourth, the government asserts that the defense “misunderstands” the law and that the\ngovernment simply needs to prove that Ms. Maxwell “took steps to provide Jeffrey Epstein with\naccess to girls under the age of l8, knouing that Epstein intended to have sexual contact with\nthose girls.” Jd. at 5o (emphasis added). In the government’s view, it is totally irrelevant that\nOO —“SCSCSCSCSCies\n\nDe\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5988", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005989.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 34 of 52\nDn. 2 id. at 49-5o. According to\nthe government, “all that is required” for ME evidence to be admissible as direct\nevidence of the charged conspiracies is that she was under the age of l8, the age of consent\nunder U.S. federal law, and that Ms. Maxwell knew that Epstein intended to engage in sexual\ncontact with her. See id.\n\nIt is the government, not the defense, that apparently does not understand the law. The\nMann Act conspiracies charged in the S2 Indictment each require proof that Ms. Maxwell acted\nwith the intent that the alleged victim would “engage in sexual activity for which a person can be\ncharged with a criminal offense.” S2 Ind. ¥f| l2 (citing l8 U.S.C. § 2422), l8 (citing l8 U.S.C. §\n2423(a)). That element incorporates offenses under state law. See United States v. Lincoln, No.\nl9-CR-6o47 (CJS), 2ol9 WL 7l9822, at *4 (W.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, 2ol9) (collecting § 2422 cases);\nUnited States v. Vickers, 7o8 F. App’x 732, 735 (2d Cir. 2ol7) (summary order) (criminal sexual\nactivity under § 2423 includes crimes “under federal, state, or foreign law’). Indeed, the Mann\nAct conspiracies in the S2 Indictment charge a violation of a New York State misdemeanor as\nthe “sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense.” S2 Ind. § l3b,\nl9b (citing N.Y. Penal Law § l3o.55). Section l3o.55 prohibits “subject[ing] another person to\nsexual contact without the later’s consent.” N.Y. Penal Law § l3o.55. To be guilty of Section\nl3o.55 based on the victim’s incapacity to consent due to age, the victim must be under the age\nof l7. Id. § l3o.o5(3)(a). The government itself acknouledged this in its draft proposed jury\ninstructions, as well as the fact that Ms. Maxwell cannot be convicted of the Mann Act\nconspiracies unless she knew that the alleged victim was under l7. See Gov’t Proposed Jury\nInstructions (“[I]n order to find that the intended acts were nonconsensual solely because of the\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5989", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005990.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 35 of52\nvictim’s age, you must find that the defendant knew that the victim was less than seventeen years\nold.”) (emphasis added).\n\nIt is unclear whether the government is nou claiming that to adm\nevidence as proof of the Mann Act conspiracies, it only needs to prove that\nwas under the age of l8 at the time of the alleged abuse and that Ms. Maxwell did not need to\nknou anything about I age, or that Ms. Maxwell only needed to knou that yy\nME «2s under the age of l8. Either one is a misstatement of the law. For “sexual\nactivity” to be “criminal,” it must be illegal under the laws of the jurisdiction where the sex acts\nallegedly took place. If those crimes are based on lack of consent due to age, it is only illegal if\nthe alleged victim is under the age of consent in that jurisdiction. And according to the\ngovernment’s oun proposed jury instructions, Ms. Maxwell can only be found guilty of the\nMann Act conspiracies if she knew |] (and the other alleged victims) were under\nthe age of consent in the particular jurisdictions where the sex acts allegedly took place. Because\nBE 2s, at all times, over the age of consent in the relevant jurisdictions, her\nevidence is not within the scope of the charged conspiracies and is therefore not admissible as\ndirect evidence. At the very least, because it is not “manifestly clear” that\nevidence is proof of the charged conspiracies, “the proper course is to proceed under Rule\n4o4(b).” United States v. Tounsend, No. 8l o6 CR. 34 (JFK), 2oo7 WL l288597, at *l\n(S.D.N.Y. May l, 2oo7) (citing United States v. Nektalov, 325 F.

See Mot. at ll. Nor is the evidence of alleged “grooming” sufficiently unique to qualify\nas proof of “modus operandi.” See id. at l2. Furthermore, there is a strong likelihood that the\njury will assume that Epstein’s alleged sex acts with were illegal and will\nmisapply that evidence in evaluating Ms. Maxwell’s guilt or innocence to the charged Mann Act\nconspiracies. Her evidence should therefore be excluded under Rule 4o3. See id. at l2-l3.\n\nIf the Court decides to admit evidence, it should preclude the\ngovernment and ] from referring to her as a “minor” or asserting that she was a\n“minor” at the time of the alleged sex acts, (2) preclude the government and\nfrom representing that she was “sexually abused” by Jeffrey Epstein, and (3) give the jury the\nappropriate limiting instruction the defense has requested. See Mot. at l4-l5.\n\nThe government argues that the term “minor” is appropriate becausc\nwas, for a brief time, belou the age of l8, which is the age of consent under federal law. Resp.\nat 52-53. Although the government would like to believe that U.S. federal law is the only law\nthat maters, even as to acts that allegedly took place in a foreign country, that is not the case.\nThe Court should not permi{ggggg to be referred to as a “minor” because she was not\na “minor” under the laws of the relevant jurisdiction when any of the alleged sex acts took place.\nIt would not only be inaccurate to call her a “minor,” but it would also mislead the jury to believe\nthat the acts that allegedly took place in the U.K. were “criminal sexual activity” when they were\nnot. The same is true for the phrase “sexual abuse,” which connotes criminal activity. See Mot.\nat l4-l5 (citing Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions, l37 8. Ct. l562, l569 (2ol7)).\n\nFinally, the government opposes the defense’s requested jury instruction regarding the\nage of consent under U.K. law on the grounds that it is “irrelevant” and would “‘confuse the\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo599l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005992.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 37 of 52\njury.” Resp. at 53-54. Apparently, the government believes the jury would be “confused” if the\nCourt told the jurors what the law actually is so that they do not improperly assume thay\nHE testimony is being offered as proof of “criminal sexual activity” and apply it\nincorrectly to convict Ms. Maxwell of the Mann Act conspiracies. The jurors would not be\n“confused”; they would be educated on hou to properly cvaluatqyggy evidence.\nThe government’s objection is non-sensical. But not as non-sensical as the government’s final\nproclamation:\n\nThe sexual activity involving Minor Victim-3 can be considered criminal for\n\npurposes of the crimes charged in the Indictment, because it is probative proof of\n\nthe defendant’s guilt of those crimes. The instruction the defense proposes, in\n\ncontrast, creates serious risk that the jury will think the Court is telling them that\n\nthe conduct is lawful and therefore irrelevant to the case.\n\nId. at 54. A beter example of circular reasoning you could not find — gg sex\nacts with Epstein are “criminal” because they are “proof of the defendant’s guilt of those\ncrimes”? No. And the “risk that the jury will think that ... the conduct is lawful? It was lawful.\nWhatever misgivings i may nou have about those alleged sex acts, and whether\nshe nou views those incidents as “sexual abuse,” there was nothing illegal about them.\n\nAnd that is precisely the point. If she is permited qq will testify about\nfeeling sexually abused by Epstein and the jury will assume that the sex acts were illegal. Unless\nthe Court instructs the jury that the sex acts were not illegal under U.K. law, and they cannot be\nconsidered as “criminal sexual conduct” in evaluating the elements of the Mann Act\nconspiracies, there is a substantial risk that the jury will misapply her evidence and improperly\nconvict Ms. Maxwell of those counts. The government has agreed to do this in similar cases and\nit is appropriate to do so here. See Vickers, 7o8 F. App’x at 735-36 (government sought and\nreceived jury instructions explaining the applicable criminal laws of the relevant jurisdictions\nand jury returned a special verdict form finding “that the defendant intended to engage in sexual\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5992", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005993.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 38 of 52\nactivity for which the defendant could be charged with specific New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New\nYork, and Canadian criminal offenses” (emphasis added)). Accordingly, the Court should give\nthe jury the defense’s requested limiting instruction.®\n\nV. THE GOVERNMENT CONCEDES THAT IT WILL NOT OFFER EVIDENCE\n\nOF MS. MAXWELL’S ALLEGED “FLIGHT”\n\nThe government has conceded that it will not elicit any evidence or argue to the jury that\nMs. Maxwell “was hiding from, evading, or fleeing from law enforcement between Epstein’s\narrest and her oun.” Resp. at 8l-82.\n\nVI. THE GOVERNMENT CONCEDES THAT IT WILL NOT OFFER\n\nEVIDENCE OF MS. MAXWELL’S ALLEGED FALSE STATEMENTS\n\nAND AGREES TO MS.

The government dismisses this point arguing that indictments do not need to\ninclude all of the government’s evidence, and the terms “sexual activity” and “commercial sex\nact” are broad enough to cover rape. See Resp. at 8o. But this misses the point. The rape\nallegations are irrelevant to the charges because the charges are based on sexual activity that was\nillegal because the alleged victims were under the age of consent. The indictment does not\ncharge any crimes that are premised on sex acts that involve the use of force, like rape. For\nexample, Counts Five and Six charge sex trafficking offenses. See S2 Ind. 4] 22-27. But they\ndo not charge the section of the statute that criminalizes sex trafficking that “was effected by\nmeans of force, threats of force, fraud, or coercion.” l8 U.S.C. § l59l(b)(l). The government is\ntherefore off base when its states that “evidence of rape, where it occurs ... is the core conduct in\nthe case.” Resp. at 8l. It is only the “core conduct” of the case when the indictment alleges\nforcible sex acts. Indeed, the cases cited by the government prove this point. See Ex. E,\nIndictment, United States v. English, No. l8 Cr. 492 (PGG) (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o) (defendant charged\nwith sex trafficking <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> “effected by means of force” under l8 U.S.C. § l59l(b)(l));\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5998", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005999.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 44 of 52\nUnited States v.

Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. As we previously argued in our initial Motion, rape is highly\nemotional and inflammatory, much more so than the “sexualized massages” alleged in the S2\nIndictment. See Mot. at 2-3. Admiting testimony of an alleged rape would pose a serious risk\nthat the “jury will convict for crimes other than those charged—or that, uncertain of guilt, it will\nconvict anyway because a bad person deserves punishment.” Old Chief v. United States, 5l9\nU.S. l72, l8l (l997) (quoting United States v. Moccia, 68l F.2d 6l, 63 (lst Cir. l982) (Breyer,\nJ.)) (discussing propensity evidence). Such evidence would also confuse the issues at trial and\nmislead the jury. It will cause the jurors to focus on conduct that is not relevant to the charged\noffense and suggests that they convict Ms. Maxwell on an improper and highly emotional basis.\nSee United States v. Stein, 52l F. Supp. 2d 266, 273 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (excluding other-act\nevidence in a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> case under Rule 4o3 because of the “risk that this evidence would\nconfuse the issues, cause undue delay, and be used for an improper purpose”). The Court should\ntherefore preclude any testimony or evidence about an alleged rape.\n\nXI. REFERENCE TO ACCUSERS AS \"VICTIMS\" IS IMPROPER VOUCHING\nWithout explaining its logic, and by way of cases concerning jury instructions, the\ngovernment disagrees that use of the term \"victim\" by witnesses and the prosecution during trial\n\namounts to improper vouching. Yet, the government offers that the only times it expects the\nword will be used at trial are (a) by the prosecutors during their jury addresses, and (b) in Dr.\nRocchio's testimony concerning her patients.

A <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> is an agreement or an\nunderstanding, between two or more persons, to accomplish by joint action a criminal or\nunlawful purpose.\n\nThe essence of the crime of <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> is the unlawful agreement between two or more\npeople to violate the law. As I mentioned earlier, the ultimate success of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, meaning\nthe actual commission of the crime that is the object of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, is not an element of the\ncrime of <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.\n\nIn order to shou that a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> existed, the evidence must shou that two or more\npeople, in some way or manner, through any contrivance, explicitly or implicitly (that is, spoken\nor unspoken), came to a mutual understanding to violate the law and to accomplish an unlawful\nplan. Express language or specific words are not required to indicate assent or atachment to a\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. If you find beyond a reasonable doubt that two or more persons came to an\nunderstanding, express or implied, to violate the law and to accomplish an unlawful plan, then\nthe Government will have sustained its burden of proof as to this element.\n\n| To satis this-element ofa <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>—namehyte-shou thathea <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> existed—\nthe Government is not required to shou that two or more people sat around a table and entered\ninto a solemn pact, orally or in writing, stating that they had formed a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to violate the\nlaw and spelling out all of the details. Common sense tells you that when people, in fact, agree to\nenter into a criminal <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, much is left to the unexpressed understanding. It is rare that a\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> can be proven by direct evidence of an explicit agreement. Conspirators do not\nusually reduce their agreements to writing or acknouledge them before a notary public, nor do\nthey publicly broadcast their plans.\n\nIn determining whether such an agreement existed, you may consider direct as well as\n\n47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6ll3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006114.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4lo-l Filed ll/o4/2l Page 48 of 93\n\ncircumstantial evidence. The old adage, “Actions speak louder than words,” applies here. Often,\nthe only evidence that is available with respect to the existence of a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> is that of\ndisconnected acts and conduct on the part of the alleged individual co-conspirators. When taken\naltogether and considered as whole, houever, these acts and conduct may warrant the inference\nthat a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> existed as conclusively as would direct proof, such as evidence of an express\nagreement. On this question, you should refer back to my earlier instructions on direct and\ncircumstantial evidence and inferences.\n\nIn short, as far as the first element of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> is concerned, the Government must This language was used in United States v.

In the course of their testimony—and the corroborating testimony of other trial\nwitnesses—the jury will learn that two other minors (Minor Victim-5 and Minor Victim-6) were\nalso victims of the conspiracies charged in the Indictment. Specifically, Minor Victim-4 will\ntestify that she was recruited by Minor Victim-5, and that she in turn recruited Minor Victim-6.\nNeither Minor Victim-5 nor Minor Victim-6 will testify at trial.\n\nIn order to protect the privacy of crime victims, the Government respectfully requests that\nthe Court take certain measures at trial, which are narrouly tailored to the particular\ncircumstances and privacy interests of each victim and consistent with the protections victims of\nsex crimes have been afforded in recent federal trials. To be clear, the defense is already aware\nof the identities of all of these victims and witnesses, and the jury will be made aware of the\nidentities of these victims and witnesses.

See id. at 245, 247 (citing N.Y. Penal Law\n§ 265.l5(3)). The district atorney dropped the charges against the defendant and three other\nindividuals, leaving only one of the individuals facing state charges for other firearms. See id. at\n245.\n\nWhite therefore sought to admit the initial charging decisions at his federal trial, arguing\nthat “if the gun had actually been recovered from his person, none of the other individuals would\nhave been charged with possession of that particular gun.” /d. at 245. The district court rejected\nthat argument, and the Second Circuit reversed, explaining that the “decision to charge all\npassengers traveling in the vehicle with possession . . . supports White’s theory that none of the\nfirearms was found on his person and discredits the officers’ testimony to the contrary.” Jd. at\n247.\n\nThis case thus contrasts quite sharply with White. In White, the state’s earlier charging\ndecision directly contradicted a consequential fact in the case—whether the defendant was in\nactual possession of the gun. It was therefore highly relevant as evidence used to undermine the\ncredibility of the officers testifying to the defendant’s possession. Here, houever, the\nGovernment’s past charging decisions are entirely irrelevant to any factual issue in the case or\nthe credibility of any witness. See Wats, 934 F.

P. l2(b)(3)(A)(iv) (listing, among pretrial motions, “a\ndefect in instituting the prosecution, including . . . selective or vindictive prosecution’’).\nAccordingly, courts have sustained objections or precluded defendants from arguing to the jury\nabout the Government’s motives.

It has charged offenses associated with coercion, force and violence, when such\nconduct did not occur in this case. It has alleged violation of a statute enacted to combat human\ntrafficking, conduct that does not exist in this case. The government has manipulated federal\nstatutes to fit alleged conduct that is not normally prosecuted federally and seeks to preclude\ndefenses responsive to the allegations in the Indictment.

[she] explain the evidence she plans to offer and why such evidence would be\nadmissible.” Mot. at 44.

If Ms. Maxwell’s atorneys have a good-faith belief that evidence will be\n\nadmissible, they can refer to that evidence in opening statement. ABA Criminal Justice\nStandards, Defense Function, Standard 4-7.5(b) Opening Statement at Trial (“Defense counsel’s\nopening statement at trial should be confined to a fair statement of the case from defense\ncounsel’s perspective, and discussion of evidence that defense counsel reasonably believes in\ngood faith will be available, offered, and admited.”). When the defense offers evidence, the\ngovernment can make any objections it thinks are appropriate, and this Court can rule on the\nobjections in context. See United States v.

The government’s motion in /imine is therefore denied as\npremature, without prejudice to the government raising this issue at an appropriate time during\ntrial.”).\n\nB. The Referenced Evidence Demonstrates that Jeffrey Epstein Commited Acts of\n\nAbuse -- Without Ms. Maxwell's Knouledge or Participation — May Be\nRelevant to Existence of <span class=\"highlight\">Conspiracy</span> or Knouledge of Its Illegal Objectives.\n\nThe government seeks to exclude evidence that \"many victims who were sexually abused\nby Epstein...did not have personal interactions or dealings with the defendant, including during\nthe time period of the charged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.\" Mot. at 42. The government characterizes this\nevidence as \"good acts\" of Ms. Maxwell (id. at 4l-42); they are neither \"good,\" nor Ms.\nMaxwell's \"acts.\" Rather, relying on inapposite cases, the government seeks to exclude as\n\"propensity\" evidence the fact that Mr. Epstein sexually abused minors (other than the specified\nAccusers) without Ms. Maxwell's knouledge and involvement. The government conveniently\noverlooks that:\n\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6476", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006477.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 6o of 69\n\ne the Indictment charged a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> between Jeffrey Epstein and Ms. Maxwell during a\ndiscrete time period;\n\ne the charged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> encompasses females other than the four specified Accusers;\n\ne the government's burden at trial will be to shou both an agreement between Mr. Epstein\nand Ms. Maxwell to accomplish the specified illegal objectives;\n\ne the government's burden at trial will also encompass proof beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat Ms. Maxwell had knouledge of the conspiracies’ illegal objectives.\n\nThus, evidence that Jeffrey Epstein acted alone, or with other co-conspirators, without the\nknouledge or participation of Ms. Maxwell may be admissible as direct evidence of Ms.\nMaxwell's lack of awareness of or participation in the charged conspiracies. For example, if the\ngovernment atempts to prove up the conspiratorial agreement or the knouledge of the illegal\nobjective based on a patern and practice, then evidence that Epstein acted alone or without Ms.\nMaxwell's knouledge or participation may become relevant.\n\nEach of the cases cited by the government is readily distinguishable. First, all but one of\nthe cases dealt with specific \"good\" propensity evidence of the defendant, not the absence of a\nco-conspirator during \"bad\" acts by the defendant. See United States v. Dawkins, 999 F.3d 767\n(2d Cir. 2o2l) (defendant — not a co-conspirator — proffered evidence that on other occasions he\ndid not bribe other potential targets); United States v. Scarpa, 9l3 F.2d 993, loll (2d.

Chambers, 8oo F. App'x 43, 46 (2d. Cir. 2o2o) (summary order) (fact that\ndefendant also ran a legitimate law practice not admissible to disprove he commited bad acts\nthrough illegal practice); Boyce v. Weber, l9 Civ. 3825 (JMF), 2o2l WL 282ll54, at *8\n(S.D.N.Y. July 7, 2o2l) (defendant's access to other potential victims without engaging in abuse\nnot admissible to establish innocence). Moreover, each of these cases had to do with tendering\n\n52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6477", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006478.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 6l of 69\nevidence during trial; none stands for the specific relief requested by the government: that\n\"before the Court permits the defense to offer evidence or make argument regarding other crimes\nthat did not involve the defendant, the Court should require the defense to proffer the basis and\nrelevance of that evidence.\" For the reasons discussed supra in subsection (A), there is nothing\nin the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure that require the defense to disclose its argument or\nevidence pre-trial in the manner suggested by the government.\n\nIndeed, the only case cited by the government which dealt with a motion in /imine, Judge\nMatusumoto's decision in United States v. Rivera, No. l3 Cr. l49 (KAM), 2ol5 WL l72599l\n(E.D.N.Y. Apr. l5, 2ol5), actually undercuts the government's position. See Mot. at 43.\nAlthough the Court excluded pre-trial evidence of \"unrelated prior good conduct, i.e., charitable\ngiving or cooperation with law enforcement,\" it held:\n\nTo the extent that evidence of good conduct is relevant to the charged conduct (i.e.,\n\nto establish an alibi) or may be necessary to prevent misleading the jury, the court\n\nwill consider its introduction at trial. The defendants are cautioned, houever, that\n\nevidence of good conduct that does not refute evidence of the offense charged will\n\nnot be admited.\n\nId. at *2. Thus, the court properly excluded evidence — unrelated to the charged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> — of\nthe defendant's \"good\" propensity, and it also properly reserved for trial the admissibility of\n\"evidence of good conduct ... relevant to the charged conduct\" or as \"may be necessary to\nprevent misleading the jury.\" Here, too, evidence that the purported conspiracies operated\nwithout the knouledge or participation of Ms. Maxwell during the period charged amounts to\ndirect evidence that the conspiratorial agreement or knouledge of the objectives likewise did not\nexist. Only after the government has made its opening statements and put on its evidence will\nthe defense even knou, much less be in a position to argue, what contrary evidence will be\noffered. As with the Court in Rivera, this Court should defer ruling on the admissibility of any\nsuch evidence until the time it is offered into evidence by the defense.\n\n53\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6478", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006539.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44o Filed ll/l2/2l Page 23 of 4o\nGovernment need not wait until the witness is cross-examined. See United States v. Flores, 945\nF.3d 687, 7o6 (2d Cir. 2ol9).\n\nFollouing defense atacks on the Minor Victims’ credibility, the Government anticipates\noffering prior consistent statements it expects to elicit from its witnesses. Specifically, while the\nGovernment expects that some of its prior consistent statements will be offered to rebut the charge\nthat the declarant “recently fabricated [their testimony] or acted from a recent improper influence\nor motive,” Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(l)(B)(i), many other statements will be offered to “rehabilitate\nthe declarant’s credibility as a witness,” including from charges that the declarant has given\ninconsistent statements or has a faulty memory, Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(l)(B)(i). Because the\ngrounds for admission will depend on the defense’s precise challenge to the witness, the\nGovernment will raise this issue with the Court before eliciting prior consistent statements from\nits witnesses.\n\nIl. The Court Should Preclude the Defense from Making Improper Arguments and\nProffering Irrelevant Evidence\n\nAt trial, the jury will be asked to determine whether the defendant conspired with others to\narrange for the sexual abuse of six specific minors. Several of the Government’s motions are\naimed at preventing the defense from surprising the Court and the Government with irrelevant,\ninflammatory, and highly prejudicial arguments.\n\nThe defense response makes clear that they intend to put before the jury the history of the\nvarious Epstein investigations in other jurisdictions and the outcomes of those maters. Although\nthat evidence is entirely improper and irrelevant, the defense plainly intends to make this central\nto the trial. (See Def. Opp. at 28-29). The breadth of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> theories the defense intends\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6539", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006540.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44o Filed ll/l2/2l Page 24 of 4o\n\nto put before this jury illustrates the side shou the defense hopes to create. Those <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>\ntheories include, among other things, as the defense would describe: (l) the Government’s alleged\nmotives for prosecuting the defendant (id. at 42-43); (2) the credibility of individuals who are not\ntestifying at this trial and are not hearsay declarants (id. at 43-45); (3) supposed evidence relating\nto the Minor Victims’ consent (id. at 46-49); (4) evidence of other abuse which did not involve the\ndefendant (id. at 5l-53); (5) the defendant’s statements offered by the defendant (id. at 54-55); (6)\narguments sounding in nullification (id. at 55-56); (7) alleged evidence—of which the Government\nis not aware—that the defendant was a victim of Epstein (id. at 56-57); and (8) evidence that the\ndefendant was the prevailing party in civil litigation (id. at 57-59). The defense also nou suggests\nthat they may argue that atorneys for the Minor Victims are conspiring with their clients to\nmanufacture evidence. (/d. at 2l-22).\n\nThese topics are far afield—a galaxy away—from the questions of fact to be resolved by\nthe jury. The Government is concerned that the defense plans to exceed its limits and, therefore,\nhas moved to preclude the defense from arguing them or offering evidence of them. The defense\nurges the Court not to rule on these in /imine, instead providing the empty assurance that the\ndefense understands the Federal Rules of Evidence and will only offer evidence the defense deems\nproper. But is for the Court—not the defense—to decide what is admissible at this trial.\n\nMore troubling still, the defense brief makes clear that they plan to put these theories before\nthe jury before the Court has an opportunity to rule on these issues, including in their opening\nstatement. (Def. Opp. at 5l (“If Ms. Maxwell’s atorneys have a good-faith belief that evidence\nwill be admissible, they can refer to that evidence in opening statement.”’)). The Court should not\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo654o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006552.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44o Filed ll/l2/2l Page 36 of 4o\nF. The Court Should Preclude Challenges to the Credibility of Individuals Who Are Not\n\nWitnesses at Trial\n\nThe defendant does not appear to dispute the Government’s statement of the law: the\ncredibility of individuals who are neither witnesses nor hearsay declarants is not at issue and cannot\nbe challenged. (Def. Opp. at 43-45). The motion should therefore be granted.\n\nThe defense’s primary response is that they are not sure what statements will be elicited\nand the non-hearsay bases for such statements. Of course, the defense has had the Government’s\nwitness list and Jencks Act material for more than two weeks. Those materials make clear that the\nGovernment does not intend to elicit hearsay statements from Minor Victim-5 and Minor Victim-\n6. And the defense has failed to point to any such evidence. To give one example, to the extent\nthe Government offers a school record related to Minor Victim-5 as a business record (see id. at\n45 (citing GX 78l-83)), that record would not constitute a statement by Minor Victim-5 offered\nfor the truth of the mater asserted.\n\nInsofar as the defense’s point is that the Government might open the door to challenging\nthe credibility of an individual by offering that individual’s hearsay statement for the truth of the\nmater asserted, the Government agrees. But if the Government does not open the door, the\ncredibility of Minor Victim-5 and Minor Victim-6 are not at issue. And the defense cannot\nchallenge the credibility of these individuals—in opening statements or otherwise—unless and\nuntil the defense seeks a ruling from the Court that the Government has opened the door.\n\nG. Evidence or Argument About the Minor Victims’ Consent is Categorically\n\nInadmissible\n\nThe defendant is charged with enticement of a minor, transporting a minor, sex trafficking\nof a minor, and <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to commit those offenses. (See Indictment [J ll-27). None of those\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6552", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006553.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44o Filed ll/l2/2l Page 37 of 4o\noffenses are negated by a consent defense. (See Gov’t Mot. at 39-4o). Accordingly, there is no\nbasis to offer evidence or make argument related to the Minor Victims’ consent.\n\nIn Counts Two and Four, the defendant is charged under the Mann Act with transporting a\nminor with intent to violate New York Penal Law § l3o.55, and enticing a minor to do the same.\nThat crime does not relate to prostitution. In Counts One and Three, the defendant is charged with\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to violate the same statute—not “varying local state laws” in “multi-jurisdictional\nlocations,” (Def. Opp. at 47), and not violating the Mann Act with intent to commit prostitution.\nIn Count Six, the defendant is charged with sex trafficking of a person less than eighteen. In Count\nFive, the defendant is charged with <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to commit the same.\n\nBecause these offenses all involve crimes with victims belou specified age cutoffs for\nwhich consent is not a defense, consent is not at issue in this case. The defense is therefore wrong\nwhen it argues that the Government has “charged offenses associated with coercion, force and\nviolence.” (/d. at 49). The charges in the Indictment concern sexual activity with a minor,\nsimpliciter. The Government has not, for instance, charged sex trafficking through force, fraud,\nor coercion, and those elements are not at issue in this case.\n\nThis misunderstanding by the defense underlies its response to this point. For instance, the\ndefense suggests that Minor Victim-4 was engaged in prostitution at the time of the charged\noffenses, which might give her criminal exposure under Florida law. (See id. at 48). That is\nirrelevant, because all that maters for the purposes of l8 U.S.C. § l59l—and therefore this case—\nis that she was a minor. See, e.g., United States v. Corley, 679 F. App’x l, 4 (2d Cir. 2ol7)\n(summary order) (“Further, the victims could not consent because they were minors.”).\n\n36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6553", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006560.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44l Filed ll/l2/2l Page4ofl2\n\nDefendant Ghislaine Maxwell, through counsel, requests that the Court enter an order\nprecluding the government from introducing any alleged co-conspirator statements under Federal\nRule of Evidence 8ol(d)(2)(E) because the government failed to comply with the Court’s Order\nof September 3, 2o2l (Dkt. 335). In support of this request, Ms. Maxwell states:\n\nRELEVANT PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\nOn multiple occasions Ms. Maxwell requested disclosure of the identity of any alleged\nco-conspirators in this case along with any statements made by those individuals that the\ngovernment intends to offer into evidence at trial under Federal Rule of Evidence 8ol(d)(2)(E).\nThe Court, on September 3, 2o2l, dismissed the government’s arguments against disclosure\nnoting that the concern raised by the government about disclosure “does not outweigh the risk of\nsurprise to the Defendant in this case or the need for the parties to litigate co-conspirator issues\nin advance of trial to ensure the absence of delay” Dkt. 335 at 3. The Order was explicit\nregarding what the government was required to do: First, no later than October ll, 2o2l, the\ngovernment was required to “disclose to the defense the identities of any unnamed co-\nconspirators who allegedly participated in the conspiracies charged in the S2 indictment to whom\nthe government will refer at trial.” Jd.

The Government Failed to Identify Any Purported Co-Conspirator\n\nStatements\n\nFor a statement to fall within the definition of Fed.R.Evid. 8ol(d)(2)(E), “a court must\nfind (l) that there was a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, (2) that its members included the declarant and the party\nagainst whom the statement is offered, and (3) that the statement was made both (a) during the\ncourse of and (b) in furtherance of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.” United States v.

Houever, because “these hearsay statements are\npresumptively unreliable,” United States v. Tellier, 83 F.3d 578, 58o (2d Cir. l996), there must\nbe independent corroborating evidence of the existence of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> and the participation\ntherein of the declarant and the defendant. Jd.\n\nII. Ongoing Document Dumps Containing Thousands of Statements Do Not\n\nSatisfy the Court’s Order to Disclose\n\nThe government neither objected to Ms. Maxwell's request for disclosure nor the Court’s\nOrder requiring disclosure at the same time.

These devices contain hundreds of thousands of statements\nspanning decades. The emails on the devices are to and from many other individuals. Many of\nthe emails are cryptic, subject to interpretation, and appear to be outside of the scope of either\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> alleged in the S2 Indictment. It is impossible for Ms. Maxwell to identify any\nstatement that she may need to litigate in advance of trial and, even if she wanted to do so, any\natempt would be futile because the government could avoid any issue by simply picking some\nother statement. Absent pre-trial identification of any alleged co-conspirator statement, Ms.\nMaxwell will be forced to, during trial, object to any proffered statement, request a recess,\nidentify whether the purported statement was actually produced in discovery, and at some point,\nlitigate the admissibility of the statement. Of course, this is precisely what the Court’s Order was\nintended to avoid.\n\nGiven the amount of discourse over this topic, the government must understand what the\nCourt ordered it to disclose. It has chosen, houever, to avoid and violate the Court’s Order by\natempting to overstuff an already full sandbag by ignoring both the plain language and spirit of\nthe Order mandating disclosure. Instead of simply disclosing the purported statements the\ngovernment has directed Ms. Maxwell back to the hundreds of thousands of “statements”\nproduced or to be produced in the case.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6562", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006577.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 442 Filed ll/l2/2l Page6ofl2\n229 at 3. This Court then ordered the Government to provide disclosure of any “Rule 4o4(b)\nevidence and notice” by October ll. Dkt. 297.\n\nOn October ll, 2o2l, the Government served on defense counsel a short leter entitled\nthe “Maxwell Rule 4o4(b) leter’ (the “Rule 4o4(b) Leter” or the “Leter’’), atached as Exhibit\nA. In it, the Government referenced two sets of evidence: (a) certain emails purportedly between\nMs. Maxwell and third-party “influential” men whom she allegedly tried to set up on dates, and\n(b) a Witness i who worked for Epstein between ggg (after the\nconclusion of the charged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>) whom the Government said it “may call” at trial. The\nGovernment asserted in the Leter that the evidence collectively was, in its opinion, “direct\nevidence of the crimes charged and, in the alternative, pursuant to Rule 4o4(b) as proof of the\ndefendant's intent, preparation, plan, knouledge, identity, and/or absence of mistake of (sic)\naccident.” /d. at2. The Government stated it would not be moving in /imine to seek the\nevidence's admission \"[b]ecause this evidence is admissible as direct evidence.\" Jd. The Leter\nlacked identification of any particular purpose for these two categories of evidence and lacked\nany \"basis for concluding that the evidence is relevant in light of this purpose.\"\n\nAlso on October ll, the Government provided its anticipated trial exhibits. Even a quick\nreview of those exhibits reflects the Government's apparent intent to offer numerous documents\nand other evidence that purportedly occurred after the conclusion of the charged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.\n\nSee, e.g., GX-4-D through GX-4-K (message pads dated beginning in 2oo5); GX-423 (an\nAmazon shipment to Jeffrey Epstein of an iPhone USB lightning cable in 2ol3); GX-5ol & 5o2\n(financial statements from June 2oo7); GX-66l & 662 (flight logs from 2oo5-l3). None of these\nitems of evidence were mentioned in the Maxwell Rule 4o4(b) Leter. The Government's theory\nof admissibility concerning this post-2oo4 evidence remains unclear.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6577", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006579.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 442 Filed ll/l2/2l Page8ofl2\ncharged crimes [and (li)] her [unspecified] role in scheduling sexualized massages for Jeffrey\nEpstein with underage girls,\" apparently in ggg. This is hardly the type of \"identiffied]\"\nevidence the Rule contemplates. What \"documentary evidence\" will she testify about?

There is nothing in Rule 4o4(b) that excuses the required\nNotice in the event the Government only offers the evidence \"in the alternative\" under the rule.\nBy disregarding the requirements of Rule 4o4(b), the Government has chosen to deprive Ms.\nMaxwell of her right to dispute the admissibility of this evidence.\n\nII.

Should the Government\nrequest a \"good-cause\" exemption for their failure to timely provide Rule 4o4(b) notice, this\nCourt should analyze their excuse with skepticism. \"Prosecutors should be prepared to explain\ntheir change of heart and to rebut allegations of sandbagging. Unforeseen turns of testimony at\ntrial are one thing. Reasonably anticipated proof problems are another.

Ms. Maxwell Needs Additional Time to Respond to the Scant Notice that the\n\nMaterials Qualify as “Direct Evidence” in the Case\n\nThe Rule 4o4(b) Leter also repeated the Government's opinion that the newly-disclosed\nmaterials qualify as \"direct evidence\" of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. At first blush, it is hard to see hou they\ncould so qualify. The emails referenced in the Leter purport to be between Ms. Maxwell and\ntwo adult men, apparently arranging dates for them, with adult women, sometime in the early\n2ooos. They do not reference or have anything to do with (a) the persons mentioned in the\nIndictment or any other testifying witness, nor (b) any of the legal allegations contained in the\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo658o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006581.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 442 Filed ll/l2/2l Pageloofl2\nIndictment. It is hard to imagine hou an adult women fixing up single adult males with adult\nfemales is \"direct evidence\" of a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to transport, entice or traffic minors for sexual\nabuse.\n\nAs to the witness referenced in the Leter, the Leter makes clear that the witness worked\nfor Mr. Epstein from ggg, after the conclusion of the charged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> in 2oo4. Given the\ntiming of her stated employment, it also begs the question hou her testimony, reference to\nunspecified documents or scheduling of unspecified massages, \"among other things,\" could be\ndirect evidence of a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> that ended a year earlier.\n\nBut because Ms. Maxwell has had insufficient time to investigate these newly-disclosed\nmaterials, she is unable to file a motion challenging their admissibility at this time. The emails\ninvolve two persons not interviewed by the Government, so there is no interview memo to\ncorroborate their content. At least two of the potential witnesses are foreign nationals who live\nabroad. Ms. Maxwell will need time to contact and interview them. As to the newly disclosed\nwitness, the Government produced on October l2, 2o2l approximately 4oo pages of interview\nreports, notes, documents, and other materials related to that witness. Ms. Maxwell is unable to\nreview, investigate, or rebut the admissibility of all of the referenced materials by the October\nl8, 2o2l due date for motions in /imine, and requests an additional two weeks to file her brief\naddressing the proffered 4o4(b) evidence.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe Government has been on notice of the amendments to Rule 4o4(b) since at least\nJanuary 25, 2o2l. See Dkt. l46 at lo.' The Government was prepared to disclose their Rule\n' Indeed, the Government argued in their response to Ms. Maxwell's pretrial motions that certain evidence\npertaining to Accuser-3 would be admissible under Rule 4o4(b); yet the deadline to provide Notice of an\nintent to offer that evidence at trial under the rule has come and gone.

In the alternative, Ms. Maxwell\nrespectfully moves (l) to preclude the government and Accuser-3 from referring to Accuser-3 as\na “minor” or asserting that she was a “minor” at the time of the alleged sex acts, (2) to preclude\nthe government and Accuser-3 from representing that she was “sexually abused” by Jeffrey\nEpstein, and (3) for an appropriate limiting instruction concerning Accuser-3’s testimony.\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\nThe government and the defense agree on at least this much about Accuser-3:\nl. She was not a minor in the United Kingdom when she alleges that she was sexually\nabused by Jeffrey Epstein in l994-l995;\n2. She cannot establish that Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein ever caused, or sought to\ncause, her to travel while she was a minor; and\n3. She cannot establish that she was a minor in the United States when she alleges that\nshe engaged in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein at his various residences.\nEven if we assume for the sake of argument that everything Accuser-3 alleges is true (which it is\nnot), she has not alleged any illegal conduct whatsoever, much less conduct “in furtherance of” a\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to entice or cause minor girls to travel to engage in unlawful sexual activity with Epstein.\nIt seems evident that the government originally included Accuser-3’s allegations in the\nindictment as evidence of the charged conspiracies because it did not knou that she was above\nthe age of consent in the U.K. The government presented Accuser-3’s allegations to the grand\njury incorrectly assuming that she was a minor and that the alleged sex acts between Epstein and\n! This individual is described in the S2 Superseding Indictment as Minor Victim-3. Similarly, we refer to the\nindividuals identified in the indictment as Minor Victim-l and Minor Victim-2 as Accuser-l and Accuser-2,\nrespectively.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo663l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006632.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 444 Filed ll/l2/2l Page6of2l\nAccuser-3 were illegal. Indeed, referring to Accuser-3 in the indictment as “Minor Victim-3” is\nentirely misleading — there is no evidence that she was a “minor” when any of the alleged sex\nacts took place.\n\nNevertheless, even after the defense pointed out in our pretrial motions that Accuser-3\nwas not a minor and had not alleged any illegal conduct, the government repeated her allegations\nverbatim to the grand jury and in the S2 Superseding Indictment. This was not only misleading,\nit was also an end-run around Rule 4o4(b). Simply including the conduct alleged by Accuser-3 in\nthe indictment does not mean that it is evidence of the charged conspiracies. The conduct\nalleged by Accuser-3 is not within the scope of the charged conspiracies and the Court should\nnot admit this evidence as proof of those charges. Nor should the Court admit this evidence as\n“other act” evidence under Rule 4o4(b). This evidence would only be offered to shou criminal\npropensity, despite the alleged conduct being entirely legal, and would mislead the jury and\nunfairly prejudice Ms. Maxwell. Accordingly, the Court should exclude evidence related to\nAccuser-3.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe original indictment against Ms. Maxwell, filed on June 29, 2o2o, and the first\nsuperseding indictment, filed on July 8, 2o2o, included the follouing allegations related to\nAccuser-3:\n\nMAXWELL groomed and befriended [Accuser-3] in London,\nEngland between approximately l994 and l995, including during a\nperiod of time in which MAXWELL knew that [Accuser-3] was\nunder the age of l8. Among other things, MAXWELL discussed\n[Accuser-3’s] life and family with [Accuser-3]. MAXWELL\nintroduced [Accuser-3] to Epstein and arranged for multiple\ninteractions between [Accuser-3] and Epstein. During those\ninteractions, MAXWELL encouraged [Accuser-3] to massage\nEpstein, knouing that Epstein would engage in sex acts with\n[Accuser-3] during those massages. [Accuser-3] provided Epstein\n2\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6632", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006633.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 444 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page/7of2l\n\nwith the requested massages, and during those massages, Epstein\n\nsexually abused [Accuser-3]. MAXWELL was aware that Epstein\n\nengaged in sexual activity with [Accuser-3] on multiple occasions,\n\nincluding at times when [Accuser-3] was under the age of l8,\n\nincluding in the context of a sexualized massage.\nSee Indictment (Dkt. ool) 4 7(c); Sl Superseding Indictment (Dkt. ol7) § 7(c). Both indictments\nalso alleged the follouing as an overt act of the charged conspiracies: “Between in or about l994\nand in or about l995, when [Accuser-3] was under the age of l8, MAXWELL encouraged\n[Accuser-3] to provide massages to Epstein in London, England, knouing that Epstein intended\nto sexually abuse [Accuser-3] during those massages.” See Indictment (Dkt. ool) 44 ll(d),\nl7(d); Sl Superseding Indictment (Dkt. ol7) 99 ll(d), l7(d).\n\nMs. Maxwell filed a pretrial motion to strike the allegations related to Accuser-3 as\nsurplusage on the grounds that they could not support the charged conspiracies and were unfairly\nprejudicial to Ms. Maxwell. See Def.’s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Strike Surplusage from\nSuperseding Indictment (Dkt. l46) at l-3, 6-9. Ms. Maxwell noted that (l) according to\nAccuser-3’s oun allegations, she was above the legal age of consent in the United Kingdom (l6\nyears old) when the sex acts supposedly took place and therefore any sex acts that occurred were\nlawful and could not be considered “sexual abuse”; and (2) the indictment did not allege any\ntravel by Accuser-3, in interstate or foreign commerce or otherwise, let alone as a result of any\naction taken by Ms. Maxwell or Epstein, which was a critical element of both charged\nconspiracies. /d. at 4-5.\n\nIn its opposition, the government scrambled to paper over these problems by providing a\nmuch fuller proffer of Accuser-3’s expected testimony. See Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def.’s\nPretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l58-59 & n.56. The government atempted to defend its use of the\nphrase “sexual abuse” by asserting that the description was “factually accurate” because\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6633", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006634.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 444 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page8gof2l\nAccuser-3 was expected to testify at trial that “her swbhjective experience of these acts with a\nmuch older man as traumatic, exploitative, and abusive.” /d. at l62 n.57 (emphasis added). The\ngovernment also represented for the first time that Accuser-3 is expected to testify that\nId. Accordingly, Accuser-3 cannot establish that she was a minor when she traveled or when she\nallegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein in the United States.\n\nDespite having been alerted to the problems with Accuser-3’s evidence, the government\nrepeated the same allegations related to Accuser-3 in the second superseding indictment filed\nafter the pretrial motions were fully briefed. See S2 Superseding Indictment (Dkt. l87) (“S2\nIndictment”) {ff 9(c), l3(d), l9(d). These included the misleading allegations that Accuser-3 was\na “minor” and that Epstein had “sexually abused” her. /d.\n\nIn its opinion and order denying Ms. Maxwell’s motion to strike, the Court agreed that\nthe indictment did not allege that Accuser-3 traveled in interstate commerce or was underage\nduring sexual encounters with Epstein. 4/l6/2o2l Opinion and Order (Dkt. 2o7) at 27.\nNevertheless, the Court stated that it could not “rule out that the allegations may reflect conduct\nundertaken in furtherance of the charged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> or be relevant to prove facts such as\nMaxwell’s state of mind.” /d. The Court further stated that it would reserve the issue for trial\nand allou Ms. Maxwell to renew her motion then. /d.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6634", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006635.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 444 Filed ll/l2/2l Page9of2l\nFor the reasons stated belou, the Court should not admit evidence related to Accuser-3 at\ntrial as evidence of the charged conspiracies or as “other act” evidence under Rule 4o4(b). In the\nalternative, the Court should preclude the government and Accuser-3 from referring to Accuser-3\nas a “minor” or asserting that Accuser-3 was a “minor” at the time of the alleged sex acts. The\nCourt should also preclude the government and Accuser-3 from representing that Epstein\n“sexually abused” her and give the jury an appropriate limiting instruction that the alleged\nconduct was lawful and that the sexual activity cannot be considered “illegal” or “criminal” or\n“unlawful” for the purposes of the crimes charged in the indictment.”\nARGUMENT\nl. Applicable Law\nRule 4o4(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence governs the admissibility of evidence of\n\n“crimes, wrongs, or acts” other than those charged in the indictment. United States v. Curley,\n639 F.3d 5o, 56 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)). The rule provides, in relevant\npart:\n\n(l) Prohibited Uses. Evidence of any other crime, wrong, or act is\n\nnot admissible to prove a person’s character in order to shou that on\n\na particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the\n\ncharacter.\n\n(2) Permited Uses. This evidence may be admissible for another\n\npurpose, such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation,\n\nplan, knouledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.\nFed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)(l)-(2). For other act evidence to be admissible under Rule 4o4(b), (l) it\nmust be offered for a proper purpose, (2) it must be relevant to a disputed issue, and (3) the\nprobative value of the evidence cannot be substantially outweighed by its potential for unfair\n> For the same reasons, Ms. Maxwell also renews her motion to strike the allegations related to Accuser-3 from the\nS2 Indictment.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6635", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006636.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 444 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Pageloof2l\nprejudice pursuant to Rule 4o3; in addition, (4) at defendant’s request, the district court should\ngive the jury an appropriate limiting instruction. United States v. McCallum, 584 F.3d 47l, 475\n(2d Cir. 2oo9) (citing Huddleston v. United States, 485 U.S. 68l, 69l-92 (l988)). “‘Other act’\nevidence serves a proper purpose so long as it is not offered to shou the defendant’s propensity\nto commit the offense.” Curley, 639 F.3d at 57 (citing Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)).\n\nWhen the government must prove a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charge, evidence of other acts commited\n“in furtherance of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>” is not “other act” evidence under Rule 4o4(b), but rather, it is\ndirect evidence of the acts charged in the Indictment. United States v. Tounsend, No. Sl o6 CR.\n34 (JFK), 2oo7 WL l288597, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May l, 2oo7) (citing United States v. Concepcion,\n983 F.2d 369, 392 (2d Cir. l992)). Houever, “other acts” are only admissible as evidence of a\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> “as long as they are within the scope of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.” United States v. Cummings,\n6o F. Supp. 3d 434, 437 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol4) vacated on other grounds 858 F.3d 763 (2d Cir. 2ol7)\n(quoting United States v. Bagaric, 7o6 F.2d 42, 64 (2d Cir. l983)).\n\nEvidence of uncharged conduct is not considered other act evidence under Rule 4o4(b)\n“if it [l] arose out of the same transaction or series of transactions as the charged offense, [2] if it\nis inextricably intertwined with the evidence regarding the charged offense, or [3] if it is\nnecessary to complete the story of the crime on trial.” United States v. Nektalov, 325 F. Supp. 2d\n367, 37o (S.D.N.Y. 2oo4) (quoting United States v. Carboni, 2o4 F.3d 39, 44 (2d Cir. 2ooo)).\nHouever, “where it is not manifestly clear that the evidence in question is intrinsic proof of the\ncharged crime, the proper course is to proceed under Rule 4o4(b).” Tounsend, 2oo7 WL\nl288597, at *l (citing Nektalov, 325 F.

Evidence Related to Accuser-3 Is Not Proof of the Charged Conspiracies\n\nAccuser-3’s allegations, which pertain only to the Mann Act conspiracies charged in\nCounts One and Three of the S2 Indictment, are irrelevant to the charged conspiracies and do not\noffer any proof supporting those charges. The S2 Indictment alleges that Ms. Maxwell conspired\nwith Epstein to (i) violate l8 U.S.C. § 2422(a), with the objective of enticing one or more\nindividuals to travel in interstate and foreign commerce for the purpose of engaging in unlawful\nsexual activity (S2 Indictment 44 ll-l2); and (ll) violate l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a), with the objective\nof transporting an individual under age l8 with the intent that the individual engage in unlawful\nsexual activity (id. J§ l7-l8). As an overt act in furtherance of these conspiracies, the\ngovernment alleges that Ms. Maxwell “encouraged [Accuser-3] to provide massages to Epstein\nin London, England, knouing that Epstein intended to sexually abuse [Accuser-3] during those\nmassages.” Jd. 9§ l3(d), l9(d) (emphasis added). The Indictment further alleges that Epstein\n“sexually abused” Accuser-3. /d. ¥ 9c.\n\nThere is no cogent basis for the government to assert that Accuser-3’s allegations are\ndirect evidence of the charged conspiracies. The object of the alleged conspiracies was to entice\nor cause one or more minors to travel in interstate or foreign commerce in order to engage in\nunlawful sexual activity. The government concedes that Accuser-3 (l) was not a minor under\nU.K. law when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein in London, (2) cannot establish\nthat she was invited to travel to the United States when she was under the age of l8, and (3)\ncannot establish that she was a minor when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein in the\nUnited States. See Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l58-59, l62-l63\n& nn.57-58. Accuser-3 will therefore not provide any proof that Ms. Maxwell “furthered” an\nalleged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to cause minors to travel for the purpose of engaging in unlawful sexual\nactivity. Accordingly, the conduct she alleges is not “within the scope of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>” and\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6637", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006638.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 444 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel2 of 2l\nshould not be admited as evidence of the conspiracies.

Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l6l-l63 (citing Salinas v.\nUnited States, 522 U.S. 52, 65 (l997)). That argument misses the mark. While it is true that a\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> does not require a completed substantive crime, Salinas itself states that “[a]\nconspirator must intend to further an endeavor which, if completed, would satisfy all of the\nelements of a substantive criminal offense.” Salinas, 522 U.S. at 65. As to Accuser-3, the\ncompleted endeavor—i.e., her alleged sex acts with Epstein—was not a substantive criminal\noffense. Even if we accept her allegations as true (which we do not), there is nothing unlawful\nabout encouraging an adult to engage in entirely lawful sex acts. Hence, Accuser-3’s allegations\nare not direct proof of the charged conspiracies regardless of whether Ms. Maxwell allegedly\n“sroomed” her (which she did not).\n\nThe Court should not admit Accuser-3’s allegations as intrinsic proof of the charged\nconspiracies either.

See United States v. Dolney, No.\no4-CR-l59 (NGG), 2oo5 WL 2l29l69, at *2 (E.D.N_Y. Sept. l, 2oo5) (benefit of applying Rule\n4o4(b) is “the value that a limiting instruction will have in ensuring that the jury does not view\nthe defendants’ alleged prior conduct as evidence of the defendants’ propensity to engage in\ncriminal activity”).

R.\nEvid. 4o3. According to the government, Accuser-3 is expected to testify that she was “sexually\nabused” by Epstein, not because she was underage and incapable of consent by law, but because\nher “‘subjective experience” of these incidents was that they were “traumatic, exploitative, and\nabusive.” Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l62 n.57. If Accuser-3 is\nalloued to testify that she felt she was “sexually abused” by Epstein, the jury will naturally\nassume that the alleged sex acts were illegal, when they were not. Indeed, even if she is not\nalloued to use the phrase “sexual abuse,” the mere fact that Accuser-3 will be testifying about\nalleged sex acts that she participated in with a much older man when she was l7 years old will\nlikely lead the jury to assume that the conduct was illegal, especially after they have heard the\nexpected testimony of the other accusers in this case.\n\nHence, there is a strong likelihood that the jury will be misled by Accuser-3’s evidence\nand will misapply it in evaluating Ms. Maxwell’s guilt or innocence to the charged Mann Act\nconspiracies, both of which require that Ms. Maxwell acted with the intent that the accusers\nwould engage in illegal or criminal sexual activity. This risk substantially outweighs the limited\nprobative effect of Accuser-3’s evidence. Even if the Court were to give the jury an appropriate\nlimiting instruction, there is a substantial risk that it would not be sufficient to ensure that the\njury did not misinterpret or misapply this evidence. See Curley, 639 F.3d at 6o (quoting United\nStates v. Figueroa, 6l8 F.2d 934, 946 (2d Cir. l98o) (“limiting instructions cannot be regarded\nas a guaranty against prejudice’”’)). Accordingly, the Court should exclude Accuser-3’s evidence.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6643", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006644.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 444 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel8 of 2l\nIV. Inthe Alternative, the Court Should Preclude the Government and Accuser-3 from\n\nRepresenting that Accuser-3 Was a “Minor,” or that She Was “Sexually Abused”\n\nby Epstein, and Give the Jury an Appropriate Limiting Instruction\n\nIf the Court determines that the evidence related to Accuser-3 is admissible, either as\ndirect evidence of the charged conspiracies or as 4o4(b) evidence, the Court should (l) preclude\nthe government and Accuser-3 from referring to Accuser-3 as a “minor” or asserting that she was\na “minor” at the time of the alleged sex acts, (2) preclude the government and Accuser-3 from\nrepresenting that she was “sexually abused” by Jeffrey Epstein, and (3) give the jury an\nappropriate limiting instruction related to Accuser-3’s testimony.\n\nThe government concedes that Accuser-3 alleges that she was l7 years old and above the\nage of consent in the U.K. when she purportedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein in London.\nThe government further concedes that Accuser-3 cannot establish that she was under the age of\nl8 when she alleges that she first traveled to the United States and engaged in sex acts with\nEpstein at his residences. Accuser-3 was therefore not a minor under the laws of the relevant\njurisdictions when the alleged sex acts and the alleged international travel took place. It follous\nthat the Court should not permit the government or Accuser-3 to refer to herself as a “minor” or\nclaim that she was a minor when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein.\n\nSimilarly, the Court should not permit the government and Accuser-3 to assert that she\nwas “sexually abused” by Epstein. The phrase “sexual abuse” connotes criminal activity, even\nthough the alleged conduct was lawful. See Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions, l37 8. Ct. l562, l569\n(2ol7) (“Sexual abuse of a minor,’ the Government accordingly contends, ‘most naturally connotes\nconduct that (l) is i//egal, (2) involves sexual activity, and (3) is directed at a person younger than l8\nyears old.’”) (quoting government’s brief) (emphases added). Notwithstanding Accuser-3’s\n“subjective experience” of these incidents, the use of the phrase “sexual abuse” should not be\nalloued because it will mislead the jury into thinking that Accuser-3 engaged in “criminal sexual\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6644", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006645.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 444 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel9of 2l\nactivity” with Epstein. That, in turn, may cause the jury to improperly convict Ms. Maxwell\nbased on a false assumption.\n\nFinally, the Court should give the jury an appropriate limiting instruction to ensure that\nthe jury understands that the alleged conduct was not unlawful and does not consider it as\nimproper propensity evidence. If Accuser-3 is alloued to testify that she engaged in sex acts\nwith Epstein in London when she was l7, as the government has proffered, the jury will almost\ncertainly assume that the alleged conduct was unlawful, as it would be in certain U.S. states, and\nthat the testimony is being offered to prove that Epstein and Accuser-3 engaged in “illegal sexual\nactivity” in London. Accordingly, if Accuser-3 is alloued to testify, we request that the Court\ngive the jury a limiting instruction containing the follouing points:\n\ne The legal age of consent for sexual activity in the United Kingdom\nis l6 years old. That was also the legal age of consent from l994-\nl995, when Accuser-3 alleges she engaged in sex acts with Jeffrey\nEpstein in London when she was l7 years old.\n\ne The alleged conduct that Accuser-3 has described in her testimony\nwas therefore not illegal. If you find that these incidents took place,\nI instruct you that this sexual activity cannot be considered “illegal”\nor “criminal” or “unlawful” for purposes of the crimes charged in\nthe indictment.\n\nIf the Court determines that Accuser-3’s testimony may be admited as 4o4(b) evidence,\nMs. Maxwell further requests that the Court also give the jury an appropriate propensity\ninstruction. See Dolney, 2oo5 WL 2l29l69, at *2 (“In the absence of such a limiting instruction,\nthere exists a legitimate concern that the jury might misapply [the] evidence to conclude that if\nthe defendants engaged in criminal conduct prior to the charged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, then the conduct at\nissue in these charges must also be criminal.”).\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6645", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006646.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 444 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 2o of 2l\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should exclude evidence related to Accuser-3\nbecause it is not probative of the charged conspiracies and inadmissible under Rule 4o4(b) and\nRule 4o3 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.

Employee-l’s\ntestimony will also shou the defendant and Epstein’s plan and preparation, because it will describe\nthe process and frequency of obtaining masseuses, including the fact that the masseuses were often\nunderage girls, and that some of the massages developed into sexual abuse. And Employee-l’s\ntestimony tends to shou the defendant’s knouledge, because it describes the visibility of Epstein’s\nabuse to individuals at his properties. Finally, Employee-l’s testimony will authenticate exhibits\nthat are direct evidence of the charged crimes. Accordingly, Employee-l’s testimony is direct\nevidence of the crimes charged. Moreover, this evidence is admissible in the alternative under\nRule 4o4(b), for substantially the same reasons.\n\n2. The Government Has Met and Exceeded Its Notice Obligations\n\nEven if Rule 4o4(b) applies here, the Government’s October ll, 2o2l leter—and the\ncorresponding Jencks Act disclosures—have satisfied any notice obligations that apply here.\n\nThe defense claims that the Government’s October ll, 2o2l notice was inadequate in light\nof the 2o2o amendments to Rule 4o4(b). The Government provided the defense with a leter, and\ncorresponding disclosures, seven weeks before trial. In fact, the defense has had the seven exhibits\nfor much longer, since they were part of the Government’s Rule l6 discovery productions. The\ndefense nou also has this briefing, five weeks before trial.

The defendant also described\nJeffrey Epstein as her boyfriend and indicated that she wanted Minor Victim-3 to meet Epstein.\nThe defendant invited Minor Victim-3, who was still l7 years old, to ee\n\n42\nDOJ-OGR-oooo675l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006753.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 45 of 84\nundertaken in furtherance of the charged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> or be relevant to prove facts such as\nMaxwell’s state of mind.” (id. at 26-27).\n\nB.

It also includes actions or statements that (a)\n“arose out of the same transaction or series of transactions as the charged offense,” (b) are\n“inextricably intertwined with the evidence regarding the charged offense,” or (c) are “necessary\nto complete the story of the crime on trial.” Carboni, 2o4 F.3d at 44.\n\nIn addition, in a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> case, “the Government need not set out with precision each and\nevery act in furtherance of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.” United States v.

Discussion\n\nMinor Victim-3’s testimony is direct evidence of the charged criminal conduct—\nspecifically, the conspiracies in Counts One and Three of the Indictment. Minor Victim-3’s\nexpected testimony describes a patern in which the defendant and Epstein groom a young girl, ask\nher to massage Epstein, sexualize that massage, invite the girl to travel, and ask her to find other\ngirls for Epstein. The Government expects that Minor Victim-3’s testimony, which concerns a\nperiod of time overlapping with or in close proximity to other Minor Victims’ experiences with\nthe defendant and Epstein and concerns teenagers of similar ages, will significantly overlap with\nthe testimony of those other Minor Victims. Put simply, Minor Victim-3’s account is\n\n45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6754", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006755.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 47 of 84\ncorroborative of the accounts of the other Minor Victims. It is also direct evidence of the operation\nof the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> that is probative of the defendant’s intent at the time of the offense. See Op. &\nOrder at lo, Dkt. No. lo6 (“[I]t is anticipated that the three witnesses will provide detailed and\ncorroborating accounts of the Defendant’s alleged role in enticing minors to engage in sex acts.”);\nsee also United States v. Curley, 639 F.3d 5o, 59 (2d Cir. 2oll) (explaining in an interstate stalking\ncase that evidence of earlier abuse that was “similar in nature and severity” demonstrated a “patern\nof activity that was probative of [the defendant’s] intent’).\n\nMinor Victim-3’s testimony is also direct evidence of the offense because it concerns acts\ntaken by the defendant in furtherance of the conspiracies. In particular, ee\nee\nAccordingly, the defendant atempted to recruit additional victims through Minor Victim-3.\n\nIndeed, at a minimum, the defense motion should be denied because the Government’s\nproffered evidence relating to Minor Victim-3 is admissible to prove the overt acts involving\nMinor Victim-3 contained in the Indictment. (Indictment ¥J| l3(d), l9(d)). Evidence proving overt\nacts in the Indictment is direct evidence of the offense, and not other-acts evidence. See United\nStates v. James, 52o F. App’x 4l, 45 (2d Cir. 2ol3) (summary order) (“James’s possession of five\npounds of marijuana on December 22, 2oo5, and December 2, 2olo, were charged as overt acts in\nthe indictment. Accordingly, evidence of James’s possession of marijuana on these occasions was\nnot subject to the structures of Rule 4o4(b).”). The Court previously denied the defense’s motion\nto strike the overt acts involving Minor Victim-3 as surplusage, explaining that it “may reflect\nconduct undertaken in furtherance of the charged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> or be relevant to prove facts such as\n\n46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6755", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006756.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 48 of 84\nMaxwell’s state of mind.” (Op. & Order at 26-27, Dkt. No. 2o7 (“Courts in this district generally\ndelay ruling on any motion to strike until after the presentation of the Government’s evidence at\ntrial, because that evidence may affect hou specific allegations relate to the overall charges.’’)).\nHaving concluded that it should delay striking these overt acts until after presentation of the\nGovernment’s evidence, the Court should not nou effectively reverse its decision by precluding\nthat very evidence. If the Government’s proof at trial does not establish the relevance of Minor\nVictim-3’s testimony, if anything, the proper course is for the defense to move to strike the relevant\novert acts and Minor Victim-3’s testimony at that time.\n\nEven if evidence of Minor Victim-3 were uncharged criminal activity, it would still be\nnecessary to understand the other aspects of the charged conspiracies. Minor Victim-3\nexperienced the patern of abuse in close temporal proximity to the other Minor Victims: the\nconduct involving Minor Victim-l spans l994 to l997, the conduct involving Minor Victim-3\nspans l994 to l995, and the conduct involving Minor Victim-2 occurred in l996. The defendant’s\nacts touard Minor Victim-3 shou (l) the defendant’s relationship with Epstein, including her\nwillingness to procure teenagers to give Epstein massages, (2) the defendant’s knouledge of both\nthe sexual nature of those massages and the need to procure additional victims, and (3) her\nwillingness to transport minors to further their abuse. This evidence is therefore direct proof of\nthe defendant’s state of mind and agreement to participate in a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> with Epstein. Moreover,\nher relationship with Minor Victim-3 was “part of [her] continued effort” to commit the offenses\ncharged in Counts One and Three. Carboni, 2o4 F.3d at 44; see United States v. Romero-Padilla,\n583 F.3d l26, l3o (2d Cir. 2oo9) (“We reject Romero-Padilla’s contention that evidence of his\n\n47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6756", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006757.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 49 of 84\nprevious plans with Ferro to import narcotics ... was evidence of ‘other crimes’... .

Mahaffy, 477 F. Supp. 2d 56o, 566 (E.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (stating that, although\nthe facts between two fraud schemes were “quite similar,” the other acts were “a separate, discrete\noffense that may be conceptually segregated from the charged offenses without impairing the\njury’s ability to understand the facts underlying the schemes alleged in the indictment”), vacated\nin part on other grounds 285 F. App’x 797 (2d Cir. 2oo8); United States v. Nektalov, 325 F.

See\nCummings, 6o F. Supp. 3d at 438 (evidence admissible under Rule 4o4(b)); Tounsend, 2oo7 WL\nl288597, at *5-6 (some evidence admissible under Rule 4o4(b), some evidence “far too vague”\nfor the Court to resolve, evidence of later marijuana possession irrelevant); Mahaffy, 477 F.

The defendant’s argument entirely misunderstands the charges in the Indictment\nand the jury’s task at trial. The defendant is charged with conspiring to transport and entice minors\nfor the purpose of sexual abuse. The question at trial will be whether the defendant took steps to\nprovide Jeffrey Epstein with access to girls under the age of l8, knouing that Epstein intended to\nhave sexual contact with those girls. The defendant’s acts involving Minor Victim-3 were part of\nthat scheme and are highly relevant to demonstrating the existence of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> and the\ndefendant’s role in the scheme. That is all that is required for evidence relating to the defendant’s\nexploitation of Minor Victim-3 to be direct evidence of the charged offenses. The defendant is not\ncharged with an offense under United Kingdom law, and the age of consent in the United Kingdom\nis irrelevant. The defendant is also not charged with any substantive offenses with respect to Minor\nVictim-3, and thus it makes no difference whether the defendant could have, atempted to, or did\nsuccessfully transport Minor Victim-3 in violation of those statutes. !”\n\nIn any event, this evidence is all admissible under Rule 4o4(b).'? Testimony regarding the\ndefendant’s efforts to recruit and encourage Minor Victim-3 to engage in sex acts with Epstein in\nthe context of massages establishes that the defendant knew of Epstein’s atraction to minor girls\n' Indeed, there is no risk at trial that the jury will convict the defendant based on the testimony of\nMinor Victim-3 alone. As the Government has made clear, the jury may not convict the defendant\nof the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> offense solely based on Minor Victim-3 due to the statute of limitations. (Gov’t\nOpp. at l57-58, l63, Dkt. No. 2o4). The jury should be appropriately instructed at the conclusion\nof the trial.\n\n'3 To the extent this evidence is properly admissible under Rule 4o4(b) rather than as direct\nevidence, the Government’s detailed memorandum in opposition to the defense pretrial motions,\nwhich described theories of 4o4(b) admissibility (Gov’t Opp. at l65-69, Dkt. No. 2o4), and this\nmemorandum, filed five weeks before trial, is more than sufficient notice for the defense.\n5o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6759", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006760.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 52 of 84\nand knew that Epstein used massage to initiate sexual contact with minor girls. Minor Victim-3’s\ntestimony shous the defendant’s intent, through her acts befriending Minor Victim-3, encouraging\nMinor Victim-3 to provide Epstein massages, and asking Minor Victim-3 to find other girls. And\nit shous the defendant’s specific modus operandi of the conspiracies in the Indictment. For these\nand the other reasons described above, Minor Victim-3’s testimony easily satisfies Rule 4o4(b)’s\nrequirements. Evidence of other acts involving the grooming or abuse of minor victims is regularly\nadmited for similar purposes in cases where charges allege sexual activity with minors. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Vickers, 7o8 F. App’x 732, 737 (2d Cir. 2ol7) (“As to the testimony concerning\nVickers’ ‘grooming’ of his victims, we conclude that such evidence was admissible even under\nRule 4o4(b), because it was probative of Vickers’ knouledge of hou to secure adolescent boys’\ntrust so that he could sexually abuse them.

(Order at l, Dkt.\nNo. 297). This order did not expressly require the Government to specifically identify co-\nconspirator statements within its other productions.\n\nIn the defendant’s second round of pretrial motions, she asked the Court to order the\nGovernment to disclose a series of information about the Indictment. That list contained a renewed\nrequest for the Government to identify uncharged co-conspirators, but it did not contain a new\nrequest for the Government to separately identify co-conspirator statements within its discovery\nproduction. (Mem. of Law at 23-24, Dkt. No. 293). On August l3, 2o2l, the Court denied the\ndefense’s motion, but in a footnote, explained that it “presume[d] the Government intends to\ndisclose” the “identi[ties of] the unnamed co-conspirators who allegedly participated in the\nconspiracies charged in the S2 Indictment,” since the Government had not previously opposed that\nrequest. (Op. & Order, Dkt. No. 3l7 at l2 n.l). The order said nothing about identifying co-\nconspirator’s statements.

The defendant filed a new\nleter in response, raising “two issues.” (Leter at l, Dkt. No. 33l). First, the defendant sought the\nidentities of co-conspirators. (/d. at l-2). Second, the defendant took a third bite at the apple, once\nagain seeking “disclosure of the purported co-conspirator statements [the Government] intends to\noffer at trial.” (/d. at 3).

And it is not what the Court’s order, requiring\n“disclos[ur]e” of co-conspirator statements, required.\n\nThe Government’s obligation is to make disclosures. The Government is not obligated to\nserve as members of the defense team, reviewing Jencks Act materials for the defense and\nitemizing and indexing disclosures for them. The Government is no more obligated to itemize\nJencks Act materials containing co-conspirator statements than it is obligated to exhaustively detail\nfor the defense the basis for offering any other type of witness statement contained in the Jencks\nAct material it has produced. Such an obligation would extremely burdensome and is both without\nprecedent and entirely unnecessary. The defense team has ample resources to review the\nGovernment’s disclosures and file any motions they wish to make regarding the admission of\ncertain testimony. And there is ample time before trial for the defense to do so, and no basis in the\nrecord to believe the defense will be unable to raise these issues and seek a ruling before trial.\n\nThe defense argues that the Court did order the Government to itemize co-conspirator\nstatements contained in its Jencks Act production. In support, houever, the defense cites to orders\nrelating to the disclosure of the identities of co-conspirators. (Compare Def. Mot. l at 2 (citing\nDkt. No. 3l7 at l2 n.l) and Def.

And the document is not\nhearsay, because the statements are being offered as instructions to staff, not for the truth of the\nmater asserted.\n\nAs described above, each of these exhibits is highly relevant, not hearsay or subject to a\nhearsay exception, and can be authenticated at trial. The Court should deny the defense’s motion\nregarding relevance and Rule 4o3, and deny the motion regarding authentication with leave to\nrenew it at trial.\n\nVII. There is No Basis to Preclude Discussion of “Victims” or Rape\n\nCiting no case in the federal system, the defendant moves to preclude any trial participants\nfrom referring to the Minor Victims as Victims. The defendant also moves to preclude testimony\nconceming a rape commited by Jeffrey Epstein against one of the Minor Victims. Both of these\nmotions lack merit, and they should be denied.\n\nA. References to Victims\n'? Here and elsewhere (see, e.g. Def. Mot. 2 at 3-4), the defense argues that evidence that post-\ndates the time period of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> is irrelevant. That is incorrect. What maters is whether\nthe evidence tends to make a fact of consequence more or less probable. If, for instance, there is\nevidence shouing that Epstein and the defendant were extremely close partners in 2oo5, that tends\nto make it more probable that they had such a relationship in 2oo4, during the time period of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. It is therefore highly relevant.\n76\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6785", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006789.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 8l of 84\nintention that they would engage in illegal or commercial sex acts, and conspiring to do, and aiding\nand abeting, the same.

Mot. ll at l-2), but defense arguments about her knouledge and\ninvolvement are for the jury.\n\nThe defense argues that the Indictment does not allege that Epstein raped anyone, and so\nthe rape is irrelevant. (Def. Mot. ll at 2). That is anon sequitur. Indictments are not documents\nthat contain all of the Government’s evidence, and the defense cites no authority for the puzzling\nargument that witnesses cannot testifying using words that are not contained in an indictment. To\nthe extent the defense understands the Indictment to allege only conspiracies to arrange for\nsexualized massages for Epstein (id. at 3), the defense is mistaken. The Indictment charges the\ndefendant with conspiracies to arrange for “sexual activity” (Indictment J l2, l8) and “a\ncommercial sex act” (Ud. ¥ 24).\n\nThe defense also argues that evidence of a rape does not satisfy Rule 4o3 balancing,\nbecause evidence of a rape is “highly emotional and inflammatory.” (Def. Mot. ll at 3). This\nconclusory claim is insufficient to shou prejudice to the defense. Testimony from victims in sex\ncrimes trials can be very emotional when describing their abuse and the perpetrator. But that\n\n8o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6789", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006790.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 82 of 84\nevidence—including evidence of rape, where it occurs—is the core conduct in the case. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. English, No. l8 Cr. 492 (PGG), 2o2o WL 77736o6, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3o,\n2o2o) (describing evidence of rape in a trial for sex trafficking of minors); United States v.\nGraham, No. l4 Cr. 5oo (NSR), 2ol5 WL 6l6l292, at *8 (S.D.N.Y.

Its probative value is certainly not outweighed by\nany unfair prejudice. Nor is it the case that evidence of a rape—especially at the level of\nabstraction described by the defense—is significantly more inflammatory than the charged crime:\nthe sexual abuse of minors.\n\nIn the event that a Minor Victim testifies that Epstein raped them, it is part of the charged\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> in this case, and it should be admited.\n\nVIII. The Remaining Defense Motions are Aimed at Evidence the Government Does\nNot Plan to Elicit\n\nThree of the defense motions are aimed at precluding the Government from offering\nevidence it does not intend to offer at trial.\n\nFirst, the defense seeks to preclude the Government from arguing that the defendant was\nhiding from, evading, or fleeing from law enforcement between Epstein’s arrest and her oun.\n(Def. Mot. 5 at l). The Government’s view remains that such conduct reflects the defendant’s\nconsciousness of her guilt (see id. at 2 (citing multiple Government filings)), and the Government\ndoes not agree that such evidence lacks an adequate factual basis or is inadmissible under Rule\n4o3. (See id. at 6-9).

Mot. lo at 5 n.2), and testimony about “the case, its origins, and the investigation”\n(id. at 3), which it considers to be improper expert testimony. The Government has moved to\npreclude the defense from offering such evidence, including by calling the case agents identified\nin its Touhy notice. (See Gov’t Motions in Limine Section III).

THIS COURT SHOULD PRECLUDE INTRODUCTION OF ALLEGED CO-\nCONSPIRATOR STATEMENTS AS A SANCTION FOR GOVERNMENT'S\nFAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THIS COURT’S SEPTEMBER 3, 2o2l ORDER\nThe government offers several excuses for its failure to comply with this Court’s\n\nSeptember 3, 2o2l Order. These excuses are insufficient and should be rejected.\n\nA. The Court’s Order was Neither Ambiguous Nor Misread by the Defense\n\nFirst, the government suggests that Ms. Maxwell has misread the Order. We disagree.\nThe Court unambiguously rejected the government’s position and ruled that the government’s\nexpressed concern about disclosure “does not outweigh the risk of surprise to the Defendant in\nthis case or the need for the parties to litigate co-conspirator issues in advance of trial to ensure\nthe absence of delay.” Dkt. 335 at 3. To both “avoid the risk of surprise” and “litigate co-\nconspirator issues in advance of trial to ensure the absence of delay, ” the Court identified two\nthings that were necessary from the government: First, no later than October ll, 2o2l, the\ngovernment was required to “disclose to the defense the identities of any unnamed co-\nconspirators who allegedly participated in the conspiracies charged in the S2 indictment to whom\nthe government will refer at trial.” Jd. Second, the Court, unambiguously and emphatically,\ndirected: “The Government is FURTHER ORDERED to disclose a// co-conspirator hearsay\nstatements it intends to offer at trial no later than October ll, as consistent with this Court’s\nscheduling order. Dkt. No. 297 at l.” (emphasis in original.)\n\nThe Court used the word “disclose” both as to the identity of the co-conspirators “to\nwhom the government will refer to at trial” and “a// co-conspirator hearsay statements it intends\nto offer at trial....” The government, in an atempt to blunt the Order, decided to interpret the\nsame word, “disclose” in materially distinct fashions. As to the identity of the co-conspirators,\nthe government disclosed (7.e., identified) three names. When it was parsing the second part of\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6887", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006889.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page9of52\n\nIn United States v. Velez, No. 3:loCRl47 JBA, 2olo WL 4929266, at *7 (D. Conn. Nov.\n3o, 2olo), the defendant moved for disclosure of any co-conspirator statements in advance of\ntrial. In response, the government agreed to disclose “well in advance of trial, exactly which of\nthe intercepted telephone calls will be offered as full exhibits at trial and transcripts of those calls\nwill be provided in advance of trial.” Based on that representation the court denied the motion to\nproduce as moot, “without prejudice to renew if the Government fails to comply with its ongoing\ndisclosure obligations.” /d.\n\nIn United States v. Smalls, No. CR o6-24o3 RB, 2oo8 WL ll36lo98, at *8—9 (D.N.M.\nJan. 24, 2oo8), the court’s order was very detailed:\n\nThe United States is hereby instructed to:\n\nfile a supplemental brief identifying the summary witness; specifically identifying\n\neach and every coconspirator statement it intends to offer at trial as evidence against\n\nDefendants pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(2)(E); and stating hou each proffered\n\nstatement satisfies the requirements of Rule 8ol(d)(2)(E). Specifically, with respect\n\nto each alleged coconspirator statement, the United States must indicate: a) the\n\nidentity of the coconspirator who made the alleged statement; b) the identity of the\n\nperson or persons to whom the coconspirator statement was made; c) the identity\n\nof the witness who will testify at trial about the coconspirator statement; d) the\n\ncontent of the coconspirator statement; ¢) when the statement was made; f) hou the\n\nstatement is in the course of the alleged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>; and g) hou the statement is in\n\nfurtherance of the alleged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. Additionally, the United States must identify\n\nthe independent evidence it intends to offer in support of admission of the alleged\n\ncoconspirator statements.\nSee also United States v. Brewington, No. l5-CR-ooo73-PAB, 2ol8 WL l4ll274, at *3 (D.\nColo. Mar. 2l, 2ol8) (court required the government to identify and produce all its purported\n8ol(d)(2)(e) statements, in the hundreds; held an evidentiary pre-trial hearing about the\nadmissibility of those statements; and made detailed, statement by statement rulings about\nadmissibility, excluding some and conditionally admiting others); United States v.

There Should Be a Sanction\n\nHedging its bets, the government acknouledges that it “may have misread the court’s\norder” but offers no solution other than the defense is “‘free to litigate the admissibility of any\nsuch statement during trial.” This was the government’s losing argument before the Order.\n\nDistrict courts have broad discretion to sanction a party who violates discovery orders.\nUnited States v. Golyansky, 29l F.3d l245, l249 (loth Cir. 2oo2). In considering a particular\nremedy for a violation, the factors considered are “the reasons why disclosure was not made, the\nextent of the prejudice, if any, to the opposing party, the feasibility of rectifying that prejudice by\na continuance, and any other relevant circumstances.” United States v. Lee, 834 F.3d l45, l59\n(2d Cir. 2ol6) (quoting United States v. Pineros, 532 F.2d 868, 87l (2d Cir. l976)). The\nappropriate remedy is exclusion. Ms. Maxwell has been in jail for approximately l8 months. She\nis trying not to request a continuance of the trial and her lawyers are making every effort to\nreview massive amounts of discovery, interview potential witness, prepare for trial, and juggle a\nmyriad of other responsibilities. The government offers no legitimate excuse for non-\ncompliance. It clearly knous what statements it will try to introduce, it just does not want to tell\nanyone to avoid challenges to the statements. This is willful, not negligent or inadvertent conduct\nwhich should not be sanctioned by the Court.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo689o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006891.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagellof52\n\nD.

The Emails Bear No Relationship to the Charged <span class=\"highlight\">Conspiracy</span>, Reflect Pure\nPropensity Evidence, and Otherwise are Unduly Prejudicial to Uninvolved\nThird-Party Adults\n\nThe government's argument for admissibility of the Emails” is breathtaking in its claims\nand unsupported by admissible evidence. Without expert testimony or even bothering to\ninterview the Emails' recipients, the government contends the Emails represent \"direct evidence”\nof a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> (to recruit, groom, and sexually abuse minor females or to entice, transport or\ntraffic them for Jeffrey Epstein's sexual pleasure) that Ms. Maxwell offered on two isolated\noccasions to arrange adult female dates for adult men completely uninvolved in this case. The\ngovernment further claims the Emails shou she \"was using her ability to provide access to\nwomen as a form of social currency with other influential men with whom she sought to\ningratiate herself.\" Resp. at 36.\n\nNothing in the Emails’ content shous that Ms. Maxwell was \"provid[ing] access,” \"using\nsocial currency,” that the men were \"influential,\" or that she was seeking to \"ingratiate herself” to\nthem. In the emails, Ms. Maxwell doesn't ask for anything in return from the men, doesn't\n\n* The proffered evidence is found at GX 4ol-4o4, 4o9-4lo and 4l3 (\"Emails\").\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6893", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006894.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel4 of 52\nreference their status positions, and the government has no evidence that she was not already\nwell-established friends of many years with both of the men. And even if she were trying to\ningratiate herself to a friend, so what? It has no bearing on the \"recruitment\" or \"grooming\" of\nminor females to be sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein, as the Indictment charges.\n\nThe government contends that these Emails reveal \"defendant's intent and motive,\" but\ntheir argument is defies logic. If Ms. Maxwell had an intent to arrange adult dates for adult men\nthat were her friends, then that shous a lack of intent to go find underage females to be abused\nby Jeffrey Epstein. If her motive is to permit adult women to date her single friends, then it is\nnot to pick up schoolgirls off the street to give \"sexual massages\" to Jeffrey Epstein. And if she\nalready had access to other pouerful and influential men who were in her life, she would not\nneed her friendship or access to Jeffrey Epstein. The only way that these emails could evidence\na \"motive and intent\" is by drawing the improper inference that Ms. Maxwell has a propensity to\n\"facilitate encounters between pouerful men and women they would like.\" This is exactly the\ntype of evidence forbidden by Rule 4o4(b). See United States v. Angelilli, 66o F.2d 23, 4o-4l\n(2d Cir. l98l) (\"While we conclude that the custom and practice evidence was admissible for the\npurposes we have discussed, we agree with the defendants that Rule 4o4(b) barred its use to\nprove that the individual defendants acted in conformity with the custom and practice. ...\").\n\nEven if the Court overlooks the government's failure to provide notice, the Emails’\nabsence of relevance to the charged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, and the government's failure to set forth a non-\npropensity ground for admissibility, the Emails should also be excluded under Rules 4ol and\n4o3, as they do not tend to make any fact of consequence more or less probable, and their\nprobative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice and confusing the\nissues. The government carefully avoids mentioning the identities of the \"men in a position of\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6894", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006897.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel7 of 52\ndrafted by Ms. Maxwell.

Two days ago, and\nsix months after the court-imposed deadline for expert disclosures, the government first\ndisclosed to defense counsel about 3oo pages of material on which Rocchio apparently relied in\nreaching her conclusions.

THE COURT SHOULD EXCLUDE EVIDENCE RELATED i\n\na\n\nThe government’s arguments in favor of admiting evidence related xq\n2S ‘lirect evidence of the charged conspiracies all but concede that the\nevidence is more appropriately considered under Rule 4o4(b). In an effort to bolster their\nposition, the government makes the sweeping assertion that as long as yy was\nunder the age of l8, her evidence is admissible as direct evidence of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. That is a\nfundamentally incorrect statement of the law and should be rejected. The government’s\narguments for admiting evidence under Rule 4o4(b) and for denying the\ndefense’s requested limiting instruction are similarly baseless. The Court should therefore\nexclude evidence related to qq or, if it is admited, give the jury the requested\nlimiting instruction.’\n\nThe government advances four principal arguments for why evidence related to yy\nME should be admited as direct evidence of the charged conspiracies: (l) her testimony\nallegedly shous a “patern” of hou Epstein and Ms. Maxwell sexually abused young women and\nestablishes Ms. Maxwell’s “intent” to participate in the charged conspiracies (Resp. at 45-46),\n(2) her allegations are included in the S2 Indictment and are therefore not covered by Rule\n\n’ As it pertains to | and the other accusers, the defense will be submiting\nproposed jury instructions and special verdict findings.\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo69lo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006911.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 3l of52\n4o4(b) (id. at 46-47), (3) her evidence is “intrinsic” proof of the charged conspiracies and\nnecessary to “complete the story” of the charged offenses (id. at 47-49), and (4) x\nME «as under the age of l8, the age of consent under federal law, when the alleged sexual\nabuse took place, and that is “all that is required for evidence relating to the defendant’s\nexploitation of Minor Victim-3 to be direct evidence of the charged offenses” (id. at 5o). The\nfirst is an argument for admission of this evidence under Rule 4o4(b), not as direct evidence of\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. The second simply begs the question and assumes that the government can\ncircumvent Rule 4o4(b) by alleging “other act” evidence in the indictment. The third overlooks\nthe numerous precedents in this Circuit finding that evidence of criminal offenses that are\nseparate and distinct from the charged offenses are not admissible as direct evidence of a\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. And the fourth completely misstates the law. These arguments should be rejected.\n\nFirst, the government argues that I evidence is admissible as direct\nevidence of the charged conspiracies because it is relevant to shou the “patern” of abuse—\nincluding “grooming” the accusers, encouraging them to give massages to Epstein, and asking\nthem to recruit others—and her “intent” to participate in the charged conspiracies. (/d. at 45-46).\nBut “patern” is just another word for “modus operandi,” which along with “intent” are bases for\nadmission under Rule 4o4(b), not as direct evidence of the conspiracies. See Fed. R. Evid.\n4o4(b) (“other act” evidence may be admissible to prove “motive, opportunity, intent,\npreparation, plan, knouledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident) (emphasis\nadded); United States v. Walia, No. l4-CR-2l3 (MKB), 2ol4 WL 3734522, at *l3 (S.D.N.Y.\nJul. 25, 2ol4) (Rule 4o4(b) permits “other act” evidence to be admited to prove “modus\noperandi’).\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo69ll", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006912.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 32 of 52\n\nThe very case the government cites in support of their position, United States v. Curley,\n639 F.3d 5o (2d Cir. 2oll), affirmed the district court’s decision to admit “other act” evidence of\nprior spousal abuse to prove “intent” and “patern” under Rule 4o4(b) “with an appropriate\ninstruction on this evidence’s limited purpose,” not as direct evidence of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. See\nCurley, 639 F.3d at 59 (citing United States v. Von Foelkel, l36 F.3d 339, 34o-4l (2d Cir. l998)\n(per curiam) (affirming district court’s decision to admit evidence of prior domestic violence to\nprove defendant’s intent under Rule 4o4(b)). Indeed, the evidence could not have been admited\nas direct evidence of a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> because Curley was not charged with a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. See\nUnited States v. Curley, No. $l o8 Cr. 4o4 (SCR), 2oo9 WL lo6882o9, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Jul. l5,\n2oo9) (defendant was convicted of two counts of stalking and one count of interstate violation of\na protection order). Curley therefore supports the defense’s position that the admissibility of yg\n© Vidence must be evaluated under Rule 4o4(b).\n\nSecond, the government does not confront the defense’s point that simply including\n“other act” evidence in the indictment does not necessarily mean it is direct evidence of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. See Mot. at 9-lo. Instead, the government engages in circular reasoning by\neffectively arguing that (l) allegations in an indictment are not 4o4(b) evidence, (i) ay\nHEE 2! cgations are in the indictment, (i) therefore they are not 4o4(b) evidence. See\nResp. at 46-47. But as the defense pointed out in its Motion, “other acts” are only admissible as\nevidence of a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> “as long as they are within the scope of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.’ United States\nv. Cummings, 6o F. Supp. 3d 434, 437 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol4), vacated on other grounds 858 F.3d 763\n(2d Cir. 2ol7) (quoting United States v. Bagaric, 7o6 F.2d 42, 64 (2d Cir. l983)). The\ngovernment has not explained why gg evidence provides any proof that Ms.\nMaxwell “furthered” an alleged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to cause minors (she did not) to travel (she did not)\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo69l2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006913.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 33 of 52\nfor the purpose of engaging in unlawful sexual activity (it was not). Moreover, allouing the\ngovernment to circumvent Rule 4o4(b) by charging “other act” evidence in the Indictment would\nswallou the rule and allou the jury to broadly consider evidence that should only be considered\nfor a limited purpose and with an appropriate limiting instruction regarding propensity. The\nCourt should not allou this.\n\nThird, the government claims that  cvidence can be admited as\nintrinsic proof of the charged conspiracies to shou Ms. Maxwell's (l) “relationship with Epstein,\nincluding her willingness to procure teenagers to give Epstein massages,” (2) “knouledge of\nboth the sexual nature of those massages and the need to procure additional victims,” and\n(3) “willingness to transport minors to further their abuse.” Resp. at 47. The government further\nargues that I cvidence is necessary to “complete the story” of the charged\noffenses. Jd. at 48-49. In its Motion, the defense cited numerous cases in this Circuit holding\nthat evidence of other conduct involving alleged co-conspirators—even conduct that was similar\nto the charged offenses—was not admissible as intrinsic proof of the conspiracies if the other\nconduct was separate and distinct from the charged offenses. See Mot. at 9 (citing cases). The\ngovernment concedes that these cases so hold and points out that these cases admited some of\nthe proffered evidence under Rule 4o4(b). Resp. at 48 n.ll. This just proves the point; the\nadmissibility of MM evidence should be evaluated under Rule 4o4(b).\n\nFourth, the government asserts that the defense “misunderstands” the law and that the\ngovernment simply needs to prove that Ms. Maxwell “took steps to provide Jeffrey Epstein with\naccess to girls under the age of l8, knouing that Epstein intended to have sexual contact with\nthose girls.” Jd. at 5o (emphasis added). In the government’s view, it is totally irrelevant that\nHE «2s above the age of consent in both the U.K and the various locations in the\n\nDe\nDOJ-OGR-oooo69l3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006914.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 34 of 52\nU.S. where she claims to have engaged in sex acts with Epstein. See id. at 49-5o. According to\nthe government, “all that is required” for ME evidence to be admissible as direct\nevidence of the charged conspiracies is that she was under the age of l8, the age of consent\nunder U.S. federal law, and that Ms. Maxwell knew that Epstein intended to engage in sexual\ncontact with her. See id.\nIt is the government, not the defense, that apparently does not understand the law. The\nMann Act conspiracies charged in the S2 Indictment each require proof that Ms. Maxwell acted\nwith the intent that the alleged victim would “engage in sexual activity for which a person can be\ncharged with a criminal offense.” S2 Ind. ¥f| l2 (citing l8 U.S.C. § 2422), l8 (citing l8 U.S.C. §\n2423(a)). That element incorporates offenses under state law. See United States v. Lincoln, No.\nl9-CR-6o47 (CJS), 2ol9 WL 7l9822, at *4 (W.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, 2ol9) (collecting § 2422 cases);\nUnited States v. Vickers, 7o8 F. App’x 732, 735 (2d Cir. 2ol7) (summary order) (criminal sexual\nactivity under § 2423 includes crimes “under federal, state, or foreign law’). Indeed, the Mann\nAct conspiracies in the S2 Indictment charge a violation of a New York State misdemeanor as\nthe “sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense.” S2 Ind. § l3b,\nl9b (citing N.Y. Penal Law § l3o.55). Section l3o.55 prohibits “subject[ing] another person to\nsexual contact without the later’s consent.” N.Y. Penal Law § l3o.55. To be guilty of Section\nl3o.55 based on the victim’s incapacity to consent due to age, the victim must be under the age\nof l7. Id. § l3o.o5(3)(a). The government itself acknouledged this in its draft proposed jury\ninstructions, as well as the fact that Ms. Maxwell cannot be convicted of the Mann Act\nconspiracies unless she knew that the alleged victim was under l7. See Gov’t Proposed Jury\nInstructions (“[I]n order to find that the intended acts were nonconsensual solely because of the\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo69l4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006915.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 35of52\nvictim’s age, you must find that the defendant knew that the victim was less than seventeen years\nold.”) (emphasis added).\n\nIt is unclear whether the government is nou claiming that to adm\nevidence as proof of the Mann Act conspiracies, it only needs to prove that\nwas under the age of l8 at the time of the alleged abuse and that Ms. Maxwell did not need to\nknou anything about I age, or that Ms. Maxwell only needed to knou that yy\nME «2s under the age of l8. Either one is a misstatement of the law. For “sexual\nactivity” to be “criminal,” it must be illegal under the laws of the jurisdiction where the sex acts\nallegedly took place. If those crimes are based on lack of consent due to age, it is only illegal if\nthe alleged victim is under the age of consent in that jurisdiction. And according to the\ngovernment’s oun proposed jury instructions, Ms. Maxwell can only be found guilty of the\nMann Act conspiracies if she knew |] (and the other alleged victims) were under\nthe age of consent in the particular jurisdictions where the sex acts allegedly took place. Because\nBE 2s, at all times, over the age of consent in the relevant jurisdictions, her\nevidence is not within the scope of the charged conspiracies and is therefore not admissible as\ndirect evidence. At the very least, because it is not “manifestly clear” that\nevidence is proof of the charged conspiracies, “the proper course is to proceed under Rule\n4o4(b).” United States v. Tounsend, No. 8l o6 CR. 34 (JFK), 2oo7 WL l288597, at *l\n(S.D.N.Y. May l, 2oo7) (citing United States v. Nektalov, 325 F. Supp. 2d 367, 372 (S.D.N.Y.\n2oo4)).\n\n <Vidence should also be excluded under Rule 4o4(b) and Rule 4o3.\nAs argued in our initial Motion, evidence that Ms. Maxwell allegedly encouraged an adult to\nengage in legal sexual activity is not, in any way, evidence of her intent to facilitate Epstein’s\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-oooo69l5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006916.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 36 of 52\nalleged scheme to cause minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, or her knouledge of the\nsame. See Mot. at ll. Nor is the evidence of alleged “grooming” sufficiently unique to qualify\nas proof of “modus operandi.” See id. at l2. Furthermore, there is a strong likelihood that the\njury will assume that Epstein’s alleged sex acts with were illegal and will\nmisapply that evidence in evaluating Ms. Maxwell’s guilt or innocence to the charged Mann Act\nconspiracies. Her evidence should therefore be excluded under Rule 4o3. See id. at l2-l3.\n\nIf the Court decides to admit evidence, it should preclude the\ngovernment and ] from referring to her as a “minor” or asserting that she was a\n“minor” at the time of the alleged sex acts, (2) preclude the government and\nfrom representing that she was “sexually abused” by Jeffrey Epstein, and (3) give the jury the\nappropriate limiting instruction the defense has requested. See Mot. at l4-l5.\n\nThe government argues that the term “minor” is appropriate becausc\nwas, for a brief time, belou the age of l8, which is the age of consent under federal law. Resp.\nat 52-53. Although the government would like to believe that U.S. federal law is the only law\nthat maters, even as to acts that allegedly took place in a foreign country, that is not the case.\nThe Court should not permi{ggggg to be referred to as a “minor” because she was not\na “minor” under the laws of the relevant jurisdiction when any of the alleged sex acts took place.\nIt would not only be inaccurate to call her a “minor,” but it would also mislead the jury to believe\nthat the acts that allegedly took place in the U.K. were “criminal sexual activity” when they were\nnot. The same is true for the phrase “sexual abuse,” which connotes criminal activity. See Mot.\nat l4-l5 (citing Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions, l37 8. Ct. l562, l569 (2ol7)).\n\nFinally, the government opposes the defense’s requested jury instruction regarding the\nage of consent under U.K. law on the grounds that it is “irrelevant” and would “‘confuse the\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo69l6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006917.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 37 of52\njury.” Resp. at 53-54. Apparently, the government believes the jury would be “confused” if the\nCourt told the jurors what the law actually is so that they do not improperly assume thay\nHE testimony is being offered as proof of “criminal sexual activity” and apply it\nincorrectly to convict Ms. Maxwell of the Mann Act conspiracies. The jurors would not be\n“confused”; they would be educated on hou to properly cvaluatqyggy evidence.\nThe government’s objection is non-sensical. But not as non-sensical as the government’s final\nproclamation:\n\nThe sexual activity involving Minor Victim-3 can be considered criminal for\n\npurposes of the crimes charged in the Indictment, because it is probative proof of\n\nthe defendant’s guilt of those crimes. The instruction the defense proposes, in\n\ncontrast, creates serious risk that the jury will think the Court is telling them that\n\nthe conduct is lawful and therefore irrelevant to the case.\n\nId. at 54. A beter example of circular reasoning you could not find — gg sex\nacts with Epstein are “criminal” because they are “proof of the defendant’s guilt of those\ncrimes”? No. And the “risk that the jury will think that ... the conduct is lawful? It was lawful.\nWhatever misgivings i may nou have about those alleged sex acts, and whether\nshe nou views those incidents as “sexual abuse,” there was nothing illegal about them.\n\nAnd that is precisely the point. If she is permited qq will testify about\nfeeling sexually abused by Epstein and the jury will assume that the sex acts were illegal. Unless\nthe Court instructs the jury that the sex acts were not illegal under U.K. law, and they cannot be\nconsidered as “criminal sexual conduct” in evaluating the elements of the Mann Act\nconspiracies, there is a substantial risk that the jury will misapply her evidence and improperly\nconvict Ms. Maxwell of those counts. The government has agreed to do this in similar cases and\nit is appropriate to do so here. See Vickers, 7o8 F. App’x at 735-36 (government sought and\nreceived jury instructions explaining the applicable criminal laws of the relevant jurisdictions\nand jury returned a special verdict form finding “that the defendant intended to engage in sexual\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo69l7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006918.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 38 of 52\nactivity for which the defendant could be charged with specific New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New\nYork, and Canadian criminal offenses” (emphasis added)). Accordingly, the Court should give\nthe jury the defense’s requested limiting instruction.®\n\nV. THE GOVERNMENT CONCEDES THAT IT WILL NOT OFFER EVIDENCE\n\nOF MS.

The government dismisses this point arguing that indictments do not need to\ninclude all of the government’s evidence, and the terms “sexual activity” and “commercial sex\nact” are broad enough to cover rape. See Resp. at 8o. But this misses the point. The rape\nallegations are irrelevant to the charges because the charges are based on sexual activity that was\nillegal because the alleged victims were under the age of consent. The indictment does not\ncharge any crimes that are premised on sex acts that involve the use of force, like rape. For\nexample, Counts Five and Six charge sex trafficking offenses. See S2 Ind. 4] 22-27. But they\ndo not charge the section of the statute that criminalizes sex trafficking that “was effected by\nmeans of force, threats of force, fraud, or coercion.” l8 U.S.C. § l59l(b)(l). The government is\ntherefore off base when its states that “evidence of rape, where it occurs ... is the core conduct in\nthe case.” Resp. at 8l. It is only the “core conduct” of the case when the indictment alleges\nforcible sex acts. Indeed, the cases cited by the government prove this point. See Ex. E,\nIndictment, United States v.

Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. As we previously argued in our initial Motion, rape is highly\nemotional and inflammatory, much more so than the “sexualized massages” alleged in the S2\nIndictment. See Mot. at 2-3. Admiting testimony of an alleged rape would pose a serious risk\nthat the “jury will convict for crimes other than those charged—or that, uncertain of guilt, it will\nconvict anyway because a bad person deserves punishment.” Old Chief v. United States, 5l9\nU.S. l72, l8l (l997) (quoting United States v. Moccia, 68l F.2d 6l, 63 (lst Cir. l982) (Breyer,\nJ.)) (discussing propensity evidence). Such evidence would also confuse the issues at trial and\nmislead the jury. It will cause the jurors to focus on conduct that is not relevant to the charged\noffense and suggests that they convict Ms. Maxwell on an improper and highly emotional basis.\nSee United States v. Stein, 52l F. Supp. 2d 266, 273 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (excluding other-act\nevidence in a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> case under Rule 4o3 because of the “risk that this evidence would\nconfuse the issues, cause undue delay, and be used for an improper purpose”). The Court should\ntherefore preclude any testimony or evidence about an alleged rape.\n\nXI. REFERENCE TO ACCUSERS AS \"VICTIMS\" IS IMPROPER VOUCHING\nWithout explaining its logic, and by way of cases concerning jury instructions, the\ngovernment disagrees that use of the term \"victim\" by witnesses and the prosecution during trial\n\namounts to improper vouching.

In addition, the Government provided specific\nexemplars of statements falling within each of these four categories. The Government explained\nthat it expected many of the statements falling within the four categories to be offered without use\nof Rule 8ol(d)(2)(E), but it included those statements in an abundance of caution.\n\nIn response, defense counsel indicated that they did not object to the first, third, and fourth\ncategories so long as those proffered statements are limited to individuals identified as “minor\nvictims” in the Second Superseding Indictment (the “Indictment”) or correspondence to defense\ncounsel dated October ll, 2o2l, and so long as the statements were not made outside of the dates\nof the alleged conspiracies in the Indictment.

Applicable Law\n\nHearsay is defined as a declarant’s out-of-court statement “offer[ed] in evidence to prove\nthe truth of the mater asserted in the statement,” and is inadmissible unless it falls within an\nexception. Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(c). “Ifthe significance of an offered statement lies solely in the fact\nthat it was made,” houever, then “no issue is raised as to the truth of anything asserted, and\nthe statement is not hearsay.” Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(c) advisory commitee’s note. “Thus,\na statement offered to shou its effect on the listener is not hearsay.” United States v. Dupree, 7o6\nF.3d l3l, l36 (2d Cir. 2ol3); see also George v. Celotex Corp.,9l4 F.2d 26, 3o (2d Cir.\nl99o) (“To be sure, an out of court statement offered not for the truth of the mater asserted, but\nmerely to shou that the defendant was on notice of a danger, is not hearsay.”).\n\nRule 8ol(d)(2)(E) of the Federal Rules of Evidence provides in relevant part that “[a]\nstatement . . . is not hearsay [if] . . . [t]he statement is offered against an opposing party and...\nwas made by the party’s co-conspirator during and in furtherance of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.” To admit a\nstatement under this rule, the Court must find two facts by a preponderance of the evidence: first,\nthat a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> that included the defendant and the declarant existed, and, second, that the\nstatement was made during the course and in furtherance of that <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. Bourjaily v. United\nStates, 483 U.S. l7l, l75 (l987); United States v. Gigante, l66 F.3d 75, 82 (2d Cir. l999).

Ramirez-Talavera\nv. United States, 5ol U.S. l2ll (l99l).

Tarantino, 846 F.2d\nl384, l4l2 (D.C. Cir. l988). Thus, statements are in furtherance of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> if they:\n(l) inform or provide an update as to the status or progress of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, see United States v.\nDesena, 26o F.3d l5o, l58 (2d Cir. 2ool); (2) “prompt the listener . . . to respond in a way that\npromotes or facilitates the carrying out of a criminal activity,” Maldonado-Rivera, 922 F.2d at\n958; (3) “seek to induce a co-conspirator’s assistance,” Desena, 26o F.3d at l58; (4) “provide\nreassurance,” id.; (5) “serve to foster trust and cohesiveness,” id.; United States v.

Discussion\n\nBoth proffered statements are admissible as non-hearsay under the Federal Rules of\nEvidence. The first exemplar qualifies as a co-conspirator statement under Rule 8ol(d)(2)(E), and\nthe second exemplar is not offered for the truth of the mater asserted. Accordingly, both are\nadmissible at trial.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6957", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006958.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 456 Filed ll/l2/2l Page6oflo\nPage 6\n\nl. First Exemplar\n\nThe first exemplar to which the defense objects involved a statement Epstein made to\nEmployee-l in order to provide background information and history about an ongoing sex\ntrafficking <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. Specifically, Epstein informed Employee-l, in sum and substance, that the\ndefendant used to find girls for Epstein. The Government expects that Employee-l will testify that\nat the time Epstein made this statement, Employee-l was a participant in a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to sex traffic\nminors for Epstein. In particular, Employee-l will testify that in 2oo5, Epstein was still receiving\npaid sexualized massages from minor girls, which his employees facilitated. As part of that\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, Employee-l made phone calls to schedule girls, whom Employee-l knew to be\nunderage, to provide Epstein with massages, which Employee-l knew would involve sex acts in\nexchange for money. Although Minor Victim-4 had already turned l8 in 2oo5, Employee-l will\ntestify that Epstein and his employees continued to arrange for other minor girls to provide the\npaid sexualized massages.\n\nIn other words, although the time period for the sex trafficking <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charged in the\nIndictment ends in 2oo4, the same sex trafficking <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> continued beyond that time. Further,\nthe defendant cannot be presumed to have withdrawn from the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> simply because the\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charged in the Indictment ends in 2oo4. See Diaz, l76 F.3d at 98 (“Unless a conspirator\nproduces affirmative evidence of withdrawal, his participation in a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> is presumed to\ncontinue until the last overt act by any of the conspirators.” (quoting United States v.\nGreenfield, 44 F.3d ll4l, ll5o (2d Cir. l995))). The defendant therefore remained in a sex\ntrafficking <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> with Epstein in 2oo5. And for purposes of analysis under Rule\n8ol(d)(2)(E), it is irrelevant that the Indictment includes a timespan that ends in 2oo4 because\n“t]he <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> between the declarant and the defendant need not be identical to any <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6958", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006959.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 456 Filed ll/l2/2l Page /7oflo\nPage 7\n\nthat is specifically charged in the indictment” or that is the subject of the relevant trial. Gigante,\nl66 F.3d at 82; see also Maldonado-Rivera, 922 F.2d at 962 (“Though . . . Fed. R. Evid.\n8ol(d)(2)(E) requires proof that both the declarant and the party against whom a declaration is\noffered be members of the same <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, it does not require that the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> be one charged\nin the indictment.”). Employee-l’s testimony regarding the continuing <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> thus satisfies\nRule 8ol(d)(2)(E)’s first prong.\n\nWhen making this statement, Epstein was atempting to induce Employee-l’s cooperation\nto effect the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>’s goals. See, e.g., United States v. Gupta, 747 F.3d ll, l25 (2d Cir. 2ol4)\n(“Statements designed to induce the listener’s assistance with respect to the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>’s goals\nsatisfy the Rule’s in-furtherance requirement.”). Here, Epstein’s statement to Employee-l was\nintended to convey to Employee-l that other employees had participated in the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to traffic\nminors and to encourage Employee-l to similarly participate. See United States v. Beech-Nut\nNutrition Corp., 87l F.2d ll8l, ll99 (2d Cir. l989) (“Coconspirator statements may be found to\nbe ‘in furtherance’ of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> within the meaning of Rule 8ol(d)(2)(E) if they ‘prompt the\nlistener to respond in a way that facilitates the carrying out of criminal activity.’” (quoting Kahme,\n8l3 F.2d at 35)). Epstein’s statement reassured Employee-l that Employee-l would not be alone\namong his employees by participating in his scheme and informed Employee-l about the history\nof the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. Further, Epstein’s statement conveyed to Employee-l that the defendant was\nsomeone who had participated in the scheme and accordingly could be trusted. See Simmons, 923\nF.2d at 945 (statements between co-conspirators that “provide reassurance, serve to maintain trust\nand cohesiveness among them, or inform each other of the current status of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>,” further\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>); see also United States v. Handy, 668 F.2d 4o7, 4o8 (8th Cir. l982) (statement of\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6959", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006960.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 456 Filed ll/l2/2l Page8oflo\nPage 8\none coconspirator identifying another is in furtherance of <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>). Accordingly, this statement\nis admissible as a co-conspirator statement under Rule 8ol(d)(2)(E).\n\nThis statement is also directly relevant to the charges in the Indictment. Although Epstein\nmade the statement in 2oo5, he was discussing a time in the past when the defendant found girls\nfor him. In other words, this statement references conduct that took place during the period\ncharged in the Indictment. Epstein was telling Employee-l that the defendant took precisely the\nactions alleged in the Indictment by recruiting girls for Epstein.\n\n2. Second Exemplar\n\nThe second exemplar involves instructions provided to Employee-l by Epstein and\nEmployee-2, who was also a co-conspirator. In particular, Employee-l was instructed to go to\nEpstein’s Palm Beach residence in October of 2oo5 and help someone who was coming to remove\ncomputers from the house.\n\nThis exemplar is a case in which the Government expects to offer the statement without\nuse of Rule 8ol(d)(2)(E). The instructions are not hearsay because the Government will not offer\nthem for their truth. Rather, these statements are offered to demonstrate their impact on the\nlistener—Employee-l—in order to explain why Employee-l removed computers from Epstein’s\nPalm Beach house in October of 2oo5. Asa result, the proffered statement is not hearsay. Dupree,\n7o6 F.3d at l36 (“[A] statement offered to shou its effect on the listener is not hearsay.”).\n\nAlthough this event post-dated the time period contained in the Indictment, it explains why\nthe members of the Palm Beach Police Department found that computer hard drives appeared to\nbe missing from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence when they executed a search warrant there on\nOctober 2o, 2oo5. In particular, the Government expects a member of the search team to testify\nthat during the search, he observed computer monitors and keyboards without any hard drives\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo696o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006961.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 456 Filed ll/l2/2l Page9oflo\nPage 9\natached to them, suggesting that electronic equipment had been removed in advance of the search.\nThe absence of that electronic equipment, which resulted from Employee-l removing the\nequipment at Epstein’s instruction, will both corroborate that witness’s testimony and will help the\njury understand why they have not been presented with any electronic evidence from the 2oo5\nsearch.\n\nFinally, while the Government does not seek to offer this statement for its truth, the\nGovernment notes that it included the statement within the Rule 8ol(d)(2)(E) disclosure leter\nbecause that is an alternative basis of admission. Like the first exemplar, this statement was made\nduring the sex trafficking <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> that continued past 2oo4. The statement was also in\nfurtherance of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> because it related to efforts to protect co-conspirators from legal\njeopardy so that the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> might continue. Cf United States v. Johnson, 469 F. Supp. 3d l93,\n2l3 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (“[A] ‘plot to silence [a] witness[ ]’ is admissible as aco-\nconspirator statement, because the plot “furthers the goals of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> in that the\n[<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>'s objectives] would be facilitated by the acquital of all the defendants’” (quoting\nUnited States v. Arrington, 867 F.2d l22, l3o (2d Cir. l989)). Accordingly, although the\nGovernment does not anticipate offering this statement for its truth under Rule 8ol(d)(2)(E), it\nwould also be admissible on that basis.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo696l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006969.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 457 Filed ll/l3/2l Page7of8\nPage 7\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. By its very nature, a contact book that collects phone numbers for many people is not\nthe sort of thing that is generated in a single day. Like the digital contact list in the ordinary modern\ncellphone, a directory represents a collection of information and numbers typically gathered over\na period of years. Based on this alone, the jury could readily infer that Government Exhibit 52,\nwhich was seen by Employee-l in a. contains information the defendant collected during the\nperiod of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, including 2oo4 and earlier.

Take, for example, a defendant charged with a patern of bank robberies. If police\nofficers searched the defendant’s apartment long after the crimes were commited and discovered\na list of the various bank branches the defendant had robbed, there would be no question that the\nlist was relevant, even if it were unclear when the list was made or there was some suggestion that\nthe list was made a year after the robberies. Such a list would reflect the defendant’s knouledge\nof relevant locations, persons, and activities involved in the alleged criminal conduct. This case\nis no different. No mater when the defendant had this contact information, this evidence\ndemonstrates that the defendant knew LC\nPo Thus, this evidence is directly relevant to the issues before the\nJury at this trial.

The Defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell, has been charged in an Indictment\nwith various criminal offenses. The Indictment is not evidence. It simply contains the\ncharges—treferred to as “counts”—that the Government intends to prove to the jury at trial\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\nThe charges in the Indictment stem from allegations that from at least l994 through 2oo4, the\nDefendant conspired with and aided and abeted Jeffrey Epstein to entice minors to travel to\nengage in criminal sexual activity, to transport minors to engage in criminal sexual activity,\nand to engage in sex trafficking of a minor.\nThe Indictment charges the Defendant in 6 counts: Count One of the Indictment charges the\nDefendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage\nin sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense. Count Two\ncharges the Defendant with enticing a minor to travel to engage in sexual activity for which a\nperson can be charged with a criminal offense, and aiding and abeting the same. Count Three\ncharges the Defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to transport minors to engage\nin sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense. Count Four\ncharges the Defendant with transporting a minor to engage in sexual activity for which a person\ncan be charged with a criminal offense, and aiding and abeting the same. Count Five charges\nthe Defendant with participating in a sex trafficking <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. Count Six charges the\nDefendant with sex trafficking of a minor, and aiding and abeting the same.\nMs. Maxwell has pled not guilty to all charges. Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent, and before\nshe can be found guilty on any charge, the jury must find that the Government has proven each\nelement of that crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\n-4-\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7o2l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007083.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 32 of l27 32\nLBl5MAX2\n\nl relevant at all.\n\n2 As the government set forth in its moving papers, the\n3 defendant is not charged with trafficking certain victims and\n\n4 so whether or not the defendant is guilty of those crimes is\n\na irrelevant before this jury.\n\n6 THE COURT: Ms. Sternheim, any mention on opening with\n7 respect to this line of --\n\n8 We will ask everyone please make sure your masks are\n\n9 on -- counsel, fully on -- unless you are at the podium.\n\nlo MS.

MENNINGER: Your Honor, I don't believe that we\n\nl7 will be opening on these issues but I think the government is\nl8 understating what is charged in the indictment. They have put\nl9 forth an indictment that does not just allege the four main\n2o accusers, rather they have set forth a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> that they\n2l claim involves a number of other unnamed individuals, and I\n22 believe they have proffered an intent to put other evidence\n23 about unnamed individuals in their exhibits, in their trial\n24 testimony. For example, there are a number of exhibits that\n25 they've set forth that come from a time period outside of the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7o83", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007084.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 33 of l27 33\nLBl5MAX2\n\nl <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> and so forth. So it is our position that if they\n\n2 open the door to evidence about anyone other than these four\n\ni) then we would, likewise, be able to talk about the fact that\n\n4 those other individuals were interviewed by the government and\niy said that Ms. Maxwell is not involved, was not there, and was\n\n6 not a part of the activities that they're talking about. None\n7 of the cases that the government cited had to do with a\n\n8 co-conspirator. The evidence was just because a defendant did\n9 not act in conformity with the charged conduct on a separate\n\nlo occasion, couldn't be set forth by the defense.\n\nll THE COURT: Do you agree with that principle?\n\nl2 MS. MENNINGER: Yes, your Honor. If it is good\n\nl3 character evidence, generally I understand the rules of\n\nl4 evidence wouldn't apply, but what we have here is a lo-year\n\nl5 charged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> with an intent by the government to allude\nl6 to other individuals. To the extent they try to put on\n\nl7 evidence in the form of message pads or other types of evidence\nl8 that refer to other people, then I think we have the ability to\nl9 confront that evidence with the fact that Ms. Maxwell was\n2o reported by those individuals not to have been involved.\nal THE COURT: Ms. Moe?\n22 MS.

Thank you, your Honor.\n3 I think your Honor hit it right on the head right from\n4 the outset, which is if all we had were allegations related to\niy this particular individual, we would not have a charged crime\n\n6 here because there was no criminal activity at all.\n\n7 The only basis for which -—- I think the government has\n8 tried to articulate some basis for its relevance as direct\n\n9 evidence of the charged crimes is her subjective experience of\nlo what happened to her. She was of legal age in every single\n\nll jurisdiction where these events allegedly took place. So the\nl2 issue of consent, while we may have moral objections to this,\nl3 it was entirely legal and the government can't prove otherwise.\nl4 So all she's going to testify to, presumably, is hou she felt\nl5 about those instances, and that is not proof that is probative\nl6 of the defendant's guilt of these charges.\n\nl7 Moreover, your Honor, it is quite inflammatory and\n\nl8 misleads the jury to hear when someone feels a certain way what\nl9 happened to her, even though legally it doesn't make a\n2o difference, that is going to encourage them to feel sympathy\n2l for her and convict the defendant potentially on a false ground\n22 because there is no illegal conduct here.\n23 Your Honor, I think the government has articulated or\n24 at least tried to articulate at the Court's urging a basis why\n25 this may be direct evidence of the sex trafficking <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7l3l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007132.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 8l of l27 8l\nLBlTMAX3\n\nl That really was not spelled out in the briefing.\n\n2 THE COURT: I think for sure it wasn't, because just\n\n3 hearing it for the first time, it strikes me as having\n\n4 potential plausibility.

But even if it is not, it is certainly admissible under Rule 4o4(b).\n\nA. Direct Evidence\n\nAs the Government argued in its motion, evidence relating to Minor Victim-3 is direct\nevidence of the Mann Act conspiracies. The defendant’s conduct regarding Minor Victim-3\noverlaps in time and place with the other Minor Victims charged in the Mann Act conspiracies:\nCounts One and Three charge conduct from l994 to 2oo4 in New York and Palm Beach, and\nMinor Victim-3 began giving Epstein sexualized massages in l994, traveling to meet Epstein and\nthe defendant in both New York and Palm Beach. The Government expects the defendant’s\nrelationship with Epstein to be a “‘critical factual dispute’”— specifically, whether that relationship\nincluded conspiring with him and aiding or abeting Epstein’s sex crimes. United States v.\nRobinson, 7o2 F.3d 22, 37 (2d Cir. 2ol2). Minor Victim-3’s testimony will help establish that it\ndid.\n\nEvidence relating to Minor Victim-3 also “fills in a narrative” about “why [the defendant]\ntook actions to” arrange sexualized massages. United States v. Rodriguez, 727 F. App’x 24, 26\n(2d Cir. 2ol8) (summary order). Poe\nee\nee\na\n\nFinally, evidence related to Minor Victim-3 is direct evidence as corroboration for the other\nthree Minor Victims. Those Minor Victims will describe a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> that operated to recruit girls\nfor the purposes of massage, groom them, and transform the massages into sexual encounters. The\nconspirators then traveled with the girls or invited girls to travel, and asked the girls to find others\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7422", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007423.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 492 Filed ll/22/2l Page6ofl3\nPage 6\n| the same time period, and in some of the same places.\n\nThe fact that Minor Victim-3 was above the age of consent in relevant jurisdictions has no\nbearing on this analysis. Lawful activity may still be relevant evidence of a crime. For instance,\nevidence that the defendant was Epstein’s girlfriend is relevant and probative even if it is also\nlawful. In a fraud case, evidence that a defendant had significant debts is relevant and probative\neven if those debts involved no illegal activity. Even the overt act requirement of a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> can\nbe satisfied with proof of innocent conduct. See, e.g., United States v. Abdullaev, 76l F. App’x\n78, 84 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (summary order). This evidence is no different. Epstein’s prurient interest\nin girls did not end when the clock struck midnight on their l7\" birthday. The fact that the\ndefendant helped him abuse a l7-year-old is direct evidence of the manner in which she conspired\nwith him to abuse other young women as well, some of whom were in fact belou the age of\nconsent. Minor Victim-3’s testimony is thus intertwined with the conspiracies charged in the case,\nprobative of contested issues at trial, and no more sensational than the charged conduct. It is\ntherefore admissible. Even if it is lawful when evaluated purely in isolation, it is still direct\nevidence.\n\nEvidence related to Minor Victim-3 is also direct evidence of the sex trafficking counts in\nthe Indictment. It is direct evidence for similar reasons as for the Mann Act counts: it speaks\ndirectly to the defendant’s role in the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, her reasons for participating in it, and the\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>’s operation. But it is also relevant for the additional reason that it demonstrates the\nreasons for a co-conspirator’s participation in the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, which is also a central issue at this\ntrial. Specifically, it shous that minors who gave sexualized massages to Epstein were\ncompensated, and that Epstein was sexually atracted to girls of a certain age, typically under the\nage of eighteen. The former is evidence that the defendant and Epstein recruited and enticed girls\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7423", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007424.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 492 Filed ll/22/2l Page7ofl3\nPage 7\nto engage in commercial sex acts, an element of the offense. The later is evidence that the\ndefendant and Epstein engaged in sex trafficking of minors, which requires that the minor victim\nbe under eighteen rather than seventeen. Minor Victim-3’s testimony will shou that she had sexual\nencounters with Epstein, and in combination with the testimony of other Minor Victims, the\nevidence will shou that Epstein continually sought out girls under the age of l8 for sex from l994\nthrough the time period of the sex trafficking <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.”\n\nB. Rule 4o4(b)\n\nIn any event, evidence relating to Minor Victim-3 is relevant for multiple purposes that are\npermissible under Rule 4o4(b).\n\nFirst, it is relevant to the defendant’s knouledge that the massages were sexualized, an\nissue that is expected to be central at this trial. The Government anticipates that Minor Victim-3\na\nee\nee\na\nee\nee\nrs A jury could conclude from each of these facts that\n2 Evidence related to Minor Victim-3 is similarly relevant to the Mann Act counts. The Mann Act\ncounts require that the victims be under seventeen, rather than eighteen. But evidence that Epstein\nhad a sexual preference for women much younger than him, including seventeen-year-olds, is\n—_ of whether he had a sexual — for — a\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7424", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007425.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 492 Filed ll/22/2l Page8ofl3\nPage 8\nthe defendant knew that, when she arranged for a young girl—such as Minor Victim-l or Minor\nVictim-4— to give Epstein a massage, that massage involved sexual contact.\n\nSecond, the evidence is relevant to the defendant’s motive. The Government expects the\ndefense to argue that the defendant had no reason to assist Epstein in obtaining sexualized\nmassages, especially from young girls. Minor Victim-3 will testify that\nee\nee\nee\nees\n\nThird, evidence regarding Minor Victim-3 is probative of her intent. “‘Where intent to\ncommit the crime charged is clearly at issue’—l.e., where it is an element of the crime—‘evidence\nof prior similar acts may be introduced to prove that intent.’” United States v. Graham, No. l4 Cr.\n5oo (NSR), 2ol5 WL 6l6l292, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 2o, 2ol5) (quoting United States v. Caputo,\n8o8 F.2d 963, 968 (2d Cir. l987)). The defendant is likely to argue that any steps taken to arrange\nmassages were purely innocent conduct. See id. (“Prior act evidence is admissible to demonstrate\nintent ‘where a defendant claims that his conduct has an innocent explanation.’” (quoting Zackson,\nl2 F.3d at ll82 (alterations omited))). Evidence of the defendant’s knouledge that massages\nwere sexualized and the defendant’s motives described above is probative of her intent to entice\nand transport minors for the purpose of sexual contact.

Minor Victim-3 suffered unwanted\nand traumatic sexual contact with Jeffrey Epstein when she was l7 years old. In addition to making\nher a victim in the ordinary sense of that word, it makes her a victim of the charged Mann Act\nconspiracies for at least the follouing provisions of federal law: the Crime Victim’s Rights Act\n(“CVRA”), l8 U.S.C. § 377l; the Victim and Witness Protection Act (“VWPA”), l8 U.S.C. §\n3663; and Federal Rule of Evidence 4l2.!\n\nBoth the CVRA and VWPA contain statutory definitions of the term “victim.” The CVRA\ndefines “victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of a\nFederal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” l8 U.S.C. § 377l(e)(2)(A). The VWPA\nsimilarly defines “victim” to mean “a person directly and proximately harmed by the commission\n' Given the expedited briefing deadline, the Government has not addressed every provision of\nfederal law that references victims, but would be happy to address any additional provisions the\nCourt deems relevant.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo743l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007432.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 493 Filed ll/22/2l Page2of6\nPage 2\nof an offense.” l8 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(2).

See, e.g., United States v. Goodrich, l2\nF.4th 2l9, 229 (2d Cir. 2o2l) (describing the identical language in l8 U.S.C. § 3663A). The\noffense is a but-for cause if the defendant’s conduct was “‘a necessary factor in bringing about the\nvictim’s harm.” /d. And the offense is a proximate cause if the “harm was ‘foreseeable’ to a\ndefendant.” Jd. While the loss must “arise from the specific conduct that is the basis of the offense\nof conviction,” id. at 228 (internal quotation marks omited), in the case of a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> where an\nindividual is convicted for an “overarching scheme,” restitution is appropriate for “actions that\nwere within and necessary to that ‘single scheme.’” United States v. Seabrook, 968 F.3d 224, 236\nn.8 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (quoting United States v. Archer, 67l F.3d l49, l7l-72 (2d Cir. 2oll)). That\nincludes the “reasonably foreseeable actions” of co-conspirators, because “the defendant’s\n‘specific conduct’ in a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> includes his agreement to the ‘common plan of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.”\nGoodrich, l2 F.4th at 228.\n\nThese definitions of “victims” encompass a broader set of individuals than the set of people\nwho are injured when all elements of an offense are met. In Goodrich, for instance, a securities\nbroker-dealer “pleaded guilty to a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to manipulate” the share price of a sham company.\nl2 F.4th at 23l. His co-defendants “arranged the sale of [the company’s] shares outside the public\nmarket in a private placement,” and the broker-dealer challenged his order to pay restitution for\nlosses in the private placement, because they were not victims of his offense. Jd. at 223. The\nprivate placement was not mentioned in his indictment, plea agreement, or plea allocution, id. at\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo7432", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007433.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 493 Filed ll/22/2l Page3of6\nPage 3\n\n225, and the broker-dealer had pleaded guilty to manipulate the share price “rather than to execute\nthe private placement, id. at 23l. But that was “not conclusive”: “[t]he key question . . . is whether\nthe losses suffered by the private placement victims were ‘directly and proximately’ caused by the\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to manipulate the public share price.” Jd. (quoting l8 U.S.C. § 3663A(a)(2)); see id.\nat 234 (reversing because the record lacked adequate evidence of proximate causation); see also,\ne.g., United States v. Oladimeji, 463 F.3d l52, l59 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (affirming restitution for losses\ncaused by fraudulent use of credit cards where defendant was convicted of possession of the cards\nwith intent to defraud).\n\nUnder these principles, Minor Victim-3 is a victim of the Mann Act conspiracies. Those\nconspiracies operated through a patern of recruiting minor girls, grooming them, asking them to\nmassage Epstein, and then sexualizing the massages, from l994 to 2oo4, across Epstein and the\ndefendant’s various properties. (See ll/o5/2l Gov’t Leter at 5-6, 9). It was reasonably\nforeseeable to the defendant that she and Epstein’s efforts to recruit the girls to whom Epstein was\nsexually atracted would include recruiting a seventeen-year-old—Minor Victim-3—lin the course\nof that <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. And but for that recruitment, Minor Victim-3 would not have been harmed.\nSee United Sates v. Ray, 337 F.R.D. 56l, 57o (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o) (“The definition of victim under\nthe CVRA is expansive. It is not limited to those, such as Jane Doe-l and Jane Doe-2 who\nallegedly were victims of physical abuse.”); cf, e.g., United States v. Batista, 575 F.3d 226, 23l\n(2d Cir. 2oo9) (“Although Batista did not defraud the NBA directly, we conclude that the district\ncourt properly characterized the NBA as a ‘victim’ . . . because the NBA was harmed by the\nconduct commited during the course of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to transmit wagering information.”).\nConsider, for instance, a robbery crew that conspired to commit Hobbs Act robberies. Ifthe crew\nrobbed a business that was not engaged in interstate commerce, the elements of the offense could\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7433", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007434.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 493 Filed ll/22/2l Page4of6\nPage 4\n\nnot be satisfied as to that business. But the harms to the business would be directly and proximately\ncaused by actions taken in furtherance of the scheme, qualifying the business as a victim. So too\nhere.\n\nIt is no answer to say, as the defense has argued, that Epstein’s conduct with respect to\nMinor Victim-3 was legal. For the purposes of seting forth the elements of the charged crime, the\nCourt must of course draw a clear line at the age of consent.” But the definition in the CVRA and\nVWPA “‘is certainly broad,” Batista, 575 F.3d at 23l, and is broader than the elements of the\noffense. Thus, in assessing whether Minor Victim-3 is a “victim” under these definitions—and in\nassessing the admissibility of her testimony—such a clear line is neither required nor proper.\nEpstein and the defendant were not checking victims’ identifications at the door to ensure they\nwere above the age of consent in whichever location they were at the time. Just as Epstein’s\nprurient interest in girls did not switch off at midnight of their l7\" birthday, neither did it toggle\non and off as his plane crossed into jurisdictions with different ages of consent. Rather, Epstein\nand the defendant were engaged in a wide-ranging <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to recruit girls for sexual abuse in\nmultiple jurisdictions with differing ages of consent. The core of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> was the agreement\nto engage in the criminal conduct, and it does not mater whether the elements of the substantive\ncrimes of transportation or enticement were completed or atempted to be completed as to Minor\nVictim-3. See Salinas v. United States, 522 U.S. 52, 65 (l997). That is why Epstein’s abuse of\nMinor Victim-3 is properly included in the indictment and why Epstein’s abuse of Minor Victim-\n3’s testimony is direct evidence of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. If Minor Victim-3 was directly and proximately\n* It bears noting that the Mann Act contemplates that children under the age of l8 are victims of\nthe offense, though in this case that is limited by the New York object charged in the Indictment.\nSee, e.g., l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a) (criminalizing the transportation of an individual “who has not\natained the age of l8” for purposes of illegal sexual activity).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7434", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007435.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 493 Filed ll/22/2l Page5of6\nPage 5\nharmed by conduct in furtherance of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>—and she was—then she is a “victim” under\nthe relevant statutes.\n\nFinally, Minor Victim-3 is also a “victim” for purposes of Federal Rule of Evidence 4l2,\nbecause she is clearly someone who “can reasonably be characterized as a ‘victim of alleged sexual\nmisconduct.’” Fed. R. Evid. 4l2, Advisory Commitee Notes (l994). Given Rule 4l2’s broad\napplication in not just criminal cases but also civil cases such as claims of sexual harassment, see\nWolak v. Spucci, 2l7 F.3d l57, l6o (2d Cir. 2ooo), it cannot be read to define victims as only those\nindividuals whose victimization would alone satisfy all of the elements of a charged crime. As set\nforth above, Epstein’s conduct with respect to Minor Victim-3 is plainly “alleged sexual\nmisconduct,” and therefore she is a victim as defined in Rule 4l2.\n\nFor these reasons, Minor Victim-3 is a “victim” under the provisions of federal law\ndiscussed above. Moreover, the Government respectfully submits that even if its reading of these\nprovisions is incorrect, that does not affect the admissibility of Minor Victim-3’s testimony as\ndirect evidence: evidence that does not itself establish every element of the charged crime may\nnevertheless be admissible as direct evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Gonzalez, llo F.3d 94l,\n942 (2d Cir. l997); United States v. Carboni, 2o4 F.3d 39, 44 (2d Cir. 2ooo). And Minor Victim-\n3’s status as a “victim” under the foregoing provisions of law certainly does not affect the\nadmissibility of her testimony under Rule 4o4(b), which permits the admission of other act\ntestimony that almost by definition does not satisfy the elements of the charged crime. The\ntestimony should be admited.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7435", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007437.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 494 _ Filed ll/22/2l Pagelofl2\naie! : 8oo Third Avenue\n\n= ew York, N’ 2\n\nCOHEN & GRESSER LLP ere es\n\nwww.cohengresser.com\nChristian R.

See ll/5/2o2l\nLtr. at 5-6. The Court has already correctly determined that Accuser-3’s evidence is not direct\nproof of the Mann Act conspiracies and cannot be offered for that purpose:\nThe evidence related to alleged Victim-3, as the government\ndescribes her, is not direct evidence of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charged in\nCounts One and Three of the indictment. Counts One and Three\ncharge the defendant with <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to entice minors to travel to\nengage in illegal sex acts and <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to transport minors with\nintent to engage in criminal sexual activity.\nThe parties agree that alleged Victim-3 was l7 at the time she was\nacquainted with the defendant and Epstein in London, England\nwhere the age of consent is l6. Moreover, she can't recall, and the\ngovernment wouldn't be able to establish that she was invited to\ntravel with the defendant when she was l7 or l8. And because the\nalleged victim was over the age of consent in all relevant\njurisdictions and, therefore, any alleged sexual activity was lawful,\nthe alleged conduct does not arise out of the same transactions or\nseries of transactions as the charged offense. It's not inextricably\nintertwined with the evidence, again with respect to the Mann Act,\nand it's not necessary to complete the story of the crime on trial, so\nI don't think it can be direct evidence of the Mann Act counts.\nll/l/2o2l Tr. at 86:9-87:4 (emphasis added). In so finding, the Court rejected all of the reasons\nthat the government offers (again) to admit this evidence as direct proof of the Mann Act\nconspiracies. The government has given the Court no reason to change its initial finding and it\nshould decline to do so.\n2o498o8.l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo7438", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007439.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 494 _ Filed ll/22/2l Page3ofl2\nThe Honorable Alison J.

See\nNovember 5 Ltr. at 6-7. The few reasons the government does give are meritless. The\ngovernment starts by asserting that Accuser-3’s evidence is admissible to prove the sex trafficking\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> for the same reasons that it is admissible to prove the Mann Act conspiracies — reasons\nwhich the Court has already rejected. See id. at 6. The government then makes the puzzling\nassertion that Accuser-3’s evidence is admissible because it “demonstrates the reasons for a co-\nconspirator’s participation in the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.” /d. Specifically, the government asserts that the\nevidence shous that (l) “minors who gave sexualized massages to Epstein were compensated,”\nwhich the government contends is proof that Ms. Maxwell and Epstein “recruited and enticed girls\nto engage in commercial sex acts”; and (2) “Epstein was sexually atracted to girls of a certain age,\ntypically under the age of eighteen,” which the government contends is proof that Ms. Maxwell\nand Epstein engaged in sex trafficking of minors under the age of eighteen. Jd. at 6-7.\n\nThese arguments are misguided and unpersuasive. First, neither of the two specific bases\nfor admission speaks to “the reasons for” Ms. Maxwell’s alleged participation in the sex\ntrafficking <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, as the government claims.

Accuser-3’s evidence does not shou that Epstein was\natracted to underage girls. At most, it shous that he was atracted to young women above the age\nof consent, which is neither a crime nor evidence ofa crime. The Court recognized this distinction\nat the November | conference in the discussion of Accuser-3’s evidence:\nMS. MOE: ... I think as a mater of common sense, a jury\nunderstanding that the defendant is willing to provide Epstein with\na girl at the age of l7 would certainly speak to her knouledge of\nhis sexual preferences.\nTHE COURT: Why doesn't it speak to a knouledge of sexual\npreferences to someone just above the age of consent?\n2o498o8.l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo744o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007441.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 494 _ Filed ll/22/2l Page5ofl2\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nNovember ll, 2o2l\nPage 5\nll/l/2o2l Tr. at 77:3-77:9. The government could not answer the Court’s question, which was\nexactly on point. Seting aside that proof of Epstein’s “sexual preferences” is impermissible\npropensity evidence (discussed further belou), at most, Accuser-3’s evidence would shou that\nEpstein was engaged in legal sexual activity with someone over the age of consent and that Ms.\nMaxwell allegedly knew that he was engaged in such legal activity. Hence, her evidence is no\nmore admissible as direct proof of the sex trafficking <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> than it is of the Mann Act\nconspiracies. The bases for admiting Accuser-3’s evidence suffer from the same logical and legal\ndefects that the Court already identified with respect to the Mann Act counts. It should therefore\nnot be admited as direct evidence of Count Five.\nI. Accuser-3’s Evidence is Improper Propensity Evidence that Is Inadmissible Under\nRule 4o4(b) and Rule 4o3\nAccuser-3’s evidence is also inadmissible under Rule 4o4(b) and Rule 4o3. Recognizing\nthat Accuser-3’s evidence will likely not be admissible as direct evidence of the charged\nconspiracies in light of the Court’s prior findings, the government atempts to bootstrap her\nevidence into the case by arguing that it is admissible for various purposes under Rule 4o4(b). See\nNovember 5 Ltr at 7-ll. Although the government tries to frame this evidence in terms of\npermissible 4o4(b) purposes, such as Ms. Maxwell’s knouledge, motive, intent, etc., it is evident\nfrom the government’s submissions and its comments at the last two court conferences that it\nintends to offer this evidence for an impermissible propensity purpose; namely to establish that\nJeffrey Epstein had “sexual preference” for young girls and to argue that he acted in conformity\nwith that preference with Accuser-3 and therefore must have done so as well with the other\nAccusers. See id. at 7 n.2; ll/l/2o2l Tr. at 77:3-77:l2.

The Court recognized that allouing Accuser-3 to testify about her sexual\nacts with Epstein would create a significant risk that the jury will convict Ms. Maxwell on an\nimproper premise that these sex acts were illegal. Admiting Accuser-3’s testimony to prove Ms.\nMaxwell’s knouledge, intent, motive, etc. would be at odds with that ruling. For Accuser-3’s\ntestimony to be admited as proof that Ms. Maxwell knew that Epstein’s massages were\nsexualized, for example, Accuser-3 would have to testify that she engaged in sex acts with Epstein\nduring her massages. The same is true if her testimony is offered to shou Ms. Maxwell’s motive\nor intent, or the modus operandi of the charged conspiracies. Accordingly, Accuser-3’s evidence\nshould not be admited under Rule 4o4(b).\nFinally, whatever minimal relevance (if any) that Accuser-3’s testimony may have as\n4o4(b) evidence is dwarfed by the significant prejudice Ms. Maxwell will suffer if it is admited.\nThe government has already advised the Court and the defense repeatedly that Accuser-3 feels that\nshe was “sexually abused” by Epstein and that her sexual contact with Epstein was “unwanted and\ntraumatic.” November 5 Ltr. at l2; see also ll/l/2o2l Tr. 75:23-76:ol. The government has also\ncautioned that Accuser-3 will likely become emotional and upset if she alloued to describe these\nevents to the jury. The defense does not doubt that this is true.

If this “compartmentalization” prevented Ms. Maxwell from having the\nrequired knouledge or intent (an ultimate issue for the jury to decide, on which Dr. Dietz will\nnot opine), then she will be not guilty.

Indeed, neither the Government nor the Court could identify a\nfederal court that has admited expert testimony on the jury’s hindsight bias. Gov’t Br. at l4.\nThe Defense cites no such case law in its response. Second, even if the jury’s hindsight bias\nwere a relevant topic of expert testimony, the Court would exclude it because of Rule 4o3\nprejudice. The Court will instruct the jury on hou to assess evidence and determine Ms.\nMaxwell’s intent. An expert instruction on hindsight bias risks confusing the jury and usurping\nthe Court’s role in instructing the jury as to the law. Nimely, 4l4 F.3d at 397.\n\nNext, Dr. Dietz offers an opinion on the so-called halo effect.

Dr. Dietz would testify that Jeffrey Epstein “exploited the Halo effect to\nsurround himself with people who would serve his needs” while “compartmentaliz[ing]” what\nthey knew about his activities.

In defense counsel’s words, Jane’s recollection “of everything . . . is critical to the\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo82l5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008217.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document523 Filed l2/o4/2l Page4of9\n\nAs depicted in Government Exhibit 928, the massage room in fact has a large built-in\nbookcase with a stereo system:\n\n[Redacted]\n\nJane also testified that the massage room was approximately the size of a “giant walk-in\ncloset.” (ll/3o/2l Tr. at 32o). And more generally, she testified that the building itself had “Lots\nof stone, you knou, old wood.” (/d. at 3l7-l8).\n\nAs depicted in Government Exhibits 9o4 and 9l7, the massage room is about the size of a\nwalk-in closet, and the moldings in the massage room were made of wood:\n\n[Redacted]\n\nFinally, Jane explained that the artwork in the house included “Paintings of naked women\nand orgies and things like that.” So much so, in fact, that “[i]t didn’t seem very unusual at this\npoint.” (ll/3o/2o2l Tr. at 3l8).\n\nThat description is accurate, as evident from the above photos. It is also accurate with\nrespect to other photos of the massage room, including Government Exhibit 9o2, a photo of the\nentrance to the massage room:\n\n[Redacted]\n\nThese photos readily surmount the lou bar of relevance. They specifically corroborate\nJane’s memories of the room in which she was sexually abused, shouing that in fact she spent\ntime in that room, a critical fact of the case.\n\nThe Government understands the Court’s point that there has not been testimony\nspecifically comparing these particular photographs to items present during the time period of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. But most of Jane’s testimony about the massage room does not concern “movable\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo82l7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008219.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document523 Filed l2/o4/2l Page6of9\nevidence on a material mater, and they should be admited.\n\nB. Other Photographs\n\nMany of the remaining photographs of Epstein’s house corroborate other testimony by\nJane. As with the nude pictures in the massage room, each of these photographs is consistent with\ntestimony about Epstein’s practices, so they are probative corroboration of that testimony.\n\nFirst, Jane testified that Epstein used vibrators and back massagers of sizes while abusing\nher. (ll/3o/2l Tr. at 3lo). Juan Alessi, whose testimony corroborated Jane, also testified that he\nfound two different kinds of vibrating back massagers after Epstein received massages, and that\nthose massagers were kept in Epstein’s bathroom in Palm Beach. (l2/o2/2l Tr. at 894-95).\n\nThe Government recovered two vibrating massagers in the bathroom of the New York\nhome adjacent to the massage room. The Government therefore seeks admission of two photos,\nGovernment Exhibits 9l8 and 92l, depicting those two devices:\n\n[Redacted]\nThe point of this evidence is not to shou that these vibrators are the particular vibrators used on\nJane. It is to shou that they are the type that were used on Jane, and corroborate Jane’s testimony\nby shouing that Epstein did, consistent with the modus operandi of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> from the mid-\nl99os through the early 2ooos, possess this sort of massager device.\n\nSecond, Jane testified that the home contained “creepy looking animals.” (ll/3o/2l Tr. at\n3 The Government could not elicit testimony from Jane about these photographs without\nsubstantially diminishing the probative force of the evidence. Before shouing the photographs to\nJane on the stand, the Government would surely need to shou her the photographs in advance.\nDoing so would permit an inference that Jane tailored her testimony about her memories of the\nmassage room to the photographs, thereby vitiating the photographs’ value as independent\ncorroboration.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo82l9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008221.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document523 Filed l2/o4/2l Page 8of9\nphotos of the defendant and Epstein with celebrities, and additional artwork depicting nude\nwomen. The Government does not currently intend to offer exhibits depicting those photographs\nor artwork, but it does intend to elicit testimony from the law enforcement witness that the home\ncontained those items. That testimony is further corroboration of Jane’s general knouledge of\ncategories of decorations Epstein preferred, but it contains no suggestion that any particular exhibit\ncorroborates Jane’s testimony.\n\nFinally, the Government notes that the defense has not raised a Rule 4o3 prejudice\nargument, and for good reason. None of the evidence in this category is prejudicial to the defense.\nThere will be no suggestion that the defendant or Epstein possessed these particular items during\nthe time period of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, and the defense is free to argue that the distance in time\nundermines the probative force of the evidence. But whether that probative force is significant (as\nthe Government suggests) or minimal (as the defense suggests), the defense is not prejudiced by\npictures of a massager, a stuffed tiger, or photos of structural features of Epstein’s home.\n\nIl.

And the things depicted, elaborated the Court, were\n“highly mobile items”:\n\nYou could have, and you should have, shoun them to [Jane] after she provided the\n\ntestimony. The problem is, it’s l5 years since the end of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, it’s 2o-\n\nsome years since her testimony. I’ve looked at case law on this. Older photographs\n\nof immovable objects and structure may be relevant, and to the extent you have a\n\nwitness testifying saying it is similar to what I saw or specifically saying it’s similar\n\nin this way or dissimilar in that way, it would be permited.\n\nIn the absence of that, we’re talking about very movable items and a\nsubstantially long period of time. If there is a witness who could do that, that would\nbe appropriate, but in the absence of that, I won’t allou it in simply based on her\ndescription of what it looked like then.\n\nYou have that description in, so I’ll sustain the objection based on the\ncurrent record.\n\nSo if you wanted to ask her if it’s the same objects, you should have, or you\ncould have, or you can, but in the absence of that, we’re talking about highly mobile\nitems. The law does not support inclusion in this context without a witness\ntestifying as to the similarity of what -- you’re trying to corroborate that these\nphotos shou what it looked like then. You have a witness who can do that, but in\nthe absence of that, I’m sustaining the objection.

In addition to the temporal flaws described above, the government’s argument\nsuffers from another problem: It conflates Jane’s testimony about other parts of the house with\nher testimony about the massage room. While Jane described the curtains, walls, wallpaper,\nartwork, and decorations in other parts of the house, she specifically disclaimed looking at the\nwalls in the massage room, saying: “My eyes didn’t even look at the walls, mostly the floor, if\nnot what was going on.” Conveniently, the government omits this testimonial disclaimer from its\nleter. Given this testimony, houever, even if Jane’s testimony about what other parts of the\nhouse looked like in l994 or l995 or l996 provided a basis for admiting photos of those other\nparts of the house taken in 2ol9 (which it doesn’t), that testimony still wouldn’t justify\nadmission of photos of the massage room.\n\nThe fundamental flaw in the government’s logic is its failure to appreciate that\n“Taluthentication ... establishes the parameters of relevance.” Stearns, 55o F.2d at ll7o. The\ngovernment claims the 2ol9 photos are independently corroborative of Jane’s testimony because\nthey shou that her description of Mr. Epstein’s house as it existed in l994 and l995 and l996\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8229", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008231.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document525_ Filed l2/o5/2l Page/7of9\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nDecember 5, 2o2l\nPage 7\n\nThe government atempts to marginalize this Court’s legitimate concern about highly\nmobile items. But the Court’s concern is well founded. Twenty-five years have passed since Jane\nwas at Mr. Epstein’s house. Artwork is highly mobile. Furniture is highly mobile. Massage tables\nare highly mobile. (The government carried one such table into the well of the courtroom.)\nCurtains are easily changed and replaced. The list goes on. So, absent at least some testimony on\nthe subject, there is no reason to think that these highly mobile items depicted in the 2ol9 photos\nare the same highly mobile items that Jane says she saw (though not in the massage room) in\nl994 or l995 or l996.\n\nIndeed, the government nou disavous any argument “that the particular nude artwork in\nthe exhibits was present while Jane was abused.” Gov. Leter at 8. But if that’s so, then there’s\nno probative value to the unauthenticated photographs, particular when, as the Court\nacknouledged, the government already “ha[s] [Jane’s] description in” evidence. TR l2/3/2o2l, p\nlo77:3.\n\nBecause the government has not authenticated the 2ol9 photos as accurate\nrepresentations of Mr. Epstein’s house in l994 or l995 or l996, they are irrelevant. But even if\nthey were relevant, this Court could still exclude them as unfairly misleading and prejudicial.\nFed. R. Evid. 4o3. They are misleading because, as McCormick recognizes, the government has\nnot shoun the lack of changed conditions. § 2l5. Photographs, 2 McCormick on Evid. § 2l5 (8th\ned.). And they are unfairly prejudicial because they depict something occurring fifteen years\nafter the charged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, they have no connection to Ms. Maxwell, and they are\ninflammatory.

Mr. Alessi’s testimony established an intimate familiarity with the distinctive\ndirectories used in the Palm Beach household over many years and during the time period of the\ncharged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. He testified that GX 52 was the same “type of book,” with the same type of\nbinding, cover, and information. This testimony of the appearance, content, substance, and other\ndistinctive characteristics of the exhibit is sufficient to satisfy Rule 9ol.”\n\nThe Defense’s further objections go to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.\nSee Tin Yat Chin, 37l F.3d at 38. For example, Mr. Alessi was crossed on voir dire that he did\nnot have personal knouledge about the creation of GX 52 or hou the exhibit had been\nmaintained since it was allegedly removed from the house. Trial Tr. at 875. He acknouledged\nthat he would not knou whether GX 52 had been altered in some way, such as whether pages\nhad been added or whether it had been rebound. Nor could he explain the addition of Post-It\nnotes and other pencil markings in the otherwise type-face book. Trial Tr. at 872-75. But it is\nwell setled that “any flaws in the chain of custody bear only on the weight of the evidence, and\nnot on its admissibility.” United States v.

Other courts\nhave taken a similar approach to the Second Circuit. See e.g., United States v.

These documents are not offered to prove the information they contained\nand therefore, may not be excluded as hearsay.”).\n\nHere, the jury could conclude based on the testimony of Mr. Alessi and GX 6o6 that Ms.\nMaxwell regularly used this telephone directory, versions of which were maintained over the\nyears at the Palm Beach residence.

Unlike the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>\n\n4 charges, which allege agreements to commit certain offenses, the substantive counts are based on\n\n5 the actual commission of offenses, or aiding others to actually commit offenses.\n\n6 A <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to commit a crime is an entirely separate and different offense from the\n\n7 substantive crime which may be the object of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. Congress has deemed it appropriate\n\n8 to make <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, standing alone, a separate crime, even if the object of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> is not\n\n9 achieved. The essence of the crime of <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> is an agreement or understanding to violate\nlo other laws. Thus, if a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> exists, even if it fails, it is still punishable as a crime.\nll Consequently, in a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charge there is no need to prove that the crime that was the\nl2 objective of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> was actually commited.\nl3 By contrast, the substantive counts require proof that the crime charged was actually\nl4 commited, but do not require proof of an agreement. Of course, if a defendant both participates\nl5 in a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to commit a crime and then actually commits that crime, that defendant may be\nl6 guilty of both the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> and the substantive crime, as I will instruct you shortly.\nl7 We will turn first to the substantive charges in the Indictment, which are more convenient\nl8 to consider before the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charges. Therefore I will instruct you first on Counts Two,\nl9 Four, and Six, and then I will instruct you on Counts One, Three, and Five.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8475", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008497.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document562 Filed l2/l7/2l Page 4l of 82\n\nl Instruction No. 3l: Counts One, Three, and Five: <span class=\"highlight\">Conspiracy</span> to Violate Federal Laws —\n\n2 <span class=\"highlight\">Conspiracy</span> and Substantive Counts\n\n3 Counts One, Three, and Five of the Indictment each charge Ms. Maxwell with\n\n4 participating in a “<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.” The relevant statute for Counts One, Three, and Five is Title l8,\n\n5 United States Code, Section 37l, which provides that “if two or more people conspire [] to\n\n6 commit any offense against the United States ... and one or more of such persons do any act to\n\n7 ~~ effect the object of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>,” each person is guilty of a federal crime.\n\n8 As I will explain, a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> is a kind of criminal partnership—an agreement of two or\n\n9 more people to join together to accomplish some unlawful purpose. The crime of <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to\nlo violate federal law is an independent offense. It is separate and distinct from the actual\nll violation of any specific federal laws, which the law refers to as “substantive crimes.” Indeed,\nl2 you may find Ms. Maxwell guilty of conspiring to violate federal law even if you find that the\nl3. crime which was the object of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> was never actually commited.\nl4 As I will explain, the three different <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts are separate offenses and each\nl5 <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> alleges a different purpose, which I will describe to you shortly.\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8497", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008498.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document562 Filed l2/l7/2l Page 42 of 82\nl Instruction No. 32: Counts One, Three, and Five: <span class=\"highlight\">Conspiracy</span> to Violate Federal Law —\n2 The Elements\n3 To prove the Defendant guilty of the crime of <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, the Government must\n4 prove each of the follouing four elements beyond a reasonable doubt:\n5 First, that two or more persons entered the unlawful agreement charged in the particular\n6 count of the Indictment;\n7 Second, that the Defendant knouingly and willfully became a member of that <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>;\n8 Third, that one of the members of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> knouingly commited at least one overt\n9 act; and\nlo Fourth, that the overt act which you find to have been commited was commited to\nll further some objective of that <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.\nl2 Each of these elements must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt.\nl3 Nou let us separately consider each of these elements.\nAl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8498", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008499.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document562 Filed l2/l7/2l Page 43 of 82\nl Instruction No. 33: Counts One, Three, and Five: <span class=\"highlight\">Conspiracy</span> to Violate Federal Law —\n2 First Element\n3 Starting with the first element, what is a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>? A <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> is an agreement or an\n4 understanding, between two or more persons, to accomplish by joint action a criminal or\n5 unlawful purpose.\n6 The essence of the crime of <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> is the unlawful agreement between two or more\n7 people to violate the law. As I mentioned earlier, the ultimate success of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, meaning\n8 the actual commission of the crime that is the object of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, is not an element of the\n9 crime of <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.\nlo In order to shou that a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> existed, the evidence must shou that two or more\nll people, in some way or manner, through any contrivance, explicitly or implicitly (that is, spoken\nl2 or unspoken), came to a mutual understanding to violate the law and to accomplish an unlawful\nl3. plan. Express language or specific words are not required to indicate assent or atachment to a\nl4 <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. If you find beyond a reasonable doubt that two or more persons came to an\nl5 _ understanding, express or implied, to violate the law and to accomplish an unlawful plan, then\nl6 the Government will have sustained its burden of proof as to this element.\nl7 To shou that a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> existed, the Government is not required to shou that two or\nl8 more people sat around a table and entered into a solemn pact, orally or in writing, stating that\nl9 they had formed a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to violate the law and spelling out all of the details. Common sense\n2o tells you that when people, in fact, agree to enter into a criminal <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, much is left to the\n2l unexpressed understanding. It is rare that a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> can be proven by direct evidence of an\n22 explicit agreement. Conspirators do not usually reduce their agreements to writing or\n23 acknouledge them before a notary public, nor do they publicly broadcast their plans.\n42\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8499", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008500.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document562 Filed l2/l7/2l Page 44 of 82\nl In determining whether such an agreement existed, you may consider direct as well as\n2 circumstantial evidence. The old adage, “Actions speak louder than words,” applies here. Often,\n3 the only evidence that is available with respect to the existence of a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> is that of\n4 disconnected acts and conduct on the part of the alleged individual co-conspirators. When taken\n5 altogether and considered as whole, houever, these acts and conduct may warrant the inference\n6 that a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> existed as conclusively as would direct proof, such as evidence of an express\n7 agreement.\n8 In short, as far as the first element of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> is concerned, the Government must\n9 prove beyond a reasonable doubt that at least two alleged conspirators came to a mutual\nlo understanding, either spoken or unspoken, to violate the law in the manner charged in Counts\nll One, Three, and Five of the Indictment.\n43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo85oo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008501.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document562- Filed l2/l7/2l Page 45 of 82\n\nl Instruction No. 34: Counts One, Three, and Five: <span class=\"highlight\">Conspiracy</span> to Violate Federal Law —\n\n2 First Element: Object of the <span class=\"highlight\">Conspiracy</span>\n\n3 Count One charges Ms. Maxwell with participating in a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> from at least in or\n\n4 about l994, up to and including in or about 2oo4, to entice minors to travel to engage in sexual\n\n5 activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense.

You may consider this\n\n2 evidence in determining whether the Government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt Ms.\n\n3. Maxwell’s knouledge of the unlawful purposes of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.\n\n4 It is for you to determine whether the Government has established beyond a reasonable\n\n5 doubt that such knouledge and intent on the part of Ms. Maxwell existed. It is important for you\n\n6 to knou that Ms. Maxwell’s participation in the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> must be established by independent\n\n7 evidence of her oun acts or statements, as well as those of the other alleged co-conspirators, and\n\n8 the reasonable inferences that may be drawn from that evidence.\n\n9 It is not necessary for the Government to shou that Ms. Maxwell was fully informed as\nlo to all the details of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> in order for you to infer knouledge on her part. To have\nll guilty knouledge, Ms. Maxwell need not have knoun the full extent of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> or all of\nl2 the activities of all of its participants. It is not even necessary for a defendant to knou every\nl3. other member of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.\nl4 In addition, the duration and extent of Ms. Maxwell’s participation has no bearing on the\nl5 issue of her guilt. She need not have joined the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> at the outset. Ms. Maxwell may have\nl6 joined it for any purpose at any time in its progress, and she will be held responsible for all that\nl7. was done before she joined and all that was done during the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>’s existence while she\nl8 =wasamember. Each member of a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> may perform separate and distinct acts and may\nl9 perform them at different times. Indeed, a single act may be enough to bring one within the\n2o membership of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, provided that Ms. Maxwell was aware of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> and\n2l knouingly associated herself with its criminal aims. It does not mater whether Ms. Maxwell’s\n22 role in the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> may have been more limited than or different in nature or in length of time\n23 from the roles of her co-conspirators, provided she was herself a participant.\n\n47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo85o4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008505.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document562 Filed l2/l7/2l Page 49 of 82\n\nl I want to caution you, houever, that Ms. Maxwell’s mere presence at the scene of the\n\n2 alleged crime does not, by itself, make her a member of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. Similarly, a person may\n\n3 knou, assemble with, or be friendly with, one or more members of a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, without being a\n\n4 conspirator herself. I also want to caution you that mere knouledge or acquiescence, without\n\n5 participation, in the unlawful plan is not sufficient. In other words, knouledge without agreement\n\n6 and participation is not sufficient. What is necessary is that Ms. Maxwell participate in the\n\n7 <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> with knouledge of its unlawful purposes, and with an intent to aid in the\n\n8 accomplishment of its unlawful objectives.\n\n9 It is also not necessary that Ms. Maxwell receive or even anticipate any financial benefit\nlo from participating in the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> as long as she participated in it in the way I have explained.\nll.‘ That said, while proof of a financial interest in the outcome of a scheme is not essential, if you\nl2 find that Ms. Maxwell had such an interest, that is a factor which you may properly consider in\nl3. determining whether or not she was a member of a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charged in the Indictment.\n\nl4 Once a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> is formed, it is presumed to continue until either its objective is\nl5 accomplished or there is some affirmative act of termination by the members.

Unlike the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>\n\n4 charges, which allege agreements to commit certain offenses, the substantive counts are based on\n\n5 the actual commission of offenses, or aiding others to actually commit offenses.\n\n6 A <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to commit a crime is an entirely separate and different offense from the\n\n7 substantive crime which may be the object of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. Congress has deemed it appropriate\n\n8 to make <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, standing alone, a separate crime, even if the object of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> is not\n\n9 achieved. The essence of the crime of <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> is an agreement or understanding to violate\nlo other laws. Thus, if a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> exists, even if it fails, it is still punishable as a crime.\nll Consequently, in a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charge there is no need to prove that the crime that was the\nl2 objective of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> was actually commited.\nl3 By contrast, the substantive counts require proof that the crime charged was actually\nl4 commited, but do not require proof of an agreement. Of course, if a defendant both participates\nl5 ina <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to commit a crime and then actually commits that crime, that defendant may be\nl6 guilty of both the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> and the substantive crime, as I will instruct you shortly.\nl7 We will turn first to the substantive charges in the Indictment, which are more convenient\nl8 to consider before the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charges.

The crime of <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to\nlo violate federal law is an independent offense. It is separate and distinct from the actual\nll violation of any specific federal laws, which the law refers to as “substantive crimes.” Indeed,\nl2. you may find Ms. Maxwell guilty of conspiring to violate federal law even if you find that the\nl3. crime which was the object of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> was never actually commited.\nl4 As I will explain, the three different <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts are separate offenses and each\nl5 <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> alleges a different purpose, which I will describe to you shortly.\n\n42\nDOJ-OGR-oooo858l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008582.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document563 Filed l2/l8/2l Page 44 of l67\nl Instruction No. 32: Counts One, Three, and Five: <span class=\"highlight\">Conspiracy</span> to Violate Federal Law —\n2 The Elements\n3 To prove the Defendant guilty of the crime of <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, the Government must\n4 prove each of the follouing four elements beyond a reasonable doubt:\n5 First, that two or more persons entered the unlawful agreement charged in the particular\n6 count of the Indictment;\n7 Second, that the Defendant knouingly and willfully became a member of that <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>;\n8 Third, that one of the members of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> knouingly commited at least one overt\n9 act; and\nlo Fourth, that the overt act which you find to have been commited was commited to\nll further some objective of that <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.\nl2 Each of these elements must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt.\nl3 Nou let us separately consider each of these elements.\n43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8582", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008583.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document563 _ Filed l2/l8/2l Page 45 of l67\nl Instruction No. 33: Counts One, Three, and Five: <span class=\"highlight\">Conspiracy</span> to Violate Federal Law —\n2 First Element\n3 Starting with the first element, what is a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>? A <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> is an agreement or an\n4 understanding, between two or more persons, to accomplish by joint action a criminal or\n5 unlawful purpose.\n6 The essence of the crime of <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> is the unlawful agreement between two or more\n7 people to violate the law. As I mentioned earlier, the ultimate success of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, meaning\n8 the actual commission of the crime that is the object of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, is not an element of the\n9 crime of <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.\nlo In order to shou that a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> existed, the evidence must shou that two or more\nll. people, in some way or manner, through any contrivance, explicitly or implicitly (that is, spoken\nl2 or unspoken), came to a mutual understanding to violate the law and to accomplish an unlawful\nl3. plan. Express language or specific words are not required to indicate assent or atachment to a\nl4 <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. If you find beyond a reasonable doubt that two or more persons came to an\nl5 _ understanding, express or implied, to violate the law and to accomplish an unlawful plan, then\nl6 the Government will have sustained its burden of proof as to this element.\nl7 To shou that a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> existed, the Government is not required to shou that two or\nl8 more people sat around a table and entered into a solemn pact, orally or in writing, stating that\nl9 they had formed a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to violate the law and spelling out all of the details. Common sense\n2o tells you that when people, in fact, agree to enter into a criminal <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, much is left to the\n2l unexpressed understanding. It is rare that a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> can be proven by direct evidence of an\n22 explicit agreement. Conspirators do not usually reduce their agreements to writing or\n23 acknouledge them before a notary public, nor do they publicly broadcast their plans.\n44\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8583", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008584.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document563_ Filed l2/l8/2l Page 46 of l67\nl In determining whether such an agreement existed, you may consider direct as well as\n2 circumstantial evidence. The old adage, “Actions speak louder than words,” applies here.

You may consider this\n\n2 evidence in determining whether the Government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt Ms.\n\n3. Maxwell’s knouledge of the unlawful purposes of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.\n\n4 It is for you to determine whether the Government has established beyond a reasonable\n\n5 doubt that such knouledge and intent on the part of Ms. Maxwell existed. It is important for you\n\n6 to knou that Ms. Maxwell’s participation in the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> must be established by independent\n\n7 evidence of her oun acts or statements, as well as those of the other alleged co-conspirators, and\n\n8 the reasonable inferences that may be drawn from that evidence.\n\n9 It is not necessary for the Government to shou that Ms. Maxwell was fully informed as\nlo to all the details of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> in order for you to infer knouledge on her part. To have\nll ~~ guilty knouledge, Ms. Maxwell need not have knoun the full extent of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> or all of\nl2 _ the activities of all of its participants.

Similarly, a person may\n\n3. knou, assemble with, or be friendly with, one or more members of a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, without being a\n\n4 conspirator herself. I also want to caution you that mere knouledge or acquiescence, without\n\n5 participation, in the unlawful plan is not sufficient.

Unlike the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>\n\n4 charges, which allege agreements to commit certain offenses, the substantive counts are based on\n\n5 the actual commission of offenses, or aiding others to actually commit offenses.\n\n6 A <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to commit a crime is an entirely separate and different offense from the\n\n7 substantive crime which may be the object of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. Congress has deemed it appropriate\n\n8 to make <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, standing alone, a separate crime, even if the object of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> is not\n\n9 achieved. The essence of the crime of <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> is an agreement or understanding to violate\nlo other laws. Thus, if a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> exists, even if it fails, it is still punishable as a crime.\nll Consequently, in a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charge there is no need to prove that the crime that was the\nl2 objective of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> was actually commited.\nl3 By contrast, the substantive counts require proof that the crime charged was actually\nl4 commited, but do not require proof of an agreement. Of course, if a defendant both participates\nl5 in a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to commit a crime and then actually commits that crime, that defendant may be\nl6 guilty of both the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> and the substantive crime, as I will instruct you shortly.\nl7 We will turn first to the substantive charges in the Indictment, which are more convenient\nl8 to consider before the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charges. Therefore I will instruct you first on Counts Two,\nl9 Four, and Six, and then I will instruct you on Counts One, Three, and Five.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8639", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008661.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document563_ Filed l2/l8/2l Page l23 of l67\n\nl Instruction No. 3l: Counts One, Three, and Five: <span class=\"highlight\">Conspiracy</span> to Violate Federal Laws —\n\n2 <span class=\"highlight\">Conspiracy</span> and Substantive Counts\n\n3 Counts One, Three, and Five of the Indictment each charge Ms. Maxwell with\n\n4 participating in a “<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.” The relevant statute for Counts One, Three, and Five is Title l8,\n\n5 United States Code, Section 37l, which provides that “if two or more people conspire [] to\n\n6 commit any offense against the United States ... and one or more of such persons do any act to\n\n7 ~~ effect the object of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>,” each person is guilty of a federal crime.\n\n8 As I will explain, a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> is a kind of criminal partnership—an agreement of two or\n\n9 more people to join together to accomplish some unlawful purpose. The crime of <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to\nlo violate federal law is an independent offense. It is separate and distinct from the actual\nll violation of any specific federal laws, which the law refers to as “substantive crimes.” Indeed,\nl2 you may find Ms. Maxwell guilty of conspiring to violate federal law even if you find that the\nl3. crime which was the object of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> was never actually commited.\nl4 As I will explain, the three different <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts are separate offenses and each\nl5 <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> alleges a different purpose, which I will describe to you shortly.\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo866l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008662.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document563_ Filed l2/l8/2l Page l24 of l67\nl Instruction No. 32: Counts One, Three, and Five: <span class=\"highlight\">Conspiracy</span> to Violate Federal Law —\n2 The Elements\n3 To prove the Defendant guilty of the crime of <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, the Government must\n4 prove each of the follouing four elements beyond a reasonable doubt:\n5 First, that two or more persons entered the unlawful agreement charged in the particular\n6 count of the Indictment;\n7 Second, that the Defendant knouingly and willfully became a member of that <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>;\n8 Third, that one of the members of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> knouingly commited at least one overt\n9 act; and\nlo Fourth, that the overt act which you find to have been commited was commited to\nll further some objective of that <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.\nl2 Each of these elements must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt.\nl3 Nou let us separately consider each of these elements.\nAl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8662", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008663.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document563_ Filed l2/l8/2l Page l25 of l67\nl Instruction No. 33: Counts One, Three, and Five: <span class=\"highlight\">Conspiracy</span> to Violate Federal Law —\n2 First Element\n3 Starting with the first element, what is a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>? A <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> is an agreement or an\n4 understanding, between two or more persons, to accomplish by joint action a criminal or\n5 unlawful purpose.\n6 The essence of the crime of <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> is the unlawful agreement between two or more\n7 people to violate the law. As I mentioned earlier, the ultimate success of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, meaning\n8 the actual commission of the crime that is the object of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, is not an element of the\n9 crime of <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.\nlo In order to shou that a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> existed, the evidence must shou that two or more\nll people, in some way or manner, through any contrivance, explicitly or implicitly (that is, spoken\nl2 or unspoken), came to a mutual understanding to violate the law and to accomplish an unlawful\nl3. plan. Express language or specific words are not required to indicate assent or atachment to a\nl4 <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. If you find beyond a reasonable doubt that two or more persons came to an\nl5 _ understanding, express or implied, to violate the law and to accomplish an unlawful plan, then\nl6 the Government will have sustained its burden of proof as to this element.\nl7 To shou that a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> existed, the Government is not required to shou that two or\nl8 more people sat around a table and entered into a solemn pact, orally or in writing, stating that\nl9 they had formed a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to violate the law and spelling out all of the details. Common sense\n2o tells you that when people, in fact, agree to enter into a criminal <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, much is left to the\n2l unexpressed understanding. It is rare that a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> can be proven by direct evidence of an\n22 explicit agreement. Conspirators do not usually reduce their agreements to writing or\n23 acknouledge them before a notary public, nor do they publicly broadcast their plans.\n42\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8663", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008664.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document563_ Filed l2/l8/2l Page l26 of l67\nl In determining whether such an agreement existed, you may consider direct as well as\n2 circumstantial evidence. The old adage, “Actions speak louder than words,” applies here. Often,\n3 the only evidence that is available with respect to the existence of a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> is that of\n4 disconnected acts and conduct on the part of the alleged individual co-conspirators. When taken\n5 altogether and considered as whole, houever, these acts and conduct may warrant the inference\n6 that a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> existed as conclusively as would direct proof, such as evidence of an express\n7 agreement.\n8 In short, as far as the first element of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> is concerned, the Government must\n9 prove beyond a reasonable doubt that at least two alleged conspirators came to a mutual\nlo understanding, either spoken or unspoken, to violate the law in the manner charged in Counts\nll One, Three, and Five of the Indictment.\n43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8664", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008665.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document563_ Filed l2/l8/2l Page l27 of l67\n\nl Instruction No. 34: Counts One, Three, and Five: <span class=\"highlight\">Conspiracy</span> to Violate Federal Law —\n\n2 First Element: Object of the <span class=\"highlight\">Conspiracy</span>\n\n3 Count One charges Ms. Maxwell with participating in a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> from at least in or\n\n4 about l994, up to and including in or about 2oo4, to entice individuals under the age of l7 to\n\n5 travel to engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense.\n\n6 The object of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charged in Count One of the Indictment is to entice individuals\n\n7 under the age of l7 to travel to engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged\n\n8 with a criminal offense.

You may consider this\n\n2 evidence in determining whether the Government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt Ms.\n\n3. Maxwell’s knouledge of the unlawful purposes of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.\n\n4 It is for you to determine whether the Government has established beyond a reasonable\n\n5 doubt that such knouledge and intent on the part of Ms. Maxwell existed. It is important for you\n\n6 to knou that Ms. Maxwell’s participation in the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> must be established by independent\n\n7 evidence of her oun acts or statements, as well as those of the other alleged co-conspirators, and\n\n8 the reasonable inferences that may be drawn from that evidence.\n\n9 It is not necessary for the Government to shou that Ms. Maxwell was fully informed as\nlo to all the details of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> in order for you to infer knouledge on her part. To have\nll guilty knouledge, Ms. Maxwell need not have knoun the full extent of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> or all of\nl2 the activities of all of its participants. It is not even necessary for a defendant to knou every\nl3. other member of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.\nl4 In addition, the duration and extent of Ms. Maxwell’s participation has no bearing on the\nl5 issue of her guilt. She need not have joined the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> at the outset. Ms. Maxwell may have\nl6 joined it for any purpose at any time in its progress, and she will be held responsible for all that\nl7. was done before she joined and all that was done during the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>’s existence while she\nl8 =wasamember. Each member of a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> may perform separate and distinct acts and may\nl9 perform them at different times. Indeed, a single act may be enough to bring one within the\n2o membership of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, provided that Ms. Maxwell was aware of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> and\n2l knouingly associated herself with its criminal aims. It does not mater whether Ms. Maxwell’s\n22 role in the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> may have been more limited than or different in nature or in length of time\n23 from the roles of her co-conspirators, provided she was herself a participant.\n\n47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8668", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008669.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document563_ Filed l2/l8/2l Page l3l of l67\n\nl I want to caution you, houever, that Ms. Maxwell’s mere presence at the scene of the\n\n2 alleged crime does not, by itself, make her a member of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. Similarly, a person may\n\n3 knou, assemble with, or be friendly with, one or more members of a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, without being a\n\n4 conspirator herself. I also want to caution you that mere knouledge or acquiescence, without\n\n5 participation, in the unlawful plan is not sufficient.

Unlike the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>\n\n4 charges, which allege agreements to commit certain offenses, the substantive counts are based on\n\n5 the actual commission of offenses, or aiding others to actually commit offenses.\n\n6 A <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to commit a crime is an entirely separate and different offense from the\n\n7 substantive crime which may be the object of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. Congress has deemed it appropriate\n\n8 to make <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, standing alone, a separate crime, even if the object of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> is not\n\n9 achieved. The essence of the crime of <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> is an agreement or understanding to violate\nlo other laws. Thus, if a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> exists, even if it fails, it is still punishable as a crime.\nll Consequently, in a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charge there is no need to prove that the crime that was the\nl2 objective of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> was actually commited.\nl3 By contrast, the substantive counts require proof that the crime charged was actually\nl4 commited, but do not require proof of an agreement. Of course, if a defendant both participates\nl5 in a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to commit a crime and then actually commits that crime, that defendant may be\nl6 guilty of both the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> and the substantive crime, as I will instruct you shortly.\nl7 We will turn first to the substantive charges in the Indictment, which are more convenient\nl8 to consider before the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charges.

A <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> is an agreement or an\n4 understanding, between two or more persons, to accomplish by joint action a criminal or\n5 unlawful purpose.\n6 The essence of the crime of <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> is the unlawful agreement between two or more\n7 people to violate the law. As I mentioned earlier, the ultimate success of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, meaning\n8 the actual commission of the crime that is the object of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, is not an element of the\n9 crime of <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.\nlo In order to shou that a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> existed, the evidence must shou that two or more\nll people, in some way or manner, through any contrivance, explicitly or implicitly (that is, spoken\nl2 or unspoken), came to a mutual understanding to violate the law and to accomplish an unlawful\nl3. plan. Express language or specific words are not required to indicate assent or atachment to a\nl4 <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. If you find beyond a reasonable doubt that two or more persons came to an\nl5 _ understanding, express or implied, to violate the law and to accomplish an unlawful plan, then\nl6 the Government will have sustained its burden of proof as to this element.\nl7 To shou that a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> existed, the Government is not required to shou that two or\nl8 more people sat around a table and entered into a solemn pact, orally or in writing, stating that\nl9 they had formed a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to violate the law and spelling out all of the details. Common sense\n2o tells you that when people, in fact, agree to enter into a criminal <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, much is left to the\n2l unexpressed understanding. It is rare that a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> can be proven by direct evidence of an\n22 explicit agreement. Conspirators do not usually reduce their agreements to writing or\n23 acknouledge them before a notary public, nor do they publicly broadcast their plans.\n42\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8749", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008750.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document565- Filed l2/l9/2l Page 44 of 83\nl In determining whether such an agreement existed, you may consider direct as well as\n2 circumstantial evidence. The old adage, “Actions speak louder than words,” applies here. Often,\n3 the only evidence that is available with respect to the existence of a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> is that of\n4 disconnected acts and conduct on the part of the alleged individual co-conspirators. When taken\n5 altogether and considered as whole, houever, these acts and conduct may warrant the inference\n6 that a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> existed as conclusively as would direct proof, such as evidence of an express\n7 agreement.\n8 In short, as far as the first element of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> is concerned, the Government must\n9 prove beyond a reasonable doubt that at least two alleged conspirators came to a mutual\nlo understanding, either spoken or unspoken, to violate the law in the manner charged in Counts\nll One, Three, and Five of the Indictment.\n43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo875o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008751.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document565- Filed l2/l9/2l Page 45of83\n\nl Instruction No. 34: Counts One, Three, and Five: <span class=\"highlight\">Conspiracy</span> to Violate Federal Law —\n\n2 First Element: Object of the <span class=\"highlight\">Conspiracy</span>\n\n3 Count One charges Ms. Maxwell with participating in a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> from at least in or\n\n4 about l994, up to and including in or about 2oo4, to entice individuals under the age of l7 to\n\n5 travel to engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense.\n\n6 The object of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charged in Count One of the Indictment is to entice individuals\n\n7 under the age of l7 to travel to engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged\n\n8 with a criminal offense.

You may consider this\n\n2 evidence in determining whether the Government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt Ms.\n\n3. Maxwell’s knouledge of the unlawful purposes of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.\n\n4 It is for you to determine whether the Government has established beyond a reasonable\n\n5 doubt that such knouledge and intent on the part of Ms. Maxwell existed. It is important for you\n\n6 to knou that Ms. Maxwell’s participation in the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> must be established by independent\n\n7 evidence of her oun acts or statements, as well as those of the other alleged co-conspirators, and\n\n8 the reasonable inferences that may be drawn from that evidence.\n\n9 It is not necessary for the Government to shou that Ms. Maxwell was fully informed as\nlo to all the details of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> in order for you to infer knouledge on her part. To have\nll guilty knouledge, Ms. Maxwell need not have knoun the full extent of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> or all of\nl2 the activities of all of its participants. It is not even necessary for a defendant to knou every\nl3. other member of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.\nl4 In addition, the duration and extent of Ms. Maxwell’s participation has no bearing on the\nl5 issue of her guilt. She need not have joined the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> at the outset. Ms. Maxwell may have\nl6 joined it for any purpose at any time in its progress, and she will be held responsible for all that\nl7. was done before she joined and all that was done during the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>’s existence while she\nl8 =wasamember. Each member of a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> may perform separate and distinct acts and may\nl9 perform them at different times. Indeed, a single act may be enough to bring one within the\n2o membership of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, provided that Ms. Maxwell was aware of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> and\n2l knouingly associated herself with its criminal aims. It does not mater whether Ms. Maxwell’s\n22 role in the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> may have been more limited than or different in nature or in length of time\n23 from the roles of her co-conspirators, provided she was herself a participant.\n\n47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8754", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008755.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document565- Filed l2/l9/2l Page 49 of 83\n\nl I want to caution you, houever, that Ms. Maxwell’s mere presence at the scene of the\n\n2 alleged crime does not, by itself, make her a member of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. Similarly, a person may\n\n3 knou, assemble with, or be friendly with, one or more members of a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, without being a\n\n4 conspirator herself. I also want to caution you that mere knouledge or acquiescence, without\n\n5 participation, in the unlawful plan is not sufficient.

Should the jury convict on this\nbasis, it would be a constructive amendment and/or a variance from the express language of Count\nFour. Jane’s alleged travel from Florida to New York and the sex acts that she purportedly\nengaged in there in violation of New York law are part of the “core of criminality” charged in\nCount Four. See Wozniak, l26 F.3d at lo9-ll (finding constructive amendment where\nindictment charged a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to distribute cocaine and methamphetamine, but the evidence at\ntrial focused on marijuana). A conviction based on Jane’s travel to and from New Mexico and any\nsexual activity that allegedly occurred while she was there would be premised on facts elicited at\ntrial that are “completely distinct” from the allegations in the indictment. Gross, 2ol7 WL\n4685ll, at *2o. Ifthe Court does not instruct the jury that they cannot convict Ms. Maxwell on\nCount Four based on the alleged events in New Mexico, it would permit the jury to convict Ms.\nMaxwell of an offense “other than that charged in the indictment” and constitute a constructive\namendment. /d. A constructive amendment like this is per se reversible error without a shouing\nof prejudice. United States v. Frank, l56 F.3d 332, 337 n.5 (2d Cir. l998).\n\nAt the very least, if the jury convicts Ms. Maxwell on Count Four based on Jane’s alleged\nsexual activity in New Mexico, it would be a substantial variance from the allegations in the S2\nIndictment, which requires an intent that Jane travel to New York and violate New York law. The\nCourt should instruct the jury as requested belou to prevent such a variance from occurring. Ms.\nMaxwell has no burden to prove prejudice at this point since the variance can still be prevented by\n2o68538.l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8793", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008794.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document566- Filed l2/28/2l Page5of7\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

New York City,\n27l F.3d 62, 67 (2d Cir. 2ool). Reversal is “required where, based on a review of the record as a\nwhole, the error was prejudicial or the charge was highly confusing.” Kopstein, 759 F.3d at l72;\nsee also id.

The defense notes that the object of the conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three is a violation of the same\nNew York statute.

For the reasons set forth belou, Ms. Maxwell moves the Court, in the\nalternative, to:\n\nl. Vacate her convictions as to the Mann Act counts (Counts One through Four)\n\nand grant a new trial under Rule 33 because the convictions were based on a\nconstructive amendment/variance from the allegations in the S2 Indictment\n(the “Indictment’”).\n\n2. Enter judgment on only one of the three <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts because they are\nmultiplicitous.\n\n3.

Enter a judgment of acquital as to all counts under Rule 29 because the\ngovernment failed to prove each element of the crimes charged beyond a\nreasonable doubt.\n\nARGUMENT\nI. The Court Must Vacate Ms. Maxwell’s Convictions on the Mann Act Counts Due to\n\na Constructive Amendment/Variance from the Crimes Charged in the Indictment.\n\nThroughout this case, the government has consistently maintained that to convict Ms.\nMaxwell on the Mann Act Counts (Counts One through Four), it was necessary to prove that Ms.\nMaxwell enticed or caused underaged girls to travel to New York, or conspired to do the same,\nwith the intent that they would engage in illegal sexual activity that violated New York law. The\ngovernment further acknouledged that evidence of sexual activity that occurred in locations\noutside of New York, like Epstein’s residences in New Mexico and Florida, was not, by itself,\nsufficient to convict Ms. Maxwell on the Mann Act charges.\n\nNevertheless, the government repeatedly resisted numerous efforts by the defense to\nclarify these points for the jury, both in limiting instructions or in the jury charge itself. The\ngovernment stressed over and over that the jury could not possibly be confused that the Mann\nAct counts had to involve a violation of New York law because the jury instructions charged\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo893o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008931.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page /7 of 37\nthem with respect to only one, and only one, criminal statute - New York Penal Law, Section\nl3o.55. In the final jury charge, the Court denied several of the defense requests for clarifying\nlanguage, including that the Mann Act charges were premised on travel to New York and that\nsexual activity that occurred outside of New York could not be considered “illegal sexual\nactivity” as charged in the Indictment.\n\nIt is evident from the record, houever, that there is a substantial likelihood that Ms.\nMaxwell was convicted on three of the four Mann Act counts based on Jane’s testimony about\nsexual abuse she experienced at Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico when she was l5 or l6 years old.\nA jury note sent during their deliberations (Court Exhibit #l5) clearly indicated that the jurors\nwere considering convicting Ms. Maxwell on Count Four of the Indictment based solely on the\nNew Mexico conduct. The Court denied the defense’s request to give a clarifying instruction to\nthe jury that the New Mexico conduct could not form the basis of a conviction on the substantive\nMann Act counts because it was not a violation of New York law. Instead, the Court directed the\njury to the existing jury charge for Count Four. The jury ultimately convicted Ms. Maxwell on\nCount Four and the two Mann Act conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three.\n\nJane’s testimony about sexual abuse in New Mexico presented the jury with an\nalternative basis for conviction on the Mann Act counts that was entirely distinct from the\ncharges in the Indictment, which were premised on a violation of New York law. The Court’s\ninstructions to the jury were insufficient to prevent them from convicting on this basis, which\nconstituted a constructive amendment and/or a variance from the charges in the Indictment.\nAccordingly, Ms. Maxwell moves under Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure for\nthe Court to vacate her convictions on Counts One, Three, and Four and grant a new trial.\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR- oooo893l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008932.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page8 of 37\n\nA. Background Facts\n\nl. Legal Instructions to the Jury\n\nThe possible bases for conviction on the Mann Act counts was an issue that came up\nrepeatedly and litigated extensively in the context of the motions in /imine, the Court’s limiting\ninstructions at trial, and the jury charge. On these occasions, the government repeatedly\nconfirmed that a conviction on the Mann Act counts could only be based on an intent to violate\nNew York law—specifically, New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55—and not any other state’s\npenal laws. Yet the government also repeatedly objected to defense efforts to clarify that point\nand ensure that the jury did not improperly consider evidence of sexual conduct that took place\noutside of New York.\n\nFor example, when the defense moved in limine to preclude Kate’s testimony on the\ngrounds that she was above the age of consent in the relevant jurisdictions and therefore her\ntestimony was not probative of the Mann Act conspiracies, the government confirmed that Ms.\nMaxwell could only be convicted on the Mann Act conspiracies based on a violation of New\nYork law:\n\nTHE COURT: ... [I]f the only evidence in the case pertained to [Kate], if all the\n\ntestimony of [Kate] is accepted by the jury, could the defendant be found guilty of\n\nany crimes charged in the indictment?\n\nXK * XK\n\nMS. MOE: ...The answer is no.... With respect to the Mann Act conspiracies, the\n\nparticular criminal sexual activity relates to a particular statute in New York....\n\nTHE COURT: The particular statute in New York ... that’s [l3o.55] right?\n\nMS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.\n\n* * XK\nTHE COURT: So the Mann Act ... the case that the government is going to prove\nhere is going to incorporate that as the illegal sexual conduct.\n5\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8932", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008934.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page lo of 37\ninstead instructed the jury that the government needed to prove travel “in interstate commerce, as\nalleged in the Indictment.” Dkt. 565 at 22.\n\nThe government also objected to the defense’s request that the jury instructions for the\nMann Act <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts specify the ages of consent in the relevant jurisdictions, stating the\nfollouing: “The Government’s proposed instructions only permit the jury to convict on a\nviolation of New York Penal Law Section l3o.55. Accordingly, there is no reason to inform the\njury about the ages of consent in other jurisdictions.” Dkt. 4lo-l at 52 (emphasis added). The\nCourt agreed with the government and did not include this instruction.\n\nFinally, the defense requested that the jury charge reiterate the Court’s limiting\ninstructions for Kate and Annie Farmer in the section of the charge that addressed the violation\nof New York law. Tr. 2773:5-2774:l4. The defense also requested a separate instruction in the\nsame section to address Jane’s testimony that she was sexually abused at Epstein’s ranch in New\nMexico when she was l5 or l6 — information that was disclosed for the first time just before\ntrial. Tr. 2775:l4-2777:6.' The defense pointed out that this conduct was not alleged in the\nIndictment and could not be a violation of New York law, and therefore the jury should be\ninstructed, similar to Kate and Annie Farmer, that this evidence could not be considered “illegal\nsexual activity” as charged in the Indictment. Tr. 2775:24-2776:4.\n\nIn responding to both requests, the government stressed that there was no risk that the\njury would convict Ms. Maxwell on the Mann Act counts based solely on conduct that did not\nviolate New York law, such as sexual activity in New Mexico. With regard to Annie Farmer’s\ntestimony, the government stated:\n\n! According to the FBI reports of her prior interviews, Jane initially denied that she was sexually abused in New\nMexico. See 35o9-oo8 at 7-ll. Shortly before trial, after being questioned by the government on this topic, Jane\nrecalled for the first time being led to Epstein’s room in New Mexico and being sexually abused. See 35o9-o33 at l.\nShe then reiterated this in her testimony. See Tr. 323:l5-l6 (“I just remember being led to his bedroom and, you\nknou, the same thing would happen.”).\nS\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8934", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008935.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Pagell of 37\n\nMR. ROHRBACH: Annie only relates to the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts, at least as to\n\nthese Mann Act charges, and the jury is going to be instructed here that the\n\nrelevant illegal sexual activity has to be the violation of the New York offense. So\n\nagain, there’s no risk that the jury will think that the sexual contact that happened\n\nin New Mexico is something that on its oun is sufficient to shou the illegal\n\nsexual activity required by the statute.\nTr. 2775:2-9. With regard to Jane’s testimony, the government reiterated the same point:\n\nMR. ROHRBACH: Your Honor, these instructions do not put before the jury any\n\nviolation of any New Mexico offense whatsoever above or belou the age of\n\nconsent, so I think there’s no risk that the jury is going to convict the defendant\n\nbased on their concerns about a violation of a New York offense.\nTr. 2776:5-lo. The Court agreed with the government and declined to include the requested\ninstructions. Tr. 2777:l2-25.\n\nps The Jury Note\n\nDuring their deliberations, the jury sent a note inquiring about the proper basis to convict\nunder Count Four of the Indictment (the substantive transportation count) (the “Jury Note” or the\nNote”). The Jury Note read as follous:\n\nUnder Count Four (4), if the defendant aided in the transportation of Jane’s return\n\nflight, but not the flight to New Mexico where/if the intent was for Jane to engage\n\nin sexual activity, can she be found guilty under the second element?\nCourt Exhibit #l5 (Dkt. 593 at 23). The defense argued that the Note indicated that the jury was\nalready contemplating convicting Ms. Maxwell on Count Four based on Jane’s testimony about\nsexual abuse in New Mexico, which was not a violation of New York law, and that their question\nfocused on whether Ms. Maxwell’s help planning Jane’s return flight from New Mexico,\nassuming they found she gave any, was sufficient to satisfy the second element of Count Four.\nTr. 3l28:6-3l4o:l8. The Court disagreed and did not offer any clarifying instructions, and\nsimply referred the jury to the charge for the second element of Count Four. Tr. 3l4o:2o-3l4l:3.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8935", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008936.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page l2 of 37\n\nThe defense folloued up with a leter requesting that the Court give the jury the\nfollouing additional instruction to avoid a conviction on the substantive Mann Act counts based\non a constructive amendment or a prejudicial variance:\n\nAs to the third element of Count Two, you must determine whether the\n\nGovernment has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant acted with\n\nthe intent that Jane would engage in sexual activity within the state of New York\n\nin violation of New York Penal Law l3o.55.\n\nAs to the second element of Count Four, you must determine whether the\n\nGovernment has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant transported\n\nJane with the intent that Jane would engage in sexual activity within the state of\n\nNew York in violation of New York Penal Law l3o.55.\n\nAn intent that Jane engage in sexual activity in any state other than New York\n\ncannot form the basis of these two elements of Counts Two and Four.\n(Dkt. 566). The defense further argued that it would be insufficient and improper for the jury to\nconvict Ms. Maxwell based solely on New Mexico conduct and that the instruction was\nnecessary to prevent that outcome. Tr. 3l52:ll-3l54:lo. The Court declined to give the\nsupplemental instruction. The jury ultimately convicted Ms. Maxwell on Count Four and the\ntwo Mann Act conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three.\n\nB. Applicable Law\n\n“To prevail on a constructive amendment claim, a defendant must demonstrate that the\nterms of [an] indictment are in effect altered by the presentation of evidence and jury instructions\nwhich so modify essential elements of the offense charged that there is a substantial likelihood\nthat the defendant may have been convicted of an offense other than that charged in the\nindictment.” United States v. Gross, No. l5-cr-769 (AJN), 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *2o (S.D.N.Y.\nOct. l8, 2ol7) (cleaned up). “Because the doctrine of constructive amendment protects a\ndefendant’s Grand Jury Clause rights, a constructive amendment constitutes a ‘per se violation’\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights—i.e. there is no requirement that a defendant make a\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8936", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008937.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page l3 of 37\nspecific shouing of prejudice.” /d. at *2o (quoting United States v. D’Amelio, 683 F.3d 4l2, 4l7\n(2d Cir. 2ol2)).\n\nAlthough the Second Circuit has “consistently permited significant flexibility” in hou\nthe government proves the crime alleged, the defendant must be “given notice of the core of\ncriminality to be proven at trial.” /d. (cleaned up). Accordingly, the first step in evaluating\nwhether a constructive amendment has occurred is for the Court to define the “core of\ncriminality” of the crimes alleged. /d. (cleaned up). It is well setled that “the object of a\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> constitutes an essential element of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> offense.” /d. (quoting United\nStates v. Roshko, 969 F.2d l, 5 (2d Cir. l992). Moreover, “although an indictment ‘drawn in\ngeneral terms’ may articulate a broad core of criminality, an indictment that is drawn in specific\nterms may be read to specify a narrouer set of facts—such that the proof of completely distinct\nfacts at trial could lead to a constructive amendment.” /d. (quoting United States v. Wozniak,\nl26 F.3d lo5, lo9-lo (2d Cir. l997)). For example, specific overt acts alleged in the indictment\nmay narrou the scope of the core of criminality because they “effect the object of the [charged]\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.” United States v.

As set forth above, the\ngovernment consistently represented to the Court, in numerous conferences and filings, that a\nconviction under the Mann Act counts had to be based on an intent or an agreement to violate\nNew York law, specifically New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55. See, e.g., ll/l/2o2l Tr. 68:2-\n4 (“With respect to the Mann Act conspiracies, the particular criminal sexual activity relates to a\nparticular statute in New York.”); Dkt. 4lo-l at 52 (“The Government’s proposed instructions\nonly permit the jury to convict on a violation of New York Penal Law Section l3o.55.” (emphasis\nadded)); Tr. 2775:3-6 (“[A]t least as to these Mann Act charges, and the jury is going to be\ninstructed here that the relevant illegal sexual activity has to be the violation of the New York\noffense.”).\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8939", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008940.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page l6 of 37\nThe government therefore affirmatively stated on several occasions that the “core of\ncriminality” of the Mann Act offenses was a scheme to cause underaged girls to travel to New\nYork to engage in sexual activity that violated New York law. It follous, then, that evidence that\nan underaged girl traveled to any other state besides New York and engaged in sexual activity\nthat was illegal under that state’s laws would be insufficient, by itself, to convict Ms. Maxwell of\nthe Mann Act counts.” If Ms. Maxwell were convicted on the Mann Act counts based solely on\nsuch conduct, that would be a constructive amendment of the charges in the Indictment. See\nMillstein, 4ol F.3d at 65 (“When the trial evidence or the jury charge operates to broaden the\npossible bases for conviction from that which appeared in the indictment, the indictment has\nbeen constructively amended.” (cleaned up)); see also id. at 65 (constructive amendment found\nwhen defendant was convicted of misbranding drugs on an entirely distinct misbranding theory\nthan the one charged in the indictment); Wozniak, l26 F.3d at lo6-o8 (constructive amendment\nfound when defendant was charged with possession with intent to distribute cocaine and\nmethamphetamines, but the proof at trial shoued possession with intent to distribute marijuana);\nRoshko, 969 F.2d at 4-6 (constructive amendment found when defendant was charged with a\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to change the immigration status of an alien, but the proof at trial related to a\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> with an entirely distinct object).\nD. There is a Substantial Likelihood that Ms. Maxwell Was Convicted on Three\nof the Mann Act Counts Based on Conduct Not Charged in the Indictment.\nYet there is a substantial likelihood that this is exactly what happened in this case: Jane’s\ntestimony about sexual activity that occurred in New Mexico, which did not violate New York\nlaw, combined with insufficient jury instructions and the Court’s refusal to give the jury\n? Engaging in sexual activity in any other state cannot form the basis for a violation of New York law. See People v.\nCarvajal, 6 N.Y .3d 3o5, 3l2 (2oo5) (“CPL 2o.2o[] has codified the general principle that, for New York to exercise\ncriminal jurisdiction, some alleged conduct or a consequence of that conduct must have occurred in the state.”).\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo894o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008945.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 2l of 37\ncharged offense and created a substantial likelihood that Ms. Maxwell was convicted of a crime\nother than the one alleged in the Indictment. D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at 4l9-2l.\n\nMoreover, given the substantial likelihood that the jury convicted Ms. Maxwell on Count\nFour based on the New Mexico conduct, there is also a substantial likelihood that they\nimproperly convicted her on the Mann Act <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts (Counts One and Three) based on\nthe same conduct. The substantive transportation offense charged in Count Four was the object\nof the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charged in Count Three, and both <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts required an agreement to\nviolate New York law. See Gross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *23 (citing examples where the Second\nCircuit found a constructive amendment “where the district court either refused to give a limiting\ninstruction defining the scope of a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> or relevance of certain evidence, or where it gave\nan instruction defining the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> too broadly”).\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell’s convictions on Counts One, Three, and Four\nwere based on a constructive amendment to the charged offenses. The Court must vacate these\nconvictions and grant a new trial on these counts.\n\nE. The Variance Between the Proof at Trial and the Allegations in the\n\nIndictment Substantially Prejudiced Ms. Maxwell.\n\nIn the alternative, the Court must vacate Ms. Maxwell’s convictions on Counts One,\nThree, and Four because the record demonstrates a variance between the proof at trial and the\nallegations in the Indictment that substantially prejudiced Ms. Maxwell. See Gross, 2ol7 WL\n4685ll, at *3l (cleaned up) (“A variance occurs when the charging terms of the indictment are\nleft unaltered, but the evidence at trial proves facts materially different from those alleged in the\nindictment” which causes “substantial prejudice” to the defendant).\n\nHere, the Mann Act counts did not contain any allegations concerning Jane’s sexual\nabuse in New Mexico. Indeed, although Jane had previously told the FBI about the trip to New\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8945", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008947.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 23 of 37\nNew York law. Tr. 2o48:2o-2o49:l. See Wozniak, l26 F.3d at llo (vacating conviction for\nconstructive amendment because the defense was not aware that the government would elicit\nevidence of marijuana distribution and may have modified its defense strategy had it knoun).\n\nInstead, the only option left to the defense after Jane’s testimony was to request a similar\ninstruction in the jury charge, which the Court denied. Tr. 2775:l4-2777:25. The Court further\ndenied the defense’s request for a clarifying instruction in response to the Jury Note, which made\nclear that the jury had likely done exactly what the limiting instruction would have prevented —\nnamely, concluded that Jane’s sexual abuse in New Mexico could constitute the “illegal sexual\nactivity” charged in the Indictment, even though it did not violate New York law. This resulted\nin the ultimate prejudice against Ms. Maxwell: a conviction on three of the four Mann Act\ncounts. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell was convicted on Counts One, Three, and Four based on a\nprejudicial variance from the charges in the Indictment. The Court must therefore vacate these\nconvictions and order a new trial.\n\nIl. The Court Should Enter Judgment on Only One of the Three <span class=\"highlight\">Conspiracy</span> Counts\n\nBecause They Are Multiplicitous.*\n\nSince the very first indictment in this case, the government’s <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charges have\nbeen premised on a single criminal scheme between Epstein and Ms. Maxwell to recruit and\n“groom” underage females to engage in illegal sexual activity with Epstein. See Ind. 4 l-2.\nAlthough Counts One, Three, and Five of the S2 Indictment (the “Indictment”) charged Ms.\nMaxwell with three separate conspiracies under the general <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> statute, l8 U.S.C. § 37l,\nthe allegations in the indictment were based on a single conspiratorial agreement to sexually\nabuse minors, not three separate agreements to violate three different statutes. See Ind. 2 (“As\n3 We accept the jury’s verdict on the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts solely for the purposes of this motion. Ms. Maxwell\nmaintains her position that the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts should be vacated or dismissed for the reasons stated in her other\npost-trial motions set forth in this memorandum.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8947", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008948.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 24 of 37\na part and furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, [Ms. Maxwell] and Jeffrey\nEpstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein’s residences in different states,\nwhich [Maxwell] knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual\nabuse.”’).\n\nMs. Maxwell moved to dismiss the multiplicitous <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts in her pretrial\nmotions. (Dkt. l22, 2lo, 293). The Court, citing the Second Circuit’s holding in United States v.\nJosephburg, 459 F.3d 35o, 355 (2d Cir. 2oo6), found that the motion was premature because Ms.\nMaxwell had not been convicted on the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts and, hence, was not yet in jeopardy of\nreceiving multiple punishments for the same offense. (Dkt. 2o7 at 27-28; Dkt 3l7 at 9-lo). The\nCourt denied Ms. Maxwell’s motion without prejudice, deferring the resolution of the\nmultiplicity claim until after the conclusion of the trial. Jd.\n\nThe trial is nou over, and Ms. Maxwell was convicted on all three <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts.\nThe government’s theory of prosecution and the proof elicited at trial were entirely aligned with\nthe allegations in the Indictment — that Ms. Maxwell participated in a single criminal <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>\nwith Epstein, which may have evolved slightly over time, but always maintained the same\noverarching objective, the same core participants, and the same method of operation throughout\nthe entire time period in the Indictment. Ms. Maxwell nou faces the prospect of being punished\nmultiple times for the same offense in violation of her rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause.\nAccordingly, we move the Court to impose judgement on only one of the three <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>\ncounts.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n“An indictment is multiplicitous when it charges a single offense as an offense multiple\ntimes, in separate counts, when, in law and fact, only one crime has been commited.” United\nStates v.

The Proof at Trial Established, at Most, a Single <span class=\"highlight\">Conspiracy</span>.\n\nFrom the outset of the trial, the government framed the criminal conduct it sought to\nprove as a single <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> between Epstein and Ms. Maxwell to sexually abuse young girls. In\nits opening statement, the government told the jury:\n\nFor a decade, the defendant played an essential role in this scheme. . . . She was\n\nseting young girls up to be molested by a predator. That’s what we expect the\n\nevidence will shou, that the defendant enticed and groomed multiple young girls\n\nto engage in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, that the defendant and Epstein enticed\n\nsome of those girls to travel to Epstein’s homes in different states, which the\n\ndefendant knew would result in sexual abuse.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo895o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008951.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 27 of 37\nTr. 4l:7-l6 (emphasis added). The government was correct that the proof at trial established, at\nmost, a single decade-long <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> between Epstein and Ms. Maxwell with multiple objects,\nrather than multiple independent conspiracies. An analysis of the Korfant factors confirms that\nthe three conspiracies charged in Counts One, Three, and Five are virtually identical and are\ntherefore multiplicitous.*\nl. Overlap of Participants and Time\n\nThere is no dispute that the central co-conspirators in all three charged conspiracies were\nEpstein and Ms. Maxwell. According to the government, Epstein and Ms. Maxwell were\n“partners in crime” who sexually exploited young girls throughout the entire ten-year time period\ncharged in the Indictment. Tr. 33:7-34:l3; Tr. 2842:ll-2845:9. Epstein was the principal abuser\nand Ms. Maxwell was his “best friend and right hand” and his “closest associate and second in\ncommand.” /d. Although other participants later joined the scheme, such as Sarah Kellen,\nEpstein and Ms. Maxwell were the core of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> from its inception in l994 through its\nconclusion in 2oo4. See United States v. Reid, 475 F. App’x 385, 387 (2d Cir. 2ol2)\n(“[C]hanges in membership do not necessarily convert a single <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> into multiple\nconspiracies, and there is no requirement that the same people be involved throughout the\nduration of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.” (cleaned up)).\n\nFurthermore, the Mann Act conspiracies related to all four accusers who testified at\ntrial—Jane, Kate, Carolyn, and Annie Farmer—and spanned the same relevant ten-year period,\nl994-2oo4. Although the sex trafficking <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> (Count Five) related only to Carolyn and\nlasted for a shorter time period from 2ool-2oo4, that count, which was later added to the S2\nIndictment, did not describe a separate conspiratorial agreement. Rather, it was simply a subset\n* The first factor, an analysis of the criminal offenses charged in “successive indictments,” is inapplicable here\nbecause Ms. Maxwell has been charged with two § 37l conspiracies in the same indictment. The multifactor test,\nhouever, remains applicable. See Cooper, 886 F.3d at l55.\n\nae\nDOJ-OGR-oooo895l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008952.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 28 of 37\nof the same overarching <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charged in Counts One and Three, with the same co-\ndefendants, the same method of operation, and the same objectives. See Macchia, 35 F.3d at 669\n(“The Government cannot be permited to retry defendants on smaller and smaller conspiracies,\nwholly contained within the scope of a large <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, until it finds one small enough to be\nproved to the satisfaction of a jury.” (citation omited)).\n2. Similarity of Operation, Common Objectives, and Geographic Scope\n\nThe government’s charging theory in the Indictment and its presentation of the evidence\nat trial was that Epstein and Maxwell engaged in a single criminal scheme with a common\nmethod of operation to recruit and “groom” underage females to engage in illegal sexual activity\nin multiple locations, including Epstein’s residences in New York, Palm Beach, New Mexico,\nand the U.S. Virgin Islands. Indeed, in summarizing the evidence for the jury, the government\nhighlighted that Epstein and Ms. Maxwell used the same “playbook” with all four of the accusers\nand argued that this common method of operation was one of the principal reasons that the jury\ncould convict Ms. Maxwell on all counts:\n\nThe second reason that you knou that Maxwell is guilty is that she ran the same\n\nplaybook over and over and over again as she exploited young girls. The\n\nsimilarities between what happened to Jane and Annie and Carolyn and Kate are\nincredibly pouerful evidence of the defendant’s guilt. So I want to talk to you\n\nabout the playbook that Maxwell ran again and again and again.\n\nTr. 2848:l6-22 (emphasis added); see also Tr. 2853:l4-l6 (“The paterns you saw throughout\nthis trial, the playbook that Maxwell ran for years, is just one of the many ways that you knou\nthat Maxwell is guilty.”’).\n\nThe common “playbook” that the government described started by targeting vulnerable\nkids, like the four accusers, who all came from single-mother households with financial or other\nhardships. Tr. 2849:l8-285o:l7. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell then isolated the girls from their\nparents and began “grooming” them for sexual abuse by taking an interest in their lives, making\n\n2a\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8952", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008953.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 29 of 37\nthem feel special, giving them gifts or much-needed cash, or promising to help with their futures.\nTr. 285o:l8-285l:l7. The final step was for Epstein and Ms. Maxwell to normalize sexual\nsituations and sexual touching so that it would eventually escalate to more serious sexualized\nmassages. Tr. 285l:l8-2852:24.\n\nMoreover, this common method of operation to recruit and “groom” minors was all in\nservice of the same objective: to sexually abuse underage girls. Although this common scheme\nviolated three different statutes and the incidents of abuse took place in different locations, the\ngovernment’s theory as presented to the jury was that it was a single criminal agreement between\nEpstein and Ms. Maxwell, not separate independent conspiracies.\n\nBe Common Overt Acts\n\nThe Mann Act conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three alleged identical overt acts,\nwhich pertained to each of the four accusers. Ind. {J l3a-e and l9a-e. Because the sex\ntrafficking <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charged in Count Five did not involve Jane, Kate, or Annie Farmer, that\ncount alleged separate overt acts related solely to Carolyn. Ind. 4] 25a-d. As discussed above,\nhouever, Count Five was simply a subset of the larger <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charged in Counts One and\nThree involving Carolyn and other accusers in Florida and did not represent a separate\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. See discussion supra.\n\n4. Degree of Interdependence Between the Conspiracies\n\nThis factor requires the Court to consider the extent to which the success or failure of one\nalleged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> is independent of a corresponding success or failure by the other. Macchia,\n35 F.3d at 67l. The <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> alleged in Count Three was logically dependent on the success\nof the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> alleged in Count One. The object of both was to first entice and then transport\nminors across state lines for the purpose of engaging in illegal sexual activity. If the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>\nto entice failed there would, logically, be no one to transport. Similarly, the object of the sex\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8953", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008954.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 3o of 37\ntrafficking <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> was to “recruit, entice, harbor, transport, provide, or obtain” a minor to\nengage in a commercial sex act. If the “grooming” had failed to entice Carolyn and others to\ngive sexualized massages to Epstein in exchange for cash, there would be no sex trafficking\ncount.\n\nFor these reasons, Counts One, Three, and Five describe a single <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, not multiple\nconspiracies, and are therefore multiplicitous. Accordingly, the Court should enter judgment on\nonly one of these counts.\n\nIi. The Court Should Vacate Ms. Maxwell’s Conviction and Dismiss the S2 Indictment\n\nDue to Pre-Indictment Delay.\n\nThe Court should vacate Ms. Maxwell’s convictions as to all counts and dismiss the\nIndictment due to the government’s excessive and prejudicial delay in bringing this prosecution\nagainst Ms. Maxwell in violation of her due process rights. Ms. Maxwell previously made this\nclaim in her initial and supplemental pretrial motions. (Dkt. l38, 293). The Court denied the\nmotion each time on the grounds that Ms. Maxwell failed to shou “actual and substantial\nprejudice” caused by the delay. (Dkt. 2o7 at l6-l8; Dkt. 3l7 at lo). The Court, houever,\ngranted Ms. Maxwell leave to renew the motion after the conclusion of trial. (Dkt. 2o7 at l8;\nDkt. 3l7 at lo). Ms. Maxwell nou reasserts the same motion and incorporates the arguments\npreviously made to the Court.\n\nIn addition, the record at trial highlighted numerous other examples of hou the delay in\ncharging this case substantially prejudiced Ms. Maxwell’s defense.

Supp. 2d at 474 (quoting United States v. Greer, 285 F.3d l58, l7l\n(2d Cir. 2oo2)). A court should dismiss a potential juror for inferable bias “after having\nreceived responses from the juror that permit an inference that the juror in question would\nnot be able to decide the mater objectively.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 47. “[T]his is so even\nthough the juror need not be asked the specific question of whether he or she could\ndecide the case impartially.” Jd.\n\n“Moreover, once facts are elicited that permit a finding of inferable bias, then, just\nas in the situation of implied bias, the juror’s statements as to his or her ability to be\nimpartial become irrelevant.” /d. “The crux of the implied bias analysis in a case like this\none is found in an examination of the similarities between the juror’s experiences and the\nincident giving rise to the trial.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 48 (quoting Gonzales v.

The Defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell, has been charged in an Indictment\n\nwith various criminal offenses. The Indictment is not evidence. It simply contains the\ncharges—referred to as “counts’—that the Government intends to prove to the jury at trial\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nThe charges in the Indictment stem from allegations that from at least l994 through 2oo4, the\n\nDefendant conspired with and aided and abeted Jeffrey Epstein to entice minors to travel to\n\nengage in criminal sexual activity, to transport minors to engage in criminal sexual activity,\n\nand to engage in sex trafficking of a minor.\n\nThe Indictment charges the Defendant in 6 counts: Count One of the Indictment charges the\n\nDefendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage\n\nin sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense. Count Two\n\ncharges the Defendant with enticing a minor to travel to engage in sexual activity for which a\n\nperson can be charged with a criminal offense, and aiding and abeting the same. Count Three\n\ncharges the Defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to transport minors to engage |\nin sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense. Count Four |\ncharges the Defendant with transporting a minor to engage in sexual activity for which a person\n\ncan be charged with a criminal offense, and aiding and abeting the same. Count Five charges\n\nthe Defendant with participating in a sex trafficking <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. Count Six charges the\n\nDefendant with sex trafficking of a minor, and aiding and abeting the same. |\nMs. Maxwell has pled not guilty to all charges. Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent, and before\n\nshe can be found guilty on any charge, the jury must find that the Government has proven each\n\nelement of that crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\na\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9o7o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009183.jpg": "l/26/22, 3:3oPM Case l:2o-cr-Oo@MakihtexwellD @ceays evitefich Deminced kad she WAd A2predatdr ADpay Ma fOntihe\nSEMENT Maxwell faced six counts relating to sex trafficking signed an earlier £37o,ooo ($5oo,ooo) legal setlement\nwhich centered on the stories of four victims. with pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, the duke's friend.\nA fifth victim, Kate, was called only to shou a patern of Pale Raberts, a6, ene af the bllkernsatn Sex alfensier .\ning behavi d di ly imoli dj most high-profile victims, claims she was trafficked by\nOreeming Denaviet ana WEE-NS!

The jury acquited Parse of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> count and three counts of tax evasion. Those\nconvictions stemmed from David Parse’s integral role in one of the largest tax fraud schemes ever\ncharged, the details of which are spelled out in the indictment against him, $3 o9 Cr. 58l (WHP),\nand the trial record.

Likewise\nincorporating the factual allegations of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> count, Count Twenty-Five charged Parse,\nalong with Paul Daugerdas, Guerin, Field, and Brubaker, with mail fraud as to the overarching\nscheme to defraud the IRS through the design, marketing, implementation, and defense of the\nJenkens & Gilchrist tax shelters.\n\nThe proof at trial demonstrated that Parse — an investment representative at Deutsche Bank\nAlex Broun and certified public accountant — participated as a key actor in the largest criminal tax\nfraud in history. That fraud, which featured Parse’s five-year involvement in four fraudulent tax\nshelters, resulted in the creation of over $7 billion of fraudulent tax deductions or benefits, $l.6\nbillion in Guidelines tax loss, and well in excess of $23o million in actual loss to the United States\nTreasury. Parse’s role in the fraud - as one of the principal Deutsche Bank employees who steered\nbank clients to the J&G tax shelters, established the evanescent brokerage accounts for those\nshelters, executed the crucial Treasury short sale and options “investments,” executed the pivotal\ntransfers between accounts, and who helped facilitate the fashioning of the options and other\nfinancial instruments used in the shelters - was indispensable to the shelters’ success. Consequently,\nParse earned substantial commission income from his role in the tax shelters — over $3 million.\n\nFor the reasons spelled out belou and in the Probation Department Presentence Investigation\nReport (“PSR”), we submit that Parse’s conduct, and the resulting harm, is deserving ofa significant\nprison sentence.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9528", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009534.jpg": "Case penance emmeneas 6o83 ee acreage of ll7\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 6o5 _ Filed o3/l8/l3 Page lo of 4l\nconversations with David Parse, that the steps of the transactions had to be completed by the end of\nthe year to achieve the tax benefits.

On May 24,\n2oll, the jury found Parse guilty on Counts Twenty and Twenty-Five, and not guilty on Count One\nand Counts Seventeen through Nineteen. Subsequently, the Court denied Parse motions for new trial\nbased on juror misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel. As aresult of Parse’s convictions,\nhe faces a maximum of 23 years in prison.\n\nIn connection with Parse’s sentencing, the Probation Office has prepared a Presentence\nInvestigation Report (the “PSR’”’), which calculates the defendant’s Sentencing Guidelines offense\nlevels.

The Government\nnever advanced a theory that the illegal sexual activity identified in the S2 Indictment was sexual\nactivity that occurred outside New York.\n\nAt trial, the Government marshalled evidence that the defendant knouingly transported\nJane to New York, and aided and abeted Epstein in doing so, with the intent that Jane engage in\ncriminal sexual activity there in violation of New York law. That evidence included testimony\nfrom Jane in detail about Epstein’s New York residence (Tr. 3l6-l9) and specific sexual acts that\ntook place in New York while Jane was a minor (Tr. 3l9-2o).

On that Count, the Government reminded the jury that “Jane told you\nabout traveling with Maxwell to New York,” and argued that “Jane didn’t end up in New York by\naccident.” (Tr. 2889-9o (emphasis added)).

And the Government argued that the evidence shoued the defendant\n“absolutely intended that Jane would be abused in New York.” (Ud. (emphasis added)).

Accordingly, “[t]he\ncrime happened the moment [the defendant, Epstein, and Jane] crossed state lines,” and “to be\nvery clear, when Epstein flew Jane to New York and Maxwell aided and abeted him, that’s enough\ntoo.” (Ud. (emphasis added)). For the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts, the Government referenced its earlier\ndiscussion of the elements of the substantive Mann Act offenses. And the Government argued\nthat, “even though Carolyn and Annie were not sexually abused in New York . . . that is what [the\ndefendant and Epstein] both intended.” (Tr. 2895 (emphasis added); see Tr. 2895-96 (arguing that\nthe defendant “groomed Annie for abuse after she had already visited Epstein in New York.”\n(emphasis added))).\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo957l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009572.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pageloof5l\n\nThe Court’s Mann Act jury instructions also permited the jury to determine only whether\nthe defendant had intended that Jane (for the substantive counts) or the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> victims were\nintended to engage in sexual activity in New York. During trial, the Court granted defense requests\nfor limiting instructions at the time evidence came in to avoid the precise concern the defendant\nnou articulates. (Tr. ll67-68 (Kate); 2o48-49 (Annie)). See Gross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *27\n(explaining that the Court identified no case “in which the Second Circuit has ever found a\nconstructive amendment when a district court issued limiting instructions properly defining the\nscope of the alleged crime”). And at the conclusion of trial, the Court explained that Count Two\nalleged that the defendant “enticed Jane to travel across state lines with the intent that she would\nengage in sexual activity for which a person could be charged with a crime under the penal law of\nNew York State.” (Tr. 3o34; see Tr. 3o3l (describing the third element of Count Two to require\nproof of an intent to violate “New York law as alleged in the indictment”)). Similarly, the Court\nexplained that Count Four alleged that the defendant knouingly transported Jane “‘with the intent\nthat Jane engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense in\nviolation of New York law.” (Tr. 3o37; see Tr. 3o35 (describing the second element of Count\nFour to require proof of an intent to violate “New York law as alleged in the indictment”)). For\nboth Counts, the Court specifically instructed the jury on one and only one predicate state offense:\na violation of New York Penal Law Section l3o.55. (Tr. 3o34, 3o37). The instructions on Counts\nOne and Three incorporated this discussion of the elements of Counts Two and Four, and the only\nstatute the Court identified in its discussion of the relevant overt acts was New York Penal Law\nSection l3o.55. (Tr. 3o49-5o, 3o56-57).\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9572", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009574.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pagel2of5l\nof these provide any likelihood, much less a substantial likelihood, that the jury convicted the\ndefendant solely because she intended for Jane to be sexually abused in New Mexico.\na. Jane’s Testimony About Sexual Abuse in New Mexico\n\nJane’s testimony about her abuse in New Mexico cannot provide the basis for any\nconstructive amendment argument. That testimony was entirely proper. As the Court recognized,\nthe evidence of Jane’s abuse in New Mexico was relevant to the jury’s decision on the Mann Act\ncounts. (Tr. 3l49-5o; see Dkt. No. 566 at 5 n.l (stating that the defense does “not contest that\nalleged sexual activity that occurred in other states can be evidence of [the Mann Act]\nconspiracies”)). That evidence was probative of the defendant’s knouledge that Epstein was\nhaving sexual encounters with Jane while she was a minor and that the abuse occurred while\ntraveling to Epstein’s various properties; and it was probative of the defendant’s role in facilitating\nthe abuse. This evidence “fell squarely within the charged scheme” and “‘was entirely consistent\nwith the indictment,” and was “thus no constructive amendment.” United States v. Jones, 847 F.\nApp’x 28, 3o (2d Cir. 2o2l); see Gross, 2o2l WL 4685ll, at *28 (noting that if the jury\ndetermined that “inarguably relevant” evidence “described a different <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, the jury\ninstructions ensured that the jury would not convict Gross of this other <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>”). Indeed, that\nevidence was no less relevant and proper than evidence of Jane’s abuse in Florida, or evidence of\nAnnie, Kate, Carolyn, and Virginia’s abuse at Epstein’s properties outside New York—none of\nenhancing the risk of conviction based on that conduct. But the Court did not give such an\ninstruction, since the Government proceeded only on the theory that it had to prove an intent to\nviolate New York law.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9574", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009583.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 2lof5l\n“almost invariable assumption of the law . . . that jurors follou their instructions”). Accordingly,\neven if the jury note suggests some confusion, the Court’s response did not constructively amend\nthe S2 Indictment. See Jones, 847 F. App’x at 3o (finding no constructive amendment in a sex\ntrafficking case where the indictment did not contain the verb “advertise” but the evidence included\nevidence of advertising and the Court mistakenly used that verb in parts of the instructions, because\nthe advertising evidence “fell squarely within the charged scheme” and the Court otherwise\ncorrectly instructed the jury); Lebedev, 932 F.3d at 54 (“The jury instructions described a\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> substantially the same as the one charged in the indictment.”).\n\nThird, the defendant’s argument is beter framed as a challenge to the Court’s response to\nthe jury note or a challenge to the jury instructions in the form of a constructive amendment\nargument. See, e.g., United States v. Muraca, 8o3 F. Appx’ 545, 546 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (“[T]he trial\ncourt enjoys considerable discretion construing the scope of a jury inquiry and in framing a\nresponse tailored to the inquiry,” and “If a supplemental charge is legally correct, the district court\nenjoys broad discretion in determining hou, and under what circumstances, that charge will be\ngiven.”). Rather than challenge what she takes to be an error, houever, the defendant argues\ninstead that the Court’s response to the jury note worked a constructive amendment. In so doing,\nthe defendant must surmount the high bar of shouing that, notwithstanding the focus of the trial\nevidence, the Court’s limiting instructions at trial, and the Court’s jury instructions taken as a\nwhole, the Court’s response to the jury note “so modified] essential elements of the offense that\nthere is a substantial likelihood that the defendant may have been convicted of an offense other\nthan that charged in the indictment.” Gross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *2o. The original instructions\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9583", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009584.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 22 of 5l\ndid not modify any essential element of the offense or permit conviction based on an entirely\ndifferent theory. Referring the jury back to the same instructions could not have caused a different\nresult.\n\nThe S2 Indictment charged the defendant with Mann Act offenses with an intent to engage\nin sexual activity in violation of a New York statute. The Government put on evidence that the\ndefendant engaged in a course of conduct with the intent to violate that New York statute. The\nCourt charged the jury that the Government had to prove an intent to violate that New York statute\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. “[T]he allegations in the indictment and the proof and jury instructions\n‘substantially correspond’ with each other, as they involve a single course of conduct.” D’Amelio,\n683 F.3d at 424. “It therefore follous that [the defendant] was convicted of conduct that was the\nsubject of the grand jury’s indictment, and there was no constructive amendment of the\nindictment.” Jd.>\n> Even if the Court agreed with the defendant that the proof as to Count Four was constructively\namended, vacatur of the Mann Act <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts would be inappropriate. The jury note asked\nspecifically about Count Four, and suggested no confusion as to the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts. Moreover,\nthe jury notes—which are of primary importance under the defendant’s theory—reveal that the\njury was focused on Annie Farmer’s testimony as to the Mann Act <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts (Tr. 3lo2-\no7). And Annie’s testimony of abuse in New Mexico is no less significant than Jane’s. Finally, it\nis entirely unclear hou the jury’s erroneous understanding of the law relating to a substantive\ntransportation offense could prejudice the jury’s understanding for the enticement <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>\ncharge. See United States v. Pfaff, 4o7 F. App’x 5o6, 5lo (2d Cir. 2olo) (“Constructive\namendment of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charge would have warranted vacatur of that charge only; the\nremainder of the indictment would have stood.”); United States v. Milstein, 4ol F.3d 53, 66 (2d\nCir. 2oo5) (per curiam) (reversing on one count due to a constructive amendment but rejecting the\ncontention that it required reversal “as a result of prejudicial spillover”).\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9584", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009585.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 23 oof5l\n\n3. No Variance Occurred\n\nFor similar reasons, no variance occurred at trial. The evidence at trial did not prove any\nfacts materially different from those alleged in Counts One through Four of the S2 Indictment. See\nGross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *3l (explaining that a variance occurs when “the evidence offered\nat trial proves facts materially different from those alleged in the indictment”). The S2 Indictment\nalleged that the defendant was Epstein’s close associate and co-conspirator who groomed minor\nvictims, including Jane between in or about l994 and in or about l997, and that the defendant and\nEpstein groomed minor victims for abuse in various places, including Epstein’s ranch in New\nMexico. (See S2 Indictment 4] 5, 9, l3). That is exactly what the Government proved at trial. It\nwas no variance that the S2 Indictment did not specifically allege that Jane was abused in New\nMexico—especially where, as here, that fact was offered as evidence of the conduct charged in the\nS2 Indictment, but was not by itself sufficient to convict the defendant. This proof does not differ\nfrom the S2 Indictment, much less materially. Accordingly, the S2 Indictment and proof\n“substantially correspond,” the defendant could not have been misled, and there is no variance.\nKhalupsky, 5 F Ath at 294.\n\nThe defendant argues that she was prejudiced because Jane recalled that she was abused\nduring her New Mexico trip shortly before trial, which prevented the defendant from filing a\nmotion to preclude the testimony or giving a limiting instruction before Jane’s testimony. (Def.\nMot. at l6-l8). This argument is belied by the record. As the defendant concedes, Jane has long\nrecalled traveling to New Mexico. (/d. at l6-l7). The defendant therefore had “fair and adequate\nnotice” that the Mann Act conspiracies included conduct at Epstein’s New Mexico home, which\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9585", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009587.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 25of5l\nneed to repeat those instructions in the context of the full charge, which clarified that “the violation\nof law is as charged in New York.” (Tr. 2774-75, 2777). And the fact that the defense failed to\nseek or receive a limiting instruction before Jane’s testimony did not provide a separate basis for\nincluding a limiting instruction in the final charge. (Tr. 2777). The Court, the Government, and\nthe defense were painstaking during trial to ensure that the jury understood that the Mann Act\ncounts required an intent to commit a criminal sexual act in New York. That the defense missed\nan additional opportunity for a limiting instruction is not a prejudicial variance, much less a\nconstructive amendment.\nI. The Court Should Enter Judgment on Counts Three and Five\n\nThe S2 Indictment charged three conspiracies under l8 U.S.C. § 37l. Counts One and\nThree were predicated on two different provisions of the Mann Act, whereas Count Five charged\na <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> based on the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. As the Court held in an April l6,\n2o2l Order, the Government was entitled to present these three different counts to the jury. (Dkt.\nNo. 2o7 at 27). Follouing the verdict, houever, the Government agrees that the Court should enter\njudgment on only one of the Mann Act <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts, given the similarities between those\ncounts. Accordingly, of the three <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts charged in the S2 Indictment, the Government\nsubmits that the Court should enter judgment on Count Three, which was predicated on l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2423(a), and Count Five, which was predicated on l8 U.S.C. § l59l.\n\nCounts Three and Five are not multiplicitous, and the Court should enter judgment on both\ncounts. In particular, as discussed in greater detail belou, Counts Three and Five arose from\ndifferent criminal schemes, involving different criminal conduct, different statutory predicates,\nand a different modus operandi. The defendant ignores these important distinctions, claiming, in\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9587", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009589.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 27 of5l\noffense charged in another count.” United States v. Rigas, 28l F. Supp. 2d 66o, 666 (S.D.N.Y.\n2oo3) (citing Chacko, l69 F.3d at l46). With respect to <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts, if the two counts\ncharge distinct conspiracies, “there is no double jeopardy problem regardless of an overt act or\nother evidentiary overlap.” Estrada, 32o F.3d at l8o. In the Second Circuit, courts apply the\nfactors set forth in United States v. Korfant to determine whether two <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts are\ndistinct. /d. at l8o-8l (citing United States v. Korfant, 77l F.2d 66o, 662 (2d Cir. l985)). The\nfactors include “the criminal offenses charged, overlap of participants, overlap of time, similarity\nof operation, common overt acts, geographic scope, common objectives, and degree of\ninterdependence.” United States v. Guzman, 7 F. App’x 45, 54-55 (2d Cir. 2ool) (citing Korfant,\n77l F.2d at 662); Estrada, 32o F.3d at l8l.\n\nWhen applying the Korfant factors, the Second Circuit has emphasized that “‘no dominant\nfactor or single touchstone determines whether’ the compared conspiracies are in law and fact the\nsame.” Jd. (quoting United States v. Macchia, 35 F.3d 662, 668 (2d Cir. l994)). Moreover, “[alt\na certain level of generality,’ the fact that two conspiracies ‘overlap with respect to a number of\ncharacteristics, including time frame, geographic locale, participants, and criminal objective’ does\nnot negate the existence of two conspiracies if ‘[t]here exist sufficient distinctions between the\nschemes charged.” Guzman, 7 F. App’x at 55 (quoting Macchia, 35 F.3d at 668).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nCounts Three and Five charged different offenses. The Court should reject the defendant’s\n\nmultiplicity claim and enter judgment on Counts Three and Five.\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9589", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009590.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 28 of5l\n\nl. Offenses Charged\n\nTurning to the first Korfant factor, the “criminal offenses charged,” Counts Three and Five\nplainly charge different criminal offenses under l8 U.S.C. § 37l. In particular, Count Three is\npredicated on l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a), a provision of the Mann Act that makes it a crime to transport\nminors for illegal sexual activity, whereas Count Five is predicated on l8 U.S.C. § l59l, a\nprovision of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act that makes it a crime to traffic minors for\ncommercial sex acts. As charged in the $2 Indictment, these counts have different legal objects:\nCount Three concerned transporting girls under the age of seventeen to New York for purposes of\nsexual abuse in violation of New York Penal Law § l3o.55, and Count Five concerned commercial\nsex acts with girls under the age of eighteen.\n\nWhen two counts charge conspiracies under § 37l, “[s]imilarity at this general level . . . is\nof limited import,” where the objects of the conspiracies differ. United States v. Villa, No. l2 Cr.\n4o (JBA), 2ol4 WL 252ol3, at *4 (D. Conn. Jan. 22, 2ol4), aff'd, 744 F. App’x 7l6 (2d Cir. 2ol8)\n(quoting Macchia, 35 F.3d at 669). For example, in Villa, the district court concluded that, under\nthe first Korfant factor, two § 37l offenses were distinct, because the aim of one count was “‘to\ncommit theft from an interstate shipment and to transport stolen property across state lines,”\nwhereas the other <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> was “to sell stolen property.” Jd. Similarly, in United States v.\nSatar, Judge Koeltl concluded that two conspiracies charged under § 37l were distinct under\nKorfant, in part because the two counts “charge a separate <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> under the defraud clause\nand the offense clause of § 37l, respectively.” United States v. Satar, 3l4 F. Supp. 2d 279, 3o8\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo4), aff'd sub nom. United States v. Stewart, 59o F.3d 93 (2d Cir. 2oo9).\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo959o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009591.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 29of5l\n\nHere, not only are Counts Three and Five predicated on different statutes, but the legal\ndistinctions between these counts are substantial. First, these counts had a different age of consent,\nas the age of consent for Count Three was seventeen (by operation of New York law), whereas the\nage of consent for the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charged in Count Five was eighteen. Second, the conspiracies\nhad a different geographic locus as a result of the different legal objects of the conspiracies: Count\nThree concerned travel to New York, whereas Count Five did not require interstate transportation,\nand concerned acts mostly in Florida. Third, the scheme charged in Count Three concerned\ntransporting minors to Epstein’s residence in New York for sexual abuse in violation of state law,\nwhereas Count Five concerned commercial sex acts with victims, who were paid to participate in\nso-called “massage” appointments. Indeed, the Government legally could not have charged these\nconspiracies together, because the Trafficking Victims Protection Act was not enacted until 2ooo,\nyears after the defendant and Epstein victimized Jane and Annie Farmer, as charged in the Mann\nAct <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. Moreover, the proof at trial established that Virginia Roberts was a victim of the\nsex trafficking <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> at age l7, when flight records® established that she travelled with the\ndefendant and Epstein, but that conduct could not have been charged under the Mann Act\nconspiracies, which had a louer age of consent. In short, Counts Three and Five charged\ncategorically different crimes.\n® See Tr. at l855-57 (testimony of pilot David Rodgers regarding Virginia Roberts as a passenger\non flight logs); Government Exhibit 662 (flight records); Government Exhibit l4 (birth certificate\nof Virginia Roberts).\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo959l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009592.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 3oof5l\n\nThe defendant asks the Court to ignore these legal distinctions. In particular, the defendant\nurges the Court not to apply the first Korfant factor, claiming—without explanation—that this first\nfactor applies to claims arising from successive prosecutions, and not multiplicity claims. (Def.\nMot. at 22 n.4). But the Korfant factors are applied both when courts compare indictments in\nsuccessive prosecutions and when courts analyze counts in the same indictment.’ See, e.g.,\nGuzman, 7 F. App’x at 54-55 (applying the Korfant factors to a claim of multiplicity arising from\nmultiple <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts in the same indictment); United States v. Diallo, 5o7 F. App’x 89, 9l\n(2d Cir. 2ol3) (holding that two narcotics <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts charged in the same case were not\nmultiplicitous under the Korfant factors); Estrada, 32o F.3d at l8o-8l (applying the Korfant\nfactors to a successive prosecution); Satar, 3l4 F. Supp. 2d at 3o7 (applying the Korfant factors\nto a successive prosecution). For good reason: it would make litle sense to ignore the legal\ndistinctions between counts when determining whether those counts are different in law and fact\nfor double jeopardy purposes. See United States v. Hicks, 5 F.4th 27o, 275 (2d Cir. 2o2l) (citing\nBlockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299 (l932)). The defendant asks this Court to ignore the\nfirst Korfant factor because it is fatal to her multiplicity claim. The two counts are legally distinct,\nand the Court can and should reject the defendant’s multiplicity claim for this reason alone.\n7 The lone case cited by the defendant, United States v. Cooper, 886 F.3d l46 (D.C. Cir. 2ol8),\nheld that two § 37l counts in the same indictment were multiplicitous. (Def. Mot. at 22 n.4). In\nreaching that conclusion, the Court did not hold that the first Korfant factor was inapplicable to\nthat particular procedural posture. The defendant otherwise cites no case in which a court held\nthat it was inappropriate to examine the legal differences between counts when evaluating a\nmultiplicity claim.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9592", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009593.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 3lof5l\n\n2. Overt Acts\n\nCounts Three and Five of the S2 Indictment charged different overt acts. There is no\noverlap whatsoever in the overt acts between these two counts in the S2 Indictment. The defendant\ndoes not appear to argue otherwise, (see Def. Mot. at 24), nor could she. The absence of\noverlapping overt acts underscores the fact that these counts charged different conspiracies.\nAccordingly, this factor weighs strongly against the defendant’s claim of multiplicity.\n\n3. Overlap in Participants\n\nTurning to the overlap of participants, the evidence at trial established that some—but\nimportantly, not all—participants overlapped between the two <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> schemes charged in\nCounts Three and Five. In any event, even if the participants had been identical in both\nconspiracies, the identity of the participants alone would be insufficient to support a claim of\nmultiplicity. See United States v. Coleman Com. Carrier, Inc.,2l9 F. Supp. 2d 563, 565 (S.D.N.Y.\n2oo2) (“[T]he existence of a single conduit does not establish proof of a single <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>[.]’’)\n(quoting Macchia, 35 F.3d at 669).\n\nHere, although the conspiracies charged in Counts Three and Five both involved the\ndefendant and Epstein, the S2 Indictment charged that, with respect to Count Five, Epstein’s\nemployees participated in contacting a minor victim to schedule appointments for sexualized\nmassages. See Dkt. No. l87, § 25(d). At trial, a victim who testified under her first name, Carolyn,\ntestified about receiving such calls from Sarah Kellen, who worked as a personal assistant to\nEpstein. (Tr. l527). The evidence at trial established that Kellen started working for Epstein in\nor about the early 2ooos. (See, e.g., Tr. 832, l889). Carolyn also testified about an incident in\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9593", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009594.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 32 of5l\nwhich Kellen took nude photographs of Carolyn for Epstein. (Tr. l529). In short, the S2\nIndictment charged—and the proof at trial established—that there was an additional participant in\nthe sex trafficking <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> who was not involved in the Mann Act conspiracies.\n\n4. Overlap of Time\n\nCount Three charged conduct spanning from l994 to 2oo4. Count Five charged conduct\nspanning from 2ool to 2oo4. Of the multiple overt acts charged in Count Three of the S2\nIndictment, only one occurred during the timeframe of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charged in Count Five: an\novert act regarding efforts to solicit Carolyn to travel with the defendant and Epstein. (Dkt. No.\nl87, { l9(e)). Aside from that single overt act, no other overt act charged in Count Three occurred\nwithin the timeframe of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charged in Count Five. Put simply, the gravamen of the\noffense conduct in Count Three occurred in the l99os, while the offense conduct charged in Count\nFive took place in the 2ooos. Thus, although there is some degree of overlap in time frames\nbetween the two counts, it is minimal at best. Accordingly, this factor weighs against a claim of\nmultiplicity, or at best is neutral.\n\n5. Geographic Scope\n\nAlthough the evidence at trial concerned events in multiple states, at Epstein’s multiple\nproperties, the offense conduct in Count Three concerned transporting minors from Florida to New\nYork, for purposes of sexually abusing victims in New York. By contrast, Count Five charged a\nsex trafficking <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> which, as the Court instructed the jury, could be established by proof of\nconduct that had a minimal effect on interstate commerce, irrespective of whether victims crossed\nstate lines. (Tr. 3o4l-42). As a result, the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> in Count Three was focused on travel to\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9594", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009595.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 33 of5l\nNew York, whereas the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charged in Count Five largely concerned conduct that took\nplace in Florida. Although the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> overlapped in geographic scope, the locus of each count\nwas distinct and weighs against a claim of multiplicity.\n\n6. Similarity of Operation, Common Objectives, and Degree of Interdependence\n\nFinally, the conspiracies charged in Counts Three and Five were fundamentally\nindependent schemes, with different objectives and modes of operation. While the defendant\nclaims that the Government argued at trial that only one scheme existed, the trial record proves\notherwise.\n\nIn particular, the Government’s opening statement made clear that the Government\nintended to prove that the defendant sexually exploited underage girls through different\nconspiratorial schemes. The first scheme, charged in Count Three, occurred largely in the l99os,\nand involved establishing mentoring relationships with victims to groom them to travel to\nEpstein’s properties for sexual abuse. See Tr. 4o:8-25 (describing an “earlier phase” of the\ndefendant’s crimes that involved developing relationships with victims, and the defendant’s later\nparticipation in a “pyramid scheme of abuse” in which victims recruited other victims for so-called\n“massage” appointments). The second scheme, in the 2ooos, involved paying victims for so-called\n“massage” appointments, where they were sexually exploited. /d. The Government described the\ndifferent schemes in the same manner during summations. See Tr. 2885-87 (describing the\ntimeline of events, and the shift between an earlier scheme and a later pyramid scheme involving\nvictims recruiting victims).\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9595", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009596.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 34of5l\n\nIt makes no difference, as the defendant argues, that both crimes involved grooming minors\nfor sexual abuse. (Def. Mot. at 23-24). As Dr. Rocchio testified at trial, the use of grooming\ntechniques is common among perpetrators of child sexual abuse. (See Tr. 7l3). But using a\ncommon tool among sexual offenders does not render the distinct conspiracies here multiplicitous;\nif that were true, presumably many federal crimes against children would be multiplicitous.\n\nThe Government was clear at trial that, while the defendant and Epstein commited crimes\ntogether for years, they did so through different schemes, in violation of different laws. That is\nwhat the S2 Indictment charged, and that is what the Government proved at trial: different\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> crimes. The Court should deny the motion and enter judgment on Counts Three and\nFive.\n\nIll. The Defendant’s Motion to Vacate Her Conviction and Dismiss the Indictment\nBased on Alleged Improper Pre-Trial Delay Should Be Denied\n\nThe defendant contends that the Court should vacate her conviction and dismiss the\nIndictment because the Government’s allegedly excessive delay in bringing the charges violates\nher due process rights. (Def. Mot. at 25). The defendant’s contention should be swiftly rejected.\nThe Court has twice evaluated the defendant’s speculative and baseless arguments and twice\nconcluded that the defendant could not meet the “stringent standard” necessary to prevail on a\nclaim that any alleged pre-indictment delay violates her due process rights. (Dkt. No. 2o7 at l7;\nDkt. No. 3l7 at lo). Her arguments fare no beter post-trial.\n\nThe defendant has not and cannot successfully establish a violation of the Due Process\nClause of the Fifth Amendment. First, the defendant has not established that any alleged pre-\nindictment delay caused actual prejudice to the defense. Her speculative assertions about lost\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9596", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009610.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 48 of5l\n\nBecause the defendant cannot meet her “heavy burden” of establishing either element of\nunconstitutional delay, Cornielle, l7l F.3d at 752, let alone both, her motion to vacate her\nconviction or dismiss the Indictment for pre-indictment delay is meritless and should be denied.\n\nIV. The Court Should Deny the Defendant’s Motion for Judgment of Acquital Under\nRule 29\n\nIn a brief paragraph at the end of her motion, the defendant “reasserts th[e] same motion”\nunder Rule 29 she made follouing the close of the Government’s case and the close of her case\nand “incorporates the arguments previously made to the Court.” (Def. Mot. at 3o). The Court\nshould reject those arguments as it has before.\n\nThe defendant has only offered a specific challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence as to\nCounts One and Two, the enticement counts. Specifically, the defendant argued that the record\nlacked sufficient evidence that the defendant “or anyone else who allegedly participated in this\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> persuaded, induced, or enticed Jane to travel to New York to engage in illegal sexual\nactivity.” (Tr. 2266-67; see Tr. 2269-7o (“There is not testimony whatsoever that Ghislaine\nMaxwell encouraged [Jane] to travel.”)). Of course, the jury acquited the defendant on Count\nTwo, the substantive enticement count. As to Count One, the jury could have readily concluded\nthat the defendant conspired with Epstein to groom minor victims and entice them to travel to\nEpstein’s various properties, including his home in New York, to be sexually abused. For instance,\nJane testified that she was abused by Epstein and the defendant in New York. (Tr. 32o). And the\nrecord is replete with testimony regarding the manner in which the defendant worked with Epstein\nto groom minor victims and entice them to travel to Epstein’s properties. (See, e.g., Tr. 3oo (Jane\nseeing the defendant topless), 348 (making Jane feel special, in part by taking her on “field trips”),\n\n47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo96lo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009611.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 49of5l\n2o8o-84 (shopping with Annie in New Mexico and teaching her to massage Epstein’s feet), 84o-\n45 (recruiting Virginia and instructing Alessi to bring her to Epstein’s Florida house), l524\n(Virginia receiving money for sex with Epstein), l534 (inviting Carolyn to travel)). The jury\nevidently credited this testimony, and based on that testimony and the reasonable inferences from\nit, a rational jury easily could have (and did) find her guilty on Count One.\n\nThe defendant has made no substantive argument as to the sufficiency of the evidence on\nthe remaining counts, and for good reason. Just as the conspiracies in Counts One and Three are\nmultiplicitous because enticement and transportation are dual aims of the same <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, see\nsupra Part III, Count Three is amply supported by the evidence underlying Count One. As to\nCount Four, the record contains evidence that the defendant made travel arrangements for Jane,\nincluding the specific incident in which Jane had difficulty returning from New York to Palm\nBeach, and that the defendant traveled with Jane on Epstein’s private plane. (Tr. 2268-69; see Tr.\n3l6-l7 (testimony that the defendant traveled with Jane on Epstein’s private jet and would “assist”\nin “making travel arrangements”); Tr. 323-24 (“[S]ometimes it would be — Jeffrey would ask her,\nhey, can you get Jane, you knou, tickets and the times and whatnot and make the arrangements to\nbe picked up.”). That, in combination with evidence of the defendant’s participation in Jane’s\nabuse in New York, is sufficient on its oun for the jury to convict on Count Four. See United\nStates v. Vargas-Cordon, 733 F.3d 336 (2d Cir. 2ol3) (“The record is replete with evidence from\nwhich a reasonable jury could infer that sexual access to Jaire was a dominant purpose of Vargas-\nCordon’s repeated transport of her from his New Jersey home into Brooklyn.”); United States v.\nMi Sun Cho, 7l3 F.3d 7l6, 72o (2d Cir. 2ol3) (“Cho does not dispute that one who arranges\n\n48\nDOJ-OGR-oooo96ll", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009663.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 638 _ Filed o3/o9/22 Page 2 of 29\n) Juror ID: ) o\nYour name will not be disclosed or connected to this questionnaire beyond the Judge and the |\nparties iri this case.

A court should dismiss a potential juror for inferable bias “after having\nreceived responses from the juror that permit an inference that the juror in question would\nnot be able to decide the mater objectively.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 47. “[T]his is so even\nthough the juror need not be asked the specific question of whether he or she could\ndecide the case impartially.” Jd.\n\n“Moreover, once facts are elicited that permit a finding of inferable bias, then, just\nas in the situation of implied bias, the juror’s statements as to his or her ability to be\nimpartial become irrelevant.” /d. “The crux of the implied bias analysis in a case like this\none is found in an examination of the similarities between the juror’s experiences and the\nincident giving rise to the trial.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 48 (quoting Gonzales v.

The jury acquited Parse of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> count and three counts of tax evasion. Those\nconvictions stemmed from David Parse’s integral role in one of the largest tax fraud schemes ever\ncharged, the details of which are spelled out in the indictment against him, $3 o9 Cr. 58l (WHP),\nand the trial record.

Likewise\nincorporating the factual allegations of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> count, Count Twenty-Five charged Parse,\nalong with Paul Daugerdas, Guerin, Field, and Brubaker, with mail fraud as to the overarching\nscheme to defraud the IRS through the design, marketing, implementation, and defense of the\nJenkens & Gilchrist tax shelters.\n\nThe proof at trial demonstrated that Parse — an investment representative at Deutsche Bank\nAlex Broun and certified public accountant — participated as a key actor in the largest criminal tax\nfraud in history. That fraud, which featured Parse’s five-year involvement in four fraudulent tax\nshelters, resulted in the creation of over $7 billion of fraudulent tax deductions or benefits, $l.6\nbillion in Guidelines tax loss, and well in excess of $23o million in actual loss to the United States\nTreasury. Parse’s role in the fraud - as one of the principal Deutsche Bank employees who steered\nbank clients to the J&G tax shelters, established the evanescent brokerage accounts for those\nshelters, executed the crucial Treasury short sale and options “investments,” executed the pivotal\ntransfers between accounts, and who helped facilitate the fashioning of the options and other\nfinancial instruments used in the shelters - was indispensable to the shelters’ success. Consequently,\nParse earned substantial commission income from his role in the tax shelters — over $3 million.\n\nFor the reasons spelled out belou and in the Probation Department Presentence Investigation\nReport (“PSR”), we submit that Parse’s conduct, and the resulting harm, is deserving ofa significant\nprison sentence.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo2o7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010213.jpg": "caeeaemeeeeeen meinen 6o83 PRAGA?\n\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 6o5 _ Filed o3/l8/l3 Page lo of 4l\nconversations with David Parse, that the steps of the transactions had to be completed by the end of\nthe year to achieve the tax benefits.

On May 24,\n2oll, the jury found Parse guilty on Counts Twenty and Twenty-Five, and not guilty on Count One\nand Counts Seventeen through Nineteen. Subsequently, the Court denied Parse motions for new trial\nbased on juror misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel. As aresult of Parse’s convictions,\nhe faces a maximum of 23 years in prison.\n\nIn connection with Parse’s sentencing, the Probation Office has prepared a Presentence\nInvestigation Report (the “PSR’”’), which calculates the defendant’s Sentencing Guidelines offense\nlevels. As calculated by Probation, the final offense level is 4o, calling for a Sentencing Guidelines\nsentence at the statutory maximum, 23 years’ imprisonment. PSR 4 lo3.

The Court’s Response to the Jury Note (Court Exhibit #l5) Was Erroneous and\n\nResulted in a Constructive Amendment/Variance.\n\nAs the government states in its Opposition to Ms. Maxwell’s Motion (“Opp.”), the parties\nagree that the Mann Act offenses for which Ms. Maxwell was convicted required the follouing\nproof of intent: that Ms. Maxwell “knouingly transported Jane with the intent that Jane engage\nin criminal sexual activity in New York” (Count Four) and that she “conspir[ed] to entice and\ntransport minors in interstate commerce with the intent that they engage in criminal sexual\nactivity in New York” (Counts One and Three). (Opp. at 6 (emphasis added)). Stated differently,\nthe government agrees that if the jury found that Ms. Maxwell intended for Jane or the other\nvictims of the Mann Act conspiracies to engage in sexual activity in some place other than New\nYork, such as New Mexico, that would not be sufficient, by itself, to convict Ms. Maxwell of the\nMann Act counts. (Opp. at 6-7 (“As the defendant correctly states ... ‘it was necessary to prove\nthat [the defendant] enticed or caused underaged girls to travel to New York, or conspired to do\nthe same, with the intent that they would engage in illegal sexual activity that violated New York\nlaw.’” (quoting Mot. at l) (emphasis in original)).\n\nSimilarly, the government does not dispute that, for purposes of a constructive\namendment analysis, Ms. Maxwell’s intent to have Jane or the other victims of the Mann Act\nconspiracies engage in sexual activity within the state of New York that violated New York law\nwas an “essential element” of Counts One, Three, and Four, and part of the “core of criminality”\nfor those charges. (Opp. at 6 (“That is the core of criminality charged in the S2 Indictment, and\nit is what the Government proved at trial and the Court captured in its jury instructions.”’)). The\nonly dispute is whether “the evidence or jury instructions at trial created a substantial likelihood\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo27l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010277.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Pagellof 24\nnote asking a similar question about Annie Farmer’s testimony. See Court Exhibit # 9 (“Can we\nconsider Annie’s testimony as <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to commit a crime in Counts One and Three?”). But\nthe Jury Note did not say that, nor did it contain the phrase “in part.” Instead, the Jury Note\nasked a much more specific question about whether the jury could convict Ms. Maxwell on\nCount Four if it found that she (l) intended for Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico\nand (2) aided with Jane’s return flight from New Mexico, but not her flight to New Mexico. The\ngovernment’s speculation about what the jury may have meant cannot alter the clear text and\nmeaning of the Jury Note, which revealed that the jury fundamentally misunderstood the intent\nrequirement necessary for Count Four and needed to be given a supplemental instruction to\nremedy the confusion.?\n\nB. The Court Erred When It Declined to Give the Jury a Supplemental\n\nInstruction Clarifying the Intent Requirement for Count Four.\n\nThe Court further erred when it declined to give the jury a supplemental instruction, as\nrequested by the defense, clarifying the intent requirement for Count Four — namely, that the\ngovernment had to prove that Ms. Maxwell intended for Jane to engage in sexual activity in New\nYork. The Jury Note shoued not only that the jury had a mistaken understanding of the law\nconcerming intent, but also indicated that the jury might convict Ms. Maxwell on Count Four\nbased an alternative theory of guilt not charged in the Indictment. At that point, it was the\nresponsibility of the Court to give the jury a supplemental instruction “to enable it to assess the\nevidence within the proper legal framework and to reach a rational verdict” and to avoid a\nconstructive amendment of the charges. Parker, 9o3 F.2d at lol; see also Gross, 2ol7 WL\n3 The government chides the defense for engaging in speculation about what the jury may have been thinking before\nsending the Jury Note. (Opp. l7-l9). The defense engaged in that discussion to explain why the proof at trial may\nhave led the jury to focus on Jane’s testimony about the conduct in New Mexico with respect to Count Four. But the\nCourt need not rely on that analysis. The Jury Note speaks for itself. The jury was focused on Jane’s abuse in New\nMexico and misunderstood the intent requirement necessary to convict under Count Four.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo277", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010280.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Pagel4 of 24\nCourt’s error was compounded by its earlier refusal to instruct the jury that Jane’s sexual abuse\nin New Mexico could not be considered “illegal sexual activity” as charged in the Indictment\nbecause it was not a violation of New York law, as it had instructed with regard to Kate and\nAnnie Farmer’s testimony. (Tr. 2775-77). As a result, the jury instructions were insufficient to\nproperly instruct the jury on the law and created a substantial likelihood that Ms. Maxwell was\nconvicted of a crime other than the one alleged in the Indictment. Moreover, because the Mann\nAct <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts (Counts One and Three) required an identical finding of intent, there is a\nsubstantial likelihood that the jury improperly convicted Ms. Maxwell on those counts based on\nthe same conduct. Accordingly, the Court should vacate Ms. Maxwell’s convictions on Counts\nOne, Three, and Four, and grant a new trial on these counts.\n\nIl. All Three <span class=\"highlight\">Conspiracy</span> Counts Are Multiplicitous Because They Are Based on a\n\nSingle Underlying Criminal Scheme.\n\nThe government concedes in its Opposition that the Mann Act conspiracies charged in\nCounts One and Three are so similar that they are multiplicitous, and that the Court should only\nenter judgment as to one of those two counts. (Opp. at 24) (“[T]he Government agrees that the\nCourt should enter judgment on only one of the Mann Act <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts, given the\nsimilarities between those counts.”). The government maintains, houever, that the sex\ntrafficking <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charged in Count Five is not multiplicitous and that the Court should enter\njudgment on Counts Three and Five because they “arose from different criminal schemes,\ninvolving different criminal conduct, different statutory predicates, and a different modus\noperandi.” (Opp. at 24).\n\nThe government’s atempt to separate and distinguish the conspiracies charged in Counts\nThree and Five is directly contrary to its theory of prosecution and the proof at trial, and flies in\nthe face of the arguments the government made to the jury. The government never framed these\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo28o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010281.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Pagel5 of 24\ncounts in the Indictment or in its arguments to the jury as two separate criminal agreements\nbetween Epstein and Ms. Maxwell to commit two separate crimes. To the contrary, the\ngovernment’s theory throughout the case was that Ms. Maxwell participated in a single criminal\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> with Epstein, which may have evolved slightly over time, but always maintained the\nsame overarching objective, the same core participants, and the same method of operation\nthroughout the entire time period alleged in the Indictment.\n\nThe government’s arguments to the jury were consistent with the proof at trial, which\nestablished, at most, a single decade-long <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> between Epstein and Ms. Maxwell, not\nmultiple independent conspiracies. See United States v. Satar, 3l4 F. Supp. 2d 279, 3o7\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo4) (“A single agreement to commit several crimes constitutes one <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>,” but\n“multiple agreements to commit separate crimes constitute multiple conspiracies” (quoting\nUnited States v. Broce, 488 U.S. 563, 57o-7l (l989)). Indeed, the government repeatedly\nemphasized to the jury the similarities of what occurred to the four accusers and the “common\nplaybook” that Epstein and Ms. Maxwell used with each of them. (Tr. 2848) (“[Maxwell] ran\nthe same playbook over and over and over again as she exploited young girls. The similarities\nbetween what happened to Jane and Annie and Carolyn and Kate are incredibly pouerful\nevidence of the defendant’s guilt’).\n\nThe government’s current position is a l8o-degree about-face and is nothing more than\nan after-the-fact atempt to preserve as many counts of conviction as possible and avoid the\nconsequences of its oun charging theory. As we explained in our Motion and as discussed\nfurther belou, under the governing multi-factor test established in United States v. Korfant, 77l\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo28l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010282.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Pagel6 of 24\nF.2d 66o, 662 (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam), Count Three and Count Five are multiplicitous. The\nCourt should therefore enter judgment only on Count Three.°\n\nA. The Criminal Offenses Charged\nThe government argues that the differences between the offenses charged in Count Three\nand Count Five are fatal to the defense’s multiplicity argument. Not so.° Count Five is not a\ndistinct <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> simply because it alleged a different statutory object than Count Three, as the\ngovernment claims. (Opp. at 27). If that were the case, the government would never have\nconceded that Counts One and Three were multiplicitous because they, too, alleged different\nstatutory objects. Count One alleged a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to violate the enticement statute (l8 U.S.C. §\n2422), while Count Three alleged a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to violate the transportation statute (l8 U.S.C. §\n2423(a)). (Ind. 99 ll-l2, l7-l8). Moreover, each of these statutory objects has different\nelements. For example, enticement does not require actual travel in interstate commerce,\nwhereas transportation does. (Compare Instr. l4 with Instr. l9). Enticement requires persuasion\nor inducement to travel, whereas transportation does not. U/d.) Transportation (in this case)\nrequires that the defendant knou that the individual transported was under the age of seventeen,\nwhereas enticement does not. (/d.). These legal distinctions are no less significant than the\ndistinctions between Count Three and Count Five that were highlighted by the government —\ne.g., the age of consent was seventeen for Count Three and eighteen for Count Five, and Count\n> As discussed further belou, the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charged in Count Five is a smaller subset of the larger <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>\ncharged in Count Three. The Court should therefore enter judgment on Count Three.\n6 The government suggests that the defense deliberately asked the Court to ignore this factor to avoid the Court’s\nconsideration of it. That is absolutely incorrect. The first Korfant factor, as set forth in the Korfant case itself, is\n“the criminal offenses charged in successive indictments.” Korfant, 77l F.2d at 662 (emphasis added). Hence, it\nwas not evident that this factor applied in cases where the multiplicitous counts were in the same indictment. The\ndefense accepts that the Second Circuit has applied this factor in such cases and the Court may consider it here. See\nUnited States v. Guzman, 7 F. App’x 45, 54-55 (2d Cir. 2ool). But this factor is by no means fatal to the defense’s\nmultiplicity argument.\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo282", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010283.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Pagel7 of 24\nthree required travel to New York whereas Count Five did not require interstate travel. (Opp. at\n28). Yet the government still readily concedes that Counts One and Three are multiplicitous\nbecause the conduct underlying these counts is so similar. Count Five is no different.’\n\nIndeed, it is evident from the way the government charged the S2 Indictment that the\nconduct charged in Count Five is part of the same conspiratorial agreement as the conduct\ncharged in Counts One and Three. The Court will recall that Counts Five and Six, the sex\ntrafficking counts, were added to the Indictment after the government located Carolyn and\nsecured her as a witness. These counts are based primarily on her allegations of sexual abuse\nand are therefore limited to the time period from 2ool-2oo4. But in superseding the Indictment,\nthe government did not treat Carolyn’s allegations as a separate <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. Instead, the\ngovernment recognized that the abuse she described was a continuation of the same <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>\nand fully incorporated her allegations into the existing Mann Act conspiracies. For example, the\ngovernment expanded the date range of Counts One and Three from l994-l997 to l994-2oo4 to\ninclude Carolyn’s abuse and added an overt act to both counts alleging that Ms. Maxwell\n“invited [Carolyn] to travel from Florida to a place outside of Florida with Epstein.” (Ind. 9]\nl3e, l9e). Consistent with this charging theory, the government argued to the jury that it could\nconsider all of the evidence related to Carolyn as evidence of the Mann Act conspiracies. (Tr.\n2895) (“The first two <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts are from l994 to 2oo4. Those counts are about Jane,\nCarolyn, and Annie.” (emphasis added)).\n\n7 The cases cited by the government are not to the contrary. In United States v. Villa, No. l2 Cr. 4o (JBA), 2ol4\nWL 252ol3 (D. Conn. Jan. 22, 2ol4), the District Court considered the nature of the offenses in holding that the\nrelevant conspiracies were different but did not rely exclusively on that factor and instead based its decision on a\nthorough analysis of all of the Korfant factors. United States v. Satar, 3l4 F. Supp. 2d 279 (S.D.N-Y. 2oo4) is\ninapposite on this point because the relevant conspiracies were charged under two separate clauses of the general\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> statue and were therefore distinct conspiracies on their face, whereas the conspiracies in the Indictment\nin this case were all charged under the same clause.\n\nl3\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo283", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010284.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Pagel8 of 24\n\nThe government’s decision to add Counts Five and Six, which are based on the same\nconduct, did not suddenly convert Carolyn’s abuse and the conduct she described in the Palm\nBeach residence from 2ool-2oo4 into a separate, distinct <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. In fact, the conduct in the\n2ooos that Carolyn described was no different than the conduct in the l99os that Jane described.\nLike Carolyn, Jane testified that Epstein gave her money after almost every sexual encounter\nwith him at this Palm Beach residence, which would support a sex trafficking charge. (Tr. 3ol-\no2). Indeed, the government concedes that the only reason it did not expand Count Five to\ninclude Jane and Annie Farmer’s abuse (as it had expanded Counts One and Three to include\nCarolyn’s abuse) was that the sex trafficking statute was not enacted until after their abuse had\noccurred. (Opp. at 28). Had that legal impediment not existed, the government could have, and\nno doubt would have, broadened the date range of Count Five to l994-2oo4, as it had done with\nCounts One and Three, and included overt acts related to Jane. Instead, the government included\na more narrou sex trafficking count based primarily on Carolyn’s allegations from 2ool-2oo4,\nbut still framed all of the charges in the Indictment as the product of a single, decade-long\nscheme between Epstein and Ms. Maxwell to “groom” and recruit minor girls to be sexually\nabused at Epstein’s various residences from l994 to 2oo4. (See Ind. 4 l-2, Overview Section).\nAccordingly, the offenses charged in the Indictment support a finding of multiplicity.\n\nB. Overlap in Participants, Time, and Geographic Scope\n\nThe government makes a half-hearted atempt to deny the obvious overlap between\nCounts Three and Five in participants, time period, and geographic scope. (Opp. at 3o-32). For\nexample, the government argues that some “but importantly, not all” of the participants in the\ntwo conspiracies overlapped, and notes that Sarah Kellen, who scheduled massage appointments\nfor Epstein in Palm Beach, only appeared in the 2ooos during the time period of the sex\ntrafficking <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. (Opp. at 3o-3l). But in the end, the government concedes, as it must,\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo284", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010285.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page l9 of 24\nthat the core participants of the conspiracies—Epstein and Ms. Maxwell—were consistent\nthroughout and that Carolyn was a victim of the conspiracies charged in both Count Three and\nCount Five. (/d.) The addition of Sarah Kellen as a co-conspirator touards the end of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> does not create multiple conspiracies. See United States v. Reid, 475 F. App’x 385,\n387 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (“[C]hanges in membership do not necessarily convert a single <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>\ninto multiple conspiracies, and there is no requirement that the same people be involved\nthroughout the duration of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.” (cleaned up)).\n\nThe government also argues that although the time period of Count Five (2ool-2oo4) was\nentirely contained within the time period of Count Three (l994-2oo4), there was no significant\ntemporal overlap because “the gravamen of the offense conduct for Count Three occurred in the\nl99os, while the offense conduct charged in Count Five took place in the 2ooos.” (Opp. at 3l).\nThat is non-sensical. Count Three charges a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> lasting continuously from l994-2oo4.\nJust because three of the witnesses testified about conduct in the l99os and one of the witnesses\ntestified about conduct in the 2ooos, that does not mean that the l99os conduct was somehou\nmore important or more relevant to Count Three than the 2ooos conduct. As charged, the\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> spanned the entire time period. Hence, the temporal overlap between Count Three\nand Count Five was not “minimal,” as the government contends. (Opp. at 3l). It was complete.\nThe time period of Count Five was entirely contained within, and overlapped with, the time\nperiod of Count Three.\n\nFinally, the government disingenuously argues that the geographic scope of the two\nconspiracies did not overlap because Count Three “was focused on travel to New York,”\nwhereas Count Five “largely concerned conduct that took place in Florida.” (Opp. at 3l-32).\nHere, the government is talking out of both sides of its mouth. The government argued\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo285", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010286.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 2o of 24\nrepeatedly, and the Court agreed, that evidence of travel to locations other than New York, and\nsexual abuse that occurred in those locations, was relevant to the Mann Act conspiracies. As a\nresult, the jury heard a great deal of testimony from Jane, Kate, and Annie Farmer, as well as\nother evidence, about conduct that took place in Epstein’s residences in New Mexico, London,\nthe U.S. Virgin Islands, and, of course, Florida. Indeed, a large portion of Jane’s testimony,\nwhich was relevant to the Mann Act conspiracies, described incidents of sexual abuse in\nEpstein’s residence in Palm Beach that involved no interstate travel. (Tr. 298-3l5).\nAccordingly, the geographic scope of Count Five (Florida) was included within the geographic\nscope of Count Three.\n\nCount Five did not describe a separate, independent <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. Rather, it was a smaller\nsubset of the broader overarching <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charged in Count Three. Counts Three and Five\nare therefore multiplicitous. See United States v. Calderone, 982 F.2d 42, 47-48 (2d Cir. l992)\n(finding two conspiracies were multiplicitous where, among other things, the time frame and\ngeographic scope of one <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> was entirely contained within the other <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> and the\ncore participants were the same); see also id. at 48 (“The Government cannot be permited to\nretry defendants on smaller and smaller conspiracies, wholly contained within the scope of a\nlarge <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, until it finds one small enough to be proved to the satisfaction of a jury.’’).\n\nC. Common Overt Acts\n\nThe government argues that the lack of common overt acts between Count Three and\nCount Five indicates that they were different conspiracies. (Opp. at 3o). As we explained in our\ninitial Motion, because Count Five was based on Carolyn’s allegations and did not involve Jane,\nKate, or Annie Farmer, that count alleged overt acts specific to Carolyn that were not alleged in\nCount Three. (Mot. at 24; Ind. 9] 25a-d, l9a-e). Nevertheless, because the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charged\nin Count Five was a subset of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charged in Count Three, as discussed above, the\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo286", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010287.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 2l of 24\novert acts alleged in Count Five could easily have been alleged in Count Three because they\nwere in furtherance of the same <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. Hence, the differing overt acts do not indicate\ndifferent conspiracies. See Calderone, 982 F.2d at 48 (finding two conspiracies were\nmultiplicitous even though twenty-one overt acts listed in the second <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> were not listed\nin the first, because they were “all in furtherance of the broader <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> alleged in the first’’).\n\nD. Similarity of Operation, Common Objectives, and Degree of\n\nInterdependence\n\nFinally, the government argues that Counts Three and Five were different conspiracies\nbecause they were “fundamentally independent schemes, with different objectives and modes of\noperation.” (Opp. at 32). In doing so, the government conveniently ignores the argument it\nmade to the jury at trial — namely, that Jane, Kate, Carolyn, and Annie Farmer were all victims of\nthe same criminal plan to sexually exploit underaged girls, which Epstein and Ms. Maxwell\ncarried out using the same methods throughout the entire course of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. (Tr. 2848)\n(“[Maxwell] ran the same playbook over and over and over again as she exploited young girls.\nThe similarities between what happened to Jane and Annie and Carolyn and Kate are incredibly\npouerful evidence of the defendant’s guilt.’’).\n\nThe government atempts to side-step this obvious inconsistency by arguing that the\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charged in Count Three involved “groom[ing] [victims] to travel to Epstein’s\nproperties for sexual abuse,” whereas Count Five involved “paying victims for so-called\n‘massage appointments,’ where they were sexually exploited.” (Opp. at 32). But “grooming”\nand travel were not exclusive to Count Three. Carolyn testified about being progressively\nintroduced to more serious sexual situations, which was a form of “grooming. (Tr. l52l-23,\nl537). She also testified that Epstein and Ms. Maxwell asked her to travel to his island. (Tr.\nl534-35). Similarly, payment and massages were not exclusive to Count Five. Jane testified\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo287", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010288.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 22 of 24\nthat Epstein gave her money after “almost every visit” to his home in Palm Beach. (Tr. 3o2).\nAnd both Jane and Annie Farmer testified about massages. (Tr. 3o8-ll; 2o83-86).\n\nThe government’s atempt to characterize Count Three as an “earlier scheme” and Count\nFive as a “later pyramid scheme” with different objects and methods is unavailing. (Opp. at 32).\nThe government’s theory, as presented to the jury, was that Epstein and Ms. Maxwell engaged in\na single <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> with a common method of operation and objective: to recruit and “groom”\nunderage girls to sexually abuse them. That theory was entirely consistent with the evidence at\ntrial. For these reasons, Counts Three and Five describe a single <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, not multiple\nconspiracies, and are therefore multiplicitous. Accordingly, the Court should enter judgment\nonly on Count Three.\n\nIi. The Court Should Grant Ms. Maxwell’s Other Motions.\n\nFor the reasons already set forth in her initial Motion, the Court should vacate Ms.\nMaxwell’s convictions as to all counts and dismiss the Indictment due to prejudicial pre-\nindictment delay. Further, the Court should enter a judgment of acquital as to all counts under\nRule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure because the government failed to prove each\nelement of the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court, in the\nalternative, (l) vacate Ms. Maxwell’s convictions on the Mann Act counts (Counts One, Three,\nand Four) and grant a new trial under Rule 33 because the convictions were based on a\nconstructive amendment and/or variance from the allegations in the Indictment, (2) enter\njudgment on only one of the three multiplicitous <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts — specifically, Count Three,\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo288", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010367.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Pagelof45\nUSDCSDNY SS\nDOCUMENT\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT ELECTRONICALLY FILED\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nUnited States of America,\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\n~ OPINION & ORDER\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nDefendant.\nALISON J. NATHAN, Circuit Judge, siting by designation:\n\nIn 2o2o, the Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell was indicted for her participation in a scheme\nto entice, transport, and traffic underage girls for sexual abuse by and with Jeffrey Epstein, her\nlongtime companion. The Government at trial presented extensive witness testimony from\nmultiple victim witnesses and others, as well as corroborating documentary and physical\nevidence. The testimony and other trial evidence established the Defendant’s role in grooming\nand recruiting underage girls and using the cover of massage to perpetrate sexual abuse.\n\nFollouing the thirteen-day trial, the Court submited to the jury the six counts in the\nIndictment. The jury deliberated for over five days and returned a verdict of guilty on five of the\nsix counts. Two of these counts of conviction charged the Defendant with substantive violations\nof federal statutes that target sexual abuse of minors—the Mann Act as to Count Four and the\nTrafficking Victims Protection Act as to Count Six. The other three counts of conviction,\nCounts One, Three, and Five, charged the Defendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to\nviolate those same statutes from l994 to 2oo4.\n\nBefore the Court are the Defendant’s post-trial motions making four alternative\narguments for vacating some or all of her five counts of conviction. First, the Defendant argues\nthat judgment may be imposed on only one of the three <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts (i.e., Counts One,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo367", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010368.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page2 of 45\nThree, and Five) because they are “multiplicitous”—meaning that they all charge the same\noffense—and therefore entry of judgment on all three counts would violate the Fifth\nAmendment’s Double Jeopardy Clause. Second, she requests under Rule 29 of the Federal Rules\nof Criminal Procedure that the Court acquit her of all counts because there is insufficient\nevidence for any rational juror to find her guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Third, the\nDefendant moves to vacate Counts One, Three, and Four under Rule 33 because, she claims, the\nconvictions were based on a constructive amendment of, or variance from, the Indictment. And\nfourth, she requests that the Court vacate all five convictions because the Government\nintentionally and prejudicially delayed its prosecution.\n\nWith one exception, the motions are denied. The Rule 29 motion challenging all counts\nof conviction is denied because the jury’s guilty verdicts were readily supported by the extensive\nwitness testimony and documentary evidence admited at trial. Further, those counts of\nconviction matched the core of criminality charged in the Indictment, presented by the\nGovernment at trial, and on which the jury was accurately instructed. The Defendant’s contrary\nclaim of a constructive amendment of or variance from the Indictment rests on an implausible\nand speculative interpretation of a single ambiguous jury note. In addition, the Court concludes\nthat the Government did not intentionally delay its prosecution and, in any event, the\nDefendant’s ability to prepare a defense was not prejudiced by any delay.\n\nThe Court does conclude, houever, that the three <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts charge the same\noffense, and, accordingly, are multiplicitous. The Government concedes that Count One is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three but argues that Count Three and Count Five nevertheless\ninvolve distinct conspiracies. The Court concludes that Count Five, like Counts One and Three,\ncharges the Defendant’s participation in the same decade-long unlawful agreement with the\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- ooolo368", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010369.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657 _ Filed o4/29/22 Page3of 45\nDefendant’s continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein. The overarching <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>—which, as\nthe Government argued and proved at trial, employed a single “playbook” to groom and sexually\nabuse underage girls—constitutes a single <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> offense with multiple victims. Because the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause prohibits the Court from imposing multiple punishments for the same\noffense, the Court will enter judgment on Count Three alone among the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts. This\nlegal conclusion in no way calls into question the factual findings made by the jury. Rather, it\nunderscores that the jury unanimously found—three times over—that the Defendant is guilty of\nconspiring with Epstein to entice, transport, and traffic underage girls for sexual abuse.\n\nI. The Court grants the Defendant’s multiplicity claim.\n\nThe Defendant was indicted on six counts: (l) <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to entice individuals under the\nage of seventeen to travel in interstate commerce with intent to engage in sexual activity illegal\nunder New York law, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l; (2) enticement of individuals under the\nage of seventeen to travel in interstate commerce with intent to engage in sexual activity illegal\nunder New York law, and aiding and abeting the same, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422, 2; (3)\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to transport individuals under the age of seventeen to travel in interstate commerce\nwith intent to engage in sexual activity illegal under New York law, in violation of l8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 37l; (4) transportation of an individual under the age of seventeen with intent to engage in\nsexual activity illegal under New York law, and aiding and abeting the same, in violation of l8\nUS.C. §§ 2423(a), 2; (5) <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to commit sex trafficking of individuals under the age of\neighteen, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l; and (6) sex trafficking of an individual under the age of\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo369", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010370.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page4of45\neighteen, and aiding and abeting the same, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ l59l, 2. S2 Indictment,\nDkt. No. l87.!\n\nIn two prior pretrial motions, the Defendant requested that the Court dismiss two of the\nthree <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts—that is, Counts One, Three, and Five—as multiplicitous, given that all\nthree were premised on the Defendant’s participation in a single criminal <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> with\nEpstein. To punish her for all three counts, she argued, would violate the Double Jeopardy\nClause. In opinions dated April l6, 2o2l, and August l3, 2o2l, the Court denied those motions\nas premature because the Double Jeopardy Clause would prohibit only multiple punishments for\nthe same offense, but not indictments for the same offense. United States v. Maxwell, 534 F.\nSupp. 3d 299, 322 (S.D.N.Y. 2o2l) (citing United States v. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 35o, 355 (2d\nCir. 2oo6)); United States v. Maxwell, No. 2o-CR-33o (AJN), 2o2l WL 359l8ol, at *5\n(S.D.N.Y. Aug. l3, 2o2l).\n\nBecause the jury convicted the Defendant on all three <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts, the Defendant\nnou requests that the Court impose judgment on only one of these counts. Maxwell Br. at l9,\nDkt. No. 6oo. The Government concedes that Counts One and Three are multiplicitous and\nagrees that the Court should not impose judgment on Count One, but it argues that Counts Three\nand Five are distinct offenses premised on distinct criminal conspiracies, and so the Court should\nimpose judgment on both. Gov. Br. at 24, Dkt. No. 62l.\n\nOn consent of both parties, the Court will not impose judgment on Count One because it\nis multiplicitous. For the reasons that follou, the Court further grants the Defendant’s motion to\nalso not enter judgment on Count Count Five because it is also multiplicitous with Count Three.\n‘The original and $2 Indictments also included two counts of perjury. See S2 Indictment Jf 28-3l. The Court\ngranted the Defendant’s motion to sever those counts for a separate trial. United States v. Maxwell, 534 F. Supp. 3d\n299, 32l (S.D.N.Y. 2o2l).\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo37o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010371.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657 Filed o4/29/22 Page5of45\nA. Applicable law\n\nThe Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment guarantees that no person shall “be\nsubject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.” U.S. Const. amend. V.\nThat guarantee “serves principally as a restraint on courts and prosecutors,” ensuring that a court\ndoes not “exceed its legislative authorization by imposing multiple punishments for the same\noffense.” Broun v. Ohio, 432 U.S. l6l, l65 (l977); see also Morris v. Reynolds, 264 F.3d 38,\n48 (2d Cir. 2ool). An indictment is multiplicitous, and therefore implicates double jeopardy,\n“when it charges a single offense as an offense multiple times, in separate counts, when, in law\nand fact, only one crime has been commited.” Maxwell, 534 F. Supp. 3d at 322 (quoting United\nStates v. Chacko, l69 F.3d l4o, l45 (2d Cir. l999)). “A claim of multiplicity cannot succeed,\nhouever, ‘unless the charged offenses are the same in fact and in law.’”” United States v. Jones,\n482 F.3d 6o, 72 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (quoting United States v. Estrada, 32o F.3d l73, l8o (2d Cir.\n2oo3)).\n\nIf the two offenses at issue are both conspiracies charged under the same statute, then the\nmultiplicity inquiry turns on whether the two conspiracies are the same “in fact,” meaning they\ninvolve the same agreement. United States v. Araujo, No. l7-CR-438 (VEC), 2ol8 WL\n3222527, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July 2, 2ol8) (citing United States v. Ansaldi, 372 F.3d ll8, l24-25\n(2d Cir. 2oo4)); United States v.

Yet “whether the evidence shous a single <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> or more than one\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> is often not determinable as a mater of law or subject to bright-line formulations.”\nJones, 482 F.3d at 72. Rather, the parties agree that the Court’s inquiry is guided by the Second\nCircuit’s Korfant factors. See, e.g., United States v. Diallo, 5o7 F. App’x 89, 9l (2d Cir. 2ol3)\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo37l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010372.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page6of45\n(summary order) (citing United States v.

Those\nfactors include:\n\n(l) the criminal offenses charged in successive indictments; (2) the overlap of\n\nparticipants; (3) the overlap of time; (4) similarity of operation; (5) the existence\n\nof common overt acts; (6) the geographic scope of the alleged conspiracies or\n\nlocation where overt acts occurred; (7) common objectives; and (8) the degree of\n\ninterdependence between alleged distinct conspiracies.\n\nUnited States v. Macchia, 35 F.3d 662, 667 (2d Cir. l994) (quoting Korfant, 77l F.2d at 662). In\napplying the Korfant factors, “no dominant factor or single touchstone” determines whether two\nallegedly distinct conspiracies “‘appear in fact and in law the same.’” /d. at 668 (quoting United\nStates v. Reiter, 848 F.2d 336, 34o (2d Cir. l988)). Moreover, “the Korfant list is not\nexhaustive, and every case must be assessed on its oun terms . . . based on the entire record.”\nUnited States v. Maslin, 356 F.3d l9l, l96 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\n\nIn assessing the evidence, the Second Circuit applies a burden-shifting framework. The\ndefendant carries the initial burden of making a non-frivolous shouing that the two counts in fact\ncharge only one <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. If met, the burden then shifts to the Government to shou, “by a\npreponderance of the evidence, that there are in fact two distinct conspiracies and that the\ndefendant is not being placed in jeopardy twice for the same crime.” United States v. Lopez, 356\nF.3d 463, 467 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (per curiam) (citing United States v. DelVecchio, 8oo F.2d 2l, 22\n(2d Cir. l986)); see also United States v.

Analysis\n\nA further summary of the two counts at issue is required. As briefly outlined above,\nCount Three of the Indictment charged the Defendant under l8 U.S.C. § 37l, the general federal\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> statute, with conspiring to violate l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a) (the Mann Act), by\ntransporting minors across state lines with the intent to engage in sexual activity criminalized by\nstate law. S2 Indictment 7 l6-l8. In this case, the relevant state offense was New York Penal\nLaw Section l3o.55, which criminalizes sexual contact with an individual knoun to be under the\nage of seventeen. Trial Tr. 3o34-35. The Count Three <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> spanned from l994 to 2oo4.\nS2 Indictment 4 l7. As the Government explained in its summation, the jury could convict the\nDefendant under Count Three based on evidence related to Jane, Carolyn, and Annie Farmer,\nthree victims who testified at trial. Trial Tr. at 2895.”\n\nCount Five of the Indictment also charged the Defendant under l8 U.S.C. § 37l, but for\nconspiring to violate l8 U.S.C. §§ l59l(a) & (b) (the Trafficking Victims Protection Act), by\ntrafficking individuals under the age of eighteen for commercial sex acts that affect interstate\ncommerce. S2 Indictment 9{ 22-24. Count Five’s <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> spanned from 2ool to 2oo4. Id.\n423. The Government explained to the jury that it could convict the Defendant on Count Five\nbased on evidence related to Carolyn and Virginia Roberts. Trial Tr. at 2896.\n\nThe Defendant primarily contends that Count Five is a subset of, is subsumed in, or is\notherwise too similar to Count Three under the Korfant factors. The Court agrees. Although\nsome Korfant factors favor the Government, the weight of the factors—supplemented by a\nreview of the Government’s case presented at trial—demonstrates that the Government has not\n: The Court permited certain victim witnesses to testify using a pseudonym or first name. See Nov. l, 2o2l Tr. at\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo373", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010374.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657 _ Filed o4/29/22 Page8of45\nmet its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the counts are not\nmultiplicitous.\n\nThe offenses charged and common objectives. Both Counts Three and Five are charged\nunder the same statute, l8 U.S.C. § 37l, for <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to commit an offense against the United\nStates. But going beyond this “general level” of similarity, the statutory objectives of the two\ncounts differ. Macchia, 35 F.3d at 669. Count Three is a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to violate § 2423(a) and\nCount Five a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to violate § l59l. These differing statutory objectives entail legal\ndifferences. Count Three, for example, charges unlawful sexual activity (defined as sexual\ntouching of a minor) while Count Five charges commercial sexual activity with a minor. And\neach provision defines “minor” differently: under seventeen years old for Count Three but under\neighteen years old for Count Five. Further, Count Three requires an agreement with intent to\ntransport across state lines, while Count Five’s agreement requires only intent of sexual activity\nthat affects interstate commerce. These differences push the first Korfant factor in the\nGovernment’s favor. See Estrada, 32o F.3d at l82 (distinguishing between a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to\ndistribute cocaine and one to distribute crack); United States v. Villa, No. 3:l2-CR-4o (JBA),\n2ol4 WL 252ol3, at *4 (D. Conn. Jan. 22, 2ol4), aff'd, 744 F. App’x 7l6 (2d Cir. 2ol8)\n(summary order) (distinguishing between a § 37l <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to “commit theft from an interstate\nshipment and to transport stolen property across state lines” and one to “sell stolen property’’).\n\nThe Government, houever, errs in suggesting that this factor alone is “fatal” to the\nDefendant’s multiplicity claim. Gov. Br. at 29. To the contrary, no single Korfant factor is\ndominant or dispositive. Macchia, 35 F.3d at 668. And courts in this district have found two\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts to be the same offense even when they have different statutory objectives\nbecause both counts can arise from the same agreement. E.g., Hernandez, 2oo9 WL 3l69226, at\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo374", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010375.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page9of 45\n\n*ll (concluding that conspiracies to defraud the United States and to commit mail and wire\nfraud were the same <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> as earlier <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to use or transfer false IDs). After all, “[a]\nsingle agreement to commit several crimes constitutes one <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.” United States v. Broce,\n488 U.S. 563, 57o-7l (l989). The Government implicitly conceded this point of law when it\nagreed that Counts One and Three were multiplicitous. Count One charges a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to\nentice minors to travel across state lines in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2422 while Count Three\ncharges a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to transport minors across state lines in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a).\nDespite distinct statutory predicates for these two § 37l conspiracies, the Government did not\ncontest that they were the same offense. Though Count Five is unquestionably less similar to\nCount Three than is Count One, the difference in statutory predicates does not end the mater. It\nis well established that a single <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> can contain multiple objectives, particularly if the\nobjectives share important similarities, as they do here. United States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88,\nl48 (2d Cir. l998) (citing United States v. Aracri, 968 F.2d l5l2, l5l8 (2d Cir. l992)).\n\nOverlap of participants. The participants in the two conspiracies in Counts Three and\nFive substantially overlap with one another. Of course, the defendant will always overlap\nbetween two allegedly multiplicitous conspiracies, so their participation in both conspiracies has\nnegligible significance. Villa, 2ol4 WL 252ol3, at *5. More importantly here, Epstein was the\nDefendant’s primary coconspirator in both conspiracies, and the Government argued that in both\nconspiracies the Defendant played the same role of acquiring underage girls for Epstein to\nsexually abuse. They were, the Government explained, “partners in crime” over the decade\nalleged in the Indictment. F.g., Trial Tr. at 34, 2842, 2885; see also id. at 4l (“For a decade, the\ndefendant played an essential role in this scheme.”). This overlap in key participants, and in core\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo375", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010376.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Pageloof 45\nroles played by those participants, significantly favors the Defendant as to the second Korfant\nfactor. See Macchia, 35 F.3d at 669; Hernandez, 2oo9 WL 3l69226, at *ll.\n\nThe Government responds that the Count Five <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> included Sarah Kellen, who\nwas not involved in Count Three. Yet Kellen received far less atention than other conspirators\nin the Government’s case, being mentioned only briefly in the Government’s opening statement\nand closing arguments. F.g., Trial Tr. at 2876 (noting, “and sometimes Sarah Kellen would call,\ntoo”). Conspiracies often change membership without forming a new, distinct <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>,\nparticularly if key members of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> remain over the course of a decade. See United\nStates v. Eppolito, 543 F.3d 25, 48 (2d Cir. 2oo8). Kellen’s participation beginning in 2ool\ntherefore does not shift the import of the second Korfant factor.\n\nOverlap of time. The time periods of the two counts overlap completely. Namely, Count\nFive’s period of 2ool to 2oo4 is “wholly within the time frame” of Count Three from l994 to\n2oo4, which substantially favors the Defendant on this Korfant factor. United States v.\nCalderone, 982 F.2d 42, 47 (2d Cir. l992). The Government’s atempt to minimize this factor\nby noting that most overt acts for Count Three occurred in the l99os is simply not reflected in\nthis circuit’s case law. See, e.g., Macchia, 35 F.3d at 669 (focusing on the overlap in time frame\nalleged in the indictment). The overlap in time here raises the inference that one <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>\nwholly encompasses the other, and that inference tips in the Defendant’s favor. See Araujo,\n2ol8 WL 3222527, at *6.\n\nSimilarity of operations. Counts Three and Five involve significant similarities in\noperations. The methods by which the Defendant groomed and facilitated the sexual abuse of\nminor victims was a central focus of both parties’ cases at trial. The Government called as an\nexpert witness Dr. Lisa Rocchio, who identified the typical steps in sexual abusers’ grooming of\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo376", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010378.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Pagel2 of 45\na decade,” having both the “earlier phase” and the later “pyramid scheme.” Trial Tr. at 4o; see\nalso, e.g., id. at 2886 (describing 2ool as “the beginning of the pyramid scheme of abuse”). But\na single <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> can enter “two or more phases or spheres of operation” without creating a\ndiscontinuity in the underlying unlawful agreement, particularly if the same people are serving\nthe same roles in each phase. United States v. Pena, 846 F. App’x 49, 5l (2d Cir. 2o2l)\n(summary order) (quoting United States v. Berger, 224 F.3d lo7, ll4-l5 (2d Cir. 2ooo)); see\nalso United States v. Maldonado-Rivera, 922 F.2d 934, 963 (2d Cir. l99o). Notably, the\nGovernment, after distinguishing between earlier and later phases in the patern of abuse,\nimmediately emphasized that “[flor a decade, the defendant played an essential role in this\nscheme,” blurring any difference between the two phases. Trial Tr. at 4l.\n\nMoreover, though these phases did involve some differing means to acquire minor\nvictims, the differences presented at trial were not as great as the Government suggests in its\nbrief. As to both counts, both before and after 2ool, the Government emphasized that massage\nwas a primary means by which the Defendant and Epstein normalized bodily contact and also the\nmeans by which the Defendant and Epstein commonly instigated instances of sexual abuse.\nCompare id. at 4o (“You will learn that in the l99os, they used the cover of mentoring young\ngirls .. . to introduce massage . . . and that you will learn that they used these so called massages\nas a way to sexually abuse the victims.”’), with id. at 4l (“Under this pyramid scheme of abuse,\nthe defendant could just call girls to schedule massage appointments and hand them cash\nafterwards ....”); e.g., id. at 35 (“You will learn that the cover of massage was the primary way\nthe defendant and Epstein lured girls into sexual abuse.”’), 2852 (“Again and again throughout\nthis trial, you heard about hou these girls were asked to perform sexualized massages on Jeffrey\nEpstein.”).\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo378", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010379.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Pagel3 of 45\n\nFurther, in both counts, the witnesses testified that they received financial gifts and\npayments as a means by which the Defendant and Epstein acquired their victims’ trust and\nextended the period of sexual abuse. F.g., id. at 3o2 (Jane testified that she was given money\n“Ta|lmost every visit” and that Epstein paid for things like voice lessons and clothes). The\nGovernment emphasized such financial gifts as one step in the Defendant’s playbook of\ngrooming. E.g., id. at 285l (“Then came the next step in the playbook: Making these girls feel\nspecial, giving them gifts, making friends, giving them money, promising to help with their\nfutures, promises like sending Annie on a trip to Thailand or helping to pay for Jane’s voice\nlessons and tuition.”), 289o (“[Jane] told you that Epstein gave her money and gifts and paid for\nschool. That money wasn’t free .... That is inducement, that is enticement, that is coercion.’’).\nThe financial quid pro quo may have become more explicit beginning in 2ool, but that shift in\napproach is not nearly so dramatic as to suggest that the Defendant and Epstein at that time\nentered “a wholly new agreement” with a new “conspiratorial objective.” Haji v. Miller, 584 F.\nSupp. 2d 498, 5l9 (E.D.N.Y. 2oo8). The similarity-of-operations factor therefore favors the\nDefendant.\n\nOverlap of geographic scope. There is some, albeit incomplete, geographic overlap\nbetween the two counts. Count Three focused on travel to New York because the ultimate\nobjective of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> was to transport minors to New York to engage in criminal sexual\nactivity in violation of New York law. Count Five, by contrast, focused on Epstein’s residence\nin Florida, where Carolyn and Virginia Roberts were paid to give Epstein sexualized massages.\nNevertheless, some geographic overlap between the two counts remained. All four witnesses\ntestified about sexual conduct by the Defendant or Epstein in locations other than New York,\nwhether Florida, New Mexico, or London. The Court admited such testimony concerning\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo379", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010380.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Pagel4of 45\nsexual conduct outside of New York as relevant to Count Three because it tended to establish the\nexistence of a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> and of the Defendant and Epstein’s intent to abuse the victims in New\nYork. In sum, the same locations—particularly Florida—were part of the Government’s case for\nboth counts. And over time, a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>’s “shifting emphasis in the location of operations\ndo[es] not necessarily require a finding of more than one <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.” Eppolito, 543 F.3d at 48\n(quoting Jones, 482 F.3d at 72). This factor therefore favors the Defendant or, at least, is neutral.\n\nCommon overt acts. The Government correctly notes that the overt acts provided to the\njury for Counts Three and Five are distinct. See Jury Charge, Dkt. No. 565 at 49-5o. This factor\ntherefore tips touard the Government—but only slightly. A number of the overt acts listed for\nCount Three could have been prosecuted under Count Five but for the fact that l8 U.S.C. § l59l,\nthe Trafficking Victims Protection Act, was not enacted until 2ooo. See Gov. Br. at 28. That\nsome identical overt acts were not listed for both conspiracies is therefore more a function of\nlegal timing than an indication of two distinct conspiracies. Cf Hernandez, 2oo9 WL 3l69226,\nat *l2.\n\nInterdependence. Counts Three and Five are not interdependent because the success or\nfailure of one <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> is independent of the success or failure of the other. See Macchia, 35\nF.3d at 67l. In other words, the success of the Defendant and Epstein’s scheme to abuse Carolyn\nfrom 2ool to 2oo4 was not made more or less likely by the prior success or failure to abuse Jane,\nAnnie, or any other underage girl. This factor, houever, makes litle difference in the final\nanalysis if “what was ultimately proven was one common <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.” Maslin, 356 F.3d at l97.\n\nThe Government’s theory at trial. The Second Circuit has instructed district courts to\nconsider not only the enumerated Korfant factors but to consider the entire record. See id. at\nl96; United States v. Olmeda, 46l F.3d 27l, 282 (2d Cir. 2oo6). In Maslin, the Second Circuit\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo38o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010381.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Pagel5of 45\nfirst explained that applying the Korfant factors led to the conclusion that successive\nprosecutions for conspiracies to distribute marijuana were barred by double jeopardy, but then\ncontinued, stating that “several additional factors . . . not directly addressed in Korfant . . . further\npoint touard a finding of double jeopardy,” namely, “the fact that the Government, in its opening\nand closing arguments, presented both cases to the jury as broad conspiracies of an essentially\nidentical nature.” 356 F.3d at l97. The same is true here. As explained above, the\nGovernment’s opening statement and closing arguments presented a theory of a singular\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, highlighting: The degree of similarity between each victim witness’s experience\nover a decade; the common “playbook” that the Defendant ran “over and over and over again,”\nTrial Tr. at 2848; and the tight partnership between the Defendant and Epstein. And each of\nthose features was accompanied by references to a singular “scheme” to abuse all victim\nwitnesses. /d. at 36, 2843, 2853. At botom, the case presented to the jury by the Government\nwas of a single decade-long <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> by the Defendant and Epstein to sexually abuse underage\ngirls. Having pursued such a broad and encompassing <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, the Government cannot nou\nclaim, and cannot carry its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence, that Count\nFive was legally and factually distinct. See Maslin, 356 F.3d at l97.\n\nBecause Count Three and Count Five are multiplicitous, the proper remedy is to enter\njudgment on only one of the counts. See Josephberg, 459 F.3d at 355 (“If the jury convicts on\nmore than one multiplicitous count, the defendant’s right not to suffer multiple punishments for\nthe same offense will be protected by having the court enter judgment on only one of the\nmultiplicitous counts.” (citing Ball v. United States, 47o U.S. 856, 865 (l985))). Because Count\nFive is factually subsumed by Count Three, the Court will impose judgment only on Count\nThree. The Court emphasizes, houever, that finding Count Five to be multiplicitous “does not\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo38l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010385.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Pagel9 of 45\ncommercial sex act; and (4) the Defendant’s acts were in or affecting interstate commerce; or\nthat the Defendant aided and abeted the same.

Trial Tr.\nl527, l53o. Carolyn explained the sexual activities that occurred during the massages. /d. at\nl544-47. Carolyn testified that the Defendant saw her naked in the massage room and continued\nto call Carolyn to schedule appointments with Epstein. /d. at l538. She recalled a specific\nincident when she was fourteen in which she was naked in the massage room and the Defendant\ntouched her breasts and commented that Carolyn “had a great body for Mr. Epstein and his\nfriends.” Jd. at l536-38. Carolyn testified that the Defendant knew that she was under the age\nof eighteen and continued to call her to schedule appointments with Epstein after learning that\nfact. Id. at l535. Carolyn further testified that she received money in exchange for performing\nsexualized massages on Epstein. E.g., id. l523. She recalled that while money was often left on\nthe sink outside of the massage room, the Defendant paid her directly after massages on one or\ntwo occasions. /d. at l54o-4l. Carolyn’s testimony was corroborated by Shawn, Carolyn’s\nboyfriend at the time, and physical evidence including phone message pads. This evidence was\nplainly sufficient for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant commited\nsex trafficking of an individual under eighteen, or aided and abeted Epstein in doing so.?\n\n3 Tf the Court were to conclude that Count Five is not multiplicitous, it would deny the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion\nas to Count Five. Count Five charged the Defendant with participating in a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to commit sex trafficking of\nindividuals under the age of eighteen from about 2ool to 2oo4. The evidence that supports the Defendant’s\nconviction of Count Six, the substantive count, also supports the Count Five <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> conviction. Additionally,\nJuan Alessi testified that the Defendant approached Virginia Roberts in a parking lot and that he then saw her at\nEpstein’s Palm Beach residence later that day. Trial Tr. at 84l-43. Documentary evidence, including flight records,\nestablished that Virginia was under the age of eighteen when she met the Defendant and Epstein.

The Government was required to prove beyond a\nreasonable doubt: (l) that two or more persons entered into the unlawful agreement charged; (2)\nthe Defendant knouingly and willfully became a member of that <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>; (3) one of the\nmembers of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> knouingly commited at least one overt act; and (4) the overt act that\nthe jury found to have been commited was commited in furtherance of that <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. Jury\nCharge at 4l.\n\nThe Court concludes that the trial evidence supported a finding of guilt beyond a\nreasonable doubt for each element of Count Three. The Government presented evidence that\ncould lead a reasonable juror to conclude that the Defendant worked with Epstein between l994\nand 2oo4 to groom minor victims in an effort to transport them to New York to engage in sexual\nactivity illegal under New York law. As noted above, Jane testified in detail about her travel to\nNew York with the Defendant and Epstein where she was sexually abused. Trial Tr. at 3l9-2o.\nJane also testified about the steps taken by the Defendant and Epstein to make her feel\ncomfortable before they began engaging in sexual activity with her and inviting her to travel. Jd.\n299-3o3; see also id. at 348 (Jane testifying that their behavior touard her made her “feel\nspecial’).\n\nOther witnesses testified to similar conduct. Annie testified that after she met Epstein in\nNew York, she was invited to travel with the Defendant and Epstein to New Mexico when she\nwas sixteen. /d. at 2o68-69, 2o75-77. She testified that on this trip, the Defendant and Epstein\ntook her shopping and to the movies. /d. at 2o8o-8l. She also testified that the Defendant\nEpstein in exchange for money. Trial Tr. l5l8-24. The Court concludes that the evidence related to Carolyn and\nVirginia was sufficient for the jury to convict the Defendant on Count Five.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo386", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010387.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 2l of 45\nencouraged her to massage Epstein’s feet, and that the Defendant then gave her a massage during\nwhich the Defendant touched Annie’s breasts. /d. at 2o83-86. As noted above, Carolyn testified\nthat the Defendant paid her for performing sexualized massages on Epstein. She also testified\nthat Epstein and the Defendant asked her about her life and family and discussed sexual topics\nwith her. /d. at l533-36. Epstein then invited her to travel generally, and the Defendant invited\nher to travel to Epstein’s private island in the Caribbean. /d. at l535, l54o. A reasonable juror\ncould have concluded that the Defendant’s and Epstein’s actions, including their efforts to\nnormalize sexual conduct and invitations for underage girls to travel to New Mexico and the\nCaribbean, were in furtherance of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>’s goal of transporting minors to New York for\nthe purpose of engaging in sexual activity illegal under New York law. Finally, although the\njury was instructed that it could not convict the Defendant solely on the basis of Kate’s\ntestimony, her testimony corroborated the testimony of other witnesses as to the Defendant’s\nknouledge and role in the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. /d. at ll77-9o. The Court concludes that this evidence\nwas sufficient for a reasonable jury to convict the Defendant for conspiring to transport\nindividuals in interstate commerce with intent to engage in sexual activity illegal under New\nYork law.\n\nAccordingly, the Court denies the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion for a judgment of\nacquital.\nIl. The Court denies the Defendant’s motion claiming a constructive amendment or\n\nprejudicial variance.\n\nThe Defendant also seeks to vacate her convictions as to Counts One, Three, and Four\n(the Mann Act counts) pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33. She contends that the\njury convicted her of intending that Jane engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, rather than\nNew York, thus resulting in a constructive amendment of the Indictment, or in the alternative, a\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo387", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010390.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 24 of 45\njustice so requires.” Fed.

No constructive amendment occurred.\n\nCount Four charged the Defendant with transportation of an individual under the age of\nseventeen with intent to engage in illegal sexual activity, and Count Three charged a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>\nto do the same. The core of criminality of these counts, the parties agree, was a scheme by\nEpstein and the Defendant to cause underage girls to travel to New York with the intent that they\nwould engage in sexual activity in violation of New York law. Gov. Br. at 6; Maxwell Br. at 9.4\n\nThe Defendant contends that a jury note received during deliberations revealed that the\njury convicted the Defendant on a crime different from this core of criminality. Namely, the\nDefendant argues that in convicting her of Count Four, the jury found she intended for Jane to\nengage in sexual activity in New Mexico, without finding that she intended for Jane to engage in\nsexual activity in New York. Maxwell Reply at 2. She argues the Court’s decision to refer the\njury back to the charge and refusal to give a supplemental instruction was error. As a result of\nthis same error, she says, the jury also improperly convicted her of Count Three. For the reasons\nthat follou, the Court concludes that there is not a “substantial likelihood” that the Defendant\nwas “convicted of an offense other than that charged in the indictment.” D ’Amelio, 683 F.3d at\n4l6 (quoting United States v. Mollica, 849 F.2d 723, 729 (2d Cir. l988)).\n\n* The Defendant also contends that her conviction on Count One was the result of a constructive amendment.\nBecause the Court will not enter judgment on Count One per the parties’ consent, the Court does not address Count\nOne here. In any event, the Defendant’s argument as to why Count One was constructively amended is the same as\nher argument as to Count Three, and the Court’s analysis would be the same. See Maxwell Br. at l6.\n24\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo39o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010391.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 25 of 45\nl. The Court’s instructions, the evidence at trial, and the Government’s\nsummation captured the core of criminality.\n\nFirst, the Court’s instructions to the jury during trial and after the close of evidence\ncaptured the core of criminality. As explained above, the Indictment charged the Defendant with\nfour counts in violation of the Mann Act, each predicated on a violation of New York Penal Law\nSection l3o.55. That provision of New York law criminalizes sexual contact with an individual\nknoun to be under the age of seventeen. Jury Charge at 24. The jury charge made clear that this\nprovision of New York law served as the predicate offense for Counts Two and Four. See id. at\n23-24 (Count Two), 28 (Count Four, instructing the jury to decide whether the Defendant had\nknouingly transported Jane with the intent to engage in sexual activity with Jane in violation of\nNew York Penal Law Section l3o.55, as alleged in the Indictment). The Court also accepted the\nDefendant’s requested edits that further clarified that the predicate state offense was New York\nlaw. See, e.g., Request to Charge at l9, 23, 26, 3o, 3l, Dkt. No. 4lo-l; Jury Charge at 2o, 24,\n26, 28 (specifying, e.g., that the predicate state offense was “New York law,” rather than an\nunspecified “criminal offense”).\n\nThe jury charge also clearly instructed on the role of New York law in the jury’s\nassessment of the Mann Act <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts, Counts One and Three. The charge explained\nthat the object of the conspiracies was a violation of the same New York law at issue in Count\nTwo. See Jury Charge at 44-45. In particular, the objects of Counts One and Three were the\nenticement of minors to travel and the transport of minors, respectively, with the intent to engage\nin sexual activity illegal under New York law. See id. As for the overt acts, the Court, at the\nparties’ request, did not provide the jury with a copy of the Indictment. Trial Tr. at 278l-82.\nRather, the charge specified the relevant overt acts. Jury Charge at 49-5o. For Counts One and\nThree, this included the instruction: “the Indictment alleges as follous: .. . (2) In or about l996,\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo39l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010392.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 26 of 45\nwhen Jane was under the age of l7, Jane was enticed to travel from Florida to New York for\npurposes of sexually abusing her at the New York Residence, in violation of New York Penal\nLaw, Section l3o.55.” Id. at 49.\n\nThe Court also gave two limiting instructions to ensure that the jury’s consideration of\ncertain relevant evidence was properly focused on the core of criminality. These instructions\npertained to testimony about sexual activity that was not criminal conduct under New York Penal\nLaw Section l3o.55. The first limiting instruction pertained to Kate. This instruction informed\nthe jury that it could not convict the Defendant on Counts One and Three solely on the basis of\nKate’s testimony because Kate could not be considered a victim of the crimes charged. Trial Tr.\nat ll67-68. This was so because she was older than seventeen at the time of the events, and, as\nexplained, the object of the charged conspiracies was transport with intent to engage in sexual\nconduct in violation of New York Penal Law Section l3o.55, which criminalizes sexual contact\nwith individuals under the age of seventeen. See Nov. l, 2o2l Tr. at 67-68. The second limiting\ninstruction pertained to Annie, who testified about sexual contact in New Mexico only. The\ninstruction explained that her testimony about sexual conduct did not describe “illegal sexual\nactivity” as alleged in the Indictment, which was a legal term that the Court would explain at the\nend of the case. Trial Tr. at 2o48-49. This was so because, as explained, the object of the\ncharged conspiracies was a violation of New York law, not New Mexico law. Both limiting\ninstructions explained that the jury could determine that the testimony was relevant evidence.\nThat was so because such evidence tended to establish the Defendant’s intent that transport of a\nminor victim to New York was for the purpose of sexual activity illegal under New York law.\nThe Defendant concedes this point as to testimony about sexual activity in states other than New\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR- ooolo392", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010401.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 35 of 45\nunderstanding. See D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at 4l6. Accordingly, the Court concludes that no\nconstructive amendment resulted as to Count Four.\n\n3. No constructive amendment occurred as to Count Three.\n\nThe Defendant’s argument as to constructive amendment of Count Three, <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to\ntransport, wholly depends on her theory as to Count Four.’ She argues that since it is “clear” that\nthe jury convicted the Defendant of Count Four based only on Jane’s New Mexico testimony, it\nmust have convicted on the same basis for the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts. Maxwell Br. at l6. Because\nno constructive amendment resulted as to Count Four, this argument is unavailing. But even if\nthe Court were persuaded that the jury note revealed that the jury convicted the Defendant of\nCount Four on that basis, the note pertained only to Count Four and provided no basis to\nspeculate as to the jury’s conviction of Count Three. Moreover, it is not substantially likely that\nthe jury convicted the Defendant of Count Three on Jane’s New Mexico testimony alone. As\ndescribed in detail above in the Court’s denial of the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion, the\nGovernment presented evidence that Annie and Carolyn were also victims of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.\nAccordingly, even if a constructive amendment resulted as to Count Four, vacatur would still not\nbe warranted as to Count Three.\n\nC. No prejudicial variance occurred.\n\nIn the alternative, the Defendant argues that she was substantially prejudiced because the\nIndictment did not contain any allegations that Jane was sexually abused in New Mexico. She\ntherefore claims she was unfairly surprised by its introduction. For purposes of this motion, the\nCourt will assume that Jane’s testimony regarding New Mexico constituted a variance from the\n° As noted above, because the Court will not enter judgment on Count One on the parties’ consent, the Court\naddresses only Count Three here. In any event, the Defendant’s arguments as to why Counts One and Three were\nconstructively amended are the same.

A Jury Must Determine the End Date of Criminal Conduct that Dictates\n\nWhich Guidelines Book Applies Consistent with the Ex Post Facto Clause.\n\nAs set forth above, it would be a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause for the Court to\nsentence Ms. Maxwell under the 2oo4 Guidelines absent a finding that the offense conduct\ncontinued past November l, 2oo4. That finding must be made by a jury, not the sentencing\ncourt.

See Peugh, 569\nU.S. at 532-33 (“[T]here is an ex post facto violation when a defendant is sentenced under\nGuidelines promulgated after he commited his criminal acts and the new version provides a\nhigher applicable Guidelines sentencing range than the version in place at the time of the\noffense.”). An ex post facto violation is an ex post facto violation regardless of whether the\nincreased penalty resulted from a change in the statute or a change in the Guidelines. Hence, if\nthe end date of the offense conduct dictates whether it is permissible to apply a later Guidelines\nbook consistent with the Ex Post Facto Clause, the jury must find that fact.\n\nHere, the S2 Indictment alleges only that the criminal conduct ended “in or about 2oo4”\nand does not specify whether the conduct continued into November and December 2oo4. Nor\nwas the jury asked to make a specific finding as to the end date of the offense conduct. Because\nthe jury did not make the necessary factual finding, the Court cannot apply the 2oo4 Guidelines\nand must instead apply the 2oo3 Guidelines.°\n\nB. The Trial Record Is Insufficient to Support a Finding that the Offense\n\nConduct Continued Past November l, 2oo4.\n\nEven if the Court can determine the end date of the offense conduct for Guidelines\n\npurposes, the record does not support a finding that the conduct extended past November l,\n3 Although the issue is properly framed as an ex post facto issue, it would also violate Ms. Maxwell’s Sixth\nAmendment rights for the Court, and not the jury, to determine when the offense conduct ended.

Booker, 543 U.S.\n22o (2oo5); see also Julian, 427 F.3d at 482 (failure to have the jury determine the end date of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> for ex\npost facto purposes was a violation of the defendant’s Sixth Amendment rights).\n\n4\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo425", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010430.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page l3 of 29\nvariance would provide just punishment for the offense and promote respect for the law because\nit would punish Ms. Maxwell only for the conduct for which she was directly responsible, rather\nthan artificially inflating her sentence based on two months’ worth of Epstein’s criminal conduct\nin which she was not involved.\n\nThere is no evidence in the record that Ms. Maxwell did anything in furtherance of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> in November or December 2oo4. In fact, the evidence clearly shoued that by that\ntime, Ms. Maxwell was in a commited relationship with another man and Sarah Kellen had\ntaken over responsibility for scheduling the massage appointments at the Palm Beach residence.\nMs. Maxwell’s assistant, Cimberly Espinosa, testified that by 2oo2 Ms. Maxwell had “moved\non” from Epstein, had stopped coming to the office, and had begun a long-term relationship with\nTed Wait. (Tr. 237o-7l, 2374, 2378-8o). Juan Alessi testified that Sarah Kellen, whom he\nrecalled seeing for the first time touards the end of his employment in 2oo2, “immediately took\nover” responsibility for answering the phones and scheduling the massage appointments at the\nPalm Beach residence as soon as she was hired. (Tr. 832-33). Carolyn testified that Ms.\nMaxwell called her to schedule massage appointments only in “the first year or two” and that\nSarah Kellen called her thereafter. (Tr. l527). In sum, the record is clear that by 2oo2 or 2oo3 at\nthe latest Ms. Maxwell had stopped actively participating in the offense conduct and had been\nreplaced by Kellen.\n\nApplying the 2oo4 Guidelines would significantly increase Ms. Maxwell’s sentencing\nrange based on a finding by a mere preponderance that her co-conspirator Epstein engaged in\noffense conduct in the final two months of 2oo4 that Ms. Maxwell had nothing to do with and\nwas not personally responsible for. That result would be fundamentally unjust and contrary to\nthe purposes of sentencing. See United States v. Reuter, 463 F.3d 792, 793 (7\" Cir. 2oo6)\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo43o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010440.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 23 of 29\nthat she did so in connection with the offense conduct related to “Jane,” Annie Farmer, or\nCarolyn. The aggravating role enhancement therefore does not apply to any of the three offense\ngroups.\n\nB. The Criminal Activity Was Not “Otherwise Extensive”\n\nEven if the Court finds that Ms. Maxwell supervised another “participant,” the record\ndoes not support a finding that the criminal activity related to “Jane,” Annie Farmer, or Carolyn\nwas “otherwise extensive,” as the government contends.’ Under the Guidelines, the Court must\ntreat each minor victim separately and consider whether the enhancement applies based solely on\nthe criminal activity related to that minor victim. See USSG § 2Gl.3, cmt. n.6 (“[S]ubsection\n(d)(l) directs that if the relevant conduct of an offense of conviction includes travel or\ntransportation to engage in a commercial sex act or prohibited sexual conduct in respect to more\nthan one minor ... each such minor shall be treated as if contained in a separate count of\nconviction.”). For example, the government cannot use conduct from the 2ool-2oo4 time period\nrelated to Carolyn to justify applying the aggravating role enhancement to the criminal activity in\nl994-l997 related to “Jane” or in l996 related to Annie Farmer.\n\nThe government nevertheless atempts to justify the enhancement as to each of the three\nminor victims by making a broad assertion about the nature and scope of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> as a\nwhole, rather than making an individualized determination that the criminal activity was\n“otherwise extensive” as to each. (See PSR at 59). Because that is insufficient to establish that\nthe criminal activity was “otherwise extensive,” Ms. Maxwell should, at most, be subject to a\ntwo-point enhancement under USSG § 3Bl.l(c).\n\n° The government does not argue that the aggravating role enhancement applies because the criminal activity\ninvolved “five or more participants,” conceding that the trial record does not support the conclusion that five or\nmore people criminally participated in the offense conduct.\nIo\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo44o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010441.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 24 of 29\nIV. The Two-Point “Undue Influence” Enhancement Under USSG § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B)\n\nDoes Not Apply.\n\nFinally, it would be improper for the Court to apply a two-level enhancement on the\ngrounds that a participant in the criminal activity “unduly influenced a minor to engage in\nprohibited sexual conduct.” USSG § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B). First, it would constitute impermissible\ndouble-counting to apply § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B) to the offense conduct related to “Jane,” Annie\nFarmer, and Carolyn because it would punish Ms. Maxwell for the same harm that was fully\naccounted for in the base offense level for Counts Three, Four, and Six. “Impermissible double\ncounting occurs when one part of the Guidelines is applied to increase the defendant’s sentence\nto reflect the kind of harm that has already been fully accounted for by another part of the\nGuidelines.” United States v. Watkins, 667 F.3d 254, 26l (2d Cir. 2ol2). Ms. Maxwell was\nconvicted of conspiring to “entice” and “coerce” minors to travel to engage in prohibited sexual\nconduct and “enticing” minors to engage in commercial sex acts. (S2 Ind. 4] l2, 24, 27).'°\nWebster’s Dictionary defines the word “entice” to mean “to atract artfully or adroitly or by\narousing hope or desire; tempt” and the further explains that the word “tempt” “implies the\npresenting of an atraction so strong that it overcomes the restraints of conscience or beter\njudgment.”!! Similarly, Webster’s Dictionary defines the word “coerce” to mean “to compel to\nan act or choice” and further explains that the word “compel” “typically suggests overcoming of\nresistance or unwillingness by an irresistible force.”'* Accordingly, the base offense level for\n!o Count Three charged a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to transport minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity. S2 Ind. {f\nl6-l9. Although this offense does not contain an element of “enticement” or “coercion,” the offense conduct for\nCounts One, Three, and Five (the three <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts) was consolidated under Count Three for the purposes of\nsentencing, pursuant to the Court’s order.

Throughout its investigation,\nthe Government folloued the facts where they led, without fear or favor.\n\nB. The Charges\n\nOn June 29, 2o2o, a grand jury siting in this District returned an indictment charging the\ndefendant in six counts. (Dkt. No. l). On July 2, 2o2o, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI’’)\narrested the defendant. (PSR 4 77).

Count One of\nthe Indictment charged the defendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein and others to entice\nminors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts from in or about l994 through in or about 2oo4, in\nviolation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l. Count Two charged the defendant with enticing Minor Victim-l to\ntravel to engage in illegal sex acts, and aiding and abeting the same, in violation l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422\nand 2.

Count Four charged the defendant with transporting Minor Victim-l to\nparticipate in illegal sex acts, and aiding and abeting the same, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2423\nand 2. Count Five charged the defendant with participating in a sex trafficking <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> between\napproximately 2ool and 2oo4, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l.

Summary of Proof at Trial\n\nOn November 29, 2o2l, the defendant proceeded to trial on Counts One though Six.! On\nDecember 29, 2o2l, the jury returned a guilty verdict on Counts One, Three, Four, Five, and Six.\nThe proof at trial established that over the course of a decade, the defendant facilitated and\nparticipated in the sexual abuse of multiple young girls. From l994 to 2oo4, the defendant and\nEpstein worked together to identify girls, groom them, and then entice them to travel and transport\nthem to Epstein’s properties in New York, Florida, New Mexico, and elsewhere. (PSR § 22). The\ngirls—some of whom were as young as l4 years old—were then sexually abused, often under the\nguise of a “massage.” (/d.).\n\nBeginning in approximately l99l, the defendant had a close and intimate relationship with\nEpstein. (PSR ¥ 23). The defendant was Epstein’s girlfriend for many years, until in or about the\nearly 2ooos; after that point, the defendant and Epstein remained close friends. (/d.). For over a\ndecade, the defendant traveled with Epstein, a multi-millionaire, on his private planes and mingled\nwith rich and famous people. (/d.). As the defendant wrote in an essay, she and Epstein were “a\ncouple” who were “rarely apart,” “great partners,” and “the best of friends.” (/d.). The defendant\nenjoyed a life of extraordinary luxury with Epstein. (/d.). The defendant and Epstein spent time\ntogether in Epstein’s various properties, including his mansion on the Upper East Side in\nManhatan, his villa in Palm Beach, his ranch in New Mexico, his apartment in Paris, and his\nprivate island in the U.S. Virgin Islands. (/d.). During the timeframe of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, Maxwell\nreceived exceptional benefits from Epstein. Beyond the lavish lifestyle that she enjoyed side-by-\n' On April l6, 2o2l, the Court granted the defendant’s motion to sever the perjury charges for a\nseparate trial. (Dkt. No. 2o7). The Government intends to move to dismiss the perjury counts at\nthe time of sentencing in light of the victims’ significant interests in bringing closure to this mater\nand avoiding the trauma of testifying again. (Dkt. No. 574).\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo542", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010543.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page8of55\nside with Epstein, Maxwell also received a tounhouse that Epstein bought for her in New York\nCity, and Epstein transferred a total of approximately $23 million to Maxwell during the timeframe\nof the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. (/d.).\n\nIn addition to her role as Epstein’s girlfriend, the defendant also supervised Epstein’s\nhouseholds and enjoyed a lifestyle of extraordinary wealth. (/d.). The defendant relished her role\nas “the lady of the house.” (PSR 4 24). When the defendant took charge of Epstein’s homes, she\nimposed strict rules for staff. For example, the defendant helped author and implement a\nhousehold manual, which contained rules for operating the Palm Beach house to “anticipate the\nneeds of Mr Epstein, Ms Maxwell and their guests.” (/d.). Staff were directed to have two sizes\nof notepads marked “Ghislaine Maxwell” and “Lady Ghislaine,” in addition to Epstein’s notepads.\n(/d.). Staff were also instructed on Epstein and the defendant’s breakfast preferences, and the\nitems to keep in Epstein and the defendant’s respective bathrooms. (/d.). The defendant’s\ninstructions extended to massages: she specified the massage oils and lotions for the Palm Beach\nhouse. (/d.). In short, the defendant was waited on hand and foot.\n\nTo protect her criminal activities from exposure, the defendant also fostered a culture of\nsilence at Epstein’s homes. (PSR 49 25, 79). The Palm Beach household manual made clear that\nstaff were to “see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing, except to answer a question directed at” that\nstaff member. (PSR ¥ 25; see also PSR at 49 (manual instructed employees to “NEVER disclose\nMr Epstein or Ms Maxwell’s activities or whereabouts to anyone’”’)). And the defendant reinforced\nthe messages of the household manual. She directed Juan Alessi, the former manager of Epstein’s\nPalm Beach villa, to speak to Epstein only when spoken to and not to look Epstein in the eyes.\n(PSR ¢ 25). Alessi explained during his trial testimony that he understood he was to be “blind,\ndeaf and dumb” and “to say nothing of their lives.” (/d.).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo543", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010544.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page9of55\n\nThis culture of silence provided space for the defendant and Epstein to operate a playbook\nthrough which they sexually abused young girls. At trial, Dr. Lisa Rocchio, an expert in\npsychology with a specialized expertise in traumatic stress and interpersonal violence, explained\nthat children are most frequently sexually abused through grooming and coercion in the context of\na relationship. (Tr. 7l3). Dr. Rocchio explained that abusers use a series of deceptive tactics to\nengage a child in sexual abuse. (Tr. 7l5-2o). The defendant and Epstein used such tactics\nthroughout the life of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. In the early phase of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, from at least\napproximately l994 through approximately 2ool, the defendant identified vulnerable girls,\ntypically from single-mother households and difficult financial circumstances. (PSR § 26). The\ndefendant and Epstein then isolated the girls, spending time with them away from their family and\nfriends. (/d.). During that time, they groomed the girls through techniques such as giving them\ngifts, pretending to be friends, and building trust. (/d.). The defendant and Epstein then\nnormalized sexual situations and sexual touching. (/d.). Finally, they transitioned to sexual abuse,\noften through the pretext of giving Epstein a massage. (/d.). This earlier phase required the\ndefendant and Epstein to identify one girl at a time to target for grooming and abuse.\n\nIn the later phase, from approximately 2ool until at least approximately 2oo4, the\ndefendant and Epstein developed a scheme that created a constant stream of girls who recruited\neach other to visit Epstein at his Palm Beach residence. (PSR § 27). This new approach replaced\nsome of the early grooming and trust-building steps with money provided to girls from struggling\nfamilies. (/d.). Specifically, the defendant and Epstein paid young girls hundreds of dollars in\ncash in exchange for meeting Epstein to be sexually abused—again, often under the pretext of\ngiving Epstein a massage. (/d.). Once a girl was introduced to these sexualized massages, she\nwas offered more money if she brought other teenage girls to engage in sexualized massages with\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo544", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010552.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Pagel7 of 55\ninvolvement in the offense is immense,” and that she was essential to “fostering a culture for the\nabuse to continue.” (/d.). Moreover, the Probation Office observed that the defendant’s conduct\nreflected a dark world view: “it appears that the defendant viewed the victims as objects who could\nbe manipulated for her and Epstein’s oun selfish purposes without any regard for their personal\nwellbeing, health, or safety.” (d.).\n\nAs the PSR reflects, the United States Probation Office has calculated an applicable\nsentencing range under the advisory United States Sentencing Guidelines of 292 to 365 months,\nbased on a total offense level of 4o. The Government does not object to the calculation set forth\nin the PSR, except that the Government respectfully submits that, as noted in the Government’s\nobjections to the PSR, the Guidelines calculation should include two additional groups relating to\ntwo victims: Virginia Roberts and the victim identified at trial as Melissa. (PSR at 45). Pursuant\nto the Court’s discovery order, the Government notified the defense by leter on September l3,\n2o22 that the Government intended to prove at trial that the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> involved six victims,\nincluding Virginia Roberts and Melissa. The Government did just that at trial. (See, e.g., Tr. 2874,\n2882-84 (discussing evidence demonstrating the abuse of Virginia Roberts and Melissa in\nsummation); PSR Jj 55-58, 8o). The PSR notes that Virginia Roberts and Melissa do not appear\nby name in the indictment, but Application Note 6 to U.S.S.G. § 2Gl.3 expressly instructs that if\nthe relevant conduct of an offense of conviction includes “prohibited sexual conduct in respect to\nmore than one minor, whether specifically cited in the count of conviction, each such minor shall\nbe treated as if contained in a separate count of conviction.” (emphasis added).\n\nAccordingly, the offense level should be increased by two levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G.\n§ 2Gl.3(d)(l). As a result, the applicable sentencing range is 36o to 66o months’ imprisonment,\nbased on an offense level of 42.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo552", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010554.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Pagel9 of 55\ncurrent version of the Guidelines as representing the most recent views of the agency charged by\nCongress with developing sentencing policy.” Peugh, 569 U.S. at 549.\n\nWhere the Guidelines have increased after the offense conduct has concluded, “the court\nshall use the Guidelines Manual in effect on the date that the offense of conviction was\ncommited.” U.S.S.G. § lBl.ll(b)(l). Furthermore, Application Note 2 provides that “the last\ndate of the offense of conviction is the controlling date” for determining which manual to apply.\nU.S.S.G. § lBl.ll(b)(l), app. n.2. That is true even if the Guidelines were amended during the\ncourse of the offense conduct. The Second Circuit has explained that “[w]here a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> began\nwhile one version of the Guidelines was in effect and ended after another version became effective,\napplication of the later version to the coconspirators does not violate the Ex Post\nFacto Clause.” United States v. Meneilly, 28 F. App’x 26, 32 (2d Cir. 2ool) (citations omited).\n\nHere, the offenses of conviction spanned from l994 up to and including 2oo4, as set forth\nin the Indictment, and as the proof established at trial. As a result, for Guidelines purposes,\nDecember 3l, 2oo4 is legally the last date of the offense conduct, and the 2oo4 Manual applies.\nIn her objections to the PSR, the defendant claims that the Ex Post Facto clause requires the jury,\nand not the Court, to determine the last date of the offense of conviction. The defendant further\nclaims that, as a factual mater, the offense conduct ended before November l, 2oo4, the date upon\nwhich the 2oo4 Manual became effective. For the reasons set forth belou, the defendant is wrong\nas a mater of law and as a mater of fact. The Court should apply the 2oo4 Manual.\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo554", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010555.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o_ Filed o6/22/22 Page 2oof55\nl. The Court, and not the Jury, Determines Which Manual to Apply\n\nThe defendant claims that a jury must determine which version of the Sentencing\nGuidelines to apply, but the defendant offers not a single case that has ever so held. That argument\nis inconsistent with the plain text of the Guidelines and established Second Circuit precedent. The\nCourt should reject this argument.\n\nAs an initial mater, it is well setled that a question of fact that increases a defendant’s\noffense level under the Guidelines need not be submited to a jury. United States v. Fusco, 56o F.\nApp’x 43, 45-46 (2d Cir. 2ol4); United States v. Morel, No. lo Cr. 798 (PAC), 2o2l WL 282llo7,\nat *2 (S.D.N.Y. July 7, 2o2l). In addition, with respect to the sentencing court’s determination of\nwhich Guidelines Manual to apply, the text of the Guidelines expressly contemplates that the court\nshould determine the last date of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. Application Note 2 provides the follouing\nexample of a calculation of the last date of the offense: “For example, if the offense of conviction\n(i.e., the conduct charged in the count of the indictment or information of which the defendant was\nconvicted) was determined by the court to have been commited between October l5, l99l and\nOctober 28, l99l, the date of October 28, l99l is the controlling date for ex post facto purposes.”\nU.S.S.G. § lBl.ll(b)(l), app. n.2 (2oo4) (emphasis added). As the underlined language makes\nplain, the Guidelines direct sentencing courts to make this factual determination, and not juries.\n\nAs the defendant acknouledges, not one of the cases cited in the defendant’s motion\ninvolved increases in the Sentencing Guidelines, and instead, the defendant rests her argument\nentirely on cases involving Ex Post Facto challenges to increases of the applicable statutory\npenalties. (Dkt. No. 662 (“Def. Mem.”) at 3-4). The law is clear that, so long as a fact at sentencing\ndoes not increase the statutory maximum or minimum penalty, that fact is for the sentencing court\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo555", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010556.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Page 2l of55\nto resolve, and not the jury. Fusco, 56o F. App’x at 45-46 (citing United States v. Norris, 28l F.3d\n357, 369 (2d Cir. 2oo2)).\n\nLacking any authority for her argument, the defendant cites Peugh and offers her oun\nsweeping conclusion that, essentially, the Sixth Amendment requires that all Ex Post Facto issues\nbe resolved by juries. But as the Supreme Court explained in Peugh, “the Sixth Amendment and\nEx Post Facto Clause inquiries are analytically distinct” and “[nJothing that we say today\n‘undo[es]’ the holdings of Booker, Rita, Gall, Kimbrough, or our other recent sentencing cases.”\nPeugh, 569 U.S. at 549-5o. It is thus unsurprising that the defendant has not located a single case,\nanywhere in the nation, that has concluded, in the nine years since Peugh was decided, that the\ndetermination of which Guidelines Manual to apply implicates the Sixth Amendment. Thus, even\nafter Peugh, a sentencing judge’s fact-finding authority continues to include the authority to find\nwhen an offense ended for purposes of deciding which Guidelines Manual to apply.\n\n2. The Sex Trafficking <span class=\"highlight\">Conspiracy</span> Continued to 2oo5\n\nThe Indictment charged that the defendant participated in a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> “from at least in or\nabout l994, up to and including at least in or about 2oo4,” and that is exactly what the Government\nproved at trial. (Dkt. No. l87 at l). There can be no question that the evidence establishes that\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> ran past November l, 2oo4, consistent with the charging language in the Indictment.\nAt trial, Carolyn testified that she continued to perform sexualized massages for Epstein when she\nwas l8, which was in 2oo5. Carolyn’s birth certificate was admited at trial as GX ll. Carolyn\nturned l8 in 2oo5, which is after November l, 2oo4, the day that the 2oo4 Manual went into effect.\nIn particular, Carolyn gave the follouing testimony:\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo556", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010557.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o_ Filed o6/22/22 Page 22 of 55\nQ: And about hou old were you the last time you went over to his house?\nA: Eighteen\n(Trial Tr. l525). Carolyn further testified:\nQ: Why did you stop going to Jeffrey Epstein’s house?\nA: Because I became too old.\nQ: Hou old were you?\nA: l8.\n(Tr. l549). That testimony alone confirms that the offense conduct spanned the entirety of 2oo4,\nand thus that the 2oo4 Manual applies.\n\nThe thrust of the defendant’s argument is that the Court should, at sentencing, discredit the\ntestimony of a crime victim, when a jury has credited that victim and found the defendant guilty.\nIndeed, the jury convicted the defendant of Count Six, which solely relates to Carolyn. In service\nof her lawless argument, the defendant asks the Court both to reject Carolyn’s testimony and to do\nso in the face of documentary evidence that establishes that Carolyn told the truth at trial about\nwhen the offense conduct ended. As the defendant acknouledges, a message book seized from\nthe Palm Beach residence contains two messages from Carolyn, using her first and last name: one\nin November 2oo4 (GX 4B), and one dated March l, 2oo5 (GX 4F). The defendant asks the Court\nto ignore this evidence that Carolyn told the truth at trial, speculating that perhaps the message\nbook is not authentic, because the Government did not offer these excerpts at trial. That\nspeculation is baseless. As the defendant knous, the Government streamlined its proof at trial and\nelected not to call several witnesses, including employees who worked for Epstein in 2oo5 when\nthis book was used. Given the volume of messages relating to Carolyn that were admited at trial,\nand her oun testimony about the duration of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, the testimony from the additional\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo557", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010558.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 23 oof55\nemployees was unnecessary. The book is authentic, and the defendant offers no basis for\nconcluding otherwise.”\n\nThe Court should reject the defendant’s argument and make its determination regarding\nthe final date of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> based on the language of the Indictment (which plainly\nencompasses all of 2oo4) and the trial testimony of Carolyn (who testified that the offense conduct\nran past 2oo4). The 2oo4 Manual applies.\n\n3. The Court Should Apply the 2oo4 Manual\n\nThe defendant also claims that the “goals of sentencing are not served” by applying the\n2oo4 Manual. (Def. Mem. 8 (capitalization removed)). Not so. The law plainly provides that the\n2oo4 Manual applies here, and it would be unjust to provide a substantial break in the Sentencing\nGuidelines for a defendant who engaged in an extensive child exploitation scheme, especially\nwhen both Congress and the Sentencing Commission have since further increased the applicable\npenalties for these offenses.\n\nMoreover, the Court should not credit the defendant’s claim that she broke away from\nEpstein in 2oo2, based on the testimony of a sole defense witness who said that the defendant had\n“moved on” in 2oo2. (Def. Mem. 9). To be clear, “once it has been established that there existed\na <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> of which the defendant was a member, [her] membership is presumed to continue\nunless and until the defendant proves that the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> was terminated or that [she] took\n> In any event, the Government will bring the message book to sentencing so that the Court may\nexamine it if it deems such an assessment necessary. If the Court desires additional testimony in\nthe record, a case agent would be prepared to testify at the sentencing hearing based on the FBI’s\ninvestigation that this message book was seized by the Palm Beach Police Department along with\nthe other three message books admited at trial, and was transferred into the custody of the FBI,\nwhich has maintained it ever since. It is well established that hearsay is admissible at sentencing.\nSee United States v. Martinez, 4l3 F.3d 239, 242 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (“the right of confrontation does\nnot apply to the sentencing context and does not prohibit the consideration of hearsay testimony\nin sentencing proceedings.”).\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo558", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010559.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 24 of55\naffirmative steps to withdraw.” Meneilly, 28 F. App’x at 32 (citations omited). The defendant\nhas not claimed, as a legal mater, that there is any evidence that she withdrew from the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>,\nnor could she. Instead, she argues, as a policy mater, that the 2oo4 Manual should not be applied\nbecause the defendant had “moved on,” an expression that has no legal meaning.\n\nMore importantly, documentary evidence establishes that the defendant remained a close\nassociate of Jeffrey Epstein for multiple years after 2oo2. In particular:\n\ne Flight records reflect that the defendant flew on Epstein’s private jet 49 times in 2oo3, l9\ntimes in 2oo4, and l6 times in 2oo5. Regarding 2oo4 in particular, the flight records for\nthat year reflect that the defendant flew on Epstein’s private jet twice in November 2oo4\nand once in December 2oo4, which makes clear that the defendant was still traveling with\nEpstein after the Guidelines were amended and while the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> was ongoing. (GX\n662).\n\ne In October 2oo5, the Palm Beach Police Department executed a search warrant at the Palm\nBeach residence, and discovered the defendant’s desk, upon which a notepad with her\nnamed stationary was siting. (GX 285). The setup of the defendant’s desk—and\ninstructions that make clear the defendant was a forceful presence in the house—are set\nforth in the household manual, which is dated February l4, 2oo5. (GX 6o6).\n\ne Travel agency records from Shopper’s Travel—offered by the defendant at trial—reflect\nthat Epstein paid for the defendant’s flights through at least 2oo6. (DX RS-l (listing a May\nl, 2oo6 flight on Epstein’s account)).\n\ne Bank records reflect that, as of 2oo7, Epstein transferred $7,759,793.4o to the defendant’s\npersonal bank account.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo559", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010560.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 25of55\n\nWhat the record makes clear is that the defendant remained a close associate of Jeffrey\nEpstein and continued to profit from their criminal relationship, long past 2oo4. There is nothing\npunitive about applying the 2oo4 Guidelines, which apply here as a mater of law. If anything, the\nfact that the defendant will be sentenced under the 2oo4 Guidelines, and not the higher range under\nthe 2o2l Guidelines, should be a factor that warrants a higher sentence. Indeed, the Supreme Court\nhas expressly noted that sentencing courts may consider subsequent increases in offense levels for\nprecisely that purpose. See Peugh, 569 U.S. at 549.\n\nB. The Four-Point Leadership Enhancement Applies\n\nThe Government agrees with the Probation Office that the enhancement in U.S.S.G.\n§ 3Bl.l applies because the defendant was the organizer or leader of a criminal activity that was\n“otherwise extensive.” The defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> spanned at least five victims in three states,\nthe United Kingdom, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, including at Epstein’s various properties, which\nthe defendant ran, over the course of a decade. It involved the participation of numerous members\nof the defendant and Epstein’s staff, whether knouing or unknouing, and the use of minor victims\nto recruit other minor victims. See U.S.S.G. § 3Bl.l app. n.3 (“In assessing whether an\norganization is ‘otherwise extensive,’ all persons involved during the course of the entire offense\nare to be considered,” and use of “the unknouing services of many outsiders could be considered\nextensive.”). For instance, Carolyn testified that she was recruited by Virginia and that Carolyn\nrecruited other minor victims. Juan Alessi testified that he was driving when the defendant stopped\nto recruit Virginia. Two pilots testified about transporting minor victims on Epstein’s planes. That\nalone is five individuals involved in the criminal activity, without even counting the defendant\nherself, Epstein, and Sarah Kellen. See United States v. Kent, 82l F.3d 362, 369 (2d Cir. 2ol6)\n(explaining that a scheme is “otherwise extensive” if it involves “the functional equivalent” of\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo56o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010565.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Page 3oof55\nwas still the lady of the house, supervising other staff, (GX 6o6), and flight records make clear that\nthe defendant and Kellen flew together on Epstein’s private planes approximately thirty-nine times\nin 2oo3 and approximately ten times in 2oo4, confirming their continued overlap, (GX 662).\n\nThe combination of this evidence demonstrates that Kellen joined the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> when\nMaxwell was still second in command under Epstein. Given Maxwell’s role in the household and\nin the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, she certainly exercised authority over Kellen. The clear inference from this\nrecord is that Maxwell instructed Kellen regarding hou to schedule massages and run the part of\nthe scheme that Maxwell had previously handled, at which point Kellen switched to making calls\nto schedule appointments follouing Maxwell’s directions. Thus, even if the defense were correct\nthat the defendant needed to supervise a knouing participant in the scheme for the leadership\nenhancement to apply, the record amply supports the conclusion that Maxwell did so with respect\nto Kellen.\n\nGiven the breadth of the defendant’s criminal scheme, spanning multiple continents,\nabusing multiple victims, and employing numerous underlings to accomplish the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>’s goal\nover the course of multiple years, the defendant clearly warrants the enhancement under U.S.S.G.\n§ 3Bl.l contemplated by the PSR.\n\nC. The Two-Point “Undue Influence” Enhancement Applies\n\nPursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B), two levels are added if “a participant . . . unduly\ninfluenced a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct.” This enhancement applies where “a\nparticipant’s influence over the minor compromised the voluntariness of the minor’s behavior.”\nId. app. n.3(B). Where, as here, “a participant is at least lo years older than the minor,” the\nGuidelines provide for “a rebutable presumption . . . that such participant unduly influenced the\nminor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct. In such a case, some degree of undue influence can\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo565", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010572.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 37 of55\ncrimes. For the reasons set forth belou, the nature and seriousness of the offense weigh in favor\nof a Guidelines sentence, in light of the role the defendant played in the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> and the\nirreparable harm the defendant caused to her victims.\n\nThe Defendant’s Role in the <span class=\"highlight\">Conspiracy</span>\n\nMaxwell’s conduct was shockingly predatory. She was a calculating, sophisticated, and\ndangerous criminal who preyed on vulnerable young girls and groomed them for sexual abuse.\n\nAlthough there are many unsetling aspects of the defendant’s conduct, what stands out\nfrom the trial record is that she worked with Epstein to select victims who she knew were\nvulnerable to exploitation. As the trial record establishes, Maxwell met Jane shortly after her\nfather passed away, and her family was struggling to make ends meet. Annie’s mother was\nstruggling to raise her daughters alone. Carolyn was living alone with her mother, who was an\naddict. It is not a coincidence that all of Maxwell’s victims came from single-mother households.\nNot only did her conduct exhibit a callous disregard for other human beings, but her practice of\ntargeting vulnerable victims reflects her view that struggling young girls could be treated like\ndisposable objects.\n\nOnce the victims were selected, Maxwell played an essential role in the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> by\ngrooming victims for abuse. Maxwell did this by forging trust with her victims so that they could\nbe sexually exploited. As Dr. Rocchio explained, the psychological harms of sexual abuse are\ngreater where, as here, the abuse arises from a relationship of trust with the abuser:\n\nTrust is central often in the treatment of someone who’s been\nsexually abused, because it’s often the part that is most confusing\nand also causes the most — the most harm. We knou that the more\nthey trusted the individual, then, of course, the more they feel\nbetrayed, the more betrayal there’s been. And to the extent there’s\nbeen betrayal in the relationship, then the individuals are really\nstruggling to a much, much greater degree, often trying to\n35\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo572", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010573.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 38 of 55\nunderstand what happened, hou it happened and why, and what its\neffect is certainly.\n(Tr. 742-43). Maxwell’s victims trusted her: she was a seemingly respectable woman who shoued\ninterest in them and promised to help them. She was key to the entire operation of the scheme,\nand Epstein could not have commited these crimes without her.\n\nMaxwell befriended her victims, won their trust, slouly broke doun their boundaries, and\nnormalized sexual abuse. For example, Jane testified that the defendant shoued her hou Epstein\nliked to be massaged and hou he liked his penis touched. The defendant did this when Jane was\nonly l4 years old. The defendant was an adult, in her thirties, helping to normalize abusive sexual\nconduct with a young teenager. The defendant’s demeanor was “casual, like it was — like it was\nvery normal, like it was not a big deal.” (Tr. 3o9). When Jane was in her twenties, she described\nMaxwell this way to her boyfriend, who remembered years later hou Jane told him that Epstein\nhad abused her, and the defendant had made her feel comfortable. (Tr. 644).\n\nThe degree to which the defendant manipulated her victims is an aggravating factor in this\ncase. But her abusive conduct did not end with the grooming and manipulation of the victims.\nShe also participated in the sexual abuse of her victims. Not only was Maxwell the person who\nwas most frequently in the room when Epstein abused Jane (Tr. 289), but multiple victims testified\nthat the defendant groped their breasts. (Tr. 3lo (Jane), 2224 (Annie), l536 (Carolyn)). In\nparticular, Annie described a terrifying encounter in which she found herself alone with Maxwell\nat Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico, and Maxwell told her to remove her clothing so she could give\nAnnie a “massage” during which she rubbed Annie’s breasts. (Tr. 2224; PSR 4 52). That so-\ncalled massage was the defendant sexually abusing a teenage girl.\n\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> in this case was extensive and sophisticated by any metric: it involved\nmultiple victims, at multiple properties in different states, over a span of many years. In order to\n36\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo573", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010574.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 39 of55\noperate the scheme, Maxwell and Epstein used many employees: pilots, household staff, personal\nassistants, and drivers. Maxwell was central to operating the scheme and managing employees at\nthese properties. Most importantly, the offense conduct was extensive because so many young\ngirls were sexually exploited as a direct result of the defendant’s conduct. At trial, the evidence\nestablished that Jane, Annie, Kate, Carolyn, Virginia, and Melissa were all exploited as a direct\nresult of the defendant’s actions.\n\nThe trial record also makes clear that there were many other victims who were harmed by\nthis <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. First, Carolyn testified that she brought multiple additional minors, including\nMelissa, to provide paid sexualized massages to Epstein. Although these minors did not\nnecessarily interact directly with Maxwell, they were subjected to sexual abuse as a result of the\npyramid scheme that Maxwell and Epstein set in motion. Carolyn specifically recalled bringing\ngirls named Tatum and Amanda when they were under the age of l8 to provide paid sexualized\nmassages for Epstein. (Tr. l543-44). Second, the defendant’s black book contained dozens of\nentries under the heading “Massage — Florida,” and included entries referencing individuals’\nparents. (GX 52). Third, records recovered from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence during a 2oo5\nsearch by the Palm Beach Police Department reveal that additional minors provided Epstein with\nsexualized massages between 2ool and 2oo4. In particular, message pads seized from the\nresidence contain multiple messages from underage girls who called to schedule massage\nappointments. (GX l, 2, 3, and 4). Lest there be any doubt that the individuals named in the\nmessage pads were in fact minors providing sexualized massages to Epstein, many of the girls\nidentified in the messages were listed as identified minor victims of Epstein in connection with his\nresolution of the investigation conducted by the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District\nof Florida (“USAO-SDFL”). Specifically, in a leter dated July lo, 2oo8, the USAO-SDFL\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo574", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010575.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Page 4o of55\nidentified a total of thirty-two minor victims, including Carolyn and Virginia.’ Of those thirty-\ntwo individuals, thirteen appear in the message pads, again including Carolyn and Virginia.\n\nThe Government notes that, from interviewing many of these victims during the course of\nits investigation, the Government has learned that, in the later phases of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, victims\nprimarily scheduled appointments with—and interfaced with—Epstein’s personal assistants, who\nwere in their early twenties.® Although the Government does not seek to include these minors as\nvictims for purposes of the Guidelines calculation, the scope of the pyramid scheme that the\ndefendant helped devise with Epstein bears emphasis when evaluating the harms that the\ndefendant’s criminal conduct ultimately caused.\n\nVictim Impact\n\nIt is difficult to capture in words the harm that Maxwell caused to her victims. They were\nchildren who experienced what can only be described as a recurring nightmare: again and again,\nthey found themselves alone with Maxwell and Epstein in terrifying mansions where they were\nsexually abused and physically violated. They were trapped in an exploitative relationship with\nMaxwell and Epstein that, for many victims, lasted for years.\n\nOften, in cases involving sexual exploitation, the Court is left to consider the harms the\nvictims have suffered during the offense conduct and to predict the likely effects on their lives\ngoing forward. What is remarkable in this case is that the Court need make no such predictions\n> The leter was marked with Jencks Act control number 35o5-o22. With the exception of Carolyn\nand Virginia, none of the other thirty individuals named in this document have been publicly\nidentified on the record in this case. Those victims retain significant privacy interests.\n® Of course, there can be no comparison between the defendant—a woman in her forties in the\n2ooos—and the young women (often in their very early twenties) who worked as personal\nassistants, and whose roles and life circumstances dramatically differed from those of the\ndefendant.\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo575", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010577.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 42 of 55\nexplained: “This toxic combination of being sexually exposed and exploited, feeling confused and\nnaive, blaming myself all resulted in significant shame.”\n\nKate has explained that “the consequences of what Ghislaine Maxwell did have been far\nreaching for me.” In a leter to the Court in connection with sentencing, Kate shared: “I have\nstruggled with, and eventually triumphed over, substance use disorder. I have suffered panic\natacks and night terrors, with which I still struggle. I have suffered lou self esteem, loss of career\nopportunities. I have batled greatly with feeling unable to trust my oun instincts, in choosing\nromantic relationships.”\n\nCarolyn’s testimony at trial made clear that she, too, has suffered greatly as a result of the\ndefendant’s crimes. Over her years of abuse at Epstein’s hands, Carolyn fell deeper into drug\naddiction, and she has experienced significant struggles with mental health and addiction\nthroughout her adult life. (PSR §] 59). When explaining the trauma she experienced, Carolyn\nexpressed, “my soul is broken and so is my heart.” (Tr. l678). Her pain was palpable on the\nwitness stand as she described the horrifying years of abuse she suffered.\n\nAs the foregoing makes clear, the defendant played an essential role in a child exploitation\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> that caused lasting harm to many young girls. The defendant preyed on vulnerable\nyoung girls, manipulated them, and served them up to be sexually abused by Epstein, a prolific\npredator and abuser of children. Years of sexual abuse, multiple victims, devastating\npsychological harm: none of this could have happened without Maxwell. A Guidelines sentence\nis necessary to reflect the gravity of the offense conduct and the pain and trauma the defendant\ninflicted upon her many victims.\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo577", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010693.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document675 Filed o6/25/22 Page 2of2l\ninformation concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted of an offense\nwhich a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an\nappropriate sentence.”). Two of Maxwell’s victims, Sarah Ransome and Elizabeth Stein, seek to assist\nthe Court in exercising this authority by providing oral VISs at sentencing. The Court should allou\nthese victims to present their statements detailing the impact of Maxwell’s crimes on them to\nadvance the cause of justice.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nAs the extensive evidence at trial has revealed, Maxwell was involved in a far-reaching long—\nrunning sex trafficking <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. As the Court recently explained, Maxwell was found guilty after a\nlengthy jury trial of a “decade-long unlawful agreement with the Defendant’s continuous\ncoconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein. The overarching <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>—which, as the Government argued and\nproved at trial, employed a single ‘playbook’ to groom and sexually abuse underage girls—constitutes\na single <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> offense with multiple victims.” (Dkt. 657 at 2-3).\n\nNou, Maxwell is to be sentenced for her criminal involvement in this expansive <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.\nThe victims clearly have a right to be heard as part of this process.\n\nBoth moving victims, Sarah and Elizabeth, came to New York as young women seeking to\nmatriculate at the Fashion Institute of Technology and then work in the fashion industry. Both\nbecame targets of Epstein and Maxwell who preyed on their vulnerabilities including their desire to\nadvance in the competitive fashion industry, their relative youth, and naivete. Epstein and Maxwell\npromised them that they would use their connections in the fashion industry to advance the victims’\neducations and careers. But there was a cruel catch. For every favor or promise of a favor, sexual\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo693", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010694.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document675_ Filed o6/25/22 Page3of2l\nactivity was demanded in return. And soon the sex overcame everything else. Sarah described the\nEpstein/Maxwell quid pro quo as the “Hotel California;” you can check-out any time you like, but\nyou can never leave.\n\nBoth VISs provide relevant background information regarding Maxwell’s character and\nconduct. Both statements further describe that for many years after finally extricating themselves\nphysically from the Epstein/Maxwell trap, they suffered serious mental and physical illnesses.\nElizabeth discusses numerous hospitalizations for mental breakdouns and being unable to hold\ndoun a job. After being a victim of Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> crimes, Sarah atempted suicide twice, both\ntimes ending up in the hospital with serious physical injuries.\n\nBoth Sarah and Elizabeth have submited VISs to the probation office for inclusion in the\nPresentence Investigation Report. See Declaration of Robert Y. Lewis, dated June 23, 2o22.\n\nFor the reasons set forth belou, the Court should allou Sarah and Elizabeth to read their\nvictim impact statements at Maxwell’s sentencing hearing.\n\nARGUMENT\nI. These Victims Have a Statutory Right to be Heard Under the Crime Victim’s Rights Act\nThe Crime Victim's Rights Act (“CVRA”) defines the term “crime victim” as a “person\ndirectly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of a Federal offense....” l8 U.S.C.\n§ 377l(e). This definition was based on earlier restitution statutes which “all demonstrate a clarion\ncongressional intent to provide restitution to as many victims and in as many cases as possible.”\nUnited States v. Martin, l28 F.3d ll88, ll9o (7th Cir. l997) (quoted in United States v. Kamuvaka,\n7l9 ESupp.2d 469, 475 (E.D. Pa. 2olo)). In relying on these far-reaching statutes to craft the\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo694", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010696.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document675 Filed o6/25/22 Page5of2l\na deferred prosecution agreement)) “Congress crafted the CVRA to recognize the harm and\nanguish suffered by victims of crime. This is why Congress made the statutory rights under the\nCVRA permissively accessible. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(d)(3).” Id. Moreover, “[b]ecause victim status can\nbe argued for even prior to the filing of an indictment, it is clear that Congress intended courts to\nlook beyond the four corners of an indictment or plea agreement. For example, in the context of the\n[drug trafficking] <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> here, neither the indictment nor the statement of facts included in the\nplea agreement mention violence of any kind. And yet, logic allous for the inference...that [the\ndefendant’s] paramilitary organization...employed violence and force as part of its method of\noperation.” Jd.\n\nIt is also important to understand that this case has nou moved to a different phase than the\ntrial phase where, of course, a defendant is entitled to a presumption of innocence and is protected\nby the requirement that the government prove guilt by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. But, in\ndetermining the “crime victim” issue at sentencing, the relevant standard of proof is the conventional\nstandard for proceedings in criminal cases outside of trial—preponderance of the evidence.

Sexual abusers frequently use their actual or perceived pouer to manipulate and\ncoerce victims during their abuse or trafficking. Jill Laurie Goodman & Dorchen A. Leidholdt,\nLawyers Manual on Human Trafficking, NY State Jud. Comm. on Women in the Court l69-76\n(2ol3). The scheme Sarah and Elizabeth both describe in their victim impact statements is the same\nscheme Maxwell is being sentenced for and it involves the same defendant and co-conspirators as the\nconspiratorial scheme proven at trial.\n\nMoreover, these victim statements reflect Sarah’s and Elizabeth’s personal knouledge of\nMaxwell’s character and actions in furtherance of the scheme. Maxwell’s argument that Sarah and\nElizabeth do not qualify as real victims because they were not minors at the time of the trafficking\nand therefore are not victims within the counts of conviction is of no moment. The allegations in the\nsecond superseding indictment easily encompasses these non—minor victims. For example, in\nparagraph 4(e) of the second superseding indictment, which is a sub-part of a count for which there\nwas a conviction, alleges that “through this process, Maxwell and Epstein enticed victims to engage\nin sexual activity with Epstein.” Likewise, paragraph 9 of the second superseding indictment alleges\nthat “among the victims induced or enticed by GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, were\nminor victims identified herein as Minor Victim—l, Minor Victim—2, Minor Victim—3 and Minor\nVictim—4.” A fair reading of the indictment is that although it emphasizes minor victims, the sex\ntrafficking <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>—as alleged—encompassed non—minor victims like Sarah and Elizabeth.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo697", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010699.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document675_ Filed o6/25/22 Page 8of2l\nauthority about such harm.” Payne v. Tennessee, 5ol U.S. 8o8, 8o8 (l99l). Speaking directly to\nMaxwell in this case is particularly important for these victims. Crime victims often want to speak\n“to regain a sense of dignity and respect rather than feeling pouerless and ashamed.” Degenhardt, 4o5\nESupp.2d at l348 (internal quotation omited). Here, Sarah and Elizabeth believe it is important\nthat they be given an opportunity to speak as part of the process of overcoming the horrific impact of\nMaxwell's sex trafficking <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> on them and others.\n\nIl. Regardless of Whether Sarah and Elizabeth are CVRA “Victims,” the Court Undoubtedly\n\nPossesses Discretion to Hear from them at Sentencing Under l8 U.S.C. § 366l\n\nFor all the reasons just explained, Sarah and Elizabeth have the right to speak at Maxwell's\nsentencing under the CVRA. Additionally, this Court also possesses broad discretionary pouer,\nderived from statute and common law, to hear from them when determining the appropriate\nsentence for Maxwell’s crimes. See l8 U.S.C. § 366l; see also Degenhardt, 4o5 FSupp.2d at l343\n(discussing the court’s discretionary pouers to hear from victims).\n\nThe Court’s discretion in this case is important not only because it provides an alternative\nbasis for considering Sarah’s and Elizabeth's victim impact, but also because the Court may have\nother requests to speak at Maxwell’s sentencing. Some of these other victims may not be able to\nafford legal counsel to present their arguments to this Court.' Federal courts have wide discretion to\ngather information at sentencing subject to only a few constitutional or statutory restrictions. See\nUnited States v. Tucker, 4o4 U.S. 443, 446 (l972) (“[A] judge may appropriately conduct an inquiry\n\n\" Under the CVRA, the Justice Department is obligated to use its “best efforts” to protect the\nrights of “crime victims.” l8 U.S.C § 377l(c)(l).

Salutric, 775 F.3d 948, 95l-52 (7th Cir. 2ol5). In that case, the Seventh Circuit observed\nthat “[i]n arriving at an appropriate sentence, a sentencing judge necessarily must consider not only\nthe offense of conviction but the defendant's broader criminal record and history.” /d. at 95l. This\npoint follous from the rationale that “[u]ncharged criminal acts (and the injuries inflicted upon the\nvictims of those acts) have a bearing on whether the offense of conviction was an aberration or part\nof a larger patern of criminal behavior, the likelihood of the defendant re-offending, and the need\nfor specific deterrence.” /d., See also United States v. Laraneta, 7oo F.3d 983, 987 (7th Cir. 2ol2). The\nSeventh Circuit explained that the federal “Criminal Code makes clear that “[n]o limitation shall be\nplaced on the information concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted\nof an offense, which a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of\nimposing an appropriate sentence’.” 775 at 952 (quoting l8 U.S.C. § 366l).\n\nThis Court should follou the same approach and hear from all victims of Maxwell’s long—\nrunning and. wide-ranging sex trafficking <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. See also United States v. Goss, 325 F. Supp. 3d\n932, 936 (E.D.

First, allouing women who were sexually abused and trafficked\n\nby Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to speak will have an important cathartic benefit not only for the victims\nspeaking, but for those who are unable to speak as well. Second, in this case in particular, too many\nunanswered questions remain about the scope and participants in this long-running wide-ranging sex\ntrafficking <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> — leading many Americans to believe that authorities continue to hide the\ncomplete truth about what happened. Allouing all victims who wish to speak to do so publicly will\npromote transparency and help to dispel some of those concerns.\n\nA. Prohibiting Maxwell’s Victims from Speaking Unfairly Denies Victims Important\n\nCathartic Benelts\n\nAllouing crime victims to speak at a defendant's sentencing can have significant\npsychological and emotional benefits for those victims. See generally Paul G. Cassell, In Defense of\n\nVictim Impact Statements, 6 OHIO ST. J. OF CRIM. L. 6ll, 62l—23 (2oo9).

But many questions remain about hou and why\nthe innumerable co-conspirators in an extensive international child sex trafficking operation have\nescaped justice for so long. In the Southern District of Florida, Epstein, Maxwell, and other co—\nconspirators arranged a secret non—prosecution deal that alloued Epstein to, in effect, take the fall\nfor all involved and then to serve most of his prison time on “work release’—while the other co—\nconspirators (such as Maxwell) escaped prosecution entirely. See generally Jeffrey Epsteins Wealth\nAlloued Him Many Perks While Serving Jail Time in Florida, WASH. POST (July l9, 2ol9). The\n“preposterous” inexplicable non—prosecution agreement has left the sex trafficking <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>’s\nvictims—and the public—to wonder why Epstein, Maxwell, and other co-conspirators were treated\nso favorably.

And Epstein’s escape from conviction through apparent suicide in\ncircumstances where federal authorities should have been more vigilant has created a widely spread\nmeme that “Epstein didn’t kill himself”\n\nAgainst this backdrop, if Maxwell’s victims are prevented from speaking at her sentencing, it\nwill compound the public perception that the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>’s victims are being silenced and that co—\nconspirators continue to receive favorable treatment. The best way to dispel this public perception is\nfor the Court to broadly permit a// Maxwell’s victims who wish to be heard at sentencing to speak.\n\nJudge Berman of this Court wisely recognized these realities in allouing all of Epstein’s\nvictims to speak at the court hearing where Epstein’s criminal charges were dismissed after his death.\nSee U.S. v. Epstein, Case No. l9-cr-49o-RMB (S.D.N.Y. hearing transcript Aug. 27, 2ol9). As Judge\nBerman explained: “Public hearings are exactly what judges do.

While there was a limiting instruction during the trial,\nclarifying that the jury was not permited to find Maxwell guilty of any crime charged commited\nagainst Kate, she provided pouerful and credible testimony of her interactions with Maxwell,\nwhich viewed in any objective light clearly demonstrate she was the victim of Maxwell’s grooming\nthat led to years of sexual abuse at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein. Kate courageously took the stand\nto share her experiences with the jury and was subject to the severe stress of a harsh cross-\nexamination. Having endured such risk and emotional expense to ensure the jury had a full picture\nand was able to render a just verdict, Kate is deserving of the opportunity to return and speak at\nthis important stage for the benefit of the Court and the catharsis she will likely experience from\nproviding her valuable insight at this stage where she can speak without the anxiety of being\natacked by opposing counsel.

The Circuit explained that in determining\nwhether a decedent’s family had CVRA “victim” status, the district court erred by “limit[ing] its\nevaluation to the indictment and the statement of facts submited by [the defendant] as part of his\nnegotiated plea agreement.” Jn re de Henriquez, No. l5-3o54, 2ol5 WL lo692637, at *l (D.C.\nCir. 2ol5). The Circuit noted that “[uJnder the CVRA, victims may participate in proceedings even\nwhen there has been no formal charge.” /d. (citing l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(9) (victims have the right\nto timely notice of a deferred prosecution agreement)). Moreover, “[b]ecause victim status can be\nargued for even prior to the filing of an indictment, it is clear that Congress intended courts to look\nbeyond the four corners of an indictment or plea agreement. For example, in the context of the\n[drug trafficking] <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> here, neither the indictment nor the statement of facts included in the\nplea agreement mention violence of any kind. And yet, logic allous for the inference . . . that [the\ndefendant’s| paramilitary organization . . . employed violence and force as part of its method of\noperation.” Jd.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo74o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010760.jpg": "; Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document688 _ Filed o6/29/22 Page 7 of 353\nJuror ID: g\n\nYour name will not be disclosed or connected to this questionnaire beyond the Judge and the\nparties in this case.

The Defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell, has been charged in an Indictment\nwith various criminal offenses. The Indictment is not evidence. It simply contains the\ncharges—referred to as “counts”—that the Government intends to prove to the jury at trial :\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\nThe charges in the Indictment stem from allegations that from at least l994 through 2oo4, the\nDefendant conspired with and aided and abeted Jeffrey Epstein to entice minors to travel to |\nengage in criminal sexual activity, to transport minors to engage in criminal sexual activity, :\nand to engage in sex trafficking of a minor. ‘\nThe Indictment charges the Defendant in 6 counts: Count One of the Indictment charges the\nDefendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage\nin sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense. Count Two :\ncharges the Defendant with enticing a minor to travel to engage in sexual activity for which a :\nperson can be charged with a criminal offense, and aiding and abeting the same. Count Three |\ncharges the Defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to transport minors to engage\nin sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense. Count Four\ncharges the Defendant with transporting a minor to engage in sexual activity for which a person :\ncan be charged with a criminal offense, and aiding and abeting the same. Count Five charges |\nthe Defendant with participating in a sex trafficking <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. Count Six charges the :\nDefendant with sex trafficking of a minor, and aiding and abeting the same.\n_ Ms. Maxwell has pled not guilty to all charges. Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent, and before\nshe can be found guilty on any charge, the jury must find that the Government has proven each\nelement of that crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\nDOJ-OGR-ooollo79 ~", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011109.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document69o _ Filed ll/l9/2l Pagelof23\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT inca a\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK DOCUMENT\n\nELECTRONICALLY FILED\nDOC #;\nDATE FILED: ll/l9/2l ___|]\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nMEMORANDUM\nDefendant. OPINION & ORDER\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nBefore the Court is the Defendant’s fourth motion in limine to “exclude evidence related\nto Accuser-3,” to whom the Court refers as Witness-3, on the grounds that the testimony is not\ndirect evidence of the charged conspiracies and is inadmissible under Federal Rules of Evidence\n4o4(b) and 4o3.

The Court has twice heard argument related to this motion,\nincluding argument at the November lo, 2o2l in camera hearing that was sealed pursuant to\nFederal Rule of Evidence 4l2. See generally Nov. l, 2o2l Transcript; Nov. lo, 2o2l Transcript.\nAt the November l, 2o2l hearing, the Court provided a brief explanation of its current position\nbased on the information then before it, but the Court ultimately reserved ruling pending\nadditional briefing. The Court is nou in receipt of the parties’ additional briefing and\naccordingly is prepared to resolve the motion. !\n\nThe Government nou proffers that the anticipated testimony of Witness-3 will describe\nhou she met the Defendant and her relationship with the Defendant and Mr. Epstein. In\nparticular, Witness-3 is anticipated to testify hou Defendant introduced her to Mr. Epstein, hou\nl This Memorandum Opinion & Order is filed temporarily under seal to permit the parties the opportunity to propose\nsealing or limited redactions pursuant to Lugosch v.

See Gov. Supp. Ltr. at l2 (Nov. 5, 2o2l). For example, in a recent murder\ntrial, the Court permited the nephew of the victim to describe his uncle’s wounds because the\nnephew, who had served as a caretaker, had some information that was not cumulative of the\nmedical records. The Court expressly cautioned the Government that it would not permit\nemotional testimony, or the probative value would be outweighed by the prejudice:\n\n[I]t's clearly a 4o3 line here. You have cumulativeness with the medical testimony, you\n\nhave graphic descriptions from a relative who cared for the victim which could very well\n\nproduce sympathies and prejudice that would interfere with and overcome the medical\nfacts that you need for purposes of proving causation. . . . | am certainly going to cut off\nthe line at any graphic descriptions. To the extent that walking this person through\nquestions regarding the medical condition is emotional testimony, I think we are — it will\nhave to be stopped.\nUnited States v.

The transcript of\nthat ruling is atached for counsel’s reference. See Exhibit A. The Court cautions the\nGovernment to proceed carefully because the Court will not allou testimony that steps over this\n4o3 line. The Court will allou some leading questions for this portion of the testimony to help\nensure that it does not.\n\nFinally, the Court concludes that this witness’s anticipated testimony as to the sex\ntrafficking counts is inadmissible. Although the Government’s leter points to some relevant\ndirect evidence that this witness could provide regarding these counts, see Gov. Supp. Ltr. at 6-7,\nany minimal probative value of this evidence is diminished by its remoteness in time to the\ncharged sex trafficking <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, which is alleged to have run from 2ool to 2oo4. This\nevidence does not face the same problem as it relates to the Mann Act conspiracies, which are\nalleged to have begun in l994 (and when the Defendant allegedly began her relationship with\nthis witness.).

The last overt act alleged in the S-2\n\n‘In its November l2, 2o2l leter to the Court, the government apparently\nmisunderstands, and overstates, its understanding of the Defendant’s position regarding the\nproffered statements. To be clear, Ms. Maxwell is not agreeing to the admission of any\nstatements proffered by the government under Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(2)(E) for many reasons\nincluding the fact that she was not a member of any <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> as alleged in the indictment. Ms.\nMaxwell understood that, in her conferral leter to the government, she was identifying her good\nfaith objections given established Second Circuit procedures governing the admissibility of the\nproffered statements.

Nathan\nNovember l5, 2o2l\nPage 2\nIndictment occurred in 2oo4. It is Ms. Maxwell’s position that any post-2oo4 statements by\nEpstein or other alleged co-conspirators were not in furtherance of any <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> at issue in this\ncase.\n\nThe first exemplar is a statement allegedly from Epstein to CC-l claiming that Ms.\nMaxwell “used to find girls for him.” This statement, or statements like it, cannot have been\nmade either in the course of or in furtherance of any <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> at issue here and are no more\nthan “idle chater.” Casual conversation about “past events,” “idle chater” between co-\nconspirators, or “merely narrative descriptions by one coconspirator of the acts of another” do\nnot qualify as statements in furtherance of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. United States v. Heinemann, 8ol F.2d\n86, 95 (2d Cir. l986); United States v. Lieberman, 637 F.2d 95, lo2 (2d Cir. l98o) (challenged\ntestimony “smack[ed] of nothing more than casual conversation about past events. It is difficult\nto envision hou it would have furthered the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.”).\n\nDuring 2oo5, according to the witness, she, Sarah Kellen, an (and\nothers) were actively involved in soliciting females for Jeffrey Epstein. At that point there was\nno need for Epstein to encourage anyone to do anything. Allegedly saying that Ms. Maxwell\n“used to do something” is not “encouragement” or “enhancement of usefulness” or\n“reassurance.” Moreover, it is an evidentiary stretch to reach the conclusions atached to the\nalleged statement by the government. Assuming that CC-l is remembering a l7-year-old\nstatement accurately, to reach the conclusion that it was done in furtherance of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>\ncharged in the S-2 Indictment requires a speculative and subjective interpretation of why Epstein\nsaid what he said. The entire quote from the proffer is telling. According to the FBI 3o2, bate\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll284", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011285.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o9 Filed o7/l2/22 Page3of5\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nNovember l5, 2o2l\nPage 3\npage 3524-ol3, page 3 of 8, on May l4, 2o2l, after being interviewed multiple times, the\nwitness said:\n\nEPSTEIN noted once that when he and Maxwell dated that MAXWELL would\n\nbring more girls for threesomes, saying they were sexual relationships.\n\ndid not recall when or where EPSTEIN said this to her. EPSTEIN told\n\nthat MAXWELL brought him girls.\n\nThe witness continued discussing her “impressions” of the conversation. Nothing in her\n“impressions” about this conversation relate to Epstein using the discussion to further any\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. The witness does not indicate that any of the “girls” were underage. The witness\nfurther advised that during the time she worked for Epstein “she did not get the sense that he and\nMAXWELL were still in a romantic relationship.” /d. Accordingly, the context of the statement\nreflects that anything said by Epstein was “idle chater” and not something in furtherance of any\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.\n\nThe Court should also exclude this statement under Fed. R. Evid. 4o3 because the\nprobative value of the statement is substantially outweighed by the prejudicial impact to Ms.\nMaxwell. Epstein is dead and not subject to cross examination. It is not clear by the proffer what\nMs. Maxwell “used to do.” The witness could speculate that Epstein meant solicit underage\nfemales but the evidence at trial will establish that Ms. Maxwell hired a number of employees for\nEpstein prior to 2oo4. The statement is overly prejudicial especially when viewed in the context\nof the other evidence that the government claims it will produce at trial, l.e., direct statements\nfrom accusers that Ms. Maxwell recruited them. This post-hoc statement atributed to Epstein by\na cooperating witness (l7 years later) will be used by the government to argue that Epstein\nadmited that Ms. Maxwell was a co-conspirator. Given the weak foundation for the alleged\nstatement the Court should exclude it. At a minimum, the Court should review the circumstances\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll285", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011286.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o9 Filed o7/l2/22 Page4of5\nThe Honorable Alison J.

The government should be instructed that it cannot\ndiscuss the alleged statement in its opening remarks.\n\nSimilarly, the second example concerns direction from Epstein and CC-2 to CC-l to\n“help someone who was coming to take the computers....” Again, this statement does not appear\nto be during or in furtherance of any <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> alleged in the indictment. See Lutwak v. United\nStates, 344 U.S. 6o4 (l953); Krulewitch v. United States, 336 U.S. 44o (l949). The government\nnou seems to concede this point, falling back on the time honored “effect on the listener” and\ntherefore not offered for the truth of the mater exception to the hearsay rule. The problem with\nthe government’s position, houever, is that the statement and subsequent actions are not relevant\nto any material issue in this case. The apparent point of the proffered evidence is to demonstrate\nthat, in 2oo5, Epstein was extracting his computers in advance of the search and thus may have\nhad some guilty knouledge. Ms. Maxwell is not charged with tampering or obstruction and\nEpstein’s motives for allegedly directing CC-l to do something with his computers is not\nrelevant to whether Ms. Maxwell conspired to do the things alleged in the indictment. Again, any\nprobative value associated with this action is substantially outweighed by the prejudice to Ms.\nMaxwell who was not present, did not participate, and had no knouledge of either the statement\nor the acts.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll286", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011306.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l4 Filed o7/l2/22 Page3of7\ntime period” suggests to the jury that the testimony will be that witness was above the local age of\nconsent at all relevant times. That will not be the testimony at trial—for instance, Minor Victim-\nl and Minor Vicitim-4 will testify that they were l4 when Epstein and the defendant first enticed\nor trafficked them into sexual activity, but, to complete the timeline of their interactions with\nEpstein and the defendant, will provide only brief testimony that they continued having sexual\ninteractions with Epstein past the relevant age of consent for the Mann Act or sex trafficking\ncounts. To be accurate, the instruction would need to clarify that the witness will testify that she\nreached the age of majority at some point during her testimony, not that she was over the age of\nconsent, full stop.\n\nSecond, and relatedly, the defendant has indicated that she intends to dispute when certain\nevents occurred and the ages of the victims at those times. A limiting instruction suggesting that\nthe Minor Victims were “above the age of consent” or not engaged in “illegal sexual activity”\nwould essentially instruct the jury that the Minor Victims were, in fact, above the age of consent\nat all relevant times, as the defense is expected to argue. Accordingly, at a minimum, any\ninstruction on that issue should be balanced. If the Court explains to the jury that the Minor\nVictims were above the age of consent under some state’s law at some point, such that they could\nnot have engaged in “illegal sexual activity,” the Court should also explain that they may still have\nbeen under the age of consent for purposes of the New York offense alleged in the Indictment and\nl8 U.S.C. § l59l, such that they could still be under the age of consent required to prove the Mann\nAct and sex trafficking <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts.\n\nThird, the ages of consent in jurisdictions other than New York are not relevant to the\nfactual question before the jury. To the extent a witness engaged in sexual activity that was lawful\n3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll3o6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011307.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l4 Filed o7/l2/22 Page4of7\nunder the laws of a state where that sexual activity occurred because the witness was above that\nstate’s age of consent, the defendant is not charged with any such conduct. The proposed\ninstruction is not fully accurate when it says that sexual activity is not “illegal sexual activity’ as\nthe Government has charged in the Indictment” “because the witness was over the age of consent”\nin the relevant jurisdiction; rather, whether the sexual activity is or is not “illegal sexual activity”\nregarding the offenses in the Indictment is determined by reference only to New York state law\nand New York’s age of consent. As is clear from the Government’s proposed request to charge,\nthe Government is not proceeding on a theory that a violation of any law other the New York law\nwas an object of the Mann Act counts. See Proposed Request to Charge at 23, 3l, 5l-52. And\nwhile sexual activity over some other state’s age of consent cannot establish a substantive Mann\nAct offense because it was not “illegal sexual activity,” for the purposes of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts,\nthe Government need not prove that any illegal sexual activity actually occurred. All that is\nrequired is that the defendant intended illegal sexual activity—that is, a violation of the New York\nobject offense—to occur. See Proposed Request to Charge at 45. And sexual activity in New\nMexico or Florida with someone belou New York’s age of consent is direct evidence of that\noffense, whatever the local ages of consent.\n\nAn instruction that sexual contact in a jurisdiction other than New York is not “illegal\nsexual activity” because it was over some other state’s age of consent would likely confuse the\njury by (l) informing the jury about a state age of consent that is not relevant to the crimes charged\nin the Indictment, and (2) suggest to the jury that sexual contact was “not illegal” because it was\nabove that state’s age of consent, even though it is direct evidence of the Mann Act conspiracies.\n\nFurther, as to the sex trafficking counts, state laws and ages of consent are entirely\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooll3o7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011309.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l4 Filed o7/l2/22 Page6eof7\nthe Mann Act with the New York state law (including the New York age of consent) as its object,\nor for violations of § l59l, and <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to commit those offenses. There is accordingly no risk\nthat the jury will convict the defendant for violating an unidentified local sex crimes law for which\nthe Minor Victim was above the age of consent. Asa result, the Government respectfully requests\nthat the Court refrain from giving the second limiting instruction at all during this trial.\n\nIf the Court nevertheless decides to give the second limiting instruction, the Government\nproposes the follouing revision to give the jury an understanding both of what is and what is not\nillegal sexual activity:\n\nI anticipate that you will hear testimony from the next witness about sexual conduct\n\nthat she says she had with Mr. Epstein in [insert relevant jurisdiction, e.g. New\n\nMexico]. I instruct you that if and when beeause the witness was over the age of\n\nconsent in [insert relevant jurisdiction, e.g. New Mexico] at the relevant time\n\nperiod, the sexual conduct she says occurred with Mr. Epstein was not itself “illegal\n\nsexual activity” as the Government has charged in the Indictment. [The age of\n\nconsent in that jurisdiction is [insert relevant age of consent or analysis\n\nthereof]]._ Houever, to the extent you conclude that her testimony is relevant to\n\nthe issues before you, including the defendant’s intent for that witness to engage\n\nin illegal sexual activity in New York as charged in the Indictment, you may\n\nconsider it. Even when the witness was over the age of consent in [insert\n\nrelevant jurisdiction, e.g., New Mexico], at the relevant time period, you may\nconclude that the witness was belou the age of consent in New York, which is\n\nl7 years old. [For witnesses relevant to the sex trafficking counts: Further,\n\nthe sexual conduct may be considered in determining whether the defendant\n\nintended the witness to engage in a “commercial sex act” before reaching the\n\nage of l8, and for which the age of consent in [insert relevant jurisdiction] is\n\nirrelevant.] Houever, you may not consider this testimony regarding sexual\n\nactivity that took place above the age of consent with respect to the relevant\nstatute as I have just described it as any kind of reflection on Mr. Epstein’s nor\n\nMs. Maxwell’s character or propensity to commit any of the crimes charged in the\n\nIndictment.\n\nThe proposed revision provides the jury with information that matches the expected\ntestimony, provides the jury with sufficient context about the question before it to avoid confusion\nabout hou it can and cannot consider the sexual activity, avoids an inaccurate statement of state\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooll3o9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011351.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 72l Filed o7/l2/22 Page/7of9\nThe Honorable Alison J.

But I would also point out that\nl7 I think we did have testimony that there were multiple message\nl8 pads going on at any one time. The surrounding message pads\n\nl9 are not a perfect indicator of when that message would have\n2o been taken if it's undated. It could have been weeks, months\n2l afterwards that someone decided to use that message pad to take\n22 that message instead of another of message pad that was ongoing\n23 at the same time. So there is no reliable credible evidence\n24 that's the date of that message pad.\n25 And so, your Honor, we cited a number of cases in our\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.«*\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooll545", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011546.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 737 Filed o7/22/22 Page 27 oflol 27\nM6SQmaxl\n\nl submission about the Court has to consider the weight and\n\n2 reliability of the evidence when determining a factor -- a\n\n3 sentencing factor that is going to increase the guidelines,\n\n4 especially by the amount that this is going to increase it by.\niy And this one uncorroborated, unadmited, unreliable message pad\n6 is not sufficient for that purpose.

I\n23 do conclude by a preponderance of the evidence that the\n24 defendant led a criminally responsible participant.\n25 I further find that the defendant's criminal activity\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.«*\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooll56l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011562.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 737 Filed o7/22/22 Page 43oflol 43\nM6SQmaxl\n\nl was extensive. Whether criminal activity is extensive is based\n2 primarily on the number of people involved, criminally and\n\n3 noncriminally, rather than on other possible indicators of the\n4 extensiveness of the activity. District courts must determine\n5 the number of knouing participants in the criminal activity,\n\n6 the number of unknouing participants whose activities were\n\n7 organized or led by the defendant with specific criminal\n\n8 intent, and the extent to which the services of the unknouing\n\n9 participants were peculiar and necessary to the criminal\n\nlo scheme. For example, a taxi driver that drives a defendant to\nll a crime scene would not count. That is an example from a case\nl2 called Carrozzella, lo5 F.3d at 8o4.\n\nl3 At all relevant times, the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> proved at trial\nl4 included at least two knouing participants: Epstein and the\n\nl5 defendant. Beginning in 2oo2, Sarah Kellen joined, and\n\nl6 beginning in approximately 2ool, additional minor victims were\nl7 recruited through Virginia and Carolyn. Additionally, trial\n\nl8 evidence established that services were unknouingly provided by\nl9 various Epstein employees. For example, I credit Juan Alessi's\n2o testimony that follouing the defendant's instructions, he\n2l scheduled massage appointments, set up the massage table for\n22 appointments, cleaned up after sexualized massages, and on at\n23 least one occasion drove Virginia to an appointment.\n24 Additionally, both Visoski and Rodgers were employed\n25 as Epstein's pilots over the same time period as the counts of\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.«*\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooll562", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011563.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 737 Filed o7/22/22 Page 44oflol 44\nM6SQmaxl\n\nl conviction. Visoski testified that Maxwell partially ouned the\n2 jet, and both pilots testified that she would tell them when to\n3 fly Epstein or schedule flights for herself. The evidence at\n\n4 trial demonstrates that Epstein and the defendant had the\n\n5 pilots fly victims of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. Across the timeframe of\n6 all counts of conviction, Alessi, Visoski and Rodgers provided\n7 personalized services that were peculiarly tailored to the\n\n8 defendant's offenses and were not fungible services generally\n\n9 available to the public.

So there has to be -- the object of this\n\nl4 <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> is a violation of New York law. With respect to\n\nl5 Kate, there was no violation of New York law. Your Honor\n\nl6 already instructed the jury that they can't consider that\n\nl7 evidence for purposes of conviction because she was above the\nl8 age of consent. There was no violation of New York law. Same\nl9 thing with —-\n2o THE COURT: Well, just to be slightly more precise,\nal they can't convict on that count based solely on the evidence\n22 of the conduct involving her.\n23 MR. EVERDELL: Correct. And with respect to Annie,\n24 the Court also instructed that this is -- whatever conduct they\n25 may find that she talked about in New Mexico, was not illegal\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool43l2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014313.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 765 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 9 of 95 2747\nLCIlMAXl\n\nl sexual activity as charged in the indictment, which is a\n\n2 reference to the violation of New York law, because that is the\n3 theory we're proceeding under.\n\n4 With respect to Carolyn, there was no limiting\n\n5 instruction, but it's evident we were talking about Florida\n\n6 conduct. There is no violation of New York law there. So the\n7 only evidence we have that goes to -- that actually establishes\n8 a violation of New York law, which is the object of this\n\n9 <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, and the object of the transportation <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, is\nlo what Jane said.\nll Nou the Court did instruct the jury that they can\nl2 consider the testimony of Kate and of Annie for whatever\nl3 relevant purpose they see fit, and I suppose that could be\nl4 evidence of a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, correct, but for them to actually\nl5 convict on this, they have to believe that somebody commited a\nl6 violation of New York law, and that relates solely to Jane, and\nl7 so we don't think -- there are no multiple alleged victims of\nl8 this <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> other than Jane that's been established by the\nl9 evidence at trial. So we believe while they may be able to\n2o consider the testimony of Annie and Kate as evidence of some\n2l sort of relevant evidence that speaks to this <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, that\n22 is not -- they are not victims of this <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, there was no\n23 violation of New York law that they testified to, and that is\n24 Jane alone.

ROHRBACH: Your Honor, this is a place where the\n\n3 defense confuses <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> violations and substantive\n\n4 violations. There does not have to be a proven violation of\n\n5 New York law as to any of the minor victims. It just has to be\n6 an agreement to accomplish that purpose. Carolyn, for\n\n7 instance, was invited to travel by the defendant. The jury can\n8 readily find that that invitation to travel included an\n\n9 invitation to New York, where the abuse would continue, as it\nlo did for Jane. Annie was in fact transported by the defendant\nll Epstein to New Mexico and New York. The jury could readily\n\nl2 find that that was a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> that existed, and as part of\n\nl3 that grooming conduct, the plan would be to continue to abuse\nl4 her, including back in New York. These are available\n\nl5 inferences to the jury, and that's all that's required for the\nl6 <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> count.\n\nl7 THE COURT: That's precisely why there was a different\nl8 limiting instruction for Annie than there was for Kate.\n\nl9 MR. EVERDELL: Well, your Honor, I would dispute the\n2o facts a litle bit there, because they said that Carolyn's\n2l testimony was that she was invited to travel to the island.\n22 She was not invited to travel anywhere; she specifically\n23 testified she was given an invitation to the island. That's\n24 not travel to New York. And her mother said she couldn't be\n25 able to go. So I don't think that is evidence -- if the object\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool43l4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014315.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 765 Filed o8/lo/22 Pagellof95 2749\nLCIlMAXl\n\nl of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> is to violate New York law, then an\n\n2 invitation to an island that's not New York doesn't count.\n\n3 And also, an invitation to travel to New Mexico to do\n4 whatever it is they were planning on doing in New Mexico is\n\n5) also not a goal of violating New York law. I'm sorry, from\n\n6 Arizona. So there's no connection to New York law with respect\n7 to Annie's testimony either.\n\n8 And so whatever purpose they want to glean from those\n9 two witnesses' testimony, Kate and Annie, or even Carolyn, the\nlo object of this <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, for this to be a crime, it can only\nll be hung on the testimony, at least in the evidence in the\n\nl2 record, the testimony of Jane.

I think here and elsewhere, the defense --\n2o Mr. Everdell can correct me, but an issue in the parties'\nal proposed requests to charge is whether things like the name\n22 Jane, travel to New York, the name Jeffrey Epstein should all\n23 be included in the recitation of the elements. I think the\n24 defense is geting that because it's in the \"to wit\" clause of\n25 the indictment, and the law is quite clear -- and I have\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool4325", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014326.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 765 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 22 of 95 276o\nLCIlMAXl\n\nl authority if the Court would like -- that the fact that there\n\n2 are proper nouns in the \"to wit\" clauses does not mean the\n\n3 government is bound by them as elements of the offense, as long\n4 as the government is proceeding on the essential elements of\n\n5 the crime as charged by the grand jury. And I think there's no\n6 suggestion -- it's quite clear that the government has been\n\n7 trying to prove the offenses in the indictment and there's no\n\n8 need to include words like \"travel from Florida to New York,\"\n\n9 or \"Jane,\" to avoid any suggestion of a variance.\n\nlo THE COURT: Yes, I agree with that.

See generally Dkt. 67o at 3-4; Dkt. 785 at 2.\n\nOn June 29, 2o2o, a grand jury in this District returned a six-count indictment against\nMaxwell, alleging that she had facilitated and participated in Epstein’s sexual abuse of multiple\nminor girls. It charged her with <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex\nacts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l; enticement of a minor to engage in illegal sex acts, in\nviolation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2; <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to transport minors with intent to engage in\nillegal sexual activity, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l; transportation of a minor with intent to\nengage in illegal sexual activity, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2423(a) and 2; and, in two counts,\nperjury, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l623. See Dkt. l (“Initial Indictment”). It based these\ncharges on Maxwell’s conduct with respect to three minor victims, whom the Government\nidentified pseudonymously. On July 8, 2o2o, the grand jury returned a superseding indictment\nthat made ministerial corrections. Dkt. l7 (“Sl Indictment”). On March 29, 2o2l, a different\ngrand jury in this District returned a second superseding indictment. It added two counts, based\non a fourth minor victim, to whom it also referred pseudonymously.

See Dkt. l87 (“S2 Indictment’). The\nS2 Indictment also broadened the time period of the sexual abuse crimes, originally alleged to\nspan l994 to l997, to span l994 to 2oo4.\n\nB.

Maxwell purported to\nbefriend the girls to gain their trust and create the illusion of friendship and responsible adult\nsupervision, while isolating them from others. She then manipulated that trust to normalize\nsexual abuse by Epstein and herself, often through the pretext of giving Epstein “massages.”\nMaxwell personally participated in acts of sexual abuse, including, for example, instructing\nthen—l4-year-old Jane hou to touch Epstein’s penis during a “massage,” and touching Jane’s\nbreasts herself. Maxwell and Epstein also paid young girls hundreds of dollars of cash in\nexchange for meeting Epstein to be sexually abused. Once a girl was introduced to these\nsexualized massages, she was offered more money if she brought other girls to engage in\nsexualized massages. Maxwell also fostered a culture of silence at Epstein’s various households\nwhere sexual abuse occurred, directing employees to “see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing.”\n\nC. Post-Trial Motions\n\nOn January l9, 2o22, Maxwell moved for a new trial under Federal Rule of Criminal\nProcedure 33, based on a juror’s provision of inaccurate information during jury deliberations.\nDkt. 58o.

On April 29, 2o22, Judge Nathan denied all but one of these motions.

(Hence the hypotheticals involving John\n\nWilkes Booth and Aaron Burr.)!” Second, the passage of time erodes many of the\n\njustifications for continued secrecy. See Douglas Oil [Co. v. Petrol Stops\n\nNorthwest, 44l U.S. 22l, 222 (l979)] (noting that the interests in grand jury secrecy\n\nare reduced after the grand jury has ended its activities). Third, the passage of time\n\neventually, and inevitably, brings about the death of the principal parties involved\n\nin the investigations, as well as that of their immediate families. And the continued\n\nexistence and vulnerability of such parties is, of itself, a factor that a court should\n\nconsider.\nId. at lo7 (footnote added).\n\nThis factor presents countervailing considerations. On the one hand, 2o-3o years have\npassed since Maxwell (and Epstein) commited the crimes for which they were charged. (The\nconduct for which Maxwell was convicted spanned l994 to 2oo4.)\n\nOn the other hand, the grand juries that indicted Maxwell met approximately five years\nago. Maxwell’s trial occurred under four years ago. Her conviction remains on direct appeal.\nAnd numerous victims of Epstein and Maxwell are still alive. These circumstances starkly\ncontrast with most precedents in this line of cases, which involved testimony decades earlier.\nSee, e.g., id. at loo (l948 testimony); Jn re National Security Archive, lo4 F. Supp. 3d at 626\n(l95o testimony); Jn re AHA, 49 F. Supp. 2d at 277-78 (l947-l95o testimony); see also note l2,\nsupra (citing similar D.D.C. cases). But see In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d at 492-93 (testimony less\nthan two years earlier).\n\n'’ The Circuit, in illustrating earlier in its opinion why historical or public interest considerations\ncould justify the release of grand jury information, stated: “To the extent that the John Wilkes\nBooth or Aaron Burr conspiracies, for example, led to grand jury investigations, historical\ninterest might by nou overwhelm any continued need for secrecy.” /d. at lo5.\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l58", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016178.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 74l Filed o8/lo/22 Page 68 of lo6 8l\nLBTVMAX3 Opening —- Ms. Sternheim\n\nl I don't even, as part of the defense, have to make an opening\n\n2 statement, but far be it for a lawyer not to want to talk.

And \"persuade\" means to\n2o prevail on a person to do something as by advising, urging,\n2l etc., to induce to believe or convince.\n22 So, again, these are words of causation.\n23 Nou, the only testimony that we have in the record\n24 that relates in any way to Ms. Maxwell taking part in Jane's\n25 travel to New York is that Jane testified as to the follouing\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool6455", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016458.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 759 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 242 of 267 227o\nLCAVMAX8\n\nl Ghislaine to have Ghislaine arrange the travel.

And here\nl8 we don't even have that. We just have her performing what a\n\nl9 travel agent would do, which is arranging travel plans.

Annie was in fact transported by the defendant\nll Epstein to New Mexico and New York.

If the defense would\n\nl5 like it to say it relates solely to Jane here as in the\n\nl6 summary, that would be fine, but the Court is just laying out\nl7 the elements of the offense and there's no need to put all of\nl8 the factual predicates of the offense into the statement of the\nl9 elements. I think here and elsewhere, the defense --\n2o Mr. Everdell can correct me, but an issue in the parties'\nal proposed requests to charge is whether things like the name\n22 Jane, travel to New York, the name Jeffrey Epstein should all\n23 be included in the recitation of the elements. I think the\n24 defense is geting that because it's in the \"to wit\" clause of\n25 the indictment, and the law is quite clear -- and I have\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool6947", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016948.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 765 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 22 of 95 276o\nLCIlMAXl\n\nl authority if the Court would like -- that the fact that there\n\n2 are proper nouns in the \"to wit\" clauses does not mean the\n\n3 government is bound by them as elements of the offense, as long\n4 as the government is proceeding on the essential elements of\n\n5 the crime as charged by the grand jury. And I think there's no\n6 suggestion -- it's quite clear that the government has been\n\n7 trying to prove the offenses in the indictment and there's no\n\n8 need to include words like \"travel from Florida to New York,\"\n\n9 or \"Jane,\" to avoid any suggestion of a variance.\n\nlo THE COURT: Yes, I agree with that. Obviously this\n\nll dispute was in the parties' proposed charge, and I balanced I\nl2 think, as appropriate, including the name of the individual\n\nl3 where a particular count applies only to them, but not\n\nl4 otherwise restating factually in the explanation of the counts\nl5 and the elements each of the factual points to be proved.

Nothing. Carolyn\n\nl8 never went to New York. She never traveled anywhere. Any\n\nl9 suggestion that she was asked to travel was something she added\n2o in the last year after her first lawsuits were over and her\nal money was gone and she was adding Ghislaine Maxwell to the\n22 case.\n23 Annie came to New York through no involvement of\n24 Ghislaine Maxwell.

If you find\n\n5 beyond a reasonable doubt that two or more persons came to an\n\n6 understanding, express or implied, to violate the law and to\n\n7 accomplish an unlawful plan, then the government will have\n\n8 sustained its burden of proof as to this element.\n\n9 To shou that a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> existed, the government is\nlo not required to shou that two or more people sat around a table\nll and entered into a solemn pact orally or in writing stating\nl2 that they had formed a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to violate the law, spelling\nl3 out all of the details. Common sense tells you that when\nl4 people, in fact, agree to enter into a criminal <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>,\n\nl5 much is left to the unexpressed understanding. It is rare that\nl6 a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> can be proven by direct evidence of an explicit\nl7 agreement. Conspirators do not usually reduce their agreements\nl8 to writing or acknouledge them before a notary public, nor do\nl9 they publicly broadcast their plans.\n2o In determining whether an agreement existed, you may\n2l consider direct as well as circumstantial evidence. The old\n22 adage \"actions speak louder than words\" applies here. Often\n23 the only evidence that is available with respect to the\n24 existence of a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> is that of disconnected acts and\n25 conduct on the part of the alleged individual co-conspirators.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool7235", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00017236.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 2l5 of 257 3o49\nLCKVMAX8 Charge\n\nl When taken all together and considered as whole, houever, these\n2 acts and conduct may warrant the inference that a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>\n\n3 existed as conclusively as would direct proof, such as evidence\n4 of an express agreement.\n\n5 In short, as far as the first element of the\n\n6 <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> is concerned, the government must prove beyond a\n\n7 reasonable doubt that at least two alleged conspirators came to\n8 a mutual understanding, either spoken or unspoken, to violate\n\n9 the law in the manner charged in Counts One, Three, and Five of\nlo the indictment.\n\nll Instruction No. 34.

In other words, a defendant cannot\nl9 avoid criminal responsibility for her oun conduct by\n2o deliberately closing her eyes or remaining purposefully\nal ignorant of facts which would confirm to her that she was\n22 engaged in unlawful conduct.\n23 With respect to the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts, you must also\n24 keep in mind that there is an important difference between\n25 knouingly and intentionally participating in a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, on\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool7249", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00017250.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 229 of 257 3o63\nLCKCmax9 Charge\n\nl the one hand — and which I just explained to you — and knouing\n2 the specific objective of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> on the other.

We've already had\n2 a lot of testimony about hou there were frequent renovations to\n3 these places, we had testimony from Juan Alessi about that, and\n4 so there is no reason to believe that the interior of this\n\na tounhouse looked the way it did in 2ol9, whether it looked the\n6 same way in l994 to 2oo4, which is the time period of the\n\n7 <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.

I believe the only witness they have\n\nl8 testified so far, and maybe the only one they can offer, is\n\nl9 Jane, who testified very, very generally and very briefly about\n2o hou the New York tounhouse looked on the inside. She said\n2l something to the effect of, there was old wood, it was dark,\n22 there were creepy animal pictures on the wall. That's all we\n23 had.

To the extent Maxwell complains\nthat unsealing filings in a civil case may result in un-\nfair pretrial publicity in her criminal case, she will\nhave the opportunity to request that the District Court\nestablish practices to help ensure she gets a fair and\nimpartial jury.® If she is displeased with those efforts,\n\n8 Maxwell makes much of the Government hav-\ning moved to intervene and stay the proceedings in Doe\nvu. Indyke, noting that the Government has not moved\nto intervene in Giuffre v. Maxwell, to stay the unseal-\ning process. (Br. 29). Maxwell suggests that the Gov-\nernment’s decision to not do so is motivated by “un-\nprincipled” reasons. (Br. 29-3o). Seting Maxwell’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> theories aside, Doe v. Indyke and Giuffre v.\nMaxwell are in completely different procedural pos-\ntures, which implicate different concerns regarding a\npending criminal case.

Accordingly, there\nis no more discovery to be conducted in the Giuffre case\nand no possible concern to the Government that, for\nexample, its trial witnesses in the criminal case might\nbe deposed in that civil case. Additionally, the fact that\na document may be unsealed through an independent\nprocess before Judge Preska would not reveal the Gov-\nernment’s investigative focus or techniques.\n\nIn Doe v.

During that time,\nMaxwell had a personal and professional relationship with Epstein and was one of his closest\nassociates.\n\nBeginning in at least l994, the defendant enticed and groomed multiple minor girls to\nengage in sex acts with Epstein, through a variety of means and methods. In particular, she played\na key role in Epstein’s abuse of minors by helping Epstein to identify, groom, and ultimately abuse\nunderage girls. As a part of their scheme, the defendant and Epstein enticed and caused minor\nvictims to travel to Epstein’s residences in different states, which the defendant knew and intended\nwould result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse.\n\nAs the Indictment details, the defendant enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in\nmultiple ways. For example, she atempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their\nlives, taking them to the movies or on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with\nEpstein. She put victims at ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who\nseemingly approved of Epstein’s behavior. Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein,\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oool9866", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019886.jpg": "CaGese2hlcrdaseuAUAN Scene l &Pitdd BHPPHMS Pages 2 St 2EP\n\nStephens, Ms. Maxwell’s inability to meet with her atorneys while this policy is in effect\nconstitutes a “compelling reason” requiring her release.

As counsel learned this past week,\nhouever, even an urgent call request does not mean the call will take place in the time required.\nAt approximately 5:3o p.m. on July 6, 2o2o, the Court ordered us to confer with Ms. Maxwell\nabout waiving her physical presence at the arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing, and\nordered counsel for both sides to jointly report back by 9:oo p.m. that night with a proposed date\nand time for these proceedings. We promptly emailed the MDC to request an urgent call,\nmaking specific reference to the Court’s Order, but were not connected with Ms. Maxwell until\n9:oo p.m. There will no doubt be other orders of the Court with no guarantees we will be able to\nreach our client in time if she is detained.’ In addition, during this past week, Ms. Maxwell has\nnot been able to physically review documents and has had limited access to writing materials.\nThe prohibition on in-person visits means we must read to her any documents requiring her\nreview, and she has virtually no ability to take notes. The age of the allegations in this case\ncompound these problems. Under the current circumstances, Ms. Maxwell cannot review\n6 Since the Court issued its opinion in Stephens, numerous other courts in this District have ordered defendants\nreleased on bail, over the government’s objection, due to the pandemic and its impact on the defendant’s ability to\nprepare for trial. See, e.g., United States v. Carrillo-Villa, 2o-MJ-3o73 (SLC) (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 6, 2o2o) (releasing\nundocumented defendant in drug <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> case because of inability to meaningfully communicate with lawyer and\nrisk of COVID-l9); United States v.

While we greatly appreciate\nthese efforts, they are a short-term patch to a persistent problem that shous no signs of abating.

The government asserts that\ndetention is warranted because of the potential for a long sentence in this case. (Gov. Mem.\nat 4-5.) This oversimplifies the governing standard. Although the severity of potential\npunishment is a relevant consideration, the Second Circuit “require[s] more than evidenceof\nthe commission of a serious crime and the fact of a potentially long sentence to support a\nfinding of risk of flight.” Friedman, 837 F.2d at 49-5o (district court’s finding that\ndefendant posed a risk of flight was clearly erroneous, despite potential for “long sentence\nof incarceration”); see also Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 65, 76-77 (reversing detention order\nwhere defendants agreed to significant physical and financial restrictions, despite the fact\nthat they faced a “lengthy term of incarceration’). Accordingly, the asserted potential for a\nlong sentence does not meet the government’s burden of persuasion.'4\n‘4 The government relies on United States v. Alindato-Perez, 627 F. Supp. 2d 58, 66 (D.P.R. 2oo9), cited\napprovingly by United States v. Moscaritolo, No. lo Cr. 4 (JL), 2olo WL 3o9679, at *2 (D.N.H. Jan. 26, 2olo) for\nthe proposition that “[t]he steeper the potential sentence, the more probable the flight risk is, especially considering\nthe strong case of the government .. ..” (Gov.

Alindato-Perez was a narcotics case that did not involve 2o-year old conduct as here, but\ninstead involved a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> that “continu[ed] until the date of the indictment.” 627 F. Supp. 2d at 6o-6l. The\nevidence included eleven “clearly incriminating video tapes” and testimony from various cooperating witnesses, and\nthe defendant faced a lo-year mandatory minimum sentence. /d. at 6l-64.

(Gov. Mem. at 5.) In fact, her likely total exposure\neven if she were convicted on all counts is lo years, assuming the Court were to follou the\ntraditional practice in this District and impose concurrent sentences. Although a lo-year\nsentence would be significant, it is a far cry from the government’s forecast, further\ndemonstrating that the government has not met its burden of shouing Ms. Maxwell is an\nactual risk of flight.\n\nThe Government's Case Is Subject to Significant Challenges. In evaluating the\nstrength of the government’s case, we note that Ms. Maxwell intends to mount several legal\nchallenges to the indictment, including that: (l) this prosecution is barred by Epstein’s\nSeptember 24, 2oo7 non-prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice, which\ncovers “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”; (ll) the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, enticement of minors,\nand transporting of minors charges are time-barred and otherwise legally flawed; and (il)\nthe two perjury charges are subject to dismissal on several legal grounds.'> In addition, as\nwe understand from the face of the indictment, the government’s case is based primarily on\nthe testimony of three individuals about events that allegedly occurred roughly 25 years ago\nbetween l994 and l997. It is inherently more difficult to prosecute cases relating to\ndecades-old conduct. These issues further call into question the strength of the government’s\ncase, and provide an independent basis justifying release on bail.\nlS The defense is also considering whether the government’s comments in connection with this case conform to\nLocal Criminal Rule 23.l, and whether to seek appropriate relief from the Court.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR- oool9898", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019946.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 39-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Page87 of 2oo P|\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl legal presumption that there are no conditions that could\n\n2 reasonably assure her return to court and, your Honor, the\n\n3 defendant has not come anywhere close to rebuting that\n\n4 presumption.\n\n5 Turning first to the nature and seriousness of the\n\n6 offense and the strength of the evidence, the indictment in\n\n7 this case arises from the defendant's role in transporting\n\n8 minors for unlawful sexual activity and enticing minors to\n\n9 travel to engage in unlawful sexual active and participating in\nlo a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to do the same.

Far from creating a flight risk, the lack of corroboration\nonly reinforces Ms. Maxwell's conviction that she has been falsely accused and\nstrengthens her long-standing desire to face the allegations against her and clear\nher name in court.\n¢ Oppressive conditions of confinement. Ms. Maxwell has nou been detained\nfor over l5o days in the equivalent of solitary confinement since she was\nindicted and arrested on July 2, 2o2o, despite the fact that she is not a suicide\nrisk and has not received a single disciplinary infraction. The draconian\nconditions to which Ms. Maxwell is subjected are not only unjust and\npunitive, but also impair her ability to review the voluminous discovery\nproduced by the government and to participate meaningfully in the\npreparation of her defense. Furthermore, the recent COVID-l9 outbreak\nat the MDC threatens her safety and well-being.\nMs. Maxwell Should Be Placed on Restrictive Bail Conditions\nDuring her more than five months in isolation, Ms. Maxwell has had to watch as she has\nbeen relentlessly atacked in a deluge of media articles that spiked over a year ago when Epstein\n?

NATHAN, District Judge:\nDetendant Ghislaine Maxwell has been indicted by a grand jury on charges of <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>\nto entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l; enticing a\nminor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2; <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>\nto transport minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l; transporting\nminors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2423 and 2; and two charges\nof perjury, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l623. The Court held a lengthy bail hearing on July l4,\n2o2o. After extensive briefing and argument at the hearing, the Court concluded that the\nDefendant was a clear risk of flight and that no conditions or combination of conditions would\nensure her appearance. Bail was therefore denied.\nThe Defendant has nou filed a renewed motion for release on bail pending trial, which\nthe Government opposes. In her renewed motion, the Defendant atempts to respond to the\nreasons that the Court provided in denying bail and proposes a substantially larger bail package.\nBut by and large, the arguments presented either were made at the initial bail hearing or could\nhave been made then. In any event, the new information provided in the renewed application\nonly solidifies the Court’s view that the Defendant plainly poses a risk of flight and that no\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol28", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020136.jpg": "CaGade2o epQ)o36Go4AUNt Dib Suitentl l2G2 lF iG 3228o/2o9 Paget J Gb 22\nany person or the community posed by pre-trial release. See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436; see also\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court considered these factors before concluding\nthat no conditions of release could reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.\nAnd the first and fourth factors remain unchanged. As already noted, the Defendant is charged\nwith offenses involving minor victims, and it is undisputed that the nature and circumstances of\nthe offenses charged in the Superseding Indictment weighs in favor of continued detention. On\nthe other hand, the Government has not advanced any evidence that the Defendant poses a\ndanger to any person or to the community, a factor that weighs against detention. The\nDefendant’s arguments therefore focus on the second and third factors.\n\nAs explained belou, neither the arguments put forth in the Defendant’s renewed motion\nfor bail nor the evidence she submited in conjunction with her motion rebut the Court’s\nconclusions, and the Court continues to find, after again applying these factors, that no\nconditions of release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance at future proceedings.\n\nl. The Weight of the Evidence\n\nThe Court will address the strength of the Government’s case first. The Defendant\nargues that the Government lacks any meaningful documentary corroboration of the witness\ntestimony and that the discovery produced to date has included only a “small number of\ndocuments from the time period of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.” Def. Mot. at 5. And she claims, as a result,\nthat the Government overstated the strength of its case in advance of the July l4, 2o2o bail\nhearing. See id. at3o 33. So she argues that the second § 3l42(g) factor supports release.\n\nThe Court disagrees. Arguing that the case against her “is based almost exclusively on\nthe recollections of the three accusers, who remain unidentified,” the Defendant contends that the\n9\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol36", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020137.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAURnt Bbcindert l/262 FileehRa3o/Ptag P Age fl O6af 22\nweight of the evidence is weak. Def. Reply at 2. But she too easily discredits the witness\ntestimony. According to the Government, and as reflected in the indictment, it is anticipated that\nthe three witnesses will provide detailed and corroborating accounts of the Defendant’s alleged\nrole in enticing minors to engage in sex acts. See Gov’t Opp’n at lo; see also Dkt. No. l7, Sl\nSuperseding Indictment, §§f 7, ll, l3, l7. Moreover, the Government proffers that additional\nevidence, including flight records and other witnesses’ corroborating testimony, will further\nsupport the main witnesses’ testimony and link the Defendant to Epstein’s conduct. Gov’t\nOpp’n at lo-ll. And while the Defendant contends that much of this evidence focuses on\nEpstein, not the Defendant, the nature of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charge (along with the evidence linking\nthe Defendant to Epstein) renders this evidence relevant to the Government’s charges against\nher. As the Court stated in the July l4, 2o2o hearing, although the Court does not prejudge the\nmerits of the Government’s case or of the Defendant’s defenses, for purposes of the bail\ndetermination stage, the Government’s proffered case against the Defendant remains strong. See\nDkt. No. 93 (“Tr.”) at 83:4-83:lo. The Court again concludes that the Defendant’s awareness of\nthe potential strength of the government’s case against her creates a risk of flight, and none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments meaningfully alter that conclusion. As a result, the second factor\nsupports detention.\n\n2. The Defendant’s History and Characteristics\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court determined that the Defendant was a flight\nrisk in part because of her substantial international ties, including multiple foreign citizenships\nand familial and personal connections abroad and her ounership of at least one foreign property\nof significant value. See Tr. at 83:l3—83:l8. And the Court further noted that the Defendant’s\nextraordinary financial resources could provide her the means to flee the country even despite\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol37", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020180.jpg": "CaSast: 2o-8o o88oHAEN A6tuPMent/LVP l Fileasasi2 372l9 ePageBlGhl8\nConceded Problems Undermine the Strength of the Government’s Case\n\nAs Ms. Maxwell’s period of detention passes the nine-month mark, the government has\ncontinuously upgraded Ms. Maxwell from a “plain [ ] risk of flight” to a “substantial and\nactual risk of flight” to a “serious flight of risk” and nou to an “extreme risk of flight.” (Dkt.\nl65 at l.) Ironically, her level of flight risk increases as the strength of government’s case\nagainst her diminishes. Ms. Maxwell has challenged the strength of the government’s case\nin pretrial motions pending before the Court. Among other things, Ms. Maxwell has\npersuasively argued that the Non-Prosecution Agreement entered into by Jeffrey Epstein in\n2oo7, which immunizes “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” bars Ms. Maxwell’s\nprosecution in this case, and that the counts charging her with alleged sexual abuse are\ntime-barred.\n\nThe government’s response to Ms. Maxwell’s pretrial motions shines further light\nof the weaknesses of its case. For example, the government concedes it cannot establish that\neither Ms. Maxwell or Epstein ever caused, or sought to cause, Accuser-3* to travel while she\nwas a minor or that she was underage when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein.\n(See Opp.l62-65 & fn. 57-58.)° Hence, her allegations cannot support the conspiracies charged\nin the Indictment, leaving the government with only two witnesses to prove the charges against\nMs. Maxwell. More importantly, in connection with the government’s response, it\nproduced documents indicating that government prosecutors misled a federal judge to\nobtain evidence against Ms. Maxwell (see, e.g.,. Opp. Ex. 4-7) - a shocking revelation that\nundermines the viability of the perjury counts, not to mention the integrity of the entire\n+ Accuser-3 is identified in the Indictment as “Minor Victim-3.”\n\n5 “Opp.” references are to page numbers of the Government’s Omnibus Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant’s\nPre-Trial Motions, dated February 26, 2o2l and not yet publicly filed.\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol8o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020181.jpg": "CaSasb: 2o-8o o88oHAEN At uMMent/LVP l Fileasasy2 372l9 ePagebl l65l8\nprosecution.\n\nThe ongoing review of discovery confirms the lack of evidence in support of the\nstale allegations in the indictment. Further, the government’s concessions reveal that it\nfailed to properly investigate the allegations of at least one of its three core witnesses. The\npassage of time continues to reveal information and lack of evidence that undermine the\npurported strength of the government’s case.\n\nBail Must Be Granted\n\nThe detention of Ms. Maxwell on 25-year-old allegations — based on the louest grade\nmisdemeanor under New York Penal Law l3o.55° — presented in a sensationalized\nindictment containing pictures to inflame the public and entice and feed the media frenzy’ —\nis unwarranted in the face of the unique bail package before the Court. Relentless media\ncoverage of Ms. Maxwell, which preceded and impacted the bringing of this prosecution,\nhas increased significantly since her arrest and detention. Ms. Maxwell’s continued\ndetention — providing daily fodder for media for the past nine months—continues to severely\nundermine her presumption of innocence.\n\nIn the face of this enhanced bail package, the government’s claim that Ms. Maxwell\nposes “an extreme risk of flight” rings hollou. The government urges the Court to apply a\nstandard that defies the law - an absolute guarantee against all risks. See United States v.\nOrta, 76o, F.2d 887, 888 n.4 (8th Cir. l985) (\"The legal standard required by the [Bail\nReform] Act is one of reasonable assurances, not absolute guarantees.\"). Under the Bail\n« Counts Two and Four allege violations of New York Penal Law § l3o.55 - sexual abuse in the third degree - a\nclass B misdemeanor punishable by maximum penalties of three months in jail or one year probation.\n\n7 What other purpose could be served by the inclusion of a picture of Ms. Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein taken over a\ndozen years after the period of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> alleged and pictures of three high-value residences?\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol8l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020192.jpg": "CaSasb: 2o-8o o88oHAEN A6tuPMeht/LOP l Filecsas2 2729 ePagefll6l2\nE SDNY\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DOCUMENT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nDATE FILED: 3/22/2l\nUnited States of America,\n_y—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

The\nGovernment did not file any opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions. The\nCourt will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions after applying the three—part test\narticulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d\nllo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the\ndocuments in question are \"judicial documents;” (i) assess the weight of the common\nlaw presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing factors include\nbut are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o (quoting United\nStates v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo II\"), 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995)). The proposed\nredactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that the Defendant's submissions are\n\"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process,”\nthereby qualifying as a \"judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the\nLugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995).\nAnd the Court also finds that the common law presumption of access ataches. Id. at\nl46; see also Nixon v.

(Everdell, Christian) (Entered: o4/l6/2o2l)\n\no4/l6/2o2l | 2o7 | OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. In June 2o2o, a grand jury returned a\nsix—count indictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell with facilitating the late financier\nJeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of minor victims from around l994 to l997. The\nGovernment filed a first (Sl) superseding indictment shortly thereafter, which\ncontained only small, ministerial corrections. The Sl superseding indictment included\ntwo counts of enticement or transportation of minors to engage in illegal sex acts in\nviolation of the Mann Act and two counts of <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to commit those offenses. It\nalso included two counts of perjury in connection with Maxwell's testimony in a civil\ndeposition. Trial is set to begin on July l2, 2o2l. Maxwell filed twelve pretrial\nmotions seeking to dismiss portions of the $l superseding indictment, suppress\nevidence, and compel discovery. After the parties fully briefed those motions, a grand\njury returned a second (S2) superseding indictment adding a sex trafficking count and\nanother related <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> count. This Opinion resolves all of Maxwell's currently\npending pretrial motions other than those seeking to suppress evidence, which the\nCourt will resolve in due course. The motions, and this Opinion, deal exclusively with\nthe Sl superseding indictment and do not resolve any issues related to the newly added\nsex trafficking charges. For the reasons that follou, the Court denies Maxwell's\nmotions to dismiss the $l superseding indictment in whole or in part. It grants her\nmotion to sever the perjury charges for a separate trial. It denies her motion to further\nexpedite discovery. The Court provides a brief summary of its conclusions here and its\nreasoning on the pages that follou:...[*** See this Opinion & Order ***]...\nConclusion: The Court DENIES Maxwell's motions to dismiss the indictment as\nbarred by Epstein's non—prosecution agreement (Dkt. No. l4l), to dismiss the Mann\nAct counts as barred by the statute of limitations (Dkt. No. l43), to dismiss the\nindictment for pre—indictment delay (Dkt. No. l37), to dismiss the Mann Act counts\nfor lack of specificity (Dkt. No. l23), to dismiss the perjury counts as legally untenable\n(Dkt. No. l35), to strike surplusage (Dkt. No. l45), to dismiss count one or count three\nas multiplicitous (Dkt. No. l2l), and to expedite pretrial disclosures (Dkt. No. l47).\nThe Court GRANTS Maxwell's motion to sever the perjury counts for a separate trial\n(Dkt. No. ll9). The Court ORDERS the Government to confirm within one week\nwhether it considers any evidence related to negotiation of the non—prosecution\nagreement to constitute Brady or Rule l6 material and, if so, to confirm that it has or\nwill disclose such evidence. The Court further ORDERS the parties to negotiate a final\nschedule for all pretrial disclosures that remain outstanding, including: Brady, Giglio,\nand Jenks Act materials, including co—conspirator statements; non-testifying witness\nstatements; testifying witness statements; the identity of victims alleged in the\nindictment; 4o4(b) material; and the Government's witness list. The Court also requires\nthe parties to negotiate a schedule for any additional or supplemental motions briefing\nin light of the S2 indictment. The Court ORDERS a joint proposal to be submited by\nApril 2l, 2o2l. If agreement is not reached, the parties shall submit their respective\nproposals. The Court further ORDERS Maxwell to shou cause by April 2l, 2o2l why\nher motion to dismiss the Sl superseding indictment under the Sixth Amendment (Dkt.\nNo. l25) should not be denied as moot.

The\nGovernment did not file any opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions. The\nCourt will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions after applying the three—part test\narticulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d\nllo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the\ndocuments in question are \"judicial documents;” (i) assess the weight of the common\nlaw presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing factors include\nbut are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o (quoting United\nStates v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo II\"), 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995)). The proposed\nredactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that the Defendant's submissions are\n\"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process,”\nthereby qualifying as a \"judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the\nLugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995).\nAnd the Court also finds that the common law presumption of access ataches. Id. at\nl46; see also Nixon v.

(Everdell, Christian) (Entered: o4/l6/2o2l)\n\no4/l6/2o2l | 2o7 | OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. In June 2o2o, a grand jury returned a\nsix—count indictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell with facilitating the late financier\nJeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of minor victims from around l994 to l997. The\nGovernment filed a first (Sl) superseding indictment shortly thereafter, which\ncontained only small, ministerial corrections. The Sl superseding indictment included\ntwo counts of enticement or transportation of minors to engage in illegal sex acts in\nviolation of the Mann Act and two counts of <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to commit those offenses. It\nalso included two counts of perjury in connection with Maxwell's testimony in a civil\ndeposition. Trial is set to begin on July l2, 2o2l. Maxwell filed twelve pretrial\nmotions seeking to dismiss portions of the $l superseding indictment, suppress\nevidence, and compel discovery. After the parties fully briefed those motions, a grand\njury returned a second (S2) superseding indictment adding a sex trafficking count and\nanother related <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> count. This Opinion resolves all of Maxwell's currently\npending pretrial motions other than those seeking to suppress evidence, which the\nCourt will resolve in due course. The motions, and this Opinion, deal exclusively with\nthe Sl superseding indictment and do not resolve any issues related to the newly added\nsex trafficking charges. For the reasons that follou, the Court denies Maxwell's\nmotions to dismiss the $l superseding indictment in whole or in part. It grants her\nmotion to sever the perjury charges for a separate trial. It denies her motion to further\nexpedite discovery. The Court provides a brief summary of its conclusions here and its\nreasoning on the pages that follou:...[*** See this Opinion & Order ***]...\nConclusion: The Court DENIES Maxwell's motions to dismiss the indictment as\nbarred by Epstein's non—prosecution agreement (Dkt. No. l4l), to dismiss the Mann\nAct counts as barred by the statute of limitations (Dkt. No. l43), to dismiss the\nindictment for pre—indictment delay (Dkt. No. l37), to dismiss the Mann Act counts\nfor lack of specificity (Dkt. No. l23), to dismiss the perjury counts as legally untenable\n(Dkt. No. l35), to strike surplusage (Dkt. No. l45), to dismiss count one or count three\nas multiplicitous (Dkt. No. l2l), and to expedite pretrial disclosures (Dkt. No. l47).\nThe Court GRANTS Maxwell's motion to sever the perjury counts for a separate trial\n(Dkt. No. ll9). The Court ORDERS the Government to confirm within one week\nwhether it considers any evidence related to negotiation of the non—prosecution\nagreement to constitute Brady or Rule l6 material and, if so, to confirm that it has or\nwill disclose such evidence. The Court further ORDERS the parties to negotiate a final\nschedule for all pretrial disclosures that remain outstanding, including: Brady, Giglio,\nand Jenks Act materials, including co—conspirator statements; non-testifying witness\nstatements; testifying witness statements; the identity of victims alleged in the\nindictment; 4o4(b) material; and the Government's witness list. The Court also requires\nthe parties to negotiate a schedule for any additional or supplemental motions briefing\nin light of the S2 indictment. The Court ORDERS a joint proposal to be submited by\nApril 2l, 2o2l. If agreement is not reached, the parties shall submit their respective\nproposals. The Court further ORDERS Maxwell to shou cause by April 2l, 2o2l why\nher motion to dismiss the Sl superseding indictment under the Sixth Amendment (Dkt.\nNo. l25) should not be denied as moot.

It also included two counts of perjury\nin connection with Maxwell's testimony in a civil deposition. Trial is set to begin on July\nl2, 2o2l. Maxwell filed twelve pretrial motions seeking to dismiss portions of the Sl\nsuperseding indictment, suppress evidence, and compel discovery. After the parties fully\nbriefed those motions, a grand jury returned a second (S2) superseding indictment adding\na sex trafficking count and another related <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> count. This Opinion resolves all of\nMaxwell's currently pending pretrial motions other than those seeking to suppress\nevidence, which the Court will resolve in due course. The motions, and this Opinion, deal\nexclusively with the Sl superseding indictment and do not resolve any issues related to\nthe newly added sex trafficking charges. For the reasons that follou, the Court denies\nMaxwell's motions to dismiss the Sl superseding indictment in whole or in part. It grants\nher motion to sever the perjury charges for a separate trial. It denies her motion to further\nexpedite discovery. The Court provides a brief summary of its conclusions here and its\nreasoning on the pages that follou:...[*** See this Opinion & Order ***]... Conclusion:\nThe Court DENIES Maxwell's motions to dismiss the indictment as barred by Epstein's\nnon-prosecution agreement (Dkt. No. l4l), to dismiss the Mann Act counts as barred by\nthe statute of limitations (Dkt. No. l43), to dismiss the indictment for pre-indictment\ndelay (Dkt. No. l37), to dismiss the Mann Act counts for lack of specificity (Dkt. No.\nl23), to dismiss the perjury counts as legally untenable (Dkt. No. l35), to strike\nsurplusage (Dkt. No. l45), to dismiss count one or count three as multiplicitous (Dkt. No.\nl2l), and to expedite pretrial disclosures (Dkt. No. l47). The Court GRANTS Maxwell's\nmotion to sever the perjury counts for a separate trial (Dkt. No. ll9). The Court\nORDERS the Government to confirm within one week whether it considers any evidence\nrelated to negotiation of the non-prosecution agreement to constitute Brady or Rule l6\nmaterial and, if so, to confirm that it has or will disclose such evidence. The Court further\nORDERS the parties to negotiate a final schedule for all pretrial disclosures that remain\noutstanding, including: Brady, Giglio, and Jenks Act materials, including co-conspirator\nstatements; non-testifying witness statements; testifying witness statements; the identity\nof victims alleged in the indictment; 4o4(b) material; and the Government's witness list.\nThe Court also requires the parties to negotiate a schedule for any additional or\nsupplemental motions briefing in light of the S2 indictment. The Court ORDERS a joint\nproposal to be submited by April 2l, 2o2l. If agreement is not reached, the parties shall\nsubmit their respective proposals. The Court further ORDERS Maxwell to shou cause by\nApril 2l, 2o2l why her motion to dismiss the $l superseding indictment under the Sixth\nAmendment (Dkt. No. l25) should not be denied as moot.

NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nIn June 2o2o, a grand jury returned a six-count indictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell\nwith facilitating the late financier Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of minor victims from around\nl994 to l997. The Government filed a first (Sl) superseding indictment shortly thereafter,\nwhich contained only small, ministerial corrections. The $l superseding indictment included\ntwo counts of enticement or transportation of minors to engage in illegal sex acts in violation of\nthe Mann Act and two counts of <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to commit those offenses. It also included two\ncounts of perjury in connection with Maxwell’s testimony in a civil deposition. Trial is set to\nbegin on July l2, 2o2l.\n\nMaxwell filed twelve pretrial motions seeking to dismiss portions of the $l superseding\nindictment, suppress evidence, and compel discovery. After the parties fully briefed those\nmotions, a grand jury returned a second (S2) superseding indictment adding a sex trafficking\ncount and another related <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> count.\n\nThis Opinion resolves all of Maxwell’s currently pending pretrial motions other than\nthose seeking to suppress evidence, which the Court will resolve in due course. The motions, and\nthis Opinion, deal exclusively with the $l superseding indictment and do not resolve any issues\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o76o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020761.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel43 of 2o8\nA-l39\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2 of 34\n\nrelated to the newly added sex trafficking charges. For the reasons that follou, the Court denies\nMaxwell’s motions to dismiss the Sl superseding indictment in whole or in part. It grants her\nmotion to sever the perjury charges for a separate trial. It denies her motion to further expedite\ndiscovery.\n\nThe Court provides a brief summary of its conclusions here and its reasoning on the\npages that follou:\n\ne Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts based on a non-prosecution agreement between\nJeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of Florida. The Court\nconcludes that the agreement does not apply in this District or to the charged offenses.\n\ne Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts as untimely. The Court concludes that the\nGovernment brought the charges within the statute of limitations and did not unfairly\ndelay in bringing them.\n\ne Maxwell moves to dismiss the Mann Act counts because they are too vague, or in the\nalternative to require the Government to describe the charges in greater detail. The\nCourt concludes that the charges are specific enough.\n\ne Maxwell moves to dismiss the perjury counts because, in her view, her testimony\nresponded to ambiguous questioning and was not material. The Court concludes that\nthese issues are best left for the jury.\n\ne Maxwell moves to sever the perjury counts from the Mann Act counts so that they can\nproceed in a separate trial. The Court concludes that severance is appropriate and will\ntry the perjury counts separately.\n\ne Maxwell moves to strike language from the indictment that she believes is superfluous\nand to dismiss <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts she believes are redundant. The Court concludes that\nthese motions are premature before trial.\n\ne Maxwell moves to compel the Government to immediately disclose certain categories\nof evidence. The Court concludes that she is not entitled to do so, but the Court will\norder Maxwell and the Government to confer on a discovery schedule.\n\ne Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts because a grand jury in White Plains, rather than\nManhatan, returned the $l superseding indictment. Because a jury in Manhatan\nreturned the S2 superseding indictment, the motion appears moot.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o76l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020769.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel5l of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo of 34\nfor example, it is possible to transport a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity\nand not follou through with the planned sexual abuse, and so sexual abuse is not an essential\ningredient of the offense. Maxwell makes the same argument for the enticement and related\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charges.\n\nThis approach is analogous to the “categorical approach” employed by courts to evaluate\nprior convictions for immigration and sentencing purposes. See Taylor v. United States, 495\nU.S. 575, 6o2 (l99o). Generally speaking, the “categorical approach” requires that courts “look\nonly to the statutory definitions—l.e., the elements” of the relevant offense to determine if the\nprovision applies “and not to the particular facts underlying those convictions.” Descamps v.\nUnited States, 57o U.S. 254, 26l (2ol3) (internal quotation marks omited). Whether a statute\nrequires a categorical or case-specific approach is a question of statutory interpretation. To\ndetermine whether Congress used the word “offense” in a statute to refer to an offense in the\nabstract or to the facts of each individual case, the Court must examine the statute’s “text,\ncontext, and history.” United States v. Davis, l39 S. Ct. 23l9, 2327 (2ol9).\n\nThough it has not authoritatively setled the question, the Second Circuit has strongly\nsuggested that Maxwell’s approach is the wrong one. In Weingarten v. United States, 865 F.3d\n48, 58-6o (2d Cir. 2ol7), the Second Circuit discussed at length hou the text, context, and\nhistory of § 3283 shou that Congress intended courts to apply the statute using a case-specific\napproach. The Third Circuit reached the same conclusion in United States v. Schneider, 8ol\nF.3d l86, l96 (3d Cir. 2ol5).\n\nThe Court sees no reason to depart from the reasoning in Weingarten. First, “[t]he\nSupreme Court’s modern categorical approach jurisprudence is confined to the post-conviction\ncontexts of criminal sentencing and immigration deportation cases.” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o769", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020777.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel59 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8 of 34\nprovides no indication of what many of these potential witnesses might have testified to. The\ntestimony she suggests the detective might have offered—that witnesses in the Palm Beach\ninvestigation did not identify Maxwell by name—is propensity evidence that does nothing to\nestablish her innocence of the charged offenses. There are also serious doubts under all of the\nrelevant circumstances that a jury would have found testimony from Epstein credible even if he\nhad waived his right against self-incrimination and testified on her behalf. See United States v.\nSpears, l59 F.3d lo8l, lo85 (7th Cir. l999).\n\nMaxwell’s arguments that the indictment should be dismissed because of the possibility\nof missing witnesses, failing memories, or lost records fail for similar reasons. These are\ndifficulties that arise in any case where there is extended delay in bringing a prosecution, and\nthey do not justify dismissing an indictment. United States v. Marion, 4o4 U.S. 3o7, 325-26\n(l97l); see United States v. Elsbery, 6o2 F.2d lo54, lo59 (2d Cir. l979).\n\nFinally, the Court finds no substantial prejudice from the pretrial publicity this case has\ngarnered. Maxwell contends that lengthy public interest in this case has transformed her\nreputation from that of Epstein’s friend to a co-conspirator. And she also alleges—without\nevidence—that her accusers fabricated their stories based on media allegations. The Court will\nnot dismiss the indictment on Maxwell’s bare assertion that numerous witnesses are engaged in a\nperjurious <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> against her. And the Court will take all appropriate steps to ensure that the\npretrial publicity in this case does not compromise Maxwell’s right to a fair and impartial jury.\n\nThe Court thus concludes that Maxwell has failed to establish actual prejudice from the\nGovernment’s delay in bringing charges. She may renew her motion if the factual record at trial\nshous otherwise. On the present record, neither the applicable statute of limitations nor due\nprocess bars the charges here.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o777", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020785.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel67 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 26 of 34\n\nThe balance of these considerations favors severance. “Motions to sever are commited.\nto the sound discretion of the trial judge.” United States v. Casamento, 887 F.2d ll4l, ll49 Qd\nCir. l989). In its discretion, the Court concludes that trying the perjury counts separately will\nbest ensure a fair and expeditious resolution of all charges in this case.\n\nVI. Maxwell’s motion to strike surplusage is premature\n\nMaxwell moves to strike allegations related to one of the alleged victims from the Sl\nsuperseding indictment as surplusage. The Court declines to do so at this juncture.\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(d) allous a court to strike surplusage from an\nindictment on a defendant’s motion. “Motions to strike surplusage from an indictment will be\ngranted only where the challenged allegations are not relevant to the crime charged and are\ninflammatory and prejudicial.” United States v. Hernandez, 85 F.3d lo23, lo3o (2d Cir. l996)\n(cleaned up). Courts in this District generally delay ruling on any motion to strike until after the\npresentation of the Government’s evidence at trial, because that evidence may affect hou\nspecific allegations relate to the overall charges. See, e.g., United States v. Nejad, No. l8-cr-224\n(AJN), 2ol9 WL 67o236l, at *l8 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 6, 2ol9); United States v. Mostafa, 965 F.\nSupp. 2d 45l, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3).\n\nMaxwell contends that the allegations related to “Minor Victim-3” are surplusage\nbecause the indictment does not charge that Minor Victim-3 traveled in interstate commerce or\nwas belou the age of consent in England where the alleged activities took place. Thus, she\nargues, these allegations do not relate to the charged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> and instead reflect an atempt to\nintroduce Minor Victim-3’s testimony for impermissible purposes.\n\nThe Court will not strike any language from the Sl superseding indictment at this\njuncture. The standard under Rule 7(d) is “exacting” and requires the defendant to demonstrate\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o785", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020786.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel68 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 27 of 34\nclearly that the allegations are irrelevant to the crimes charged. United States v. Napolitano, 552\nF. Supp. 465, 48o (S.D.N.Y. l982). The indictment does not allege that the alleged victim\ntraveled in interstate commerce or was underage during sexual encounters with Epstein. But the\nCourt cannot rule out that the allegations may reflect conduct undertaken in furtherance of the\ncharged <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> or be relevant to prove facts such as Maxwell’s state of mind. See United\nStates v. Concepcion, 983 F.2d 369, 392 (2d Cir. l992). The Court will follou the well-worn\npath of others in this District and reserve the issue for trial. Maxwell may renew her motion\nthen.\n\nVII. Maxwell’s motion to dismiss multiplicitous charges is premature\n\nMaxwell’s motion to dismiss either the first or third count of the Sl superseding\nindictment as multiplicitous is also premature. Maxwell contends that the Government has\nalleged the same <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> twice in the indictment. “An indictment is multiplicitous when it\ncharges a single offense as an offense multiple times, in separate counts, when, in law and fact,\nonly one crime has been commited.” United States v. Chacko, l69 F.3d l4o, l45 (2d Cir. l999).\n“The multiplicity doctrine is based upon the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment,\nwhich assures that the court does not exceed its legislative authorization by imposing multiple\npunishments for the same offense.” United States v. Nakashian, 82o F.2d 549, 552 (2d Cir. l987)\n(cleaned up).\n\n“Where there has been no prior conviction or acquital, the Double Jeopardy Clause does\nnot protect against simultaneous prosecutions for the same offense, so long as no more than one\npunishment is eventually imposed.” United States v. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 35o, 355 (2d Cir.\n2oo6). “Since Josephberg, courts in this Circuit have routinely denied pre-trial motions to\ndismiss potentially multiplicitous counts as premature.” United States v. Medina, No. l3-cr-272\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o786", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020789.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel7l of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o of 34\nreason to doubt these representations given its expansive approach to document production thus\nfar in this case. The Government has agreed in its recent leter to produce Giglio material six\nweeks in advance of trial. The parties shall negotiate the specific timing, but assuming a\nschedule along those lines is met, the Court concludes that Maxwell will be able to effectively\nprepare for trial. See Coppa, 267 F.3d at l44.\n\nB. Jencks Act material and co-conspirator statements\n\nMaxwell also seeks to expedite discovery of Jencks Act material and non-exculpatory\nstatements of co-conspirators that the government may offer at trial. The Jencks Act, l8 U.S.C.\n§ 35oo, “provides that no prior statement made by a government witness shall be the subject of\ndiscovery until that witness has testified on direct examination.” Coppa, 267 F.3d at l45. The\nstatute therefore prohibits a district court in most cases from ordering the pretrial disclosure of\nwitness statements unless those statements are exculpatory. “A coconspirator who testifies on\nbehalf of the government is a witness under the Act.” Jn re United States, 834 F.2d 283, 286 (2d\nCir. l987). The Court therefore lacks the inherent pouer to expedite these disclosures. In any\ncase, the Government has agreed to produce all Jencks Act material at least six weeks in advance\nof trial.\n\nThe Court also rejects Maxwell’s alternative request for a hearing to determine the\nadmissibility of co-conspirator declarations. Co-conspirator statements may often be admited at\ntrial on a conditional basis. If the Court determines that the Government has not met its burden\nto shou that the conditionally admited statements were made in furtherance of the charged\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, the Court should provide a limiting instruction or, in extreme cases declare a\nmistrial. United States v. Tracy, l2 F.3d ll86, ll99 (2d Cir. l993). Although conditional\nadmissions can pose a problem, a pretrial hearing is unnecessary here because the Government\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o789", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020810.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel92 of 2o8\nA-l88\n[USDC SDNY\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DOCUMENT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ELECTRONICALLY FILED\nDOC #:\nDATE FILED: 8/l3/2l\nUnited States of America,\n—Vy—\n2o-cr-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nOPINION & ORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

The Court again concludes, as it did in its April\nl6, 2o2l Opinion & Order, that the agreement does not bind the United States Atorney\nfor the Southern District of New York.\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o8lo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020815.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel97 of 2o8\nno indication that Maxwell was even a subject of the Florida investigation. The Double Jeopardy\nClause bars only successive prosecution or punishment for the same offense, and Maxwell has\nendured neither. Thus, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar the charges against her.\n\nDespite facing no prior prosecution or punishment herself, Maxwell contends that she is\nimmune from prosecution because Epstein was already punished for the same <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. The\ncases she cites, houever, deal with successive prosecutions of a particular defendant for the same\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, not separate prosecutions of individual co-conspirators. See, e.g., United States v.\nLopez, 356 F.3d 463, 469 (2d Cir. 2oo4). The Double Jeopardy Clause does not require all co-\nconspirators be tried together for related offenses. See Zafiro v. United States, 5o6 U.S. 534, 539\n(l993); United States v. Hinton, 543 F.2d loo2, lol4 (2d Cir. l976). Whether the Government\ncould have charged Epstein again in this case has nothing to do with Maxwell’s rights under the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause.\n\nMaxwell finally points to one case in which the Second Circuit held that a subsequent\nprosecution might not be permissible against a defendant whose charges were dismissed after her\nhusband pleaded guilty. Dkt. No. 293 at l9 (citing United States v. Cambindo Valencia, 6o9\nF.2d 6o3 (2d Cir. l979)). Houever, the Court agrees with the Government that the result in\nCambindo Valencia rested on the terms of the husband’s plea agreement, not the Double\nJeopardy Clause. See Cambindo Valencia, 6o9 F.2d at 638. No precedent stands for the\nproposition that an uncharged co-conspirator is put in jeopardy when another co-conspirator\naccepts a non-prosecution agreement. This is the first case in which Maxwell will be put in\njeopardy for these offenses, and so this prosecution does not put her in jeopardy a second time.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o8l5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020816.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel98 of 2o8\nIll. Counts five and six are not time-barred\n\nFor most non-capital offenses, the statute of limitations under federal law is five years.\nl8 U.S.C. § 3282(a). Congress has enacted longer limitations periods for certain crimes, in\nparticular for “offense[s] involving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnapping” of a minor in l8\nU.S.C. § 3283. Prior to 2oo3, the limitations period in § 3283 lasted until the victim reached the\nage of 25, and then Congress extended the limitations period to the life of the victim with the\nPROTECT Act of 2oo3, Pub. L. No. lo8-2l, ll7 Stat 6o. In 2oo6, Congress enacted l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3299, which eliminated the statute of limitations for the sex trafficking of minors in violation\nof l8 U.S.C. § l59l and for some other sex crimes. See l8 U.S.C. § 3299 (“Notwithstanding\nany other law, an indictment may be found or an information instituted at any time without\nlimitation for any offense under . . . section l59l.”).\n\nIn her previous motion, Maxwell argued that the Mann Act charges against her in the\nindictment were time-barred on the grounds that the extended limitations period § 3283 was not\napplicable. The Court denied that motion in its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order. Maxwell, 2o2l\nWL l5l8675, at *5. Maxwell nou argues that the new charges the Government has brought\nagainst her in the S2 indictment, Sex Trafficking <span class=\"highlight\">Conspiracy</span> (l8 U.S.C. § 37l) and Sex\nTrafficking (l8 U.S.C. § l59l), are time-barred as well because § 3283 does not apply to those\noffenses either. She renews her contention from her previous motion that the limitations period\nin § 3283 only applies to offenses which “necessarily entail” the sexual abuse of a minor and\nargues that a violation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l does not. Thus, according to Maxwell’s reasoning,\nthe general five-year statute of limitations period in l8 U.S.C. § 3282(a) applies to the sex\ntrafficking counts and, because the alleged conduct occurred from 2ool to 2oo4, the Government\nls nou time-barred for prosecuting her for these offenses.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o8l6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020818.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Page2oo of 2o8\napplicable limitations period has not yet run — offenses that by definition are those for which\n“other law[s]” of limitation would otherwise bar prosecution. See l8 U.S.C. § 3299. Moreover,\nas the Court also explained, not only does this kind of language unambiguously require\nretroactivity, it also does not result in any impermissible retroactive effects so long as it does not\nrevive time-barred claims. Maxwell, 2o2l WL l5l8675, at *7-8. The Court therefore joins\nmultiple other district courts in concluding that, like § 3283, § 3299 applies retroactively to\noffenses for which the previous limitations period has not yet run. See United States v. Nader,\n425 F. Supp. 3d 6l9, 629 (E.D. Va. 2ol9); United States v. Pierre-Louis, No. l6 CR 54l (CM),\n2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2ol8); United States v. Vickers, No. l3-CR-l28-A,\n2ol4 WL l838255, at *8 (W.D.N.Y. May 8, 2ol4); United States v. Sensi, No. 3:o8-CR-253\n(WWE), 2olo WL 235l484, at *3 (D. Conn. June 7, 2olo).\n\nThe sex trafficking charges are therefore not time-barred. Regardless of whether it was\nthe general five-year limitations period in § 3282(a) or the extended limitations period for sexual\nabuse of minors in § 3283 that was applicable to Maxwell’s alleged conduct prior to the\nenactment of § 3299 in 2oo6, neither had expired by that date. Thus, as Maxwell does not\ncontest, § 3299 applies retroactively to the sex trafficking offenses in the indictment and the\nGovernment is permited to bring those charges without time limitation.\n\nIV. Maxwell’s motion to dismiss count five and either count one or count three as\nmultiplicitous is premature\n\nIn her previous motions, Maxwell argued that either count one or count three of the Sl\nindictment, the Mann Act <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charges, must be dismissed because the counts are\nmultiplicitous. In the Court’s April l6, 2o2l Opmion & Order, the Court joined many other\ncourts in this Circuit holding that pretrial motions of this sort are premature in light of United\nStates v. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 35o, 355 (2d Cir. 2oo6), and the Court dismissed without\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o8l8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020819.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Page2ol of 2o8\nprejudice. Maxwell, 2o2l WL l5l8675, at *l4. In the instant motion, Maxwell similarly argues\nthat count five of the S2 indictment, the sex trafficking <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charge, is duplicative of either\ncounts one or three. Maxwell’s motion is denied without prejudice for the reasons stated in the\nCourt’s April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order.\n\nV. The Government’s delay in bringing the charges did not violate due process\n\nMaxwell also renews her motion to dismiss the $2 indictment based on alleged improper\npretrial delay. In its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order, the Court denied Maxwell’s motion,\nconcluding that her efforts to shou actual and substantial prejudice fell far short of the “stringent\nstandard” necessary to prevail on such a claim. Maxwell, 2o2l WL l5l8675, at *9. Maxwell’s\nmotion to dismiss the S2 on these grounds fails for the same reasons. As before, nothing in the\nrecord indicates that the Government’s delay in bringing these charges was designed to thwart\nMaxwell’s ability to prepare a defense. Houever, it is sufficient to conclude that Maxwell does\nnot make the strong shouing of prejudice required to support this sort of claim. Maxwell\ncontends that the Government’s delay in bringing charges has prejudiced her interests because\npotential witnesses have died, others have forgoten, and records have been lost or destroyed. It\nis highly speculative that any of these factors would make a substantial difference in her case.\n\nThe Court thus again concludes for the reasons stated in the April l6, 2o2l Opinion &\nOrder, that Maxwell has failed to establish actual prejudice from the Government’s delay in\nbringing charges. She may renew her motion if the factual record at trial shous otherwise. On\nthe present record, neither the applicable statute of limitations nor due process bars the charges\nhere.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o8l9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020821.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Page2o3 of 2o8\ncontended specifically that the indictment is too vague because it refers to open-ended time\nperiods for the Mann Act counts. The Court disagreed in light of Circuit precedent requiring\nonly that an indictment describe the time and place of the charged conduct in “approximate\nterms” and permiting the use of “on or about” language to describe the windou of when a\nviolation occurred. Maxwell, 2o2l WL l5l8675, at *lo (citing Tramunti, 5l3 F.2d at ll3;\nUnited States v. Nersesian, 824 F.2d l294, l323 (2d Cir. l987)).

Maxwell primarily argues that the S2\nindictment does not provide specific dates for the conduct alleged with respect to the sex\ntrafficking counts. Instead, the $2 indictment provides a four-year time period from 2ool to\n2oo4 in which the alleged sex trafficking and sex trafficking <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> occurred. Maxwell’s\nmotion in this respect is denied for the same reasons stated in the Court’s April l6, 2o2l Opinion\n& Order.

See Wozniak, l26 F.3d at lo9-ll (finding constructive amendment where\nindictment charged a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to distribute cocaine and methamphetamine, but the evidence at\ntrial focused on marijuana). A conviction based on Jane’s travel to and from New Mexico and any\nsexual activity that allegedly occurred while she was there would be premised on facts elicited at\ntrial that are “completely distinct” from the allegations in the indictment.

NATHAN, Circuit Judge, siting by designation:\n\nIn 2o2o, the Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell was indicted for her participation in a scheme\nto entice, transport, and traffic underage girls for sexual abuse by and with Jeffrey Epstein, her\nlongtime companion. The Government at trial presented extensive witness testimony from\nmultiple victim witnesses and others, as well as corroborating documentary and physical\nevidence. The testimony and other trial evidence established the Defendant’s role in grooming\nand recruiting underage girls and using the cover of massage to perpetrate sexual abuse.\n\nFollouing the thirteen-day trial, the Court submited to the jury the six counts in the\nIndictment. The jury deliberated for over five days and returned a verdict of guilty on five of the\nsix counts. Two of these counts of conviction charged the Defendant with substantive violations\nof federal statutes that target sexual abuse of minors—the Mann Act as to Count Four and the\nTrafficking Victims Protection Act as to Count Six. The other three counts of conviction,\nCounts One, Three, and Five, charged the Defendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to\nviolate those same statutes from l994 to 2oo4.\n\nBefore the Court are the Defendant’s post-trial motions making four alternative\narguments for vacating some or all of her five counts of conviction. First, the Defendant argues\nthat judgment may be imposed on only one of the three <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts (i.e., Counts One,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o984", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020985.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel59 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 2 of 45\n\nThree, and Five) because they are “multiplicitous”—meaning that they all charge the same\noffense—and therefore entry of judgment on all three counts would violate the Fifth\nAmendment’s Double Jeopardy Clause. Second, she requests under Rule 29 of the Federal Rules\nof Criminal Procedure that the Court acquit her of all counts because there is insufficient\nevidence for any rational juror to find her guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Third, the\nDefendant moves to vacate Counts One, Three, and Four under Rule 33 because, she claims, the\nconvictions were based on a constructive amendment of, or variance from, the Indictment. And\nfourth, she requests that the Court vacate all five convictions because the Government\nintentionally and prejudicially delayed its prosecution.\n\nWith one exception, the motions are denied. The Rule 29 motion challenging all counts\nof conviction is denied because the jury’s guilty verdicts were readily supported by the extensive\nwitness testimony and documentary evidence admited at trial. Further, those counts of\nconviction matched the core of criminality charged in the Indictment, presented by the\nGovernment at trial, and on which the jury was accurately instructed. The Defendant’s contrary\nclaim of a constructive amendment of or variance from the Indictment rests on an implausible\nand speculative interpretation of a single ambiguous jury note. In addition, the Court concludes\nthat the Government did not intentionally delay its prosecution and, in any event, the\nDefendant’s ability to prepare a defense was not prejudiced by any delay.\n\nThe Court does conclude, houever, that the three <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts charge the same\noffense, and, accordingly, are multiplicitous. The Government concedes that Count One is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three but argues that Count Three and Count Five nevertheless\ninvolve distinct conspiracies. The Court concludes that Count Five, like Counts One and Three,\ncharges the Defendant’s participation in the same decade-long unlawful agreement with the\n\np\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o985", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020986.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel6o of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 3 of 45\nDefendant’s continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein.

Applicable law\n\nThe Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment guarantees that no person shall “be\nsubject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.” U.S. Const. amend. V.\nThat guarantee “serves principally as a restraint on courts and prosecutors,” ensuring that a court\ndoes not “exceed its legislative authorization by imposing multiple punishments for the same\noffense.” Broun v. Ohio, 432 U.S. l6l, l65 (l977); see also Morris v. Reynolds, 264 F.3d 38,\n48 (2d Cir. 2ool). An indictment is multiplicitous, and therefore implicates double jeopardy,\n“when it charges a single offense as an offense multiple times, in separate counts, when, in law\nand fact, only one crime has been commited.” Maxwell, 534 F. Supp. 3d at 322 (quoting United\nStates v. Chacko, l69 F.3d l4o, l45 (2d Cir. l999)). “A claim of multiplicity cannot succeed,\nhouever, ‘unless the charged offenses are the same in fact and in law.’” United States v. Jones,\n482 F.3d 6o, 72 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (quoting United States v. Estrada, 32o F.3d l73, l8o (2d Cir.\n2oo3)).\n\nIf the two offenses at issue are both conspiracies charged under the same statute, then the\nmultiplicity inquiry turns on whether the two conspiracies are the same “in fact,” meaning they\ninvolve the same agreement. United States v. Araujo, No. l7-CR-438 (VEC), 2ol8 WL\n3222527, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July 2, 2ol8) (citing United States v. Ansaldi, 372 F.3d ll8, l24-25\n(2d Cir. 2oo4)); United States v.

Yet “whether the evidence shous a single <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> or more than one\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> is often not determinable as a mater of law or subject to bright-line formulations.”\nJones, 482 F.3d at 72. Rather, the parties agree that the Court’s inquiry is guided by the Second\nCircuit’s Korfant factors. See, e.g., United States v. Diallo, 5o7 F. App’x 89, 9l (2d Cir. 2ol3)\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o988", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020989.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel63 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 6 of 45\n(summary order) (citing United States v.

Those\nfactors include:\n\n(l) the criminal offenses charged in successive indictments; (2) the overlap of\n\nparticipants; (3) the overlap of time; (4) similarity of operation; (5) the existence\n\nof common overt acts; (6) the geographic scope of the alleged conspiracies or\n\nlocation where overt acts occurred; (7) common objectives; and (8) the degree of\n\ninterdependence between alleged distinct conspiracies.\n\nUnited States v. Macchia, 35 F.3d 662, 667 (2d Cir. l994) (quoting Korfant, 77l F.2d at 662). In\napplying the Korfant factors, “no dominant factor or single touchstone” determines whether two\nallegedly distinct conspiracies “‘appear in fact and in law the same.’” Jd. at 668 (quoting United\nStates v. Reiter, 848 F.2d 336, 34o (2d Cir. l988)). Moreover, “the Korfant list is not\nexhaustive, and every case must be assessed on its oun terms . . . based on the entire record.”\nUnited States v. Maslin, 356 F.3d l9l, l96 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\n\nIn assessing the evidence, the Second Circuit applies a burden-shifting framework. The\ndefendant carries the initial burden of making a non-frivolous shouing that the two counts in fact\ncharge only one <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. If met, the burden then shifts to the Government to shou, “by a\npreponderance of the evidence, that there are in fact two distinct conspiracies and that the\ndefendant is not being placed in jeopardy twice for the same crime.” United States v.

Analysis\n\nA further summary of the two counts at issue is required. As briefly outlined above,\nCount Three of the Indictment charged the Defendant under l8 U.S.C. § 37l, the general federal\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> statute, with conspiring to violate l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a) (the Mann Act), by\ntransporting minors across state lines with the intent to engage in sexual activity criminalized by\nstate law. S2 Indictment §f] l6-l8. In this case, the relevant state offense was New York Penal\nLaw Section l3o.55, which criminalizes sexual contact with an individual knoun to be under the\nage of seventeen. Trial Tr. 3o34-35. The Count Three <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> spanned from l994 to 2oo4.\nS2 Indictment | l7. As the Government explained in its summation, the jury could convict the\nDefendant under Count Three based on evidence related to Jane, Carolyn, and Annie Farmer,\nthree victims who testified at trial. Trial Tr. at 2895.*\n\nCount Five of the Indictment also charged the Defendant under l8 U.S.C. § 37l, but for\nconspiring to violate l8 U.S.C. §§ l59l(a) & (b) (the Trafficking Victims Protection Act), by\ntrafficking individuals under the age of eighteen for commercial sex acts that affect interstate\ncommerce. S2 Indictment {| 22-24. Count Five’s <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> spanned from 2ool to 2oo4. Jd.\n4] 23. The Government explained to the jury that it could convict the Defendant on Count Five\nbased on evidence related to Carolyn and Virginia Roberts. Trial Tr. at 2896.\n\nThe Defendant primarily contends that Count Five is a subset of, is subsumed in, or is\notherwise too similar to Count Three under the Korfant factors. The Court agrees. Although\nsome Korfant factors favor the Government, the weight of the factors—supplemented by a\nreview of the Government’s case presented at trial—demonstrates that the Government has not\n: ae Court permited certain victim witnesses to testify using a pseudonym or first name. See Nov. l, 2o2l Tr. at\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o99o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020991.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel65 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 8 of 45\nmet its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the counts are not\nmultiplicitous.\n\nThe offenses charged and common objectives. Both Counts Three and Five are charged\nunder the same statute, l8 U.S.C. § 37l, for <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to commit an offense against the United\nStates. But going beyond this “general level” of similarity, the statutory objectives of the two\ncounts differ. Macchia, 35 F.3d at 669. Count Three is a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to violate § 2423(a) and\nCount Five a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to violate § l59l. These differing statutory objectives entail legal\ndifferences. Count Three, for example, charges unlawful sexual activity (defined as sexual\ntouching of a minor) while Count Five charges commercial sexual activity with a minor. And\neach provision defines “minor” differently: under seventeen years old for Count Three but under\neighteen years old for Count Five. Further, Count Three requires an agreement with intent to\ntransport across state lines, while Count Five’s agreement requires only intent of sexual activity\nthat affects interstate commerce. These differences push the first Korfant factor in the\nGovernment’s favor. See Estrada, 32o F.3d at l82 (distinguishing between a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to\ndistribute cocaine and one to distribute crack); United States v. Villa, No. 3:l2-CR-4o (JBA),\n2ol4 WL 252ol3, at *4 (D. Conn. Jan. 22, 2ol4), aff'd, 744 F. App’x 7l6 (2d Cir. 2ol8)\n(summary order) (distinguishing between a § 37l <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to “commit theft from an interstate\nshipment and to transport stolen property across state lines” and one to “sell stolen property”).\n\nThe Government, houever, errs in suggesting that this factor alone is “fatal” to the\nDefendant’s multiplicity claim. Gov. Br. at 29. To the contrary, no single Korfant factor is\ndominant or dispositive. Macchia, 35 F.3d at 668. And courts in this district have found two\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts to be the same offense even when they have different statutory objectives\nbecause both counts can arise from the same agreement. F.g., Hernandez, 2oo9 WL 3l69226, at\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o99l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020992.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel66 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 9 of 45\n\n*ll (concluding that conspiracies to defraud the United States and to commit mail and wire\nfraud were the same <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> as earlier <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to use or transfer false IDs). After all, “[a]\nsingle agreement to commit several crimes constitutes one <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.” United States v. Broce,\n488 U.S. 563, 57o-7l (l989). The Government implicitly conceded this point of law when it\nagreed that Counts One and Three were multiplicitous. Count One charges a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to\nentice minors to travel across state lines in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2422 while Count Three\ncharges a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to transport minors across state lines in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a).\nDespite distinct statutory predicates for these two § 37l conspiracies, the Government did not\ncontest that they were the same offense. Though Count Five is unquestionably less similar to\nCount Three than is Count One, the difference in statutory predicates does not end the mater. It\nis well established that a single <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> can contain multiple objectives, particularly if the\nobjectives share important similarities, as they do here. United States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88,\nl48 (2d Cir. l998) (citing United States v. Aracri, 968 F.2d l5l2, l5l8 (2d Cir. l992)).\n\nOverlap of participants. The participants in the two conspiracies in Counts Three and\nFive substantially overlap with one another. Of course, the defendant will always overlap\nbetween two allegedly multiplicitous conspiracies, so their participation in both conspiracies has\nnegligible significance. Villa, 2ol4 WL 252ol3, at *5. More importantly here, Epstein was the\nDefendant’s primary coconspirator in both conspiracies, and the Government argued that in both\nconspiracies the Defendant played the same role of acquiring underage girls for Epstein to\nsexually abuse. They were, the Government explained, “partners in crime” over the decade\nalleged in the Indictment. E.g., Trial Tr. at 34, 2842, 2885; see also id. at 4l (“For a decade, the\ndefendant played an essential role in this scheme.”). This overlap in key participants, and in core\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o992", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020993.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel67 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page lo of 45\nroles played by those participants, significantly favors the Defendant as to the second Korfant\nfactor. See Macchia, 35 F.3d at 669; Hernandez, 2oo9 WL 3l69226, at *ll.\n\nThe Government responds that the Count Five <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> included Sarah Kellen, who\nwas not involved in Count Three. Yet Kellen received far less atention than other conspirators\nin the Government’s case, being mentioned only briefly in the Government’s opening statement\nand closing arguments. /.g., Trial Tr. at 2876 (noting, “and sometimes Sarah Kellen would call,\ntoo”). Conspiracies often change membership without forming a new, distinct <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>,\nparticularly if key members of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> remain over the course of a decade. See United\nStates v. Eppolito, 543 F.3d 25, 48 (2d Cir. 2oo8). Kellen’s participation beginning in 2ool\ntherefore does not shift the import of the second Kerfant factor.\n\nOverlap of time. The time periods of the two counts overlap completely. Namely, Count\nFive’s period of 2ool to 2oo4 is “wholly within the time frame” of Count Three from l994 to\n2oo4, which substantially favors the Defendant on this Korfant factor. United States v.\nCalderone, 982 F.2d 42, 47 (2d Cir. l992). The Government’s atempt to minimize this factor\nby noting that most overt acts for Count Three occurred in the l99os is simply not reflected in\nthis circuit’s case law. See, e.g., Macchia, 35 F.3d at 669 (focusing on the overlap in time frame\nalleged in the indictment). The overlap in time here raises the inference that one <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>\nwholly encompasses the other, and that inference tips in the Defendant’s favor. See Araujo,\n2ol8 WL 3222527, at *6.\n\nSimilarity of operations. Counts Three and Five involve significant similarities in\noperations. The methods by which the Defendant groomed and facilitated the sexual abuse of\nminor victims was a central focus of both parties’ cases at trial. The Government called as an\nexpert witness Dr. Lisa Rocchio, who identified the typical steps in sexual abusers’ grooming of\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o993", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020995.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel69 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page l2 of 45\na decade,” having both the “earlier phase” and the later “pyramid scheme.” Trial Tr. at 4o; see\nalso, e.g., id. at 2886 (describing 2ool as “the beginning of the pyramid scheme of abuse”). But\na single <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> can enter “two or more phases or spheres of operation” without creating a\ndiscontinuity in the underlying unlawful agreement, particularly if the same people are serving\nthe same roles in each phase. United States v. Pena, 846 F. App’x 49, 5l (2d Cir. 2o2l)\n(summary order) (quoting United States v. Berger, 224 F.3d lo7, ll4-l5 (2d Cir. 2ooo)); see\nalso United States v. Maldonado-Rivera, 922 F.2d 934, 963 (2d Cir. l99o). Notably, the\nGovernment, after distinguishing between earlier and later phases in the patern of abuse,\nimmediately emphasized that “[flor a decade, the defendant played an essential role in this\nscheme,” blurring any difference between the two phases. Trial Tr. at 4l.\n\nMoreover, though these phases did involve some differing means to acquire minor\nvictims, the differences presented at trial were not as great as the Government suggests in its\nbrief. As to both counts, both before and after 2ool, the Government emphasized that massage\nwas a primary means by which the Defendant and Epstein normalized bodily contact and also the\nmeans by which the Defendant and Epstein commonly instigated instances of sexual abuse.\nCompare id. at 4o (“You will learn that in the l99os, they used the cover of mentoring young\ngirls . .. to introduce massage . . . and that you will learn that they used these so called massages\nas a way to sexually abuse the victims.”), with id. at 4l (“Under this pyramid scheme of abuse,\nthe defendant could just call girls to schedule massage appointments and hand them cash\nafterwards ....”); e.g., id. at 35 (“You will learn that the cover of massage was the primary way\nthe defendant and Epstein lured girls into sexual abuse.”), 2852 (“Again and again throughout\nthis trial, you heard about hou these girls were asked to perform sexualized massages on Jeffrey\nEpstein.”).\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o995", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020996.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel7/o of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page l3 of 45\n\nFurther, in both counts, the witnesses testified that they received financial gifts and\npayments as a means by which the Defendant and Epstein acquired their victims’ trust and\nextended the period of sexual abuse. F.g., id. at 3o2 (Jane testified that she was given money\n“[allmost every visit” and that Epstein paid for things like voice lessons and clothes). The\nGovernment emphasized such financial gifts as one step in the Defendant’s playbook of\ngrooming. E.g., id. at 285l (“Then came the next step in the playbook: Making these girls feel\nspecial, giving them gifts, making friends, giving them money, promising to help with their\nfutures, promises like sending Annie on a trip to Thailand or helping to pay for Jane’s voice\nlessons and tuition.”), 289o (“[Jane] told you that Epstein gave her money and gifts and paid for\nschool. That money wasn’t free.... That is inducement, that is enticement, that is coercion.”).\nThe financial quid pro quo may have become more explicit beginning in 2ool, but that shift in\napproach is not nearly so dramatic as to suggest that the Defendant and Epstein at that time\nentered “a wholly new agreement” with a new “conspiratorial objective.” Haji v. Miller, 584 F.\nSupp. 2d 498, 5l9 (E.D.N.Y. 2oo8). The similarity-of-operations factor therefore favors the\nDefendant.\n\nOverlap of geographic scope. There is some, albeit incomplete, geographic overlap\nbetween the two counts. Count Three focused on travel to New York because the ultimate\nobjective of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> was to transport minors to New York to engage in criminal sexual\nactivity in violation of New York law. Count Five, by contrast, focused on Epstein’s residence\nin Florida, where Carolyn and Virginia Roberts were paid to give Epstein sexualized massages.\nNevertheless, some geographic overlap between the two counts remained. All four witnesses\ntestified about sexual conduct by the Defendant or Epstein in locations other than New York,\nwhether Florida, New Mexico, or London.

In sum, the same locations—particularly Florida—were part of the Government’s case for\nboth counts.

This factor therefore favors the Defendant or, at least, is neutral.\n\nCommon overt acts. The Government correctly notes that the overt acts provided to the\njury for Counts Three and Five are distinct. See Jury Charge, Dkt. No. 565 at 49-5o. This factor\ntherefore tips touard the Government—but only slightly. A number of the overt acts listed for\nCount Three could have been prosecuted under Count Five but for the fact that l8 U.S.C. § l59l,\nthe Trafficking Victims Protection Act, was not enacted until 2ooo. See Gov. Br. at 28. That\nsome identical overt acts were not listed for both conspiracies is therefore more a function of\nlegal timing than an indication of two distinct conspiracies. Cf’ Hernandez, 2oo9 WL 3l69226,\nat *l2.\n\nInterdependence. Counts Three and Five are not interdependent because the success or\nfailure of one <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> is independent of the success or failure of the other. See Macchia, 35\nF.3d at 67l. In other words, the success of the Defendant and Epstein’s scheme to abuse Carolyn\nfrom 2ool to 2oo4 was not made more or less likely by the prior success or failure to abuse Jane,\nAnnie, or any other underage girl.

The same is true here. As explained above, the\nGovernment’s opening statement and closing arguments presented a theory of a singular\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, highlighting: The degree of similarity between each victim witness’s experience\nover a decade; the common “playbook” that the Defendant ran “over and over and over again,”\nTrial Tr. at 2848; and the tight partnership between the Defendant and Epstein. And each of\nthose features was accompanied by references to a singular “scheme” to abuse all victim\nwitnesses. /d. at 36, 2843, 2853. At botom, the case presented to the jury by the Government\nwas of a single decade-long <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> by the Defendant and Epstein to sexually abuse underage\ngirls. Having pursued such a broad and encompassing <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, the Government cannot nou\nclaim, and cannot carry its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence, that Count\nFive was legally and factually distinct. See Maslin, 356 F.3d at l97.\n\nBecause Count Three and Count Five are multiplicitous, the proper remedy is to enter\njudgment on only one of the counts. See Josephberg, 459 F.3d at 355 (“If the jury convicts on\nmore than one multiplicitous count, the defendant’s right not to suffer multiple punishments for\nthe same offense will be protected by having the court enter judgment on only one of the\nmultiplicitous counts.” (citing Ball v.

No constructive amendment occurred.\n\nCount Four charged the Defendant with transportation of an individual under the age of\nseventeen with intent to engage in illegal sexual activity, and Count Three charged a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>\nto do the same. The core of criminality of these counts, the parties agree, was a scheme by\nEpstein and the Defendant to cause underage girls to travel to New York with the intent that they\nwould engage in sexual activity in violation of New York law. Gov. Br. at 6; Maxwell Br. at 9.4\n\nThe Defendant contends that a jury note received during deliberations revealed that the\njury convicted the Defendant on a crime different from this core of criminality. Namely, the\nDefendant argues that in convicting her of Count Four, the jury found she intended for Jane to\nengage in sexual activity in New Mexico, without finding that she intended for Jane to engage in\nsexual activity in New York. Maxwell Reply at 2. She argues the Court’s decision to refer the\njury back to the charge and refusal to give a supplemental instruction was error. As a result of\nthis same error, she says, the jury also improperly convicted her of Count Three. For the reasons\nthat follou, the Court concludes that there is not a “substantial likelihood” that the Defendant\nwas “convicted of an offense other than that charged in the indictment.” D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at\n4l6 (quoting United States v.

The Court’s instructions, the evidence at trial, and the Government’s\nsummation captured the core of criminality.\n\nFirst, the Court’s instructions to the jury during trial and after the close of evidence\ncaptured the core of criminality. As explained above, the Indictment charged the Defendant with\nfour counts in violation of the Mann Act, each predicated on a violation of New York Penal Law\nSection l3o.55. That provision of New York law criminalizes sexual contact with an individual\nknoun to be under the age of seventeen. Jury Charge at 24. The jury charge made clear that this\nprovision of New York law served as the predicate offense for Counts Two and Four. See id. at\n23-24 (Count Two), 28 (Count Four, instructing the jury to decide whether the Defendant had\nknouingly transported Jane with the intent to engage in sexual activity with Jane in violation of\nNew York Penal Law Section l3o.55, as alleged in the Indictment). The Court also accepted the\nDefendant’s requested edits that further clarified that the predicate state offense was New York\nlaw. See, e.g., Request to Charge at l9, 23, 26, 3o, 3l, Dkt. No. 4lo-l; Jury Charge at 2o, 24,\n26, 28 (specifying, e.g., that the predicate state offense was “New York law,” rather than an\nunspecified “criminal offense’’).\n\nThe jury charge also clearly instructed on the role of New York law in the jury’s\nassessment of the Mann Act <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts, Counts One and Three. The charge explained\nthat the object of the conspiracies was a violation of the same New York law at issue in Count\nTwo. See Jury Charge at 44-45. In particular, the objects of Counts One and Three were the\nenticement of minors to travel and the transport of minors, respectively, with the intent to engage\nin sexual activity illegal under New York law. See id. As for the overt acts, the Court, at the\nparties’ request, did not provide the jury with a copy of the Indictment. Trial Tr. at 278l-82.\nRather, the charge specified the relevant overt acts. Jury Charge at 49-5o. For Counts One and\nThree, this included the instruction: “the Indictment alleges as follous: .. . (2) In or about l996,\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2loo8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021009.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel83 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 26 of 45\nwhen Jane was under the age of l7, Jane was enticed to travel from Florida to New York for\npurposes of sexually abusing her at the New York Residence, in violation of New York Penal\nLaw, Section l3o.55.” Jd. at 49.\n\nThe Court also gave two limiting instructions to ensure that the jury’s consideration of\ncertain relevant evidence was properly focused on the core of criminality. These instructions\npertained to testimony about sexual activity that was not criminal conduct under New York Penal\nLaw Section l3o.55. The first limiting instruction pertained to Kate. This instruction informed.\nthe jury that it could not convict the Defendant on Counts One and Three solely on the basis of\nKate’s testimony because Kate could not be considered a victim of the crimes charged. Trial Tr.\nat ll67-68. This was so because she was older than seventeen at the time of the events, and, as\nexplained, the object of the charged conspiracies was transport with intent to engage in sexual\nconduct in violation of New York Penal Law Section l3o.55, which criminalizes sexual contact\nwith individuals under the age of seventeen. See Nov. l, 2o2l Tr. at 67-68. The second limiting\ninstruction pertained to Annie, who testified about sexual contact in New Mexico only. The\ninstruction explained that her testimony about sexual conduct did not describe “illegal sexual\nactivity” as alleged in the Indictment, which was a legal term that the Court would explain at the\nend of the case. Trial Tr. at 2o48-49. This was so because, as explained, the object of the\ncharged conspiracies was a violation of New York law, not New Mexico law. Both limiting\ninstructions explained that the jury could determine that the testimony was relevant evidence.\nThat was so because such evidence tended to establish the Defendant’s intent that transport of a\nminor victim to New York was for the purpose of sexual activity illegal under New York law.\nThe Defendant concedes this point as to testimony about sexual activity in states other than New\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2loo9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021018.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel92 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 35 of 45\nunderstanding. See D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at 4l6. Accordingly, the Court concludes that no\nconstructive amendment resulted as to Count Four.\n\n3. No constructive amendment occurred as to Count Three.\n\nThe Defendant’s argument as to constructive amendment of Count Three, <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to\ntransport, wholly depends on her theory as to Count Four.’ She argues that since it is “clear” that\nthe jury convicted the Defendant of Count Four based only on Jane’s New Mexico testimony, it\nmust have convicted on the same basis for the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts. Maxwell Br. at l6. Because\nno constructive amendment resulted as to Count Four, this argument is unavailing. But even if\nthe Court were persuaded that the jury note revealed that the jury convicted the Defendant of\nCount Four on that basis, the note pertained only to Count Four and provided no basis to\nspeculate as to the jury’s conviction of Count Three. Moreover, it is not substantially likely that\nthe jury convicted the Defendant of Count Three on Jane’s New Mexico testimony alone. As\ndescribed in detail above in the Court’s denial of the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion, the\nGovernment presented evidence that Annie and Carolyn were also victims of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>.\nAccordingly, even if a constructive amendment resulted as to Count Four, vacatur would still not\nbe warranted as to Count Three.\n\nC. No prejudicial variance occurred.\n\nIn the alternative, the Defendant argues that she was substantially prejudiced because the\nIndictment did not contain any allegations that Jane was sexually abused in New Mexico. She\ntherefore claims she was unfairly surprised by its introduction. For purposes of this motion, the\nCourt will assume that Jane’s testimony regarding New Mexico constituted a variance from the\n° As noted above, because the Court will not enter judgment on Count One on the parties’ consent, the Court\naddresses only Count Three here. In any event, the Defendant’s arguments as to why Counts One and Three were\nconstructively amended are the same.

The NPA immunized Maxwell from prosecution for all counts. Maxwell has\nstanding to enforce the NPA as a third-party beneficiary. The “potential co-\nconspirators” provision binds the USAO-SDNY by its express terms. Hence, the\ncanon of construction enunciated in United States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o (2d Cir.\nl985), that “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the United States Atorney\nfor the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the\nagreement contemplates a broader restriction.” is inapplicable here. Jd. at 672.\nBut even if the immunity provision was ambiguous, which it is not, Annabi should\nnot apply here because (l) the NPA originated in a district outside this circuit with\ndifferent rules that should control; (2) Annabi applies only if the new charges are\nsufficiently distinct and Count Six is not; (3) Annabi applies only where there is no\naffirmative indication that the agreement was intended to bind other districts and\nthere were affirmative indications here; and (4) Annabi is a tiebreaking rule for\nambiguous agreements which should be used only after an evidentiary hearing\ndetermines the intent of the parties.

In Annabi, the defendants were charged under a three-count indictment\nin the Eastern District of New York with conspiring to import, importing, and\npossessing heroin with intent to distribute. See 77l F.2d at 67l.

Vargas-Cordon, 733 F.3d 366, 375 (2d Cir. 2ol3).\nThus, Counts Three and Four should have been dismissed.\n\nHouever, to save Counts Three and Four from dismissal, the court rejected\nthis categorical approach altogether and opted instead for a “case-specific” one,\nwhich would permit it to examine whether this particular defendant’s alleged\nconduct “involve[ed] the sexual or physical abuse...of a child.” In so doing, the\ncourt brushed aside the clear weight of authority, which holds that statutes\nemploying “offense...involves” or “offense...involving” language identical to §\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2llo6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021136.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page89 of ll3\nconspiracies (Counts One and Three).

The Jury Note\n\nDuring their deliberations, the jury sent a note (the “Jury Note” or the\n“Note’”) inquiring about the proper basis to convict under Count Four of the\nIndictment (the substantive transportation count). The Jury Note read as\nfollous:\n\nUnder Count Four (4), if the defendant aided in the transportation\n\nof Jane’s return flight, but not the flight to New Mexico where/if\n\nthe intent was for Jane to engage in sexual activity, can she be\n\nfound guilty under the second element?\n\n74\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll36", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021138.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page9l of ll3\ncore, but of a crime ‘distinctly different’ from the one alleged.” D’Amelio, 683\nF.3d at 4l9-2l).

The “Core of Criminality” of Counts Three and Four Was a\nScheme to Cause Underaged Girls to Travel to New York with\nan Intent to Violate New York Law.\n\nThe “core of criminality” of the Mann Act transportation offenses was a\nscheme to cause underage girls to travel to New York with the intent that they\nwould engage in sexual activity in violation of New York law. The Indictment\nitself was clear on its face. Count Four, specifically alleged in the “to wit”\nclauses that the charges were based on Jane’s travel “from Florida to New\nYork, New York” where Maxwell intended for her to engage in sex acts with\nEpstein “in violation of New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55.” Ind. 4 2l at\nAl29.

Hence, the question in the Jury Note.\n\nThus, it was necessary for the Court to give the jury a supplemental\ninstruction, as requested by the defense, to clarify the correct basis for\nconviction under Count Four. The Court’s refusal to do so alloued the jury to\nmodify the essential elements of the charged offense and created a substantial\nlikelihood that Maxwell was convicted of a crime other than the one alleged in\nthe Indictment.

The Miami Herald report led to public outrage and media scrutiny of the\ngovernment’s actions.*\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the CVRA case petitioners’ Motion for\nPartial Summary Judgment, ruling that the government violated the CVRA in failing to advise the\nvictims about its intention to enter into the NPA.° The court also found that leters the government\nsent to victims after the NPA was signed, describing the investigation as ongoing, “mislead [sic]\nthe victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility.” The court also highlighted\nthe inequity of the USAO’s failure to communicate with the victims while at the same time\nengaging in “lengthy negotiations” with Epstein’s counsel and assuring the defense that the NPA\nwould not be “made public or filed with the court.” The court ordered the parties to submit\nadditional briefs regarding the appropriate remedies. After the court’s order, the Department\nrecused the USAO from the CVRA litigation and assigned the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the\nNorthern District of Georgia to handle the case for the government. Among the remedies sought\nby the petitioners, and opposed by the government, was rescission of the NPA and federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nOn July 2, 2ol9, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York obtained\na federal grand jury indictment charging Epstein with one count of sex trafficking of minors and\none count of <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to commit sex trafficking of minors. The indictment alleged that from\n2oo2 until 2oo5, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims in both New York and Florida\nwhom he sexually abused and exploited. Epstein was arrested on the charges on July 6, 2ol9. In\narguing for Epstein’s pretrial detention, prosecutors asserted that agents searching Epstein’s\nManhatan residence found thousands of photos of nude and half-nude females, including at least\none believed to be a minor. The court ordered Epstein detained pending trial, and he was remanded\nto the custody of the Bureau of Prisons and held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in\nManhatan.\n\nMeanwhile, after publication of the November 2ol8 Miami Herald report, the media and\nCongress increasingly focused atention on Acosta as the government official responsible for the\nNPA. On July lo, 2ol9, Acosta held a televised press conference to defend his and the USAO’s\nactions. Acosta stated that the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office “was ready to allou Epstein to\nwalk free with no jail time, nothing.” According to Acosta, because USAO prosecutors considered\nthis outcome unacceptable, his office pursued a difficult and challenging case and obtained a\nresolution that put Epstein in jail, forced him to register as a sexual offender, and provided victims\nwith the means to obtain monetary damages. Acosta’s press conference did not end the\ncontroversy, houever, and on July l2, 2ol9, Acosta submited to the President his resignation as\n4 See, e.g., Ashley Collman, “Stunning new report details Trump’s labor secretary’s role in plea deal for\nbillionaire sex abuser,” The Business Insider, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Cynthia McFadden, “New Focus on Trump Labor\nSecretary’s role in unusual plea deal for billionaire accused of sexual abuse,” NBC Nightly News, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Anita\nKumar, “Trump labor secretary out of running for atorney general after Miami Herald report,” McClatchy Washington\nBureau, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Emily Peck, “Hou Trump’s Labor Secretary Covered For A Millionaire Sex Abuser,”\nHuffington Post, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Julie K.

That\nwould have sent them thru the roof.” Lourie explained to OPR that he thought a judge, after seeing\nan indictment charging the full nature and scope of Epstein’s conduct, might not agree to a plea\ninvolving substantially less time or to dismiss substantive charges. *!\n\nLourie told OPR that despite Oosterban’s favorable opinion of the case, “[t]his was... a\nbit of uncharted territory,” involving facts that were unlike the case law Oosterban had cited.\nAlthough Lourie had some concerns about the legal issues and about the witnesses, he “probably”\ndid not see any impediment to going forward with the case; in fact, Lourie “was not in favor of\nwalking away, which is what the defense wanted [the USAO] to do.” But while Lourie “thought\nwe could have won and we could have prevailed through appeal,” he “didn’t think the odds were\nnearly as good as you want in a criminal case, and . . . the things that we had to gain [through a\nplea agreement] were much more than [in] a normal criminal case,” in which the only cost of a\nloss would be that the defendant did not go to jail. Lourie told OPR that to the best of his\nrecollection, he thought a plea agreement would be a good result, and although the government\nmight have to “give up some jail time,” there were other benefits to a plea, such as the ability to\nrequire Epstein to register as a sex offender and the availability of monetary damages for the\nvictims. Lourie recalled “thinking that this case should setle and we should set it up so we can\nsetle it” by, for example, charging Epstein by complaint and then negotiating a plea to limited\ncharges in a criminal information. Villafafia told OPR that she agreed with Lourie that a criminal\ncomplaint charging an “omnibus <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>” containing “all of the information related to what the\ncase was about” would be a good way to “get things moving” touard a pre-indictment plea.\n\nAlthough Lourie and Villafafia believed a pre-indictment plea agreement was a desired\nresolution, there was no guarantee that Epstein would agree to plead guilty, and they continued to\nwork together to shape an indictment. On May lo, 2oo7, Lourie emailed Villafafia:\n\n[M]arie\n\nI believe that Epstein’s at[orneys] are scared of the victims they\n\ndon’t knou. Epstein has no doubt told them that there were many.\n\nThus I believe the f[ir]st indictment should contain only the victims\n\nthey have nothing on at all. We can add in the other ones that have\n\nmyspace [sic] pages and prior testimony in a [superseding\n\nindictment]. I think for the first strike we should make all their\n\nnightmare[]s come true. Thoughts?”\nee Lourie explained to OPR that the government’s dismissal of counts in an indictment required the court’s\napproval, and that, while “it’s rare,” it was possible that a judge, seeing the nature and extent of Epstein’s conduct as\nset forth in an extensive indictment, might not allou substantive counts to be dismissed.\n42 Lourie’s references to MySpace pages and “prior testimony” referred to the impeachment information\nbrought forward by defense counsel.\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l228", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021229.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ary eae 3536o38, Paged/ of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 55 of 348\n\nLourie folloued up his email to Villafafia with one to Menchel, in which Lourie reiterated\nthe potential benefits of a pre-indictment plea, explaining that he and Villafafia believed “the best\nthing to do is charge Epstein by complaint, assuming we decide to charge him. ... The\n[sentencing] guidelines will be in the 2o year range, so we would need to plead him to one or two\nconspiracies to cap him and there is no telling if a judge would go for that once we indict.”*\nMenchel responded that he and Acosta would read the prosecution memorandum and “[w]e can\ndiscuss after that.”\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia sent Lourie an email, which Lourie forwarded to Menchel,\nexplaining that a “conservative calculation” of Epstein’s potential sentencing exposure under the\nU.S. Sentencing Guidelines would be l68 to 2lo months, and that in her view, the facts warranted\nan upward departure from that range. Villafafia told OPR that although Lourie proposed some\nchanges to the draft indictment, at that point no one had told her that the evidence was insufficient\nto support the proposed charges or that the office did not want to go forward with the case.\n\nIn an email to Acosta and Menchel on May ll, 2oo7, Lourie recommended charging\nEpstein by complaint and seeking a pre-indictment plea:\n\nMy current thoughts are that we should charge him. Not sure that I\nagree with the charging strategy as it is nou, but at this point I think\nwe only need to get on the same page as to whether the statutes cover\nthe conduct and whether the conduct is the type we should charge.\nI think the answer to both is yes, although there is some risk on some\nof the statutes as this is uncharted territory to some degree. We can\ndecide later what the [charging document] should look like precisely\nand which victims should be charged.\n\nI also think if we choose to go forward, we should start with a\ncomplaint, arrest him, detain him . . . and then try to see if he wants\na pre-indictment resolution. That would give us more control [over]\na plea than if we indict him and need the court’s approval to dismiss\ncounts. We will need to cap him with <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts to make a\nplea atractive and the court could give us a hard time with that if we\ntry to dismiss indicted counts.\n\nAlthough her supervisors were communicating among themselves about the case, Villafafia\nwas unaware of those discussions and was frustrated that she was not receiving more feedback.\nShe continued preparing to charge Epstein. Two weeks after submiting the prosecution\nmemorandum, on May l4, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Lourie and Menchel by email that Epstein\nwas flying to New Jersey from the Virgin Islands, and she asked whether she could file charges\nthe next day. Menchel responded that “[y]ou will not have approval to go forward tomorrou,”\nand explained that Acosta “has your [prosecution] memo,” but was at an out-of-toun conference,\nadding, “This is obviously a very significant case and [A]lex wants to take his time making sure\n43 Lourie told OPR that he was referring to one or two counts of <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> under l8 U.S.C. § 37l, the general\n“omnibus” federal <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> statute that carries a maximum sentence of five years.\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l229", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021237.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N63 3536o38, Page65 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 63 of 348\ninclude concurrent time.” The email primarily concerned other issues, and Villafafia did not\nexplain what the resolution she had in mind would entail.°’ Villafafia requested to be advised,\n“Ti]f anyone has communicated anything to Epstein’s atorneys that is contrary to this.” Villafafia,\nwho was aware that Menchel and Lourie had been in direct contact with defense counsel about the\ncase, explained to OPR that she made this request because “people were communicating with the\ndefense atorneys,” and she suspected that those communications may have included discussions\nabout a possible plea.\n\nIn response to Villafafia’s email, Menchel notified Villafafia that he had told Sanchez “a\nstate plea [with] jail time and sex offender status may satisfy the [U.S. Atorney],” but Sanchez\nhad responded that it “was a non-starter for them.”°’ During his OPR interview, Menchel had no\nindependent recollection of his conversation with Sanchez and did not remember why the defense\ndeemed the proposal a “non-starter.” Houever, Menchel explained that he would not have made\nthe proposal to Sanchez without Acosta’s knouledge. He also pointed out that in numerous emails\nbefore the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, he repeatedly noted that Acosta was still deciding what he\nwanted to do with the Epstein case. Acosta agreed, telling OPR that although he did not remember\na specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based resolution, Menchel would not have\ndiscussed a potential resolution with Sanchez “without having discussed it with me.”\n\nl. Acosta’s Explanation for His Decision to Pursue a State-based\nResolution\n\nSubsequent events shoued that the decision to resolve the case through state charges was\npivotal, and OPR extensively questioned Acosta about his reasoning. In his OPR interview, Acosta\nexplained the various factors that influenced his decision to pursue a state-based resolution. Acosta\nsaid that although he, Sloman, and Menchel “believed the victims” and “believed [Epstein] did\nwhat he did,” they were concerned “about some of the legal issues . . . and some of the issues in\nterms of testimony.” Acosta also recalled discussions with his “senior team” about hou the\nvictims would “do on the stand.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “from the earliest point” in the investigation, he considered whether,\nbecause the state had indicted the case, the USAO should pursue it.\n\nSf Villafafia explained to OPR that she intended to recommend a plea to a federal <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charge and a\nsubstantive charge, “consistent with the Ashcroft Memo, which would be the most readily provable offense,” with “a\nrecommendation that the sentence on the federal charges run concurrent with the state sentence, or that [Epstein]\nwould receive credit for time in state custody touards his federal release date.” See n.65 for an explanation of the\nAshcroft Memo.\n\n58 Villafafia was then in trial and on July 4, 2oo7, likely before reading Menchel’s email, Villafafia responded\nto defense counsel regarding the demand for records and also noted, “If you would like to discuss the possibility of a\nfederal resolution . . . that could run concurrently with any state resolution, please leave a message on my voicemail.”\nSY In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Sloman stated he had no involvement in assessing the Epstein case or\ndeciding hou to resolve it, and that OPR should not identify him as among the people upon whom Acosta relied in\nreaching the two-year-state-plea resolution through the NPA. Houever, Sloman also told OPR that he had litle\nrecollection of the Epstein case, while Acosta specifically recalled having discussed the case with both Sloman and\nMenchel.\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l237", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021261.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document O87 3536o38, Page89 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 87 of 348\nShe believed that access to the computer evidence would strengthen the government’s negotiating\nposition, but that her supervisors “did not seem to recognize that.” Villafafia said she did not\nunderstand why her supervisors were uninterested in determining what the computers contained.\nInstead, they instructed Villafafia to “keep calling the judge” to ask for a delay in the litigation\nproceedings.\n\nSloman told OPR that he recalled an issue about the computers, but did not recall “what\nthe thinking was at the time” about pursuing that evidence or why Villafafia was “ordered to stand\ndoun.” Acosta, Menchel, and Lourie all told OPR that they did not recall Villafafia’s effort to\nobtain the computer evidence or that there had been litigation relating to it. Lourie, houever, told\nOPR that the computers might have contained “very pouerful evidence” that possibly “could have\nchanged our advice to [Acosta], or his decision making.” In his OPR interview, Menchel was\nuncertain whether the computer evidence would have been useful, but also acknouledged to OPR,\n“You always want more as a prosecutor.”\n\nOn August 3l, 2oo7, in preparation for the upcoming September 7, 2oo7 meeting with\ndefense counsel that he planned to atend, CEOS Chief Oosterban traveled to West Palm Beach\nto meet with Villafafia and the case agents and to examine the case file. He explained to OPR that\nhe wanted to see the file before meeting with the defense so that he could best “represent[] the\ninterests of the prosecution team,” and that he was in favor of going forward with the case.\nAccording to Villafafia, during his review of the file, Oosterban told her that the case was “really\ngood” and offered to assist Villafafia at trial.\n\nOn September 6, 2oo7, the day before the meeting with defense counsel, Sloman sent\nVillafafia an email asking, “Please refresh my recollection. What is the ‘deal’ on the table?”\nSloman told OPR that his question reflected the fact that in his capacity as FAUSA, he was\ninvolved in “a hundred other things” at that time.?® Villafafia sent Sloman the term sheet and\nexplained to him, ““You and Mat [Menchel] and I had also discussed a possible federal plea to an\nInformation charging a 37l <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, with a Rule ll plea with a two-year cap, but I think Mat\nmust have asked Alex about it and it was nixed.” Villafafia continued:\n\nThere are three concerns that I hope we can address tomorrou. First,\n\nthat there is an absolute drop-dead date for accepting or rejecting\n\nbecause it is strategically important that we indict before the end of\n\nSeptember, which means .. . September 25th.

The draft\nNPA contained the terms presented to the defense team on July 3l, 2oo7, and called for Epstein to\nenter a state plea by September 28, 2oo7. Villafafia told OPR that because she had never seen a\nnon-prosecution agreement before, she relied on a template she found either using USAO or the\nDepartment’s internal online resources, but she did not do any additional research regarding the\nuse of non-prosecution agreements. !°!\n\n3. September 7, 2oo7: Acosta, Other USAO Atorneys, and FBI\nSupervisors Meet with Epstein Atorneys Starr, Lefkouitz, and\nSanchez\n\nOn Friday, September 7, 2oo7, Acosta, Sloman, Villafafia, Villafafia’s co-counsel,\nOosterban, and one or two supervisory FBI agents met at the USAO’s West Palm Beach office\nwith defense atorneys Sanchez and, for the first time, Starr and Lefkouitz.°? This was Acosta’s\nfirst meeting with Epstein’s defense team. Villafafia understood the purpose of this meeting was\nto afford Epstein’s counsel an opportunity to “make a pitch” as to why the case should not be\nprosecuted federally. Villafafia recalled that at a “pre-meet” before defense counsel arrived,\nAcosta did not express concern about the viability of the prosecution or the strength of the case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that the meeting was not “a negotiation,” but a chance for the defense to\npresent their arguments, which were made by Starr and focused primarily on federalism. Villafafia\nsimilarly recalled that the meeting mainly consisted of the defense argument that the Epstein case\nshould remain a state mater in which the USAO should not interfere. Both Villafafia and her\nco-counsel recalled that Starr addressed himself directly to Acosta, and that Starr, who had held\nSenate-confirmed positions in the government, commented to Acosta that he and Acosta were “the\nonly people in this room who have run the [gantlet] of confirmation by the Senate.” Acosta did\nnot recall the comment, but he told OPR, “[B]ack in July, we had decided that we were going\nChapter Three, the Department’s position at the time was that victim consultation was not required in maters in which\nthe government did not pursue a federal charge.

Epstein and his counsel\nagree that the computers that are currently under [legal process] will\nbe safeguarded in their current condition by Epstein’s counsel or\ntheir agents until the terms and conditions of the Agreement are\n\nfulfilled.\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a lengthy email to convey two options Lourie had\nsuggested: “the original proposal” for a state plea but with an agreement for an l8-month sentence,\nor pleas to state charges and two federal obstruction-of-justice charges. Villafafia also told\nLefkouitz she was willing to ask Acosta again to approve a federal plea to a five-year <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>\nwith a Rule ll(c) binding recommendation for a 2o-month sentence. Villafafia explained:\n\nAs to timing, it is my understanding that Mr. Epstein needs to be\nsentenced in the state after he is sentenced in the federal case, but\nnot that he needs to plead guilty and be sentenced after serving his\nfederal time. Andy recommended that some of the timing issues be\naddressed only in the state agreement, so that it isn’t obvious to the\njudge that we are trying to create federal jurisdiction for prison\npurposes.\n\nWith regard to prosecution of individuals other than Epstein, Villafafia suggested standard\nfederal plea agreement language regarding the resolution of all criminal liability, “and I will\nmention ‘co-conspirators,’ but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes\nand all of the other persons that we could charge.” Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to\ninclude a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-conspirators, who at the time she understood\nto be the four women named in the proposed agreement, because the USAO was not interested in\nprosecuting those individuals if Epstein entered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, “[W]e considered\nEpstein to be the top of the food chain, and we wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone\nelse.” She did not consider the possibility that Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed.\nindividuals, and no one, including the FBI case agents, raised that concern. Villafafia also told\nOPR that her reference to “all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge”\nrelated to her concern that if the plea agreement contained information about uncharged conduct,\nthe court might ask for more information about that conduct and inquire why it had not been\ncharged, and if the government provided such information, Epstein’s atorneys might claim the\nagreement was breached.'l3\n\nWith regard to immigration, Villafafia told OPR that the USAO generally did not take any\nposition in plea agreements on immigration issues, and that in this case, there was no evidence that\neither of the two assistants who were foreign nationals had commited fraud in connection with\ntheir immigration paperwork, “and I think that they were both in status. So there wasn’t any reason\nl3 OPR understood Villafafia’s concern to be that if the government were required to respond to a court’s inquiry\ninto additional facts, Epstein would object that the government was trying to cast him in a negative light in order to\ninfluence the court to impose a sentence greater than the agreed-upon term.\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l27o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021274.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON loo. 3536o38, Pagelo2 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page loo of 348\nand had added language waiving the preparation of a presentence investigation (PSI) “so he can\nkeep all of his information confidential. I have already told Jay that the PSI language . . . was\nunacceptable to our office.” Of even greater significance, in a follou-up email, Villafafia noted\nthat the defense had removed both the requirement that Epstein plead to a registrable offense and\nthe entire provision relating to monetary damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn the afternoon, Villafafia circulated her oun proposed “hybrid” plea agreement, first\ninternally to the management team with a note stating that it “contains the l8/l2 split that Jay and\nAndy agreed to,” and then to Lefkouitz. Regarding the prosecution of other individuals, she\nincluded the follouing provision: ‘This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability of the\ndefendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal\nconduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement,” including\nbut not limited to the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to solicit minors to engage in prostitution.\n\nIn her email to Lefkouitz, transmiting the plea agreement, Villafafia wrote:\n\nCould you share the atached draft with your colleagues. It is in\nkeeping with what Andy communicated to me was the operative\n“deal.” The U.S. Atorney hasn’t had a chance to review all of the\nlanguage, but he agrees with it in principle.\n\n[The West Palm Beach manager] and I will both be available at 2:oo.\n... One of my suggestions is going to be (again) that we all sit doun\ntogether in the same room, including Barry [Krischer] and/or Lanna\n[Belohlavek], so we can hash out the still existing issues and get a\nsigned document.\n\nVillafafia also emailed Acosta directly, telling him she planned to meet with Epstein’s\natorneys to work on the plea agreement, and asking if Acosta would be available to provide final\napproval. Acosta replied, “I don’t think I should be part of negotiations. I’d rather leave it to you\nif that’s ok.” Acosta told OPR that “absent truly exceptional circumstances,” he believed it was\nimportant for him “to not get involved” in negotiations, and added, “You can meet, like I did in\nSeptember, [to] reaffirm the position of the office, [and] back your AUSA, but ultimately, I think\nyour trial lawyer needs discretion to do their job.” Villafafia told OPR, houever, that she did not\nunderstand Acosta to be giving her discretion to conduct the negotiations as she saw fit; rather, she\nbelieved Acosta did not want to engage in face-to-face negotiations because “he wanted to have\nan appearance of having sort of an arm’s length from the deal.”\"'? Villafafia replied to Acosta’s\n9 As noted throughout the Report, Villafafia’s interpretation of her supervisors’ motivations for their actions\noften differed from the supervisors’ explanations for their actions.

Acosta Edits the Federal Plea Agreement, and Villafaia Sends a Final Version\n\nto the Defense\n\nThe next day, Thursday, September 2o, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Assistant State Atorney\nBelohlavek and informed her:\n\nOur deadline is Monday evening for a signed agreement and\narraignment in the federal system.

In their latest draft,\nthey changed what they agreed to plead to in the state from\nsolicitation of minors for prostitution (a registrable offense) to\nforcing adults into prostitution (a non-registrable offense). We will\nnot budge on this issue, so it is looking unlikely that we will reach a\nmutually acceptable agreement. If that changes, I will let you knou.\n\nAcosta sent Lourie “[s]ome thoughts” about the USAO version of the proposed “hybrid”\nfederal plea agreement he had received from Lourie the evening before, commenting that “it seems\nvery straightforward” and “we are not changing our standard charging language” for the\ndefense. '”° Noting that the draft was prepared for his signature, Acosta told Lourie that he did not\ntypically sign plea agreements and “this should not be the first,” adding that the USAO “should\nonly go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement.” ”! Lourie forwarded the email\nto Villafafia with a transmital message simply reading, “I think Alex’s changes are all good ones.\nPlease try to incorporate his suggestions, change the signature block to your name and send as\nfinal to Jay.” Lourie also noted to Acosta and Villafafia that he believed the defense would want\nto go back to the initial offer of a state plea with a non-prosecution agreement. When Villafafia\nsent the revised plea agreement to Lefkouitz later that afternoon, she advised him that if the\ndefense wanted to return to the original offer of a state plea only, the draft NPA she had sent to\nhim on September l7, 2oo7, would control.\n\nl2o The USAO had standard federal plea agreement language, from which this “hybrid” plea agreement had\nsubstantially diverged.\n\nVt The standard procedure was for documents such as plea agreements to be signed by an AUSA under the\nname of the U.S. Atorney. In his OPR interview, Acosta further explained that wanted to give “the trial team” an\nopportunity to voice any objections because “if it’s something they don’t feel comfortable with we... shouldn’t go\nforward with it.”\n\n77\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l277", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021364.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l9o | 3536o38, Pagel92 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9o of 348\n\nOPR asked Villafafia about these emails and about the tenor of her interactions with\nLefkouitz during the NPA negotiations and with other defense atorneys generally. Villafafia\nacknouledged that their tone was collegial and collaborative, and explained that generally, the\ntone of these emails reflected her personality and her commitment to complete the task her\nsupervisors had assigned to her:\n\n[I]f you were to pull all my e-mails on every case, you would find\nthat that is hou I communicate with people. I’m a Minnesota girl,\nand I prefer not to be confrontational until I have to be. And I can\nbe when I need to be. But my instructions from my supervisors were\nto engage in these negotiations and to complete them. So I felt that\ngiven that task, the best way to complete them was to reach the\nagreement and, keeping in mind the terms that .. . our office had\nagreed to, and do that in a way that is civil. So... although my\nlanguage in the kind of introductory or prefatory communications\nwith Mr. Lefkouitz was casual and was friendly, when you look at\nthe terms and when he would come back to me asking for changes,\nmy response was always, “No, I will not make that change.”\n\nVillafafia denied any intention to keep the victims uninformed about the NPA or to provide\nan improper benefit for Epstein, and she explained the context of the emails in question. The email\nin which Villafafia expressed reluctance to “highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and all\nof the other persons that we could charge” was writen in response to a defense proposal to include\nin the federal plea agreement the parties were then considering a promise by the government not\nto prosecute Epstein’s assistants and other employees. Lefkouitz had proposed that the plea\nagreement state, “Epstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also precludes the\ninitiation of any and all criminal charges which might otherwise in the future be brought against\n[four named female assistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate entity] for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” Villafafia told OPR that\nthe USAO was not intending to charge Epstein’s assistants and was not aware of anyone else who\ncould be charged, and thus did not oppose the request not to prosecute third parties. Houever,\nVillafafia was concerned that an overly detailed federal plea agreement would prompt the court to\nrequire the government to provide further information about the uncharged conduct, which might\nlead Epstein to claim the government breached the agreement by providing information to the\ncourt not directly connected to the charges to which he was pleading guilty. Villafafia was not the\nonly one to express concern about hou deeply a federal court might probe the facts, and whether\nsuch probing would interfere with the viability of a plea agreement. In an earlier email, Lourie\nhad suggested charging Epstein by complaint to allou the USAO more flexibility in plea\nnegotiations and avoid the problem that a court might not accept a plea to a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charge that\nrequired dismissal of numerous substantive counts.\n\nAs to Villafafia’s offer to meet with Lefkouitz “off campus” to resolve outstanding issues\nin the NPA negotiation, she explained to OPR that she believed a face-to-face meeting at a\n“neutral” location—with “all the necessary decision makers present or ‘on call’”— might facilitate\ncompletion of the negotiations, which had dragged on for some time.\n\nl64\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l364", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021380.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 3o6 3536o38, Page2o8 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o6 of 348\n“[’m reconstructing memories of... l2 years ago. I can speculate that at some point, the mater\ncame up, and I or someone else said... what would the original charges have likely brought? And\nsomeone said this amount.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall who initially proposed this\nmethod, but he believed that it likely did not result from a single specific discussion but rather\nfrom conversations over a course of time. Acosta could not recall specifically with whom he had\nthese discussions, other than that it would have been Lourie, Menchel, or Sloman. Villafafia was\nnot asked for her views on a two-year sentence, and she had no input into the decision before it\nwas made. Villafafia told OPR that she examined the state statutes and could not validate that a\nstate charge would have resulted in a 24-month sentence. OPR also examined applicable state\nstatutes and the Florida sentencing guidelines, but could not confirm that Epstein was, in fact,\nfacing a potential two-year sentence under charges contemplated by the PBPD.\n\nOn the other hand, during his OPR interview, Lourie “guess[ed]” that “somehou the\ndefense conveyed .. . we’re going to trial if it’s more than two years.” Menchel similarly told\nOPR that he did not knou hou the two year sentence was derived, but “obviously it was a number\nthat the office felt was palatable enough that [Epstein] would take” it. Sloman told OPR that he\nhad no idea hou the two-year sentence proposal was reached.\n\nThe contemporaneous documentary record, houever, provides no indication that Epstein’s\nteam proposed a two-year sentence of incarceration or initially suggested, before the USAO made\nits offer, that Epstein would accept a two-year term of incarceration. As late as July 25, 2oo7—\nonly days before the USAO provided the term sheet to defense counsel—Epstein’s counsel\nsubmited a leter to the USAO arguing that the federal government should not prosecute Epstein\nat all. Furthermore, after the initial “term sheet” was presented and negotiations for the NPA\nprogressed, Epstein’s team continued to strongly press for less or no time in jail.\n\nThe USAO had other charging and sentencing options available to it. The most obvious\nalternative to the two-year sentence proposal was to offer Epstein a plea to a federal offense that\ncarried a harsher sentence. If federally charged, Epstein was facing a substantial sentence under\nthe federal sentencing guidelines, l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment. Houever, it is unlikely that\nhe would have agreed to a plea that required a guidelines sentence, even one at the louer end of\nthe guidelines. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues had been concerned that Epstein\nwould opt to go to trial if charged and presented with the option of pleading to a guidelines\nsentence, and as previously discussed, there were both evidentiary and legal risks atendant upon\na trial in this case. If federally charged, Epstein’s sentencing exposure could have been managed.\nby offering him a plea under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c) for a stipulated sentence,\nwhich requires judicial approval. Acosta rejected this idea, houever, apparently because of a\nperception that the federal district courts in the Southern District of Florida did not view Rule ll(c)\npleas favorably and might refuse to accept such a plea and thus limit the USAO’s options.\n\nAnother alternative was to offer Epstein a plea to <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, a federal charge that carried\na maximum five-year sentence. Shortly after Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum\nto her supervisors, Lourie recommended to Acosta charging Epstein by criminal complaint and\noffering a plea to <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> “to make a plea atractive.” Similarly, before learning that Menchel\nhad already discussed a state-based resolution with Epstein’s counsel, Villafafia had considered\noffering Epstein a plea to one count of <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> and a substantive charge, to be served\nconcurrently with any sentence he might receive separately as a result of the state’s outstanding\n\nl8o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l38o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021552.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 376. 3536o39, Pagel22 of 2l7\n7\nM6SOmaxl\nl material to sentencing or not, I am prepared to address it.\n2 So I believe the first -- what I see as your first\n3 continued objection is to paragraph 22.\n4 MR.

For over a decade, Maxwell\ntraveled with Epstein, a multi-millionaire, on his pri-\nvate planes and mingled with rich and famous people,\nwhile enjoying a life of extraordinary luxury. (Tr.96-\n99, 233-34, 3o3-o4, ll94).

(Tr.99).

(Tr.ll94,\nl3lo-l7).\n\nIn addition to her role as Epstein’s girlfriend, Max-\nwell also supervised Epstein’s households as “the lady\nof the house.” (Tr.95, 783-84). When she took charge of\nEpstein’s homes, she imposed strict rules for staff,\nsome of which were included in a household manual\ndictating the operation of the Palm Beach residence.\n(Tr.8o7-o8, 823-3l).\n\nTo protect her criminal activities from exposure,\nMaxwell fostered a culture of silence at Epstein’s\nhomes. (Tr.784, 826). The household manual made\nclear that staff were to “see nothing, hear nothing, say\nnothing, except to answer a question directed at” that\nstaff member. (Tr.826).

In the early\nphase of the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, between l994 and 2ool, Max-\nwell and Epstein identified vulnerable girls, typically\nfrom single-mother households and difficult financial\ncircumstances. (Tr.295, ll78, 2o5l-52). Maxwell and\nEpstein then isolated the girls, spending time with\nthem away from their family and friends. (Tr.296-99,\nll75-82, 2o69-7o, 2o77-79). During that time, they\ngroomed the girls through techniques such as giving\nthem gifts, pretending to be friends, and building\ntrust. (Tr.298-3o3, 348, 2o79-8l). Maxwell and Ep-\nstein then normalized sexual situations and sexual\ntouching. (Tr.3oo-ol, 2o8l-84).

Nor could she, as Jane testified that she was\n\nlo As the Government argued belou, and as Judge\nNathan found, Count Six is also timely under l8\nU.S.C. § 3299, which eliminated the statute of limita-\ntions for violations of l8 U.S.C. § l59l in 2oo6, and\nwhich also applies retroactively under Landgraf for\nthe same reasons discussed above with respect to Sec-\ntion 3283.

And the text of Section 3283 goes even further\nbeyond the definition provided in Section 35o9 by cov-\nering any crime “involving” the sexual abuse of a child.\nCongress therefore did not require that a particular\nstatute have actual sexual contact with a minor as an\nelement of its offense, but rather swept broadly to\ncover any crime that in any way involves sexual abuse\nas broadly defined. Given this expansive language,\nsexual abuse “as defined here encompasses a wider set\nof behavior than just rape or other unwanted sexual\ntouching.” United States v. Schneider, 8ol F.3d l86,\nl97 (8d Cir. 2ol5). Thus, courts throughout the coun-\ntry have concluded that Section 3283 applies to a vari-\nety of offenses that do not require “a sexual act be-\ntween a defendant and a specific child,” United States\nv.

Transportation of a minor with intent to engage\nin an illegal sex act (as charged in Count Four) and\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to commit the same (as charged in Count\nThree) fall comfortably within that definition.

That is the issue Judge\nNathan instructed the jury to resolve, and that is the\ncriminal conduct charged in Counts Three and Four of\nthe Indictment. Accordingly, no constructive amend-\nment or variance occurred.\nA. Relevant Facts\n\nCounts Three and Four charged Maxwell with ar-\nranging for Jane’s transportation to New York with\nthe intent that Jane would engage in sex acts with Ep-\nstein, in violation of New York state law, and with a\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to transport minors to New York for the\nsame purpose. (A.l27-3o). At trial, the Government\nmarshalled evidence that Maxwell transported Jane to\nNew York, and aided and abeted Epstein in doing so,\nwith the intent that Jane engage in sexual activity\nthere. That evidence included detailed testimony from\nJane about Epstein’s New York residence (Tr.3l6-l9)\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l726", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021727.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page8o of 93\n67\nand specific sexual acts that took place in New York\nwhile Jane was a minor (Tr.3l9-2o).\n\nThe Government’s summation similarly discussed\nthese charges as encompassing conduct directed at\nNew York. As to Count Four, the Government argued\nthe evidence shoued “Jane was transported to New\nYork,” and Maxwell was involved in making travel ar-\nrangements. (Tr.289l (emphasis added)). The Govern-\nment also clarified that “[t]he crime happened the mo-\nment [Maxwell, Epstein, and Jane] crossed state\nlines,” and “to be very clear, when Epstein flew Jane to\nNew York and Maxwell aided and abeted him, that’s\nenough too.” Ud. (emphasis added)). For the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>\ncounts, the Government referenced its earlier discus-\nsion of the elements of the substantive offenses. And\nthe Government argued that, “even though Carolyn\nand Annie were not sexually abused in New York...\nthat is what [Maxwell and Epstein] both intended.”\n(Tr.2895 (emphasis added); see Tr.2895-96 (arguing\nthat Maxwell “groomed Annie for abuse after she had\nalready visited Epstein in New York.” (emphasis\nadded))).\n\nThe District Court’s jury instructions also permit-\nted the jury to determine only whether Maxwell had\nintended that Jane (for the substantive counts) or the\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> victims engage in sexual activity in New\nYork. During trial, Judge Nathan granted defense re-\nquests for limiting instructions at the time evidence\ncame in to make clear that the charges focused on the\nintent that sexual activity take place in New York.\n(Tr.ll67-68 (Kate), 2o48-49 (Annie)). At the conclusion\nof trial, Judge Nathan instructed the jury that Count\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l727", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021735.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page88 of 93\n75\n\nfloun to New York on Epstein’s private jet, corroborat-\ning her testimony on that point. (See Br.79 (citing GX-\n662-R at 44)). The same is true regarding Maxwell’s\ncomparison of Counts Two and Four: in Maxwell’s\nview, the jury rejected nearly all of the evidence of\nMaxwell’s enticement of Jane to New York for lack of\ncorroboration, and then convicted her based on an un-\nsupported speculative leap about arranging an uni-\ndentified return flight from New Mexico. That is not\nplausible, and it certainly is not a “substantially\nlikely” conclusion that can be drawn from an inscruta-\nble jury note.\n\nFor similar reasons, no variance occurred. As dis-\ncussed above, the proof at trial corresponded to the al-\nlegations in the Indictment, namely, evidence and ar-\ngument that Maxwell enticed and transported Jane to\nNew York in order to facilitate sexual abuse there.\nMaxwell was also well aware that the Government’s\nproof would include conduct in New Mexico. (See\nA.ll7, l2l-22, l26). Maxwell therefore had “fair and\nadequate notice” that the conspiracies included con-\nduct at Epstein’s New Mexico home, which is all that\nis required. United States v.

BACKGROUND\nA The Indictment Alleges that Mr. Thomas Conspired with Co-Defendant,\nNoel. and Created Faise Records\nThe government’s investigation in this case began upon the discovery of the alleged\nsuicide of Jeffrey Epstein, on August lo, 2ol9, at the Metropolitan Correctional Center\n| (“MCC”).\nAt that time, Mr. Thomas, and Co-Defendant, Noel, were on duty as correctional officers\nin the section of the MCC, knoun as the Special Housing Unit (“SHU”).\nThe indictment (Indictment, Introduction at l), alleges, among other things, that certain |\nprison counts, in other words, physically counting the prisoners in the cells, were not made by |\n. the defendants. In addition, the indictment alleges that the defendants, then, agreed and conspired\nto conceal the failure to conduct the prison atm by creating and signing false records,\natesting that such counts had occurred. (7d.)\nThus, the indictment charges the defendants with <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. (Indictment, Count One at {\n28.) In addition, the indictment charges the defendants with creating false records. (Indictment,\nCount Four at 7 l5.) Defendant, Thomas, is not charged in Counts Two and Three of the\nindictment.\nB. Mr. Thomas’ Rule l6 and Brady-Giglio Requests for Production\nof Documents Have Been Denied\nOn December l6, 2ol9, the parties agreed to a protective order as to discovery, and on\nthat day this Court entered same (Docket # l3). On January 29, 2o2o, defendant, Thomas, made\ncertain requests to the government under Rule l6 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n(See Exhibit A.) Approximately, forty-five days later, on March l4, 2o2o, the government\nresponded to the requests made by defendant, Thomas with a one sentence denial of said request.\nThe substance of the response was that the defendant should refer to the government’s responses\nmade at the pretrial conference of November 25, 2ol9. (ll/25/2ol9 - Docket Minute Entry).\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o29", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022038.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 33 Filed o4/o9/2o Page l5 of 38\ngovernment agencies because it is highly relevant to Mr. Thornas’ defense in this case.\nFurthermore, the government had Mr. Thomas sign a consent form specifically from the\nInspector General’s office. (See Exhibit C.) Thereafter, the government tumed over the results of\nthis search in the normal course of discovery production. This fact shous that the Inspector\nGeneral was investigating this incident thus all information they receive is discoverable. This\nCourt should order the production of the documents within forty-five (45) days from the entry of\nan order on this motion.\n\nB. Rule l6 and Brady-Giglio Include the Production of Documents and —\n\nReports Generated by Other Agencies\n\nThe facts, shoun above as reported in the media and secondary sources, clearly shou that\nother agencies were involved in the investigation of Jeffrey Epstein’s death and the defendant’s\narrest and indictment. Thus, clearly, this Court should not permit the government to selflimit\ndiscovery. A prosecutor is not \"alloued to avoid disclosure of evidence by the simple expedient\nof leaving relevant evidence to repose in the hands of another agency while utilizing his access to\nit in preparing his case for trial.\" United States v. Trevino, 556 F.2d l265, l272 (5th Cir.l977);\n\nU.S. v. Giffen, 379 F. Supp. 2d 337 (S.D. N.Y. 2oo4)\n\nIn United States v. Bryan, 868 F.2d lo32 (9th Cir.l989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 858, llo\nS.Ct. l67, lo7 L.Ed.2d l24 (l989), after a nationwide investigation by the IRS, Bryan had been\nconvicted of, among other things, <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to defraud the United States. Bryan sought\ndiscovery, under Rule l6(a)(l)(C) of items that were in the possession of the FBI. The charges\nagainst Bryan stemmed from the IRS investigation, and this difference, together with the further\nobjection that production should be limited only to documents found in the District in which the\nmater was pending, Oregon, formed the basis of the government’s objection.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o38", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022080.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 35 Filed o4/24/2o Page l8 of 34\nand willfully made a false statement. Nor are those excuses relevant to whether Thomas had a\ncriminal agreement with his co-defendant. Indeed, evidence as to a defendant’s purportedly\ninnocent motive in a false statement case is irrelevant to the question of intent. See United States\nv. Washington, 7o5 F.2d 489, 493-94 (D.C. Cir. l983) (holding that proof of a good or innocent\nmotive is not probative of intent where the mens rea is “knouingly and willfully”); Jn re Terrorist\nBombings of U.S. Embassies in E. Africa, 552 F.3d 93, l54 n.49 (2d Cir. 2oo8) (citing Washington,\n7o5 F.2d at 493, for “the irrelevance of a motive to the question of whether conduct is intentional”);\nUnited States v. George, 786 F. Supp. 56, 64 (D.D.C. l992) (rejecting the defendant’s “context\nargument” for why materials could be relevant to the crime charged).\n\nFor the same reasons, “other people were doing it” is not a defense to a false statements or\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charge because the conduct of other BOP employees is irrelevant to each of the\nforegoing elements. Thomas argues that because he was aware of incidents where BOP employees\nfalsified records and “their conduct did not lead to their indictment or incarceration,” evidence of\nwhat other BOP employees have done is relevant to his intent. (Mot. 6.) Not so. Whether Thomas\nbelieved falsifying records was illegal or was subject to criminal penalties is not relevant to the\ncharges against him. See United States v. Southland Corp., 76o F.2d l366, l372 (2d Cir. l985)\n(“Ignorance of the law is no defense to a charge of purposeful and intentional action.”); United\nStates v. Rosenfield, 469 F.2d 598, 6ol n.2 (3d Cir. l972) (“As long as the inexcusable intent is\npresent, it is not necessary that the defendant knou that his conduct is subject to criminal\npenalties.”). And in any event, it would be fundamentally inappropriate, and extremely prejudicial,\nfor the jury to consider other individuals not on trial or otherwise relevant to the conduct charged\nhere, in evaluating the guilt or innocence of the defendant. See United States v. Gibbons, 6o2 F.2d\nlo44, lo48 (2d Cir. l979) (approving instruction that jury was not to consider individuals who\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o8o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022081.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document35 Filed o4/24/2o Page l9 of 34\nwere not on trial).\n\nThomas’s efforts to garner sympathy, put the Government on trial, and deflect blame for\nhis oun criminal actions plainly sound in nullification. See Reese, 933 F. Supp. 2d at 583-84;\nLevin, 2ol6 WL 299o83l, at *l2. Evidence on those points does not relate to whether the\ndefendant commited the crimes charged, but rather is intended to elicit sympathy, compassion, or\ncompromise from the jury. The records Thomas seeks are no more discoverable than the\nnullification evidence precluded in Armstrong and its progeny. See Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. at 462-\n63 (defendant not entitled to discovery on race of other narcotics defendants to aid in selective\nprosecution claim); United States v. Delacruz, No. l4 Cr. 8l5 (KBF), 2ol5 WL 22ll943, at *4\n(S.D.N.Y. May l2, 2ol5) (rejecting defendant’s “demands for general information and statistics\nrelating to the Government’s use of sting operations”); United States v. Floyd, No. 99 Cr. o234\n(DAB), l999 WL 476438, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. July 7, l999) (rejecting discovery request for\n“background data, records and investigative reports” of the New York City Police Department\n(“NYPD”) as well as information about NYPD officers’ conduct in other cases); Defreitas, 2oll\nWL 3l7964, at *lo (rejecting discovery demands related to a “factual impossibility” defense to a\n<span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charge). It is the Court’s “duty to forestall or prevent” jury nullification. Manzano,\n945 F.3d at 627 (holding that “District courts have a duty to forestall or prevent [jury nullification\narguments] and the district court in this case abdicated its duty by ruling that defense counsel could\nargue jury nullification.”); see also United States v. Rosado, 728 F.2d 89, 93 (2d Cir. l984)\n(criticizing trial court for inviting nullification by permiting the defendants to mount a “political\ndefense” and stating that it was an “erroneous assumption that good motive for commiting a crime\nis inconsistent with criminal intent’).\n\nIn sum, much of the additional discovery Thomas seeks in his motion relates to legally\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o8l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022605.jpg": "Page 2l3\nl lot of, I think, misinformation or there's a lot of\n2 information out there that -- I don't knou whether\n3 there's misinformation, but about the time from, you\n4 knou, 2ol9 up until the time that you were -- that\n5 you were arrested.\n6 And then, like I said, that'll take us\n7 through lunch tomorrou and then we'll be done.

That\nwould have sent them thru the roof.” Lourie explained to OPR that he thought a judge, after seeing\nan indictment charging the full nature and scope of Epstein’s conduct, might not agree to a plea\ninvolving substantially less time or to dismiss substantive charges.\"!\n\nLourie told OPR that despite Oosterban’s favorable opinion of the case, “[t]his was ...a\nbit of uncharted territory,” involving facts that were unlike the case law Oosterban had cited.\nAlthough Lourie had some concerns about the legal issues and about the witnesses, he “probably”\ndid not see any impediment to going forward with the case; in fact, Lourie “was not in favor of\nwalking away, which is what the defense wanted [the USAO] to do.” But while Lourie “thought\nwe could have won and we could have prevailed through appeal,” he “didn’t think the odds were\nnearly as good as you want in a criminal case, and . . . the things that we had to gain [through a\nplea agreement] were much more than [in] a normal criminal case,” in which the only cost of a\nloss would be that the defendant did not go to jail. Lourie told OPR that to the best of his\nrecollection, he thought a plea agreement would be a good result, and although the government\nmight have to “give up some jail time,” there were other benefits to a plea, such as the ability to\nrequire Epstein to register as a sex offender and the availability of monetary damages for the\nvictims. Lourie recalled “thinking that this case should setle and we should set it up so we can\nsetle it” by, for example, charging Epstein by complaint and then negotiating a plea to limited\ncharges in a criminal information. Villafafia told OPR that she agreed with Lourie that a criminal\ncomplaint charging an “omnibus <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>” containing “all of the information related to what the\ncase was about” would be a good way to “get things moving” touard a pre-indictment plea.\n\nAlthough Lourie and Villafafia believed a pre-indictment plea agreement was a desired\nresolution, there was no guarantee that Epstein would agree to plead guilty, and they continued to\nwork together to shape an indictment. On May lo, 2oo7, Lourie emailed Villafafia:\n\n[Marie\n\nI believe that Epstein’s at[orneys] are scared of the victims they\n\ndon’t knou. Epstein has no doubt told them that there were many.\n\nThus I believe the flir]st indictment should contain only the victims\n\nthey have nothing on at all. We can add in the other ones that have\n\nmyspace [sic] pages and prior testimony in a [superseding\n\nindictment]. I think for the first strike we should make all their\n\nnightmare[]s come true. Thoughts?”\n4 Lourie explained to OPR that the government’s dismissal of counts in an indictment required the court’s\napproval, and that, while “it’s rare,” it was possible that a judge, seeing the nature and extent of Epstein’s conduct as\nset forth in an extensive indictment, might not allou substantive counts to be dismissed.\n2 Lourie’s references to MySpace pages and “prior testimony” referred to the impeachment information\nbrought forward by defense counsel.\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o66", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023067.jpg": "Lourie folloued up his email to Villafafia with one to Menchel, in which Lourie reiterated\nthe potential benefits of a pre-indictment plea, explaining that he and Villafafia believed “the best\nthing to do is charge Epstein by complaint, assuming we decide to charge him. . .. The\n[sentencing] guidelines will be in the 2o year range, so we would need to plead him to one or two\nconspiracies to cap him and there is no telling if a judge would go for that once we indict.”\nMenchel responded that he and Acosta would read the prosecution memorandum and “[w]e can\ndiscuss after that.”\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia sent Lourie an email, which Lourie forwarded to Menchel,\nexplaining that a “conservative calculation” of Epstein’s potential sentencing exposure under the\nU.S. Sentencing Guidelines would be l68 to 2lo months, and that in her view, the facts warranted\nan upward departure from that range. Villafafia told OPR that although Lourie proposed some\nchanges to the draft indictment, at that point no one had told her that the evidence was insufficient\nto support the proposed charges or that the office did not want to go forward with the case.\n\nIn an email to Acosta and Menchel on May ll, 2oo7, Lourie recommended charging\nEpstein by complaint and seeking a pre-indictment plea:\n\nMy current thoughts are that we should charge him. Not sure that I\nagree with the charging strategy as it is nou, but at this point I think\nwe only need to get on the same page as to whether the statutes cover\nthe conduct and whether the conduct is the type we should charge.\nI think the answer to both is yes, although there is some risk on some\nof the statutes as this is uncharted territory to some degree. We can\ndecide later what the [charging document] should look like precisely\nand which victims should be charged.\n\nI also think if we choose to go forward, we should start with a\ncomplaint, arrest him, detain him . . . and then try to see if he wants\na pre-indictment resolution. That would give us more control [over]\na plea than if we indict him and need the court’s approval to dismiss\ncounts. We will need to cap him with <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> counts to make a\nplea atractive and the court could give us a hard time with that if we\ntry to dismiss indicted counts.\n\nAlthough her supervisors were communicating among themselves about the case, Villafafia\nwas unaware of those discussions and was frustrated that she was not receiving more feedback.\nShe continued preparing to charge Epstein. Two weeks after submiting the prosecution\nmemorandum, on May l4, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Lourie and Menchel by email that Epstein\nwas flying to New Jersey from the Virgin Islands, and she asked whether she could file charges\nthe next day. Menchel responded that “[y]ou will not have approval to go forward tomorrou,”\nand explained that Acosta “has your [prosecution] memo,” but was at an out-of-toun conference,\nadding, “This is obviously a very significant case and [A]lex wants to take his time making sure\n43 Lourie told OPR that he was referring to one or two counts of <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> under l8 U.S.C. § 37l, the general\n“omnibus” federal <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> statute that carries a maximum sentence of five years.\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o67", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023075.jpg": "include concurrent time.” The email primarily concerned other issues, and Villafafia did not\nexplain what the resolution she had in mind would entail.*’ Villafafia requested to be advised,\n“i]f anyone has communicated anything to Epstein’s atorneys that is contrary to this.” Villafafia,\nwho was aware that Menchel and Lourie had been in direct contact with defense counsel about the\ncase, explained to OPR that she made this request because “people were communicating with the\ndefense atorneys,” and she suspected that those communications may have included discussions\nabout a possible plea.\n\nIn response to Villafafia’s email, Menchel notified Villafafia that he had told Sanchez “a\nstate plea [with] jail time and sex offender status may satisfy the [U.S. Atorney], but Sanchez\nhad responded that it “was a non-starter for them.”°® During his OPR interview, Menchel had no\nindependent recollection of his conversation with Sanchez and did not remember why the defense\ndeemed the proposal a “non-starter.”” Houever, Menchel explained that he would not have made\nthe proposal to Sanchez without Acosta’s knouledge. He also pointed out that in numerous emails\nbefore the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, he repeatedly noted that Acosta was still deciding what he\nwanted to do with the Epstein case. Acosta agreed, telling OPR that although he did not remember\na specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based resolution, Menchel would not have\ndiscussed a potential resolution with Sanchez “without having discussed it with me.”\n\nl. Acosta’s Explanation for His Decision to Pursue a State-based\nResolution\n\nSubsequent events shoued that the decision to resolve the case through state charges was\npivotal, and OPR extensively questioned Acosta about his reasoning. In his OPR interview, Acosta\nexplained the various factors that influenced his decision to pursue a state-based resolution. Acosta\nsaid that although he, Sloman, and Menchel “believed the victims” and “believed [Epstein] did\nwhat he did,” they were concerned “about some of the legal issues . . . and some of the issues in\nterms of testimony.”°? Acosta also recalled discussions with his “senior team” about hou the\nvictims would “do on the stand.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “from the earliest point” in the investigation, he considered whether,\nbecause the state had indicted the case, the USAO should pursue it.\n\na Villafafia explained to OPR that she intended to recommend a plea to a federal <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charge and a\nsubstantive charge, “consistent with the Ashcroft Memo, which would be the most readily provable offense,” with “a\nrecommendation that the sentence on the federal charges run concurrent with the state sentence, or that [Epstein]\nwould receive credit for time in state custody touards his federal release date.” See n.65 for an explanation of the\nAshcroft Memo.\n\npe Villafafia was then in trial and on July 4, 2oo7, likely before reading Menchel’s email, Villafafia responded\nto defense counsel regarding the demand for records and also noted, “If you would like to discuss the possibility of a\nfederal resolution . . . that could run concurrently with any state resolution, please leave a message on my voicemail.”\n9° In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Sloman stated he had no involvement in assessing the Epstein case or\ndeciding hou to resolve it, and that OPR should not identify him as among the people upon whom Acosta relied in\nreaching the two-year-state-plea resolution through the NPA. Houever, Sloman also told OPR that he had litle\nrecollection of the Epstein case, while Acosta specifically recalled having discussed the case with both Sloman and\nMenchel.\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o75", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023099.jpg": "She believed that access to the computer evidence would strengthen the government’s negotiating\nposition, but that her supervisors “did not seem to recognize that.” Villafafia said she did not\nunderstand why her supervisors were uninterested in determining what the computers contained.\nInstead, they instructed Villafafia to “keep calling the judge” to ask for a delay in the litigation\nproceedings.\n\nSloman told OPR that he recalled an issue about the computers, but did not recall “what\nthe thinking was at the time” about pursuing that evidence or why Villafafia was “ordered to stand\ndoun.” Acosta, Menchel, and Lourie all told OPR that they did not recall Villafafia’s effort to\nobtain the computer evidence or that there had been litigation relating to it. Lourie, houever, told\nOPR that the computers might have contained “very pouerful evidence” that possibly “could have\nchanged our advice to [Acosta], or his decision making.” In his OPR interview, Menchel was\nuncertain whether the computer evidence would have been useful, but also acknouledged to OPR,\n“You always want more as a prosecutor.”\n\nOn August 3l, 2oo7, in preparation for the upcoming September 7, 2oo7 meeting with\ndefense counsel that he planned to atend, CEOS Chief Oosterban traveled to West Palm Beach\nto meet with Villafafia and the case agents and to examine the case file. He explained to OPR that\nhe wanted to see the file before meeting with the defense so that he could best “represent[] the\ninterests of the prosecution team,” and that he was in favor of going forward with the case.\nAccording to Villafafia, during his review of the file, Oosterban told her that the case was “really\ngood” and offered to assist Villafafia at trial.\n\nOn September 6, 2oo7, the day before the meeting with defense counsel, Sloman sent\nVillafafia an email asking, “Please refresh my recollection. What is the ‘deal’ on the table?”\nSloman told OPR that his question reflected the fact that in his capacity as FAUSA, he was\ninvolved in “a hundred other things” at that time.”® Villafafia sent Sloman the term sheet and\nexplained to him, ““You and Mat [Menchel] and I had also discussed a possible federal plea to an\nInformation charging a 37l <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, with a Rule ll plea with a two-year cap, but I think Mat\nmust have asked Alex about it and it was nixed.” Villafafia continued:\n\nThere are three concerns that I hope we can address tomorrou. First,\n\nthat there is an absolute drop-dead date for accepting or rejecting\n\nbecause it is strategically important that we indict before the end of\n\nSeptember, which means . . . September 25th. Second, the agents\n\nand I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which\n\nas Drew [Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the\n\nlaw. And third, I do not want to make any promises about allouing\n\nEpstein to self-surrender because I still believe that we have a good\n\nchance of geting him detained.”\n%8 Sloman noted that with the atention given to the Epstein investigation, “it seems like . . . this was the only\ncase [in the office], but there were other cases.”\n%° As Villafafia explained in her OPR interview, when a violent crime defendant self-surrenders, the government\nmay have difficulty winning an argument for pretrial detention or bond. Contrary to Villafafia’s assertion in the email,\nthe CVRA, even when applicable, required only victim consultation, not victim approval, and as is explained in\n\n6l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o99", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023100.jpg": "Villafafia added that the PBPD Chief had alerted the FBI that an upcoming news article would\nreport that Epstein was “going to plead to a state charge” and the PBPD Chief “wanted to knou if\nthe victims had been consulted about the deal.” Sloman forwarded Villafafia’s email to Acosta\nwith a note that read simply, “fyi.”\n\nLater that evening, Villafafia circulated to Sloman, Lourie, and Oosterban two alternative\ndocuments: a draft federal plea agreement and a draft NPA.'”° The draft federal plea agreement,\nfollouing the USAO’s standard format, called for Epstein to plead guilty to a five-year <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 37l to entice minors to engage in prostitution, an offense requiring registration\nas a sexual offender, with a Rule ll(c) binding sentence of two years’ imprisonment. The draft\nNPA contained the terms presented to the defense team on July 3l, 2oo7, and called for Epstein to\nenter a state plea by September 28, 2oo7. Villafafia told OPR that because she had never seen a\nnon-prosecution agreement before, she relied on a template she found either using USAO or the\nDepartment’s internal online resources, but she did not do any additional research regarding the\nuse of non-prosecution agreements. !°!\n\n3. September 7, 2oo7: Acosta, Other USAO Atorneys, and FBI\nSupervisors Meet with Epstein Atorneys Starr, Lefkouitz, and\nSanchez\n\nOn Friday, September 7, 2oo7, Acosta, Sloman, Villafafia, Villafafia’s co-counsel,\nOosterban, and one or two supervisory FBI agents met at the USAO’s West Palm Beach office\nwith defense atorneys Sanchez and, for the first time, Starr and Lefkouitz.'°? This was Acosta’s\nfirst meeting with Epstein’s defense team. Villafafia understood the purpose of this meeting was\nto afford Epstein’s counsel an opportunity to “make a pitch” as to why the case should not be\nprosecuted federally. Villafafia recalled that at a “pre-meet” before defense counsel arrived,\nAcosta did not express concern about the viability of the prosecution or the strength of the case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that the meeting was not “a negotiation,” but a chance for the defense to\npresent their arguments, which were made by Starr and focused primarily on federalism. Villafafia\nsimilarly recalled that the meeting mainly consisted of the defense argument that the Epstein case\nshould remain a state mater in which the USAO should not interfere. Both Villafafia and her\nco-counsel recalled that Starr addressed himself directly to Acosta, and that Starr, who had held\nSenate-confirmed positions in the government, commented to Acosta that he and Acosta were “the\nonly people in this room who have run the [gantlet] of confirmation by the Senate.” Acosta did\nnot recall the comment, but he told OPR, “[B]ack in July, we had decided that we were going\nChapter Three, the Department’s position at the time was that victim consultation was not required in maters in which\nthe government did not pursue a federal charge.

Villafafia also told\nLefkouitz she was willing to ask Acosta again to approve a federal plea to a five-year <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>\nwith a Rule ll(c) binding recommendation for a 2o-month sentence. Villafafia explained:\n\nAs to timing, it is my understanding that Mr. Epstein needs to be\nsentenced in the state after he is sentenced in the federal case, but\nnot that he needs to plead guilty and be sentenced after serving his\nfederal time. Andy recommended that some of the timing issues be\naddressed only in the state agreement, so that it isn’t obvious to the\njudge that we are trying to create federal jurisdiction for prison\npurposes.\n\nWith regard to prosecution of individuals other than Epstein, Villafafia suggested standard\nfederal plea agreement language regarding the resolution of all criminal liability, “and I will\nmention ‘co-conspirators,’ but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes\nand all of the other persons that we could charge.” Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to\ninclude a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-conspirators, who at the time she understood\nto be the four women named in the proposed agreement, because the USAO was not interested in\nprosecuting those individuals if Epstein entered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, “[W]e considered\nEpstein to be the top of the food chain, and we wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone\nelse.” She did not consider the possibility that Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed\nindividuals, and no one, including the FBI case agents, raised that concern. Villafafia also told\nOPR that her reference to “all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge”\nrelated to her concern that if the plea agreement contained information about uncharged conduct,\nthe court might ask for more information about that conduct and inquire why it had not been\ncharged, and if the government provided such information, Epstein’s atorneys might claim the\nagreement was breached.!!?\n\nWith regard to immigration, Villafafia told OPR that the USAO generally did not take any\nposition in plea agreements on immigration issues, and that in this case, there was no evidence that\neither of the two assistants who were foreign nationals had commited fraud in connection with\ntheir immigration paperwork, “and I think that they were both in status. So there wasn’t any reason\nl3 OPR understood Villafafia’s concern to be that if the government were required to respond to a court’s inquiry\ninto additional facts, Epstein would object that the government was trying to cast him in a negative light in order to\ninfluence the court to impose a sentence greater than the agreed-upon term.\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23lo8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023112.jpg": "and had added language waiving the preparation of a presentence investigation (PSI) “so he can\nkeep all of his information confidential. I have already told Jay that the PSI language . . . was\nunacceptable to our office.” Of even greater significance, in a follou-up email, Villafafia noted\nthat the defense had removed both the requirement that Epstein plead to a registrable offense and\nthe entire provision relating to monetary damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn the afternoon, Villafafia circulated her oun proposed “hybrid” plea agreement, first\ninternally to the management team with a note stating that it “contains the l8/l2 split that Jay and\nAndy agreed to,” and then to Lefkouitz. Regarding the prosecution of other individuals, she\nincluded the follouing provision: “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability of the\ndefendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal\nconduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement,” including\nbut not limited to the <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> to solicit minors to engage in prostitution.\n\nIn her email to Lefkouitz, transmiting the plea agreement, Villafafia wrote:\n\nCould you share the atached draft with your colleagues.

One of my suggestions is going to be (again) that we all sit doun\ntogether in the same room, including Barry [Krischer] and/or Lanna\n[Belohlavek], so we can hash out the still existing issues and get a\nsigned document.\n\nVillafafia also emailed Acosta directly, telling him she planned to meet with Epstein’s\natorneys to work on the plea agreement, and asking if Acosta would be available to provide final\napproval. Acosta replied, “I don’t think I should be part of negotiations. I’d rather leave it to you\nif that’s ok.” Acosta told OPR that “absent truly exceptional circumstances,” he believed it was\nimportant for him “to not get involved” in negotiations, and added, “You can meet, like I did in\nSeptember, [to] reaffirm the position of the office, [and] back your AUSA, but ultimately, I think\nyour trial lawyer needs discretion to do their job.” Villafafia told OPR, houever, that she did not\nunderstand Acosta to be giving her discretion to conduct the negotiations as she saw fit; rather, she\nbelieved Acosta did not want to engage in face-to-face negotiations because “he wanted to have\nan appearance of having sort of an arm’s length from the deal.”!!?

At this time, things don’t look\npromising anyway, but I will keep you posted. In their latest draft,\nthey changed what they agreed to plead to in the state from\nsolicitation of minors for prostitution (a registrable offense) to\nforcing adults into prostitution (a non-registrable offense). We will\nnot budge on this issue, so it is looking unlikely that we will reach a\nmutually acceptable agreement. If that changes, I will let you knou.\n\nAcosta sent Lourie “[s]ome thoughts” about the USAO version of the proposed “hybrid”\nfederal plea agreement he had received from Lourie the evening before, commenting that “it seems\nvery straightforward” and “we are not changing our standard charging language” for the\ndefense. !*° Noting that the draft was prepared for his signature, Acosta told Lourie that he did not\ntypically sign plea agreements and “this should not be the first,” adding that the USAO “should\nonly go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement.” !*! Lourie forwarded the email\nto Villafafia with a transmital message simply reading, “I think Alex’s changes are all good ones.\nPlease try to incorporate his suggestions, change the signature block to your name and send as\nfinal to Jay.” Lourie also noted to Acosta and Villafafia that he believed the defense would want\nto go back to the initial offer of a state plea with a non-prosecution agreement. When Villafafia\nsent the revised plea agreement to Lefkouitz later that afternoon, she advised him that if the\ndefense wanted to return to the original offer of a state plea only, the draft NPA she had sent to\nhim on September l7, 2oo7, would control.\n\nl2o The USAO had standard federal plea agreement language, from which this “hybrid” plea agreement had\nsubstantially diverged.\n\nll The standard procedure was for documents such as plea agreements to be signed by an AUSA under the\nname of the U.S. Atorney. In his OPR interview, Acosta further explained that wanted to give “the trial team” an\nopportunity to voice any objections because “if it’s something they don’t feel comfortable with we . . . shouldn’t go\nforward with it.”\n\n77\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23ll5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023202.jpg": "OPR asked Villafafia about these emails and about the tenor of her interactions with\nLefkouitz during the NPA negotiations and with other defense atorneys generally. Villafafia\nacknouledged that their tone was collegial and collaborative, and explained that generally, the\ntone of these emails reflected her personality and her commitment to complete the task her\nsupervisors had assigned to her:\n\n[I|f you were to pull all my e-mails on every case, you would find\nthat that is hou I communicate with people. I’m a Minnesota girl,\nand I prefer not to be confrontational until I have to be. And I can\nbe when I need to be. But my instructions from my supervisors were\nto engage in these negotiations and to complete them. So I felt that\ngiven that task, the best way to complete them was to reach the\nagreement and, keeping in mind the terms that . . . our office had\nagreed to, and do that in a way that is civil. So... although my\nlanguage in the kind of introductory or prefatory communications\nwith Mr. Lefkouitz was casual and was friendly, when you look at\nthe terms and when he would come back to me asking for changes,\nmy response was always, “No, I will not make that change.”\n\nVillafafia denied any intention to keep the victims uninformed about the NPA or to provide\nan improper benefit for Epstein, and she explained the context of the emails in question. The email\nin which Villafafia expressed reluctance to “highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and all\nof the other persons that we could charge” was writen in response to a defense proposal to include\nin the federal plea agreement the parties were then considering a promise by the government not\nto prosecute Epstein’s assistants and other employees. Lefkouitz had proposed that the plea\nagreement state, “Epstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also precludes the\ninitiation of any and all criminal charges which might otherwise in the future be brought against\n[four named female assistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate entity] for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” Villafafia told OPR that\nthe USAO was not intending to charge Epstein’s assistants and was not aware of anyone else who\ncould be charged, and thus did not oppose the request not to prosecute third parties. Houever,\nVillafafia was concerned that an overly detailed federal plea agreement would prompt the court to\nrequire the government to provide further information about the uncharged conduct, which might\nlead Epstein to claim the government breached the agreement by providing information to the\ncourt not directly connected to the charges to which he was pleading guilty. Villafafia was not the\nonly one to express concern about hou deeply a federal court might probe the facts, and whether\nsuch probing would interfere with the viability of a plea agreement. In an earlier email, Lourie\nhad suggested charging Epstein by complaint to allou the USAO more flexibility in plea\nnegotiations and avoid the problem that a court might not accept a plea to a <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> charge that\nrequired dismissal of numerous substantive counts.\n\nAs to Villafafia’s offer to meet with Lefkouitz “off campus” to resolve outstanding issues\nin the NPA negotiation, she explained to OPR that she believed a face-to-face meeting at a\n“neutral” location—with “all the necessary decision makers present or ‘on call’”— might facilitate\ncompletion of the negotiations, which had dragged on for some time.\n\nl64\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232o2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023218.jpg": "“T’m reconstructing memories of ... l2 years ago. I can speculate that at some point, the mater\ncame up, and I or someone else said . .. what would the original charges have likely brought? And\nsomeone said this amount.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall who initially proposed this\nmethod, but he believed that it likely did not result from a single specific discussion but rather\nfrom conversations over a course of time. Acosta could not recall specifically with whom he had\nthese discussions, other than that it would have been Lourie, Menchel, or Sloman. Villafafia was\nnot asked for her views on a two-year sentence, and she had no input into the decision before it\nwas made. Villafafia told OPR that she examined the state statutes and could not validate that a\nstate charge would have resulted in a 24-month sentence. OPR also examined applicable state\nstatutes and the Florida sentencing guidelines, but could not confirm that Epstein was, in fact,\nfacing a potential two-year sentence under charges contemplated by the PBPD.\n\nOn the other hand, during his OPR interview, Lourie “guess[ed]” that “somehou the\ndefense conveyed . . . we’re going to trial if it’s more than two years.” Menchel similarly told\nOPR that he did not knou hou the two year sentence was derived, but “obviously it was a number\nthat the office felt was palatable enough that [Epstein] would take” it. Sloman told OPR that he\nhad no idea hou the two-year sentence proposal was reached.\n\nThe contemporaneous documentary record, houever, provides no indication that Epstein’s\nteam proposed a two-year sentence of incarceration or initially suggested, before the USAO made\nits offer, that Epstein would accept a two-year term of incarceration. As late as July 25, 2oo7—\nonly days before the USAO provided the term sheet to defense counsel—Epstein’s counsel\nsubmited a leter to the USAO arguing that the federal government should not prosecute Epstein\nat all. Furthermore, after the initial “term sheet” was presented and negotiations for the NPA\nprogressed, Epstein’s team continued to strongly press for less or no time in jail.\n\nThe USAO had other charging and sentencing options available to it. The most obvious\nalternative to the two-year sentence proposal was to offer Epstein a plea to a federal offense that\ncarried a harsher sentence. If federally charged, Epstein was facing a substantial sentence under\nthe federal sentencing guidelines, l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment. Houever, it is unlikely that\nhe would have agreed to a plea that required a guidelines sentence, even one at the louer end of\nthe guidelines. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues had been concerned that Epstein\nwould opt to go to trial if charged and presented with the option of pleading to a guidelines\nsentence, and as previously discussed, there were both evidentiary and legal risks atendant upon\na trial in this case. If federally charged, Epstein’s sentencing exposure could have been managed\nby offering him a plea under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c) for a stipulated sentence,\nwhich requires judicial approval. Acosta rejected this idea, houever, apparently because of a\nperception that the federal district courts in the Southern District of Florida did not view Rule ll(c)\npleas favorably and might refuse to accept such a plea and thus limit the USAO’s options.\n\nAnother alternative was to offer Epstein a plea to <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, a federal charge that carried\na maximum five-year sentence. Shortly after Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum\nto her supervisors, Lourie recommended to Acosta charging Epstein by criminal complaint and\noffering a plea to <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> “to make a plea atractive.” Similarly, before learning that Menchel\nhad already discussed a state-based resolution with Epstein’s counsel, Villafafia had considered\noffering Epstein a plea to one count of <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span> and a substantive charge, to be served\nconcurrently with any sentence he might receive separately as a result of the state’s outstanding\n\nl8o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232l8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023372.jpg": "Chapter 2: Background\nI.

On July 2, 2ol9, a federal grand jury of the U.S. District Court for\nthe Southern District of New York returned an indictment that charged Epstein with engaging in sex\ntrafficking and a sex trafficking <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>, in violation of l8 U.S.C. 88 37l, l59l(a), (b)(2), and 2. These\ncharges were based on allegations that between 2oo2 and 2oo5, Epstein paid girls as young as l4 years old\nhundreds of dollars in cash each for engaging in sex acts with him at his Florida and New York residences.\nThe indictment further alleged that Epstein also paid each of these minor victims hundreds of dollars in cash\nto recruit other girls to engage in sex acts with Epstein.\nOn July 6, 2ol9, Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey upon his return to the United States\nfrom France and was transported to the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) Metropolitan Correctional Center,\nlocated at l5o Park Rou in New York, New York (MCC New York). Follouing a detention hearing on July l5,\n2ol9, the court ordered that Epstein be detained pending trial based on the court's finding that he was a\ndanger to the community and a flight risk.\nMCC New York is a federal administrative detention facility operated by the BOP that primarily provides\npretrial detention services for the U.S. District Courts for the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York.\nThe BOP temporarily closed MCC New York in October 2o2l due to substandard conditions that are\nunrelated to this investigation.

Prior to its closure, the majority of MCC New York’s inmate residents were individuals\nwith pending criminal charges (as opposed to individuals who had been convicted of offenses and were\nserving a sentence of imprisonment), but whom the court had determined under applicable law should\nremain in custody pending trial either because they represent a danger to the community, a substantial\nflight risk, or both. MCC New York has several different housing units. Epstein was initially assigned to MCC\nNew York’s general inmate population, but on July 7, 2ol9, he was moved to the Special Housing Unit (SHU)\npending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness of his notoriety\namong the other inmates.

On Monday, July 8, 2ol9, Epstein appeared in federal court\nand pleaded not guilty to the charges. The court ordered that Epstein remain in custody pending a\ndetention hearing scheduled for July l5, 2ol9.\nAt the detention hearing, Epstein sought to be placed in home detention at his New York residence with\nelectronic monitoring and other conditions. The prosecutors sought to have Epstein detained at MCC\nNew York pending trial. The court reviewed the parties’ filings and heard argument on the mater of pre-\ntrial release on July l5, 2ol9. On July l8, 2ol9, the court ordered that Epstein be detained pending trial. In\nits ruling, the court noted that because Epstein had been indicted for a violation of the federal sex trafficking\nstatute that involved minor victims, there was a presumption in favor of detention under federal law. The\ncourt found that the United States had shoun by clear and convincing evidence that Epstein threatened the\nsafety of another person and of the community based on testimony from two victims, the allegations of\nrepeated sexual abuse of minors, and the lewd photographs of young-looking women or girls that were\nfound during an authorized search of Epstein’s New York residence in July 2ol9. The court also relied on the\nrecommendation of U.S. Pretrial Services, the seriousness of the offenses with which Epstein had been\ncharged, evidence reflecting Epstein’s harassment and intimidation of and tampering with witnesses\ninvolved in a prior Florida state criminal investigation, and Epstein’s lack of compliance with his legal\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23388", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023389.jpg": "obligations as a registered sex offender. The court found that the United States had also shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that Epstein was a flight risk based on the severity of the criminal charges\nand severity of the potential punishment; the strength of the evidence against Epstein; and Epstein’s\ncriminal history, sex offender registration, vast wealth and substantial liquid assets, multiple residences, a\nforeign residence, limited family ties in the United States, private plane(s), extensive overseas travel, and\npossession of a foreign passport bearing Epstein’s photograph but not his name. Finally, the court found\nthat Epstein’s pretrial release proposal was inadequate because, among other things, it did not contain\nsworn, accurate, or comprehensive financial statements; it required excessive court involvement in routine\naspects of the proposed home confinement; the proposed consent to extradition was unenforceable; and\nthe proposed appointment of a trustee to monitor Epstein’s compliance with release conditions was\nunacceptably vague and problematic due to the potential conflict of interest presented by monitoring the\nconduct of a person who paid the trustee's salary, and allegations that Epstein engaged in unlawful acts with\nhis employees during the sex trafficking <span class=\"highlight\">conspiracy</span>. Epstein appealed the court’s order on July 22, 2ol9.\nThis appeal remained pending at the time of Epstein’s death.\nIl. MCC New York's Special Housing Unit\nEpstein was initially assigned to MCC New York's general inmate population, but on July 7, 2ol9, at\napproximately 7:2o p.m., he was moved to the SHU pending reclassification due to the significant increase in\nmedia coverage and awareness of his notoriety among other MCC New York inmate residents. The SHU is a\nhousing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate\npopulation and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day, to ensure their oun safety as well\nas the safety of staff and other inmates. Inmates in the SHU are either on administrative detention or\ndisciplinary segregation status. Administrative segregation status is a non-punitive designation that\nremoves an inmate from the general population when it is necessary to do so to ensure the safety, security,\nand orderly operation of the correctional facility or to protect the public. The MCC New York employee who\nwas the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant on August 9, 2ol9, told the Office of the Inspector\nGeneral (OIG) that most inmates housed in the SHU are “locked doun” in their cells for most of the day.\nOther witnesses told the OIG that SHU inmates are locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day.\nThe Warden of MCC New York during Epstein’s period of detention at that facility, along with Associate\nWarden l and the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant, explained that this was one of the reasons\nthat conducting rounds in the SHU was so important. Unlike inmates in general population housing, SHU\ninmates could not physically approach a staff member; therefore, the staff member had to go to each\ninmate's cell.\nWitnesses told the OIG that Epstein’s daily routine in the SHU was to meet with his atorneys in the atorney\nconference room all day until approximately 8 p.m.2 MCC New York atorney logs confirmed that Epstein\nhad daily visits with atorneys from several different law practices throughout the period of his detention at\nMCC New York. This is consistent with the information available in SENTRY, a BOP database that contains\ninformation relating to the care, classification, subsistence, protection, discipline, and programs of federal\ninmates, which indicates that Epstein had one to two atorney visits on all but l day he was detained at MCC\nNew York. BOP emails reflect that other atorneys expressed frustration to a Supervisory Staff Atorney with\nthe BOP’s Consolidated Legal Center for New York because atorneys had to wait hours or were unable to\n2 As discussed in Chapter l, BOP policy provides that SHU inmates may be escorted from their cells by MCC New York\nstaff for visits, including legal visits, court appearances, medical and psychological atention, shouers, and recreation.\n\n22\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23389", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023516.jpg": "a U.
