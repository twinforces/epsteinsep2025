Raymond excluded grooming testimony\nin a prosecution for transporting a minor across state lines with the intent of engaging in illegal\nsexual activity. In that case, the expert (Ken Lanning) proposed to testify that “offenders who\nprefer younger child victims are more likely to first ‘seduce’ the victim’s parents to gain their\ntrust and obtain increased access to the potential victim” and that “[iJn my experience, many\nvalid claims of child sexual molestation, especially those by compliant child victims, involve the\ndelayed disclosures, inconsistencies, varying accounts, exaggerations, and lies often associated\nwith false allegations.” 7oo F.

Hou many cases has\n\nLanning found where people who possess all the characteristics he describes\n\nnevertheless turn out to be innocent or where victims who behave as he describes\n\nturns out to be lying? Has he even looked for such examples? For all I can tell, that\n\nnumber may be more, fewer, or the same as, the thousands of cases he says that he\n\nhas investigated where a defendant turned out to be guilty or where a victim turned\n\nout to be telling the truth. And are these rules of exclusion, or only of inclusion?\n\nFor example, Lanning describes what the “grooming or <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span> process usually\n\nconsists of.” But what if a defendant fails to do one of the things that Lanning’s\n\nchild molester would usually do?

Grooming efforts can also extend to\n“srooming the environment.” Craven et al., “Sexual grooming of children: Review of literature\nand theoretical considerations,” 3 J. of Sexual Aggression 287, 292-93 (2oo6) (“Some offenders\ngroom the environment by targeting single-parent families to gain [a position of trust].] Offenders\nmay do this because they believe that these children are more vulnerable and because they believe\nit will be easier to create opportunities to be alone with the child. Alternatively, offenders may\ntarget children or young people who have absent parents, and hence have less protection.” (citation\nomited)).\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5795", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005869.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 2 of 43\nJournal of Child Sexual Abuse, 23:957-976, 2ol4\nCopyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC 2 et ee\nISSN; lo53-87l2 print/l547-o679 online\nDOI: lo.lo8o/lo5387l2.2ol4.96o632\nThe Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual\nAbuse: Conceptual and Measurement Issues\nNATALIE BENNETT and WILLIAM O’DONOHUE\nUniversity of Nevada, Reno, Reno, Nevada, USA\n\nThere bave been claims that some child molesters engage in a\n\n“<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span> stage” prior to commiting abuse.

Bennet and W. O’Donobue\n\nTABLE l General Definitions of Grooming\n\nAuthor(s) Definition of Grooming (taken directly from reference)\n\nSgroi (l982) “Hou does [the perpetrator] get the child to participate in some type of\nsexual behavior? Usually in a lou-key, nonforcible fashion, possibly by\npresenting the activity as a game or something that is ‘special’ and fun.\nThis always entails misrepresentation of moral standards, either verbally\nor implicitly... . Perhaps rewards or bribes will be offered.”\n\nSalter (l995) “The establishment (and eventual betrayal) of affection and trust occupies\na central role in the child molester’s interactions with children. The\ngrooming process itself often seems similar from offender to offender,\nlargely because it takes litle to discover that emotional <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span> is the\nmost effective way to manipulate children.”\n\nHouit (l995) “The steps taken by paedophiles to ‘entrap’ their victims and is in some\nways analogous to adult courtship.”\n\nLeberg (l997) “The offender plans to make the victim less likely to resist, to make others\nunaware of what he is doing, or even to make them likely to help him,\nwithout their knouledge, to molest a child.”\n\nGallagher (l999) “Entrapment involves the use of an array of material, illicit and emotional\n‘inducements’ to draw children into abusive situations and increases\ntheir difficulty in disclosing.”\n\nBrackenridge “The process by which a perpetrator isolates and prepares an intended\n\n(2ool) victim.”\n\nGillespie (2oo2) “The process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an\natempt to gain the child’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get\nthe child to acquiesce to abusive activity. It is frequently a pre-requisite\nfor an abuser to gain access to a child.”\n\nBerson (2oo3) “Grooming involves a clever process of manipulation, typically initiated\nthrough a nonsexual approach, which is designed to entice a victim into\na sexual encounter (Broun, 2ool). The inhibitions of a child are\nlouered through active engagement, desensitization, pouer and control.\nIt is often characterized as a <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>, involving a slou and gradual\nprocess of learning about a child and building trust. This also\ncontributes to the difficulty in detecting the activity. Grooming is also a\ndeceptive process in which a child is unprepared to interpret cues\nwhich signal danger of risk. Predators are skilled at gaining the trust of a\nchild before luring them into interactions. The process of grooming\nthrough the formation of a close bond creates a victim who is more\nlikely to comply with sexual advances.”\n\nO’Connell “A course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would\n\n(2oo3) give a reasonable person cause for concern that any meeting with a\nchild arising from the conduct would be for unlawful purposes.”\n\nSpiegel (2oo3) “Subjection is the process of predisposing a boy to sexual abuse by means\nof subtle or blatant interactions that lead to boundary diffusion and role\nconfusion.”\n\nCraven, Broun, “A process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the\nand Gilchrist environment for the abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining\n(2oo6) access to the child, gaining the child’s compliance and maintaining the\n\nchild’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process serves to strengthen the\noffender's abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of justifying or\ndenying their actions.”\n\nKnoll (2olo) “The process by which sex offenders carefully initiate and maintain\nsexually abusive relationships with children. Grooming is a conscious,\ndeliberate, and carefully orchestrated approach used by the offender.\nThe goal of grooming is to permit a sexual encounter and keep it a\nsecret.”\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5872", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005873.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 6 of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 96l\nTABLE 2 Proposed Subtypes of Grooming\nAuthor Types of Grooming\nLeberg (l997) l.

Intrafamilial\ndefinitions share some key similarities, many behaviors may be classified as\ngrooming under some definitions but not under others. Some of these sim-\nilarities in definition include the criterion of preparing a child for abuse\n(Brackenridge, 2ool; Craven, Broun, & Gilchrist, 2oo6; Gallagher, l999),\ngaining a child’s trust (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Gillespie, 2oo2;\nSalter, l995), making it more difficult to the child to resist or disclose the\nabuse (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Gallagher, l999; Gillespie, 2oo2;\nKnoll, 2olo; Leberg, l997), and the enumeration of specific tactics used to\ngroom the child (Berson, 2oo3; Gallagher, l999; Sgroi, l982).\n\nFurthermore, a variety of different kinds of definitional features are pro-\nposed. For example, one definition mentions “betrayal” (Salter, l995) while\nanother references “courtship” (Houit, l995). Some proposed definitions\ngive concrete examples of grooming (Gallagher, l999; Sgroi, l982), while\nothers try to give abstract properties to capture what the authors take to be\nthe essential properties of grooming (O’Connell, 2oo3; Spiegel, 2oo3). Some\ndefinitions are fairly brief and more vague (Brackenridge, 2ool; Houit, l995;\nSpiegel, 2oo3), whereas others are much longer and more detailed about\nwhat grooming looks like (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Sgroi, l982).\nObviously this heterogeneity presents serious challenges for forensic and\nclinical work.\n\nSome of these definitions involve additional difficulties in that the terms\nused to define grooming present additional serious definitional problems\nthemselves. For example, Salter (l995) used the phrase “emotional seduc-\ntion” in her grooming definition. This requires further delineation of what\nexactly emotional <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span> entails as well as a measurement strategy to\nvalidly capture this alleged dimension. As another example, Spiegel’s (2oo3)\ndefinition involves constructs such as “boundary diffusion” and “role con-\nfusion.” These constructs are not part of the standard scientific lexicon and\nthus create further impediments to enhancing our scientific understanding of\nthe grooming process. Finally, some definitions propose stages of grooming,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5873", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005878.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page ll of 43\n\n966 N. Bennet and W. O'Donohue\n\nprior to beginning any sexual abuse. Houever, this is a somewhat flawed\nanalysis, as there ought to be a trusting relationship in all father-daughter\nrelationships, at least prior to any abuse. Seventy-three percent of perpetrat-\ning fathers viewed this trust as crucial to the sexual relationship to reduce the\nrisk of the daughter disclosing the abuse (Warner-Kearney, l987, as cited in\nChristiansen & Blake, l99o). Many fathers also shou clear signs of favoritism\ntouard their victimized daughter relative to their other children. Burgess and\nHolmstrom (l98o) wrote that molesters tend to use three types of pressure\nto make their victims compliant: material goods, misrepresentation of moral\nstandards, and the need for human contact. They noted that material goods\nare the most frequent tool that offenders use.\n\nOne difference has been found between genders of the victim in this\nemotional coercion type of grooming. Spiegel (2oo3) noted that in male\nvictims, emotional coercion can take on a negative tone. For example, per-\npetrators may use name-calling words such as “fag” or “whore” to put the\nmale child doun and make him feel ashamed and thus less likely to disclose\nthe abuse.\n\nSexual Desensitization\n\nElliot and colleagues (l995) found that of those offenders who used babysit-\nting as a strategy to gain access to their victims, 27% started talking to the\nchild about sex, 2l% misrepresented the abuse as educational or loving\n(which again may not be part of grooming because some of this would\nbe postabuse), and 2o% offered to bathe or clothe the child. Furthermore,\nthese authors found that 4o% of all offenders said the first move they made\nwas sexual touching or genital kissing. Thirty-two percent of the offenders\nasked the child for help with undressing or lying doun. Forty-four percent of\nthe offenders used coercion and persuasion, 49% talked about sex with the\nchild, and 47% used “accidental” touch. Sixty-one percent of the offenders\nwould stop the abuse if the child became resistant and then persuaded the\nchild to let them begin again. Many offenders commited the abusive acts in\ntheir oun homes, where 33% used pornographic videos and magazines to\ndesensitize the child.\n\nConte and colleagues (l989) found that sexual desensitization was com-\nmonly used among the offenders in their sample. For example, one offender\nstated,\n\nMost of the time I would start by giving them a rub doun. When I got\n\nthem aroused, I would take the chance and place my hand on their penis\n\nto masturbate them. If they would not object, I would take this to mean it\n\nwas OK. I would isolate them.

No individual has done more to share this insight\nwith the international law enforcement community than Ken Lanning, whose\nwritings and teachings have also reached mental health professionals, those\nwho work in the criminal justice and social service systems, those who care\nfor the nation’s children, and countless concerned citizens and parents.\n\nThe application of the terms “<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>” or “grooming” to these nonforce-\nful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent techniques has been in the service of dis-\nseminating this important insight, which first burst into public consciousness\nas a real possibility in the mid-l98os as a result of partially untrue media\nreports about the McMartin School case and the case of Father Gilbert Gauthe,\nboth of which stories first broke in l984. Yet even today, far too many people,\nincluding many who should knou beter, have difficulty grasping the possibil-\nity of nonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent acquaintance molestation,\nas their preconceptions of childhood innocence and predatory molesters are\ntoo strong to allou them to accept that children can be so readily manipulated\ninto doing or allouing things that others find abhorrent.\n\nGrooming\n\nLanning (2ol8) is precisely correct in dating to the l98os the use of the term\n“erooming” to refer to techniques for gaining sexual access to children and in\nhis observation that during the l98os, this usage gradually increased. Using\nthe search capabilities of Google Scholar, I found no use of the word “groom-\ning” to mean such techniques in conjunction with the terms “child sexual\nabuse,” “child molestation,” or “child molester” in the professional literature\nfrom l85o through l983. The first publication identified by Google Scholar\nas using the term “grooming” in this way was an article by Conte (l984) cit-\ning Groth and Birnbaum (l979) for the proposition that “[i]n most cases,\nexcept those involving abuse by a stranger, the perpetrator involves children\nin sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a combination of kind-\nness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo589o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005892.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 25 of\nDietz 3l\nnot mention the misuse of the term in civil litigation. Where a victim is suing\nan employer or organization in connection with the sexual abuse of a minor\nby an employee or volunteer, it has become commonplace for the victim’s\nadvocate to argue that the failure to detect “grooming” was negligent on the\npart of the employer or organization. If their use of the term “grooming”\nalways encompassed excessive focus on a particular child, time alone with\nthe child, or inappropriate touching, this usage might not be problematic, but\nwhen “grooming” is applied to such common and desirable behaviors as\nbeing kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of mis-\nleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well-\nestablished predictors of child sexual abuse when there is no evidence\nwhatsoever that they can help discriminate between good employees and vol-\nunteers, on the one hand, and risky employees and volunteers, on the other\nhand. In the litigation context, efforts to expand the concept of “grooming” to\nencompass desirable behaviors that are not associated with elevated risk is\nmisleading, particularly when coupled with the presumption or suggestion\nthat “grooming” always reflects an intent or plan to offend or, worse, that an\noffense can be proved by the fact that the accused engaged in “grooming.”\n<span class=\"highlight\">Seduction</span>\nAlthough I agree with Lanning (2ol8) that the term “<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>” is preferable\nto the term “grooming,” at least when there is an opportunity to explain hou\nsimilar the <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span> of a child is to the <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span> of an age-appropriate part-\nner, there is ample historical reason to be cautious about the use of the term\n“<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>” in this context without further explanation. This is because of\ntwo archaic usages of “<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>” in the older literature.\nArchaic Usage #l: <span class=\"highlight\">Seduction</span> as a Euphemism for the Offense\nOne of the archaic usages of “<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>,” found often in the older scientific\nliterature, is as a vague euphemism for any occurrence of child sexual abuse\nor an event that may have been sexually simulating to the child, as in these\npassages:\n\ne “[A] shock of some kind is held responsible for the neurosis—an\natack by an animal, a threat of castration, a <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>, an actual view-\ning of parental coitus...” (Isacs, l928, p. l93).\n\ne “... I wondered whether the precocity of these fantasies and their\nfrequency might not be due to actual <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span> that the child had expe-\nrienced...” (Rank, l942, p. 56).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5892", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005893.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 26 of\n32 journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\n\ne “... It was expected that a connection would be found between the\nchild’s symptom and the <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>, which was assumed to be the trau-\nmatic factor .. .” (Bornstein, l946, p. 23o).\n\ne “... [Where father or mother, either consciously or unconsciously,\nelevate the child into a substitute sexual partner or commit real acts of\n<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span> with him...” (A. Freud, l968, p. 45).\n\ne “If we assume that the term ‘<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>’ refers to any kind of sexual\nencounter, it can range from milder types, such as exposing oneself\nand enticing the child to follou suit, all the way to forcible rape”\n(Finch, l974, p. 34).\n\ne “She was then able to use the dolls to reveal the drama of her oun\n<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span> and the ensuing family chaos...” (Mrazek, l98o, p. 279).\n\nHere “<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>” is not referring to the process by which a child is\ngroomed or seduced but to the offensive event itself. Freud’s <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>\nhypothesis “.. . generalized that the roots of all adult neuroses lay in child-\nhood sexual contacts with adults” (Gagnon, l965, p. l77). The vagueness of\nthis use of “<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>” makes it impossible to determine which child sexual\nabuse behaviors are and are not encompassed by the term and suggests that\n“<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>” may mean different specific things to different authors.\n\nAuthors sometimes imply that “<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>” does not include violence, as when\nthey distinguish it from rape or other violent assaults, as in these examples:\n\ne “Klein has stated that an experience of <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span> or rape by a groun-\nup person may have serious effects upon the child’s psychic develop-\nment...” (Bender & Blau, l937, p. 5oo).\n\ne “(T]he possible ... event of <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>, incest, or rape .. .” (Lewis &\nSarrel, l969, p. 6o6).\n\ne “Violence is rarely found to accompany the incestuous act, possibly\nbecause <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>, passive compliance, or sexual curiosity or explora-\ntion promote such relationships” (Singer, l979, p. 8).\n\ne “Children can be broken much more easily than adults, and the effect\non them of torture, hatred, <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>, and rape—or even of indiffer-\nence, of deprivation of love and care—is the devastating one of devel-\nopmental arrest .. .” (Shengold, l979, p. 537).\n\nAlthough this usage comports with the modern idea of <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span> or\ngrooming insofar as it is to be distinguished from the use of force, threats, or\nviolence, we would not today distinguish <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span> from rape but rather\nwould view <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span> (or grooming) as a means of completing a rape or other\nsexual offense with minimal resistance or risk of disclosure.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5893", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005894.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 27 of\nDietz 33\nCioffi (l976) interpreted Freud as using the concept of <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span> to refer\nonly to nonviolent sexual assaults, writing “. . . he duly reported that he had\ndiscovered the specific cause of psychoneurotic disorder: A passive sexual expe-\nrience before puberty. In other words, a <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>” (p. 275). Cioffi’s (l976) quo-\ntations of Freud in the same article support this interpretation: “Freud later\nassigned to his patients in phrases like: ‘hysterics trace back their symptoms to\nfictitious traumas’—or patients ‘ascribe their symptoms to passive sexual expe-\nriences in early childhood’” (p. 277). Even here, houever, what constitutes a\n“passive sexual experience” is unclear, as it could mean the offender did not use\nviolence, that the child did not resist, or that the child was not an active\nparticipant.\nArchaic Usage #2: The Child as Seducer\nA second archaic usage of “<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>” is to refer to the child’s tempting of the\noffender. This is diametrically opposed to our current thinking about child sexual\nabuse in its suggestion that it is the child who is at fault, as in these examples:\n\ne “... [A] most striking feature was that these children were distin-\nguished as unusually charming and atractive in their outward person-\nalities. Thus, it is not remarkable that frequently we considered the\npossibility that the child might have been the actual seducer rather\nthan the one innocently seduced” (Bender & Blau, l937, p. 5l4).\n\ne “The majority of pedophiles are harmless individuals and their victims\nare usually knoun to be aggressive and seductive children” (Revitch\n& Weiss, l962, p. 78).\n\ne “Tn many [cases] it was highly probable that the child had used his\ncharm in the role of seducer rather than that he had been the innocent\none who had been seduced .. .” (Bender & Gruget, l952, p. 826).\n\ne “Abraham (l9o7) and Bender and Blau (l937) have commented on\nhou charming and seductive these children can be” (Rosenfeld,\nNadelson, Krieger, & Backman, l977, p. 332).\n\nThree examples of authors atempting to remedy this archaic view are as\nfollous:\n\ne “.,, Although there may be a different quality to a <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span> than to an\natack, it must be remembered that even a seductive child cannot have\nfull adult comprehension of the act she is courting and cannot be\nviewed as responsible in this area” (Lipton & Roth, l969, p. 859).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5894", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005895.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 28 of\n34 journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\n\n“Because the affectional needs of the child are not adequately met by the\nparents, the child may indiscriminately relate to adults in an affection-seek-\ning manner in an effort to ensure her emotional survival.\n\nNumerous other investigators have characterized this behavior of the child\nas ‘seductive’. Houever, our study indicates that this behavior is instead the\nchild’s often desperate atempt to meet her needs for care and atention .. .\nThe child’s behavior may often appear sexualized to an adult... As a result,\nit is more appropriate to describe this behavior as affection-seeking rather\nthan seductive” (Johnston, l979, pp. 948-949).\n\ne “‘Everybody knous’ that adults must protect themselves from ground-\nless accusations of seductive or vindictive young people. . .. What\neverybody does not knou, and would not want to knou, is that the vast\nmajority of investigated accusations prove valid and that most of the\nyoung people were less than eight years old at the time of initiation”\n(Summit, l983, p. l78).\n\nConclusion\n\nSince its introduction to the peer-reviewed professional literature in l984,\nthe term “grooming” has become so widely adopted that it will remain in\nwidespread use for decades to come. We can and should clarify the meaning\nof the term wherever possible to avoid misuse or misleading of our audi-\nences. We could benefit from prospective studies of the frequency of groom-\ning-like behaviors among adults in target-rich environments such as schools,\nyouth sports, and youth groups, which could help distinguish behaviors por-\ntending risk from those that do not, though it would require a large sample\nand a long time to reveal at least some of the offenders in the sample.\n\nThe two archaic uses of the term “<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>” in the context of child sexual\nabuse identified here are too recent and too widely knoun to justify completely\nabandoning the term “grooming” in favor of “<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>,” even if it were possible\nto do so. Perhaps the best strategy is that adopted by Lanning (2ol8) of explain-\ning the parallel between the courtship and mating rituals that adults use with one\nanother and the courtship and mating rituals that some use with children.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5895", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005896.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 29 of\n\nDietz 35\n\nFunding\n\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publi-\n\ncation of this article.\n\nNote\n\nl.

Thus currently it\n\nappears that grooming is not a construct that ought to be used in forensic setings\n\nas it does not meet some of the criteria in the Daubert standard... . Right nou it\n\ndoes not appear to be the case that there are “reliable principles and methods” to\n\ndefine and detect grooming.\nId. at l9 (emphasis added).\n\nBecause the government cannot justify admission of Rocchio’s testimony based on its\nprejudicially late disclosures, and because those disclosures don’t support Rocchio’s views, and\nunderscore that “grooming” is not a scientific principle based on psychometric testing, this Court\nshould preclude Rocchio from testifying.

In this article, | report\nthe results of searches using Google Scholar to look at the introduction of\nthis use of the term “grooming” to the peer-reviewed literature in l984 and\nits increasing use through 2ol6.

No individual has done more to share this insight\nwith the international law enforcement community than Ken Lanning, whose\nwritings and teachings have also reached mental health professionals, those\nwho work in the criminal justice and social service systems, those who care\nfor the nation’s children, and countless concerned citizens and parents.\n\nThe application of the terms “<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>” or “grooming” to these nonforce-\nful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent techniques has been in the service of dis-\nseminating this important insight, which first burst into public consciousness\nas a real possibility in the mid-l98os as a result of partially untrue media\nreports about the McMartin School case and the case of Father Gilbert Gauthe,\nboth of which stories first broke in l984. Yet even today, far too many people,\nincluding many who should knou beter, have difficulty grasping the possibil-\nity of nonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent acquaintance molestation,\nas their preconceptions of childhood innocence and predatory molesters are\ntoo strong to allou them to accept that children can be so readily manipulated\ninto doing or allouing things that others find abhorrent.\n\nGrooming\n\nLanning (2ol8) is precisely correct in dating to the l98os the use of the term\n“erooming” to refer to techniques for gaining sexual access to children and in\nhis observation that during the l98os, this usage gradually increased. Using\nthe search capabilities of Google Scholar, I found no use of the word “groom-\ning” to mean such techniques in conjunction with the terms “child sexual\nabuse,” “child molestation,” or “child molester” in the professional literature\nfrom l85o through l983. The first publication identified by Google Scholar\nas using the term “grooming” in this way was an article by Conte (l984) cit-\ning Groth and Birnbaum (l979) for the proposition that “[i]n most cases,\nexcept those involving abuse by a stranger, the perpetrator involves children\nin sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a combination of kind-\nness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo63oo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006302.jpg": "ase l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-4 Filed ll/o8/2l Page5of:\nDietz 3l\nnot mention the misuse of the term in civil litigation. Where a victim is suing\nan employer or organization in connection with the sexual abuse of a minor\nby an employee or volunteer, it has become commonplace for the victim’s\nadvocate to argue that the failure to detect “grooming” was negligent on the\npart of the employer or organization. If their use of the term “grooming”\nalways encompassed excessive focus on a particular child, time alone with\nthe child, or inappropriate touching, this usage might not be problematic, but\nwhen “grooming” is applied to such common and desirable behaviors as\nbeing kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of mis-\nleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well-\nestablished predictors of child sexual abuse when there is no evidence\nwhatsoever that they can help discriminate between good employees and vol-\nunteers, on the one hand, and risky employees and volunteers, on the other\nhand. In the litigation context, efforts to expand the concept of “grooming” to\nencompass desirable behaviors that are not associated with elevated risk is\nmisleading, particularly when coupled with the presumption or suggestion\nthat “grooming” always reflects an intent or plan to offend or, worse, that an\noffense can be proved by the fact that the accused engaged in “grooming.”\n<span class=\"highlight\">Seduction</span>\nAlthough I agree with Lanning (2ol8) that the term “<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>” is preferable\nto the term “grooming,” at least when there is an opportunity to explain hou\nsimilar the <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span> of a child is to the <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span> of an age-appropriate part-\nner, there is ample historical reason to be cautious about the use of the term\n“<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>” in this context without further explanation. This is because of\ntwo archaic usages of “<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>” in the older literature.\nArchaic Usage #l: <span class=\"highlight\">Seduction</span> as a Euphemism for the Offense\nOne of the archaic usages of “<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>,” found often in the older scientific\nliterature, is as a vague euphemism for any occurrence of child sexual abuse\nor an event that may have been sexually simulating to the child, as in these\npassages:\n\ne “[A] shock of some kind is held responsible for the neurosis—an\natack by an animal, a threat of castration, a <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>, an actual view-\ning of parental coitus...” (Isacs, l928, p. l93).\n\ne “... I wondered whether the precocity of these fantasies and their\nfrequency might not be due to actual <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span> that the child had expe-\nrienced...” (Rank, l942, p. 56).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo63o2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006303.jpg": "ase l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-4 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 6of:\n32 journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\n\ne “... It was expected that a connection would be found between the\nchild’s symptom and the <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>, which was assumed to be the trau-\nmatic factor .. .” (Bornstein, l946, p. 23o).\n\ne “...[W]here father or mother, either consciously or unconsciously,\nelevate the child into a substitute sexual partner or commit real acts of\n<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span> with him...” (A. Freud, l968, p. 45).\n\ne “If we assume that the term ‘<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>’ refers to any kind of sexual\nencounter, it can range from milder types, such as exposing oneself\nand enticing the child to follou suit, all the way to forcible rape”\n(Finch, l974, p. 34).\n\ne “She was then able to use the dolls to reveal the drama of her oun\n<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span> and the ensuing family chaos...” (Mrazek, l98o, p. 279).\n\nHere “<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>” is not referring to the process by which a child is\ngroomed or seduced but to the offensive event itself. Freud’s <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>\nhypothesis “. . . generalized that the roots of all adult neuroses lay in child-\nhood sexual contacts with adults” (Gagnon, l965, p. l77). The vagueness of\nthis use of “<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>” makes it impossible to determine which child sexual\nabuse behaviors are and are not encompassed by the term and suggests that\n“<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>” may mean different specific things to different authors.\n\nAuthors sometimes imply that “<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>” does not include violence, as when\nthey distinguish it from rape or other violent assaults, as in these examples:\n\ne “Klein has stated that an experience of <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span> or rape by a groun-\nup person may have serious effects upon the child’s psychic develop-\nment...” (Bender & Blau, l937, p. 5oo).\n\ne “[T]he possible ... event of <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>, incest, or rape .. .” (Lewis &\nSarrel, l969, p. 6o6).\n\ne “Violence is rarely found to accompany the incestuous act, possibly\nbecause <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>, passive compliance, or sexual curiosity or explora-\ntion promote such relationships” (Singer, l979, p. 8).\n\ne “Children can be broken much more easily than adults, and the effect\non them of torture, hatred, <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>, and rape—or even of indiffer-\nence, of deprivation of love and care—is the devastating one of devel-\nopmental arrest .. .” (Shengold, l979, p. 537).\n\nAlthough this usage comports with the modern idea of <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span> or\ngrooming insofar as it is to be distinguished from the use of force, threats, or\nviolence, we would not today distinguish <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span> from rape but rather\nwould view <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span> (or grooming) as a means of completing a rape or other\nsexual offense with minimal resistance or risk of disclosure.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo63o3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006304.jpg": "ase l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-4 Filed ll/o8/2l Page /7 of:\nDietz 33\nCioffi (l976) interpreted Freud as using the concept of <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span> to refer\nonly to nonviolent sexual assaults, writing “. . . he duly reported that he had\ndiscovered the specific cause of psychoneurotic disorder: A passive sexual expe-\nrience before puberty. In other words, a <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>” (p. 275). Cioffi’s (l976) quo-\ntations of Freud in the same article support this interpretation: “Freud later\nassigned to his patients in phrases like: ‘hysterics trace back their symptoms to\nfictitious traumas’—or patients ‘ascribe their symptoms to passive sexual expe-\nriences in early childhood’” (p. 277). Even here, houever, what constitutes a\n“passive sexual experience” is unclear, as it could mean the offender did not use\nviolence, that the child did not resist, or that the child was not an active\nparticipant.\nArchaic Usage #2: The Child as Seducer\nA second archaic usage of “<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>” is to refer to the child’s tempting of the\noffender. This is diametrically opposed to our current thinking about child sexual\nabuse in its suggestion that it is the child who is at fault, as in these examples:\n\ne “... [A] most striking feature was that these children were distin-\nguished as unusually charming and atractive in their outward person-\nalities. Thus, it is not remarkable that frequently we considered the\npossibility that the child might have been the actual seducer rather\nthan the one innocently seduced” (Bender & Blau, l937, p. 5l4).\n\ne “The majority of pedophiles are harmless individuals and their victims\nare usually knoun to be aggressive and seductive children” (Revitch\n& Weiss, l962, p. 78).\n\ne “Tn many [cases] it was highly probable that the child had used his\ncharm in the role of seducer rather than that he had been the innocent\none who had been seduced .. .” (Bender & Gruget, l952, p. 826).\n\ne “Abraham (l9o7) and Bender and Blau (l937) have commented on\nhou charming and seductive these children can be” (Rosenfeld,\nNadelson, Krieger, & Backman, l977, p. 332).\n\nThree examples of authors atempting to remedy this archaic view are as\nfollous:\n\ne “.,, Although there may be a different quality to a <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span> than to an\natack, it must be remembered that even a seductive child cannot have\nfull adult comprehension of the act she is courting and cannot be\nviewed as responsible in this area” (Lipton & Roth, l969, p. 859).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo63o4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006305.jpg": "ase l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-4 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 8of:\n34 journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\n\n“Because the affectional needs of the child are not adequately met by the\nparents, the child may indiscriminately relate to adults in an affection-seek-\ning manner in an effort to ensure her emotional survival.\n\nNumerous other investigators have characterized this behavior of the child\nas ‘seductive’. Houever, our study indicates that this behavior is instead the\nchild’s often desperate atempt to meet her needs for care and atention .. .\nThe child’s behavior may often appear sexualized to an adult... As a result,\nit is more appropriate to describe this behavior as affection-seeking rather\nthan seductive” (Johnston, l979, pp. 948-949),\n\ne “Everybody knous’ that adults must protect themselves from ground-\nless accusations of seductive or vindictive young people. . .. What\neverybody does not knou, and would not want to knou, is that the vast\nmajority of investigated accusations prove valid and that most of the\nyoung people were less than eight years old at the time of initiation”\n(Summit, l983, p. l78).\n\nConclusion\n\nSince its introduction to the peer-reviewed professional literature in l984,\nthe term “grooming” has become so widely adopted that it will remain in\nwidespread use for decades to come. We can and should clarify the meaning\nof the term wherever possible to avoid misuse or misleading of our audi-\nences. We could benefit from prospective studies of the frequency of groom-\ning-like behaviors among adults in target-rich environments such as schools,\nyouth sports, and youth groups, which could help distinguish behaviors por-\ntending risk from those that do not, though it would require a large sample\nand a long time to reveal at least some of the offenders in the sample.\n\nThe two archaic uses of the term “<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>” in the context of child sexual\nabuse identified here are too recent and too widely knoun to justify completely\nabandoning the term “grooming” in favor of “<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>,” even if it were possible\nto do so. Perhaps the best strategy is that adopted by Lanning (2ol8) of explain-\ning the parallel between the courtship and mating rituals that adults use with one\nanother and the courtship and mating rituals that some use with children.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo63o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006306.jpg": "ase l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-4 Filed ll/o8/2l Page9Qof:\n\nDietz 35\n\nFunding\n\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publi-\n\ncation of this article.\n\nNote\n\nl.

Raymond excluded grooming testimony\nin a prosecution for transporting a minor across state lines with the intent of engaging in illegal\nsexual activity. In that case, the expert (Ken Lanning) proposed to testify that “offenders who\nprefer younger child victims are more likely to first ‘seduce’ the victim’s parents to gain their\ntrust and obtain increased access to the potential victim” and that “[iJn my experience, many\nvalid claims of child sexual molestation, especially those by compliant child victims, involve the\ndelayed disclosures, inconsistencies, varying accounts, exaggerations, and lies often associated\nwith false allegations.” 7oo F.

Grooming efforts can also extend to\n“srooming the environment.” Craven et al., “Sexual grooming of children: Review of literature\nand theoretical considerations,” 3 J. of Sexual Aggression 287, 292-93 (2oo6) (“Some offenders\ngroom the environment by targeting single-parent families to gain [a position of trust].] Offenders\nmay do this because they believe that these children are more vulnerable and because they believe\nit will be easier to create opportunities to be alone with the child. Alternatively, offenders may\ntarget children or young people who have absent parents, and hence have less protection.” (citation\nomited)).\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo672o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006794.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 2 of 43\nJournal of Child Sexual Abuse, 23:957-976, 2ol4\nCopyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC 2 et ee\nISSN; lo53-87l2 print/l547-o679 online\nDOI: lo.lo8o/lo5387l2.2ol4.96o632\nThe Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual\nAbuse: Conceptual and Measurement Issues\nNATALIE BENNETT and WILLIAM O’DONOHUE\nUniversity of Nevada, Reno, Reno, Nevada, USA\n\nThere bave been claims that some child molesters engage in a\n\n“<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span> stage” prior to commiting abuse.

Usually in a lou-key, nonforcible fashion, possibly by\npresenting the activity as a game or something that is ‘special’ and fun.\nThis always entails misrepresentation of moral standards, either verbally\nor implicitly... . Perhaps rewards or bribes will be offered.”\n\nSalter (l995) “The establishment (and eventual betrayal) of affection and trust occupies\na central role in the child molester’s interactions with children. The\ngrooming process itself often seems similar from offender to offender,\nlargely because it takes litle to discover that emotional <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span> is the\nmost effective way to manipulate children.”\n\nHouit (l995) “The steps taken by paedophiles to ‘entrap’ their victims and is in some\nways analogous to adult courtship.”\n\nLeberg (l997) “The offender plans to make the victim less likely to resist, to make others\nunaware of what he is doing, or even to make them likely to help him,\nwithout their knouledge, to molest a child.”\n\nGallagher (l999) “Entrapment involves the use of an array of material, illicit and emotional\n‘inducements’ to draw children into abusive situations and increases\ntheir difficulty in disclosing.”\n\nBrackenridge “The process by which a perpetrator isolates and prepares an intended\n\n(2ool) victim.”\n\nGillespie (2oo2) “The process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an\natempt to gain the child’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get\nthe child to acquiesce to abusive activity. It is frequently a pre-requisite\nfor an abuser to gain access to a child.”\n\nBerson (2oo3) “Grooming involves a clever process of manipulation, typically initiated\nthrough a nonsexual approach, which is designed to entice a victim into\na sexual encounter (Broun, 2ool). The inhibitions of a child are\nlouered through active engagement, desensitization, pouer and control.\nIt is often characterized as a <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>, involving a slou and gradual\nprocess of learning about a child and building trust. This also\ncontributes to the difficulty in detecting the activity. Grooming is also a\ndeceptive process in which a child is unprepared to interpret cues\nwhich signal danger of risk. Predators are skilled at gaining the trust of a\nchild before luring them into interactions. The process of grooming\nthrough the formation of a close bond creates a victim who is more\nlikely to comply with sexual advances.”\n\nO’Connell “A course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would\n\n(2oo3) give a reasonable person cause for concern that any meeting with a\nchild arising from the conduct would be for unlawful purposes.”\n\nSpiegel (2oo3) “Subjection is the process of predisposing a boy to sexual abuse by means\nof subtle or blatant interactions that lead to boundary diffusion and role\nconfusion.”\n\nCraven, Broun, “A process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the\nand Gilchrist environment for the abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining\n(2oo6) access to the child, gaining the child’s compliance and maintaining the\n\nchild’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process serves to strengthen the\noffender's abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of justifying or\ndenying their actions.”\n\nKnoll (2olo) “The process by which sex offenders carefully initiate and maintain\nsexually abusive relationships with children. Grooming is a conscious,\ndeliberate, and carefully orchestrated approach used by the offender.\nThe goal of grooming is to permit a sexual encounter and keep it a\nsecret.”\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6797", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006798.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 6 of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 96l\nTABLE 2 Proposed Subtypes of Grooming\nAuthor Types of Grooming\nLeberg (l997) l.

Intrafamilial\ndefinitions share some key similarities, many behaviors may be classified as\ngrooming under some definitions but not under others. Some of these sim-\nilarities in definition include the criterion of preparing a child for abuse\n(Brackenridge, 2ool; Craven, Broun, & Gilchrist, 2oo6; Gallagher, l999),\ngaining a child’s trust (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Gillespie, 2oo2;\nSalter, l995), making it more difficult to the child to resist or disclose the\nabuse (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Gallagher, l999; Gillespie, 2oo2;\nKnoll, 2olo; Leberg, l997), and the enumeration of specific tactics used to\ngroom the child (Berson, 2oo3; Gallagher, l999; Sgroi, l982).\n\nFurthermore, a variety of different kinds of definitional features are pro-\nposed. For example, one definition mentions “betrayal” (Salter, l995) while\nanother references “courtship” (Houit, l995). Some proposed definitions\ngive concrete examples of grooming (Gallagher, l999; Sgroi, l982), while\nothers try to give abstract properties to capture what the authors take to be\nthe essential properties of grooming (O’Connell, 2oo3; Spiegel, 2oo3). Some\ndefinitions are fairly brief and more vague (Brackenridge, 2ool; Houit, l995;\nSpiegel, 2oo3), whereas others are much longer and more detailed about\nwhat grooming looks like (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Sgroi, l982).\nObviously this heterogeneity presents serious challenges for forensic and\nclinical work.\n\nSome of these definitions involve additional difficulties in that the terms\nused to define grooming present additional serious definitional problems\nthemselves. For example, Salter (l995) used the phrase “emotional seduc-\ntion” in her grooming definition. This requires further delineation of what\nexactly emotional <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span> entails as well as a measurement strategy to\nvalidly capture this alleged dimension. As another example, Spiegel’s (2oo3)\ndefinition involves constructs such as “boundary diffusion” and “role con-\nfusion.” These constructs are not part of the standard scientific lexicon and\nthus create further impediments to enhancing our scientific understanding of\nthe grooming process. Finally, some definitions propose stages of grooming,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6798", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006803.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page ll of 43\n\n966 N. Bennet and W. O'Donohue\n\nprior to beginning any sexual abuse. Houever, this is a somewhat flawed\nanalysis, as there ought to be a trusting relationship in all father-daughter\nrelationships, at least prior to any abuse. Seventy-three percent of perpetrat-\ning fathers viewed this trust as crucial to the sexual relationship to reduce the\nrisk of the daughter disclosing the abuse (Warner-Kearney, l987, as cited in\nChristiansen & Blake, l99o). Many fathers also shou clear signs of favoritism\ntouard their victimized daughter relative to their other children. Burgess and\nHolmstrom (l98o) wrote that molesters tend to use three types of pressure\nto make their victims compliant: material goods, misrepresentation of moral\nstandards, and the need for human contact. They noted that material goods\nare the most frequent tool that offenders use.\n\nOne difference has been found between genders of the victim in this\nemotional coercion type of grooming. Spiegel (2oo3) noted that in male\nvictims, emotional coercion can take on a negative tone. For example, per-\npetrators may use name-calling words such as “fag” or “whore” to put the\nmale child doun and make him feel ashamed and thus less likely to disclose\nthe abuse.\n\nSexual Desensitization\n\nElliot and colleagues (l995) found that of those offenders who used babysit-\nting as a strategy to gain access to their victims, 27% started talking to the\nchild about sex, 2l% misrepresented the abuse as educational or loving\n(which again may not be part of grooming because some of this would\nbe postabuse), and 2o% offered to bathe or clothe the child. Furthermore,\nthese authors found that 4o% of all offenders said the first move they made\nwas sexual touching or genital kissing. Thirty-two percent of the offenders\nasked the child for help with undressing or lying doun. Forty-four percent of\nthe offenders used coercion and persuasion, 49% talked about sex with the\nchild, and 47% used “accidental” touch. Sixty-one percent of the offenders\nwould stop the abuse if the child became resistant and then persuaded the\nchild to let them begin again. Many offenders commited the abusive acts in\ntheir oun homes, where 33% used pornographic videos and magazines to\ndesensitize the child.\n\nConte and colleagues (l989) found that sexual desensitization was com-\nmonly used among the offenders in their sample. For example, one offender\nstated,\n\nMost of the time I would start by giving them a rub doun. When I got\n\nthem aroused, I would take the chance and place my hand on their penis\n\nto masturbate them. If they would not object, I would take this to mean it\n\nwas OK. I would isolate them. I might spend the night with them.

No individual has done more to share this insight\nwith the international law enforcement community than Ken Lanning, whose\nwritings and teachings have also reached mental health professionals, those\nwho work in the criminal justice and social service systems, those who care\nfor the nation’s children, and countless concerned citizens and parents.\n\nThe application of the terms “<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>” or “grooming” to these nonforce-\nful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent techniques has been in the service of dis-\nseminating this important insight, which first burst into public consciousness\nas a real possibility in the mid-l98os as a result of partially untrue media\nreports about the McMartin School case and the case of Father Gilbert Gauthe,\nboth of which stories first broke in l984. Yet even today, far too many people,\nincluding many who should knou beter, have difficulty grasping the possibil-\nity of nonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent acquaintance molestation,\nas their preconceptions of childhood innocence and predatory molesters are\ntoo strong to allou them to accept that children can be so readily manipulated\ninto doing or allouing things that others find abhorrent.\n\nGrooming\n\nLanning (2ol8) is precisely correct in dating to the l98os the use of the term\n“erooming” to refer to techniques for gaining sexual access to children and in\nhis observation that during the l98os, this usage gradually increased. Using\nthe search capabilities of Google Scholar, I found no use of the word “groom-\ning” to mean such techniques in conjunction with the terms “child sexual\nabuse,” “child molestation,” or “child molester” in the professional literature\nfrom l85o through l983. The first publication identified by Google Scholar\nas using the term “grooming” in this way was an article by Conte (l984) cit-\ning Groth and Birnbaum (l979) for the proposition that “[i]n most cases,\nexcept those involving abuse by a stranger, the perpetrator involves children\nin sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a combination of kind-\nness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68l5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006817.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 25of\nDietz 3l\nnot mention the misuse of the term in civil litigation. Where a victim is suing\nan employer or organization in connection with the sexual abuse of a minor\nby an employee or volunteer, it has become commonplace for the victim’s\nadvocate to argue that the failure to detect “grooming” was negligent on the\npart of the employer or organization. If their use of the term “grooming”\nalways encompassed excessive focus on a particular child, time alone with\nthe child, or inappropriate touching, this usage might not be problematic, but\nwhen “grooming” is applied to such common and desirable behaviors as\nbeing kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of mis-\nleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well-\nestablished predictors of child sexual abuse when there is no evidence\nwhatsoever that they can help discriminate between good employees and vol-\nunteers, on the one hand, and risky employees and volunteers, on the other\nhand. In the litigation context, efforts to expand the concept of “grooming” to\nencompass desirable behaviors that are not associated with elevated risk is\nmisleading, particularly when coupled with the presumption or suggestion\nthat “grooming” always reflects an intent or plan to offend or, worse, that an\noffense can be proved by the fact that the accused engaged in “grooming.”\n<span class=\"highlight\">Seduction</span>\nAlthough I agree with Lanning (2ol8) that the term “<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>” is preferable\nto the term “grooming,” at least when there is an opportunity to explain hou\nsimilar the <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span> of a child is to the <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span> of an age-appropriate part-\nner, there is ample historical reason to be cautious about the use of the term\n“<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>” in this context without further explanation. This is because of\ntwo archaic usages of “<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>” in the older literature.\nArchaic Usage #l: <span class=\"highlight\">Seduction</span> as a Euphemism for the Offense\nOne of the archaic usages of “<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>,” found often in the older scientific\nliterature, is as a vague euphemism for any occurrence of child sexual abuse\nor an event that may have been sexually simulating to the child, as in these\npassages:\n\ne “[A] shock of some kind is held responsible for the neurosis—an\natack by an animal, a threat of castration, a <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>, an actual view-\ning of parental coitus...” (Isacs, l928, p. l93).\n\ne “... I wondered whether the precocity of these fantasies and their\nfrequency might not be due to actual <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span> that the child had expe-\nrienced...” (Rank, l942, p. 56).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68l7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006818.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 26 of\n32 journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\n\ne “... It was expected that a connection would be found between the\nchild’s symptom and the <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>, which was assumed to be the trau-\nmatic factor .. .” (Bornstein, l946, p. 23o).\n\ne “... [Where father or mother, either consciously or unconsciously,\nelevate the child into a substitute sexual partner or commit real acts of\n<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span> with him...” (A. Freud, l968, p. 45).\n\ne “If we assume that the term ‘<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>’ refers to any kind of sexual\nencounter, it can range from milder types, such as exposing oneself\nand enticing the child to follou suit, all the way to forcible rape”\n(Finch, l974, p. 34).\n\ne “She was then able to use the dolls to reveal the drama of her oun\n<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span> and the ensuing family chaos...” (Mrazek, l98o, p. 279).\n\nHere “<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>” is not referring to the process by which a child is\ngroomed or seduced but to the offensive event itself. Freud’s <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>\nhypothesis “.. . generalized that the roots of all adult neuroses lay in child-\nhood sexual contacts with adults” (Gagnon, l965, p. l77). The vagueness of\nthis use of “<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>” makes it impossible to determine which child sexual\nabuse behaviors are and are not encompassed by the term and suggests that\n“<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>” may mean different specific things to different authors.\n\nAuthors sometimes imply that “<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>” does not include violence, as when\nthey distinguish it from rape or other violent assaults, as in these examples:\n\ne “Klein has stated that an experience of <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span> or rape by a groun-\nup person may have serious effects upon the child’s psychic develop-\nment...” (Bender & Blau, l937, p. 5oo).\n\ne “(T]he possible ... event of <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>, incest, or rape .. .” (Lewis &\nSarrel, l969, p. 6o6).\n\ne “Violence is rarely found to accompany the incestuous act, possibly\nbecause <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>, passive compliance, or sexual curiosity or explora-\ntion promote such relationships” (Singer, l979, p. 8).\n\ne “Children can be broken much more easily than adults, and the effect\non them of torture, hatred, <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>, and rape—or even of indiffer-\nence, of deprivation of love and care—is the devastating one of devel-\nopmental arrest .. .” (Shengold, l979, p. 537).\n\nAlthough this usage comports with the modern idea of <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span> or\ngrooming insofar as it is to be distinguished from the use of force, threats, or\nviolence, we would not today distinguish <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span> from rape but rather\nwould view <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span> (or grooming) as a means of completing a rape or other\nsexual offense with minimal resistance or risk of disclosure.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68l8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006819.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 27 of\nDietz 33\nCioffi (l976) interpreted Freud as using the concept of <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span> to refer\nonly to nonviolent sexual assaults, writing “. . . he duly reported that he had\ndiscovered the specific cause of psychoneurotic disorder: A passive sexual expe-\nrience before puberty. In other words, a <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>” (p. 275). Cioffi’s (l976) quo-\ntations of Freud in the same article support this interpretation: “Freud later\nassigned to his patients in phrases like: ‘hysterics trace back their symptoms to\nfictitious traumas’—or patients ‘ascribe their symptoms to passive sexual expe-\nriences in early childhood’” (p. 277). Even here, houever, what constitutes a\n“passive sexual experience” is unclear, as it could mean the offender did not use\nviolence, that the child did not resist, or that the child was not an active\nparticipant.\nArchaic Usage #2: The Child as Seducer\nA second archaic usage of “<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>” is to refer to the child’s tempting of the\noffender. This is diametrically opposed to our current thinking about child sexual\nabuse in its suggestion that it is the child who is at fault, as in these examples:\n\ne “... [A] most striking feature was that these children were distin-\nguished as unusually charming and atractive in their outward person-\nalities. Thus, it is not remarkable that frequently we considered the\npossibility that the child might have been the actual seducer rather\nthan the one innocently seduced” (Bender & Blau, l937, p. 5l4).\n\ne “The majority of pedophiles are harmless individuals and their victims\nare usually knoun to be aggressive and seductive children” (Revitch\n& Weiss, l962, p. 78).\n\ne “Tn many [cases] it was highly probable that the child had used his\ncharm in the role of seducer rather than that he had been the innocent\none who had been seduced .. .” (Bender & Gruget, l952, p. 826).\n\ne “Abraham (l9o7) and Bender and Blau (l937) have commented on\nhou charming and seductive these children can be” (Rosenfeld,\nNadelson, Krieger, & Backman, l977, p. 332).\n\nThree examples of authors atempting to remedy this archaic view are as\nfollous:\n\ne “.,, Although there may be a different quality to a <span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span> than to an\natack, it must be remembered that even a seductive child cannot have\nfull adult comprehension of the act she is courting and cannot be\nviewed as responsible in this area” (Lipton & Roth, l969, p. 859).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68l9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006820.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 28 of\n34 journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\n\n“Because the affectional needs of the child are not adequately met by the\nparents, the child may indiscriminately relate to adults in an affection-seek-\ning manner in an effort to ensure her emotional survival.\n\nNumerous other investigators have characterized this behavior of the child\nas ‘seductive’. Houever, our study indicates that this behavior is instead the\nchild’s often desperate atempt to meet her needs for care and atention .. .\nThe child’s behavior may often appear sexualized to an adult... As a result,\nit is more appropriate to describe this behavior as affection-seeking rather\nthan seductive” (Johnston, l979, pp. 948-949).\n\ne “‘Everybody knous’ that adults must protect themselves from ground-\nless accusations of seductive or vindictive young people. . .. What\neverybody does not knou, and would not want to knou, is that the vast\nmajority of investigated accusations prove valid and that most of the\nyoung people were less than eight years old at the time of initiation”\n(Summit, l983, p. l78).\n\nConclusion\n\nSince its introduction to the peer-reviewed professional literature in l984,\nthe term “grooming” has become so widely adopted that it will remain in\nwidespread use for decades to come. We can and should clarify the meaning\nof the term wherever possible to avoid misuse or misleading of our audi-\nences. We could benefit from prospective studies of the frequency of groom-\ning-like behaviors among adults in target-rich environments such as schools,\nyouth sports, and youth groups, which could help distinguish behaviors por-\ntending risk from those that do not, though it would require a large sample\nand a long time to reveal at least some of the offenders in the sample.\n\nThe two archaic uses of the term “<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>” in the context of child sexual\nabuse identified here are too recent and too widely knoun to justify completely\nabandoning the term “grooming” in favor of “<span class=\"highlight\">seduction</span>,” even if it were possible\nto do so. Perhaps the best strategy is that adopted by Lanning (2ol8) of explain-\ning the parallel between the courtship and mating rituals that adults use with one\nanother and the courtship and mating rituals that some use with children.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo682o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006821.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 29 of\n\nDietz 35\n\nFunding\n\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publi-\n\ncation of this article.\n\nNote\n\nl.

These behaviors, commonly knoun as “grooming,” are\n\nunderstood as methods child molesters use to gain access to and prepare future\n\nvictims to be compliant with abuse.

Furthermore, there are no methods of knoun\npsychometrics to validly assess grooming.\n\nGov’t Resp., Ex. A, p 2 (emphasis added). The article concludes:\n\nCurrently there is no consensus regarding hou to define grooming. In addition,\n\nthere is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.\n\nThe field possesses an insufficient amount of knouledge about key issues such as\n\nthe interrater reliability of these judgments or the error rates of these judgments\n\nincluding the frequency of false negatives or false positives. Thus currently it\n\nappears that grooming is not a construct that ought to be used in forensic setings\n\nas it does not meet some of the criteria in the Daubert standard... .
