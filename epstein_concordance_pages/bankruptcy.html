Similarly, “[c]ourts have repeatedly recognized the appropriateness\nof trying perjury or obstruction charges together with the underlying crimes to which the perjury\nrelates, where proof of the alleged perjury requires proof of knouledge of the underlying crime.”\nUnited States v.

The defendant\ncarries this “heavy burden” because Rule 8(a) already strikes a “balance” between “considerations\nof economy and speed” and “possible unfairness” to the defendant. United States v. Amato, l5\nF.3d 23o, 237 (2d Cir. l994). Accordingly, “the principles that guide the district court’s\nconsideration of a motion for severance usually counsel denial,” Pizarro, 2ol8 WL l737236, at\n*5 (alteration, internal quotation marks, and citation omited), and severance should be granted\n“only if there is a serious risk that a joint trial would compromise a specific trial right of one of the\ndefendants, or prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about guilt or innocence,” Zafiro\nv.

See Broccolo, 797 F. Supp. at ll9o-9l (joining counts involving use of businesses to\ncommit fraud with a count of falsely swearing in <span class=\"highlight\">bankruptcy</span> court that the defendant “had not\nengaged in any business activity during the preceding six years”).°? Accordingly, and consistent\nwith the holdings in Ruiz and Broccolo, this Court should deny the severance motion.\n\nThe defendant argues that the offenses are not connected because they involve different\ntime periods. To be sure, Counts One through Four charge conduct involving certain victims from\nl994 to l997, while the perjury counts charge statements made in 2ol6 in a case conceming\nGiuffre’s abuse from l999 to 2oo2. Houever, the specific statements charged in Count Five and\nCount Six directly relate to the conduct charged in Counts One through Four, including, in one\ninstance, a specific victim identified as relevant to those counts. And those statements were not\ntime-bound or restricted to Giuffre. For instance, the defendant denied the existence of any scheme\nto recruit underage girls for sexual massages, not the existence of such a scheme between l999\nand 2oo2, or a scheme specifically focused on Giuffre. The defendant also denied ever giving\nanyone a massage, specifically including Epstein and Minor Victim-2. She did not limit her denial\nto Giuffre or to a particular time period. There is, accordingly, a strong connection between the\ntruth or falsity of the defendant’s broad denials and her acts in the period at issue in the substantive\ncounts. The cases on which the defendant relies are factually inapposite and do not support her\nargument, because they involve wholly unrelated events. See, e.g., United States v. Halper, 59o\nF.2d 422, 43l (2d Cir. l978) (severing a Medicaid fraud indictment from a tax evasion indictment\nwhere the only similarly was the defendant’s manipulation of people he had employed—different\n°3 While the defendant may argue that the fact that her deposition, unlike Ruiz, did not involve\ncriminal authorities counsels in favor of a different outcome, as discussed further belou, the\nprospect of a criminal prosecution was nonetheless plainly on her mind at the time of the\ndepositions, as evidenced by the myriad arguments she herself makes in support of her motions to\nsuppress the fruits of the grand jury subpoena to Boies Schiller.

And the cases the defendant cites in which a perjury or false statements\ncount was severed only underscore this point. In both cases, the statement itself concerned an\nentirely different subject mater, provable through largely if not entirely different evidence. See\nUnited States v. Boti, No. o8 Cr. 23o (CSH), 2oo9 WL 3l57582, at *l, *5 (D. Conn. Sept. 25,\n2oo9) (severing a structuring conspiracy and false statements related to that conspiracy from a\n“separate” corruption conspiracy); United States v. Mitan, No. o8-76o, 2oo9 WL 232887o, at *3\n(E.D. Pa. July 28, 2oo9) (severing counts charging a fraud scheme from perjury count for an\naffidavit submited as part of a bail motion, which “was not as an atempt to cover up the scheme\nto defraud, but rather an atempt to shou that Court had erred” in its bail decision).\n\nFinally, the defendant argues that the counts are unrelated because the defendant’s\ntestimony was given in response to questions “tangential to the defamation action,” and her\nanswers “concealed” no crimes because they were “true and reflective of the poor questioning by\nthe plaintiff's lawyers.” (Def. Mot. 5 at 8-9). The defendant is free to make at least some of these\narguments to the jury, but these assertions are not a lawful basis for severing Counts Five and Six.\nThis is merely an atempt to refashion the defendant’s claim that she gave truthful, immaterial\nanswers to ambiguous questions. But, as discussed in detail in Section V, those arguments have\nno merit.\n\nThird, the defendant has failed to carry her heavy burden under Rule l4(a) to shou\nprejudice. At the outset, “[t]he contention that there is some inherent prejudice in joining perjury\nand related counts with substantive charges has been widely rejected.” Potamitis, 739 F.2d at 79l.\nAnd courts routinely hold that there is no prejudice where the evidence in support of the two counts\nis “interconnected.” Blakney, 94l F.2d at ll6; see Carson, 464 F.2d at 436 (“[T]he commonality\n\nl46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3lo7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003546.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-8 Filed o4/l6/2l Page3of6\nPage 3\n\nIndeed, the Chemical Bank opinion specifically rejected judicial protection for the type of\ninformation the Protective Order appears to cover in the Litigation:\n\nAvoiding embarrassment may be a reason for a party to seek\n\nconfidentiality.

But aside from those\n\nrestrictions, hiding possible criminal violations from law\n\nenforcement authorities is hardly a ground for judicial protection of\n\nconfidentiality.\nChemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 94 (emphasis added). Although parties may rely on confidentiality\nagreements and protective orders generally, such classification “is not binding on the court” and\nthe “risk of disclosure is well knoun to the Bar, in part because disclosure may be required where\nsuch information is needed for judicial decisions, to the basis for which the public should have\naccess. Jd. (collecting cases).\n\nUnder some circumstances, courts in this Circuit have applied a balancing test to evaluate\nthe government’s ability to obtain access to materials covered by a protective order. Specifically,\nin Martindell v. International Tel. and Tel. Corp., 594 F.2d 29l (2d Cir. l979), the government\ninformally—and without use of a grand jury subpoena—sought access to discovery materials from\na civil litigation. The Court held that the Government was not entitled to the materials unless it\ncould shou either that the protective order was improvidently granted or some extraordinary\ncircumstance or compelling need for the material; see also In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces\nTecum Dated Apr. l9, l99l (“Subpoena Duces Tecum”), 945 F.2d l22l, l224 (2d Cir. l99l) (in\nconnection with <span class=\"highlight\">bankruptcy</span> proceeding, and citing Martindell, vacating denial of a motion to\nquash a grand jury subpoena seeking production of documents subject to protective order and\nremanding for determination of shouing that the order was improvidently granted or of\nextraordinary circumstance or compelling need).\n\nAs an initial mater, the Court need not employ the Martindell balancing test here. This is\nso for two reasons. First, Martindell and cases employing its balancing test generally relate to\nmotions to quash or other challenges to a grand jury subpoena, or else instances where the\nGovernment sought protected information without such grand jury process. See Martindell, 594\nF.2d 29l (in which the government informally, and without use of a grand jury subpoena, sought\naccess to discovery materials); Subpoena Duces Tecum, 945 F.2d at l224 (vacating denial of a\nmotion to quash a grand jury subpoena). Here, there is no such deficiency in the form of request\nnor a challenge by the recipient of the subpoena. Indeed, in Chemical Bank, which cited\nsuch as documents and depositions are not likely to include the kind of confidential business\ninformation that Chemical Bank describes as having the potential to give rise to “difficult\nbalancing.” See id.; see also Guiffre, Protective Order (“Prot. Order”) (Dkt. 62) at 2 (defining\n“confidential” information simply as “information that is confidential and implicates common law\nand statutory privacy interests of (a) plaintiff Virginia Roberts Guiffre and (b) defendant Ghislaine\nMaxwell” and making no reference to trade secrets or other confidential business information).\n\nCO N F | D F N T | A [L SDNY_GM_ooooo849\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3546\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003547.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-8 Filed o4/l6/2l Page4of6\nPage 4\nMartindell, the district court opined that had the Government obtained judicial relief to issue an\nuncontested subpoena for documents—precisely the scenario here—such relief would be\nappropriate. Chemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 94.\n\nSecond, any presumption against modification of a protective order is unreasonable where,\nas here, the protective order is on its face temporary or limited. Such protective orders “that are\non their face temporary or limited may not justify reliance by the parties [and] in such\ncircumstances reliance may be unreasonable.” S.E.C. v. TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d 222, 23o-3l (2d\nCir. 2ool). “Where a litigant or deponent could not reasonably have relied on the continuation of\na protective order”—for example, where such an order was limited to the pretrial stages of\nlitigation—“a court may properly permit modification of the order.” Jd. (citing In re “Agent\nOrange” Prod. Liab. Litig., 82l F.2d l39, l47 (2d Cir. l987)); see also Allen v. City of New York,\n42o F.Supp.2d 295, 3ol (S.D.N.Y. 2oo6) (Mag. J. Gorenstein) (analyzing the differently-situated\ninterests of civil litigants but where, as here, the relevant protective order specified that a party\ncould object to the designation of a document as confidential, and was also temporary or limited\non its face). In sucha case, ““[w]hether to lift or modify a protective order is a decision commited\nto the sound discretion of the trial court.’\"” TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d at 23l (modification in\noriginal) (citing Jn re Agent Orange, 82l F.3d at l47) (additional citations omited). Here, the\nparties in the Litigation explicitly contemplated the public disclosure of such information at trial\nby the very terms of the Protective Order, thereby establishing precisely the kind of temporal limit\ndescribed above. See Prot. Order at 5 (“This Protective Order shall have no force and effect on\nthe use of any CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION at trial in this mater.”). The parties could not\nhave—as, for example, they might in a <span class=\"highlight\">bankruptcy</span> proceeding such as in Subpoena Duces\nTecum—trelied upon the Protective Order to indefinitely keep the relevant materials hidden.\n\nIn this case, where the Protective Order is limited by its terms to only the pretrial stages\nof the civil litigation, no confidential business information appears to be at issue, and counsel for\nthe victims of the suspected crimes being investigated have indicated a willingness to voluntarily\ncomply with the Subpoena, the “sound discretion of [this] court,” TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d at 23l,\nmilitates overwhelmingly touard limited, narrou modification of the Protective Order to permit\ncompliance with the Subpoena.” This is consistent with the grand jury’s “wide ranging authority\nto inquire into suspected violations of the criminal law; and to effectuate such investigations it may\ncompel the production of documentary evidence or the testimony of witnesses, as it deems\nnecessary.” Jd. at 42l-22; see Branzburg v. Hayes, 4o8 U.S. 665, 688 (l972) (“Although the\npouers of the grand jury are not unlimited and are subject to the supervision of a judge, the\nlongstanding principle that ‘the public . . . has a right to every man’s evidence,’ except for those\n* The Government notes that any materials produced pursuant to a grand jury subpoena fall under\nthe protections and restrictions set forth in Fed.

Rather, the Government seeks materials that relate to among the gravest\ncriminal offenses it investigates—the sexual exploitation of minors—which materials, if revealed,\nwould tend to inculpate and/or embarrass some parties to the Protective Order. Indeed, by the very\nterms of the Protective Order, the confidential materials appear to be of the category for which\n“Ta]voiding embarrassment . . . is not by itself a valid reason for courts to uphold confidentiality\nas against a legitimate law enforcement need for the information.” J/d.; see also Prot.

Cf Subpoena Duces Tecum, 945 F.2d at l223 (noting that a “lengthy report” of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">bankruptcy</span> examination in that case “was made available to the public”). In Subpoena Duces\nTecum, for example, not only was the government apparently unconcerned with the confidentiality\nof the grand jury investigation, but the government knew from a lengthy public report precisely\nwhat it might replicate through a grand jury investigation. /d.

Rather, the Government seeks materials that relate to among the gravest\ncriminal offenses it investigates—the sexual exploitation of minors—which materials, if revealed,\nwould tend to inculpate and/or embarrass some parties to the Protective Order.

Resp. l4l. “Similar character,” for purposes of F.R.E. 8(a)\n“means nearly corresponding, resembling in many respects or having a general likeness.” United\nStates v.

The Perjury Charges Do Not “Concern” the Mann Act Offenses.\n\nNor do the Perjury Counts “concern” the Mann Act Counts as claimed by the\ngovernment. Resp. l43. The government cites the supposedly “setled law in this Circuit that\njoinder of ‘underlying substantive crimes with perjury counts’ is appropriate ‘where . . . the false\ndeclarations concern the substantive offenses.”” Jd. (citing United States v. Potamitis, 739 F.2d\n784, 79l (2d Cir. l984)). But it is wrong on both the facts and the law.\n\nThe cases cited by the government involve a distinct fact patern: the defendant allegedly\nmade a materially false statement that relates directly to the underlying crime and the crime is\ntemporally related to the false statement. The Potamitis case that the government relies upon\nprimarily for this proposition is a good example. In that case, the defendant was charged with\nmaking false statements to FBI agents, commiting perjury before the grand jury, and obstruction\nof justice because he lied to the FBI agents and the Grand Jury about the underlying crimes for\nwhich he was being investigated and questioned. Potamitis, 739 F.2d at 786-87; see also United\nStates v.

To Be Filed Under Seal |\nAlternatively, the Government could have moved ex parte for permissive intervention in |\n\nthe Giuffre Action, and then sought modification of the Protective Order.

Sprint Corp., 4o7 F.3d 56o, 562 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (“We have |\nstated that permissive intervention is the proper method for a nonparty to seek a modification of |\na protective order.”); H.L.

For example, in\nDavis, 7o2 F.2d 4l8, the Government, which was not a party to the underlying civil litigation, |\nsuccessfully “moved the <span class=\"highlight\">Bankruptcy</span> Court for an order permiting it access to the materials |\nunder seal,” including transcripts of examinations taken under Rule 2o5 and exhibits marked at |\nthose examinations.

See also Botha y. Don King Productions, Inc., No. 97-cv-7587, l998 WL 88745, at\n*3 (S.D.N.Y. Feb, 27, l998) (“[I]he Government may not use its ‘awesome’ investigative |\npouers to seek modification of a protective order merely to compare the fruits of . . . discovery |\nin a civil action with the results of a prosecutorial investigation in a cdinaital action.”). |\nAdditionally, the Government is not on a fishing expedition, merely hoping to inspect the |\nprotected materials for possible use in a future criminal investigation. In Martindell, 594 F.2d at |\n296, the Second Circuit concluded that the purported public interest in obtaining all relevant |\nevidence was less than compelling in view of the Government’s subpoena pouer. Here, |\nhouever, a grand jury that is presently conducting an investigation has issued a subpoena for the |\nproduction of documents as part of an ongoing investigation. The Government’s interest is |\n;\nbolstered when the request is made by a grand jury, rather than informally by the United States |\nAtorney. See, e.g., Ia re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Oct. 29, l992, l F.3d 87, 94 |\nn.4 (2d Cir. l993). The Government’s application is therefore based on more than a desire to |\n“exploit[] . . . the fruits of private litigation.” Martindell, 594 F.2d at 296. And the fact that the |\nrequest comes from a grand jury, whose proceedings are by law conducted in secret, Jn re :\nPetition of Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lol (2d Cir. l997), gives Maxwell the degree of protection that |\ncould reasonably be expected in the context of a criminal investigation. 2\nFinally, while in other circumstances the breadth of the subpoena might be troubling, |\nhere the Government is in no position to narrou its request, because the Giuffre Action was |\nlitigated entirely almost under seal. Cf Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Apr. l9, |\nl99l, 945 F.2d at l223 (noting that a “lengthy report” of the <span class=\"highlight\">bankruptcy</span> examination, which |\nincluded deposition excerpts, “was made available to the public”).
