        const textData = {"Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000281.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6 - Filed o7/ll/l9 Page 8 of l6\n\nThe NPA required Mr. Epstein to plead guilty to a state felony charge (Fla. Stat.\n\n§ 796.o7), then pending in the State of Florida and to an additional state felony charge (not\npreviously charged or required by the State) of violating Fla. Stat. § 796.o3 (Case No. 2oo8-CF-\n938lAXX), a charge requiring registration as a sex offender. Mr. Epstein complied with all of\nhis obligations under the NPA.\n\nContrary to the government’s argument, the NPA was not limited to a “list of several\ndozen victims identified in the prior investigation ... .” Gov’t Bail Leter at 6-7. Indeed, the\nNPA contains no “list of several dozen victims” and regardless, the NPA immunized Mr. Epstein\nfrom prosecution “for the offenses set out on pages | and 2 of this Agreement,” allegedly\ncommited between 2ool-o7, as well as “any offenses that arose from the Federal Grand Jury\ninvestigation.” NPA at 2 (emphasis added). Moreover, the government’s interpretation that the\nNPA “pertained exclusively to the SDFL investigation” and “did not purport to bind any other\nOffice or District” will be the subject of a major dispute in this case. This is especially so\nbecause Mr. Epstein’s alleged conduct at his Palm Beach residence features prominently in the\nconspiracy count (Count l, 94 l4-l9, § 22.a, d, f) and is incorporated by reference in the\nsubstantive charge (Count 2, ¥ 23).\n\nBeyond that, Mr. Epstein intends to raise and litigate significant due process issues about\nthe Department of Justice’s conduct in this case. Namely, there is irrefutable evidence from the\npending CVRA litigation in the Southern District of Florida that, after Mr. Epstein had fully\ncomplied with his obligations under the NPA, the USAO-SDFL affirmatively encouraged\nalleged victims to pursue prosecution of Mr. Epstein in other districts, in violation of the DOJ’s\ncommitment to a “global” resolution. See Exhibit 2, at 8-l2. The United States Atorney for the\nSouthern District of Florida, along with supervisory and line prosecutors from the USAO-SDFL,\ncorresponded on multiple occasions with, and personally conferred with, alleged victims and\ntheir lawyers to entertain discussions about the alleged victims’ desire to have Mr. Epstein\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> on federal charges. See id. at 9. Further, the Southern District of New York is likely\nrelying upon physical evidence seized in connection with the prior investigation, see Gov’t Bail\nLeter at 6 (discussing “corroborating evidence,” including “contemporaneous notes, messages . .\n., and call records”). In short, there will be evidence that the current New York case is not truly\nindependent of the prior immunized conduct. The evidence will shou that Mr. Epstein’s\nreasonable expectation that the NPA would “resolve globally [Mr. Epstein’s] state and federal\ncriminal liability” in exchange for Mr. Epstein’s compliance with the duties and obligations in\nthe NPA — which he fully performed — has been unconstitutionally undermined by the\ngovernment’s efforts to minimize the potential consequences of a CVRA conferral violation (one\nthat neither the government nor defense believes occurred but that was found to have occurred in\nthe CVRA litigation which is pending a decision on remedies) by returning an inextricably\nintertwined second federal prosecution just as the District Court in Florida is receiving\nsubmissions on remedy.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo28l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000283.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6 - Filed o7/ll/l9 Page lo of l6\n\nTo reiterate, the Bail Reform Act requires pretrial release on the “/east restrictive”\nconditions that will assure both appearance and public safety. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)\n(emphasis added).

The Defendant Raises Legal Arguments Not Relevant Here\n\nFinally, the defendant raises certain legal arguments he contends he will litigate at the\nappropriate stage and which he further suggests mitigate in favor of bail. None is meritorious, and\ncertainly none should give the Court any comfort whatsoever that the defendant would, if granted\nbail, refrain from fleeing so he could atempt to vindicate himself via dubious legal strategies.\nNevertheless, the Government will address the defendant’s arguments briefly in turn.\n\nA. The Non-Prosecution Agreement Does Not Preclude Prosecution\n\nAs an initial mater, as the Court itself noted at the parties’ initial appearance earlier this\nweek, and as the defendant appears to concede, the instant Indictment charges conduct well beyond\nthe scope of the NPA — that is, alleged conduct that occurred here in New York and involving New\nYork based victims. D. Tr. 6-8; Release Motion at 2. For present purposes, that alone is sufficient\nto put this issue to rest, because even assuming the defendant were to mount a meritorious\nchallenge to the NPA, he would still have to stand trial on Count Two of the Indictment and\nadditional charges brought based on New York conduct.\n\nBut more generally, the reasons the defendant can be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> in the Southern District\nof New York—or anywhere else outside the SDFL—are manifold. The language of the NPA\noverwhelmingly refers to the SDFL, and the core terms and text of the agreement are limited to\nthe SDFL. The prefatory language states: “THEREFORE, on the authority of R. Alexander\nAcosta, United States Atorney for the Southern District of Florida, prosecution in this District for\nthese offenses shall be deferred in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida.”’ The final\nparagraph of the prefatory language also states, among other things, that after fulfilling the terms\nof the agreement, “no prosecution for the [sex abuse] offenses set out on pages | and 2 of this\nAgreement, nor any other offenses that have been the subject of the joint investigation by the\nFederal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Atorney’s Office, nor any offenses that\narose from the Federal Grand Jury investigation will be instituted in this District.”\n\nIn its terms section, the NPA further states that Epstein’s signature “is not to be construed\nas an admission of civil or criminal liability or a waiver of any jurisdictional or other defense” as\nto any victim whose identity was not disclosed by SDFL to Epstein, as provided for in the NPA,\nand additionally states that neither Epstein’s signature nor any resulting waivers or civil\nsetlements “are to be construed as admissions or evidence of civil or criminal liability or a waiver\nof any jurisdictional or other defense as to any person.” These provisions shou the parties\ncontemplated possible criminal prosecutions in other jurisdictions and/or based on victims not\ninitially identified in the Florida investigations (whether in Florida or elsewhere). The final\nsubstantive paragraph of the NPA states that “Epstein hereby requests that the United States\nAtorney for the Southern District of Florida defer [. . .] prosecution.”\n\nIt is well setled in the Second Circuit that “‘a plea agreement in one U.S. Atorney’s office\ndoes not, unless otherwise stated, bind another.” United States v.

Preliminary Statement\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this memorandum in response to the Court’s Orders\nconceming the two pending motions to unseal grand jury transcripts (Epstein Dkt. 6l; Maxwell\nDkt. 785) in cases <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> in this District. (Epstein Dkt. 63 at l-3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at l-3).\nThis memorandum, as directed by the Court, addresses the specific facts and factors highlighted\nin the Court’s Orders relevant to the particular grand jury materials at issue here. (Epstein Dkt. 63\nat l-3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at l-3). In order to ensure that “[t]ransparency in this process ... not be\nat the expense of [the Government’s] obligation under the law to protect victims” (Epstein Dkt. 6l\nat 2; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at 2), the Government also respectfully requests leave to file a supplemental\nsubmission once the Government and the Court have received any filings from the victims or\nothers referenced in the transcripts.\nIl. The Court’s Orders\n\nAs the Court recognized (Epstein Dkt. 63 at l-2; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at l-2), the Second\nCircuit has held that “there are certain ‘special circumstances’ in which release of grand jury\nrecords is appropriate even outside the boundaries of the rule.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo2 (2d\nCir. l997); see also In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489, 494 (2d Cir. l973) (supplemental opinion)\n(Friendly, C.J.) (recognizing that there are certain “special circumstances” in which release of\ngrand jury records is appropriate even outside of the boundaries of Rule 6(e)).! The Second Circuit\nenumerated a list of non-exhaustive factors for trial courts to consider when deciding such motions:\n' There is currently a Circuit split. See Pitch v. United States, 953 F.3d l226, l233 & n.6 (llth Cir.\n2o2o) (en banc) (describing the Circuit split); Jn re Petition for Order Directing Release of\nRecords, 27 F.4th 84, 9o-9l (lst Cir. 2o22) (same). In light of this split, when the Government\nsought similar relief seeking to unseal grand jury transcripts in the Southern District of Florida\nfrom 2oo5 and 2oo7 relating to Epstein, the Honorable Robin L. Rosenberg—who is bound by the\nEleventh Circuit’s rule barring extra-Rule disclosures set forth in Piteh—denied that motion. /n re\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo747\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000767.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 72 Filed o8/o5/25 Page 2of5\nBSF\nIt is obviously impossible for two people to conduct a decades-long sex-trafficking enterprise\ninvolving thousands of victims without other individuals who participated in and facilitated these\nunspeakable atrocities.\n\nThe recent controversy surrounding the Government’s decision to withhold information\nconceming Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes has largely ignored the victims’ perspective. Ms.\nFarmer is thankful for the Court’s invitations to state the victims’ positions, and supports the\nunsealing of the grand jury transcripts, as well as the accompanying grand jury exhibits, with\nredactions only as necessary to protect victims’ names, likenesses, and identifying information.\nTransparency is critical to justice, and the public has a legitimate interest in understanding the full\nscope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes, particularly where those actions caused lasting harm to\nothers. While it was not the victims’ decision to seek disclosure of the grand jury transcripts alone\n(as opposed to the much larger volume of information available in the “more than 3oo gigabytes\nof data and physical evidence” in the Government’s possession that should be disclosed as well),\nthe instant motion for unsealing will help expose the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s crimes.\n\nIn this case that involved a decades-long, systematic criminal scheme that shocked the\nconscience of the public, caused lasting harm to survivors, and raised credible concerns about the\nfailures of institutional accountability, there is an especially compelling interest in transparency.\nUnsealing the grand jury transcripts will illuminate the scope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s abuse,\nprovide additional insight into those who enabled his abuse, and bring light to hou these crimes\nwere investigated and <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>. While grand jury secrecy serves important purposes, it is not\nabsolute and under these circumstances the balance tilts in favor of disclosure.\n\nl. Given the Magnitude and Abhorrence of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s Crimes, the\n\nUnsealing of the Grand Jury Transcripts Is Appropriate.\n\nThe Second Circuit has recognized that there are special circumstances when the release\nof grand jury records is appropriate based on the courts’ supervisory authority over the grand juries\nthey empanel and that the trial court has “wide discretion ... in evaluating whether disclosure is\nappropriate.” Jn re Petition of Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo2, lo4 (2d Cir. l997). In Craig, the Second\nCircuit outlined a non-exclusive list of factors that a trial court may consider when deciding\nwhether “special circumstances warrant the release of grand jury transcripts. /d. at lo6.

Nathan\n\nOctober 7, 2o2o\n\nPage 4\n\nlil. The Government’s Plan to Review Certain Files from the Florida Investigation\nA. Relevant Background Regarding the Florida Investigation (2oo5-2olo)\nBetween approximately 2oo5 and 2olo, and as detailed further belou, members of the\nPalm Beach Police Department, the Palm Beach State’s Atorney’s Office, the U.S Atorney’s\nOffice for the Southern District of Florida (““USAO-SDFL”), and the FBI’s Palm Beach Resident\nAgency (the “FBI Florida Office”) conducted a separate investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey\nEpstein for his sexual abuse of minors in Florida (the “Florida Investigative Team” and the\n“Florida Investigation,” respectively). The Prosecution Team in this case had no involvement in\nthe Florida Investigation, which predated the instant investigation by approximately eight years.”\nSimilarly, the Florida Prosecution Team and the agencies involved in the Florida Investigation\nhave had no involvement in the investigative, charging, or prosecutorial strategy decisions of the\nProsecution Team in this case. Accordingly, under the governing law of this Circuit as discussed\nabove, there is no basis for deeming the Florida Prosecution Team a part of the current Prosecution\nTeam, and the Government does not believe it has any legal obligation to obtain or review the\ninvestigative files of those agencies. As discussed belou, houever, the Government is\nnevertheless prepared to go significantly above and beyond its disclosure obligations by requesting\nfiles from the Florida Investigation that have at least some potential to contain materials that could\nbe relevant to the instant case, and by reviewing and producing those materials as appropriate in\nthis case.?\n? As detailed herein, during the course of its investigation, the Prosecution Team has gathered\nsome documents related to the Florida Investigation, principally consisting of the FBI Florida\nOffice’s case file for the Florida Investigation. Those materials are being treated as a part of the\nProsecution Team’s files and will be produced, to the extent covered by Rule l6 or any other\ndisclosure obligation, to the defendant in this case.\n>In addition to the Florida Investigation, the Government is aware, through public reporting\namong other means, of a number of other investigations into maters relating to Jeffrey Epstein.\nFor example, it has been publicly reported that local agencies in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Paris, and\nLondon have conducted and may still be conducting investigations into Epstein, which may\ninclude investigation into his sexual abuse of minors. There has also been public reporting\nregarding investigations into Epstein’s finances, including an investigation by the U.S. Atorney’s\nOffice in the U.S. Virgin Islands, and into the conditions of Epstein’s confinement while serving\nhis sentence follouing the Florida Investigation. Additionally, the USAO-SDNY conducted an\ninvestigation into Epstein’s suicide and is currently prosecuting two corrections officers as a result\nof that investigation. See United States v. Noel and Thomas, l9 Cr. 83o (AT). Separately, the FBI\nFlorida Office investigated and ultimately <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> an employee of Epstein’s named Alfredo\nRodriguez for obstruction of justice, see United States v. Alfredo Rodriguez, lo Cr. 8ool5 (KAM),\nand the Prosecution Team has received some files from that case. The Government does not intend\nto further seek out or review the investigative files of any such cases, which are completely\nunrelated to the subject mater of the instant prosecution and/or have been conducted by entities\nthat are not part of this Prosecution Team and, in some instances, the Department of Justice.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool79o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002133.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-22 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 9 of 3o\nWilliam JULIE\navocat a la cour — atorney at law\n\n- The Minister of Foreign Affairs first verifies that the file is properly constituted in\naccordance with the requirements of the Extradition Treaty. The Minister of Foreign\nAffairs only verifies that the request contains all the required documents.\n\n- The file is then transmited to the Minister of Justice, which verifies the regularity\nof the request.

The Court recognized the defense\narguments that the defendant did not leave the United States after Epstein’s arrest and was in\ncontact with the Government through counsel, but emphasized that the defendant may have\nexpected that she would not be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>. (Tr. 84-85). The Court also noted that the defendant\n“did not provide the government with her whereabouts,” and that the “[c]ircumstances of her arrest\n... may cast some doubt on the claim that she was not hiding from the government, a claim that\nshe makes throughout the papers and here today, but even if true, the reality that Ms. Maxwell may\nface such serious charges herself may not have set in until she was actually indicted.” (Tr. 85).\nBased on all of those factors, the Court found that the Government had carried its burden of\ndemonstrating that the defendant “poses a substantial actual risk of flight.” (Tr. 86).\n\nThe Court then concluded that “even the most restrictive conditions of release would be\ninsufficient” to ensure the defendant’s appearance. (/d.). Acknouledging that the defense’s initial\nbail package represented only a fraction of the defendant’s assets, the Court found that “even a\nsubstantially larger package would be insufficient.” (/d.). Although the defendant “apparently\nfailed to submit a full accounting or even close to full accounting of her financial situation,” the\nCourt implicitly rejected the defense’s offer to provide additional information by determining that\n““/e/ven if the picture of her financial resources were not opaque, as it is, detention would still be\nappropriate.” (Tr. 86-87 (emphasis added)). That conclusion was informed not only by the\ndefendant’s “significant financial resources,” but also her “demonstrated sophistication in hiding\nthose resources and herself.” (Tr. 87). “Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide\nfrom the press and the public,” the Court emphasized that the defendant’s “recent conduct\nunderscores her extraordinary capacity to evade detection, even in the face of what the defense has\nacknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (/d.). Given that sophistication,\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l69\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002511.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 8 of 26\nresolved the allegations against himself and any potential co-conspirator. Faced with significant\npublic pressure, the government broke that agreement and brought an indictment against Epstein,\nand only Epstein, in 2ol6. The charges were ultimately dismissed because Epstein died while in\nfederal custody. Left with no fish to atempt to fry, the government, belatedly, turned to Ms.\nMaxwell.\n\nIt is inexcusable that decades have passed while the government investigated Epstein,\nresolved the allegations against him by plea and non-prosecution agreements, and then changed\ncourse when these agreements were atacked by plaintiffs’ lawyers who fueled the media fenzy.\nThis dithering has alloued memories to be corrupted, conflated, and confabulated. Documents\nhave been destroyed, altered, and lost. Witnesses have died, moved, and become afraid of\ndiscussing these maters for fear of media vilification or, as with Ms. Maxwell, tactical\nindictment by default. Meanwhile, the Epstein story continues to occupy the public’s atention\nwith various iterations and conflations including multiple books, podcasts, and television series\navailable to alleged witnesses, posers, atention-seekers, copy-cats, and opportunists for study\nand exploitation.\n\nThe primary guarantees against excessive preindictment delay and the prosecution of\noverly stale criminal charges are statutes of limitation for criminal offenses. United States v.\nLawson, 683 F.2d 688, 694 (2d Cir. l982). Ms. Maxwell has separately moved to dismiss Counts\nOne through Four of the Indictment because those counts were brought after the expiration of the\napplicable statute of limitation, l8 U.S.C.A. § 3282, which provides, in relevant part, that “no\nperson shall be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>, tried, or punished for any offense, not capital, unless the indictment\nis found or the information is instituted within five years next after such offense shall have been\ncommited.” The government will argue that a much longer statute of limitation applies to the\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo25ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002587.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l5 of 38\nId. Thus, the NPA limits the benefit to Epstein to immunity “in this District.”\n\nNext, the NPA sets forth l3 provisions labeled “Terms of the Agreement.” These include\nthe details of Epstein’s guilty plea and proposed sentence in the Florida state court, as well as\nEpstein’s agreement to waive his right to contest jurisdiction, liability, and damages up to an\nagreed-upon amount in certain civil actions brought by identified victims. NPA at 3-5.\n\nIn the paragraph follouing the “Terms of the Agreement,” the NPA provides that\n“Epstein understands that the United States Atorney has no authority to require the State\nAtorney’s Office to abide by” the NPA. NPA at 5. This section further provides that Epstein\nretains the obligation to obtain the State Atorney’s Office’s compliance with the NPA’s\nprocedures, “which compliance will be necessary to satisfy the United States’ interest,” and to\nconvince the Florida state court to accept the proposed sentence. NPA at 5. The section contains\nno similar provision regarding compliance by other USAOs outside the SDFL.\n\nThe NPA then lays out the provision at issue in this motion:\n\nIn consideration of Epstein’s agreement to plead guilty and to provide\n\ncompensation in the manner described above, if Epstein successfully fulfills all of\n\nthe terms and conditions of this agreement, the United States also agrees that it\n\nwill not institute any criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of\n\nEpstein, including but not limited to Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, Lesley Groff, or\n\nNadia Marcinkova.\n\nNPA at 5 (emphasis added). Unlike the provision that Epstein will not be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> “in this\nDistrict” (id. at 2), the sentence regarding co-conspirators contains no provision limiting co-\nconspirators’ immunity to the SDFL. Unlike the agreement that Epstein will not be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>\nfor “offenses that have been the subject of the joint investigation” and “offenses that arose from\nthe Federal Grand Jury investigation” (id. at 2), the sentence regarding co-conspirators contains\nno limitation on the scope of conduct for which “potential co-conspirators of Epstein” cannot be\n\nlo\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2587\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002588.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l6 of 38\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>. Nor does the NPA contain any language limiting its binding effect on other USAOs,\nas standard agreements typically do.\n\nB. The Negotiation of the NPA\n\nUnlike standard non-prosecution agreements, the NPA here was heavily negotiated.\nNegotiations began in January 2oo7, lasted for a period of eight months, and were “extensive.”\nIn re Wild, 955 F.3d ll96, ll98-99 (llth Cir.), reh’g en banc granted, opinion vacated, 967\nF.3d l285 (llth Cir. 2o2o).

Privilege Log, Doe v. United States, Case No. 9:o8-CV-8o736 (S.D.\nFla.), Dkt. No. 2l2-l (filed July l9, 2ol3) (‘SDFL Privilege Log”), at 4, 5, 7.

Because there is no such language in the\nNPA here, Ms. Maxwell’s position is entirely consistent with these cases, and they counsel in\nfavor of enforcement of the NPA in this case.\n\nOther Second Circuit cases citing Annabi also support Ms. Maxwell’s position. In United\nStates v. Broun, No. 99-l23o(L), 2oo2 WL 34244994 (2d Cir. Apr. 26, 2oo2), the defendants\nrelied solely on their “subjective beliefs” and “implicit understanding” that they would not be\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> further in another district, which the court held irrelevant; they cited no “affirmative\nappearance” in support of their position, as Ms. Maxwell has. And in Russo, the court found it\nunnecessary to reach Annabi, but acknouledged that an “affirmative appearance” of an intent to\nbind other USAOs can be found even where a plea agreement does not contain an express\nstatement to that effect—an interpretation that supports Ms. Maxwell’s position that the NPA\nbinds the government here. Russo, 8ol F.2d at 626.\n\nc. To the extent that Annabi conflicts with Eleventh Circuit law,\nEleventh Circuit law applies and would require enforcement of the\nNPA here.\n\nUnder federal choice-of-law rules, which apply in non-diversity cases, factors in\ndetermining which jurisdiction’s contract law applies include (i) any choice-of-law provision in\nthe contract; (ll) the place where the contract was negotiated, issued, and signed; (ili) the place of\nperformance; (iv) the location of the subject mater of the contract; and (v) the domicile,\nresidence, nationality, place of incorporation, and place of business of the parties. Advani\nEnters., Inc. v. Underwriters at Lloyds, l4o F.3d l57, l62 (2d Cir. l998). New York conflict-of-\nlaw rules similarly require that the law of the jurisdiction with the most significant contacts and\ngreatest interest governs the construction of a contract.

The NPA’s Prohibition on the Prosecution of Potential Co-Conspirators Is\nNot Limited to Prosecution for Conduct Between 2ool and 2oo7 or for\nParticular Statutory Offenses.\n\nFinally, the government has characterized the NPA’s co-conspirator immunity provision\nas “limited by its terms to conduct spanning from 2ool to 2oo7 . . . and to violations of statutes\nnot charged in this Indictment.” Reply Mem. at 5-6. This characterization is grossly inaccurate.\nThe co-conspirator immunity provision contains no limitation as to either the time period or the\nstatutes on which such criminal charges might be based.’\n\nJust as the NPA deviates from the standard agreement in failing to include language\nlimiting its scope to the SDFL, it also deviates from the standard agreement by failing to specify\nthe conduct, including the time period, for which the putative defendant—or, in this case,\npotential co-conspirators—cannot be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>. As with its failure to limit the co-conspirator\nimmunity provision to the SDFL, the government may not nou rewrite the NPA to limit the\nscope of covered conduct in a manner that it failed to do in drafting the NPA. At minimum, the\nabsence of any such limitation renders the scope of the provision ambiguous, and any ambiguity\nmust be construed against the government. See Feldman, 939 F.3d at l89.\n\nWhile the NPA’s factual recitals reference the 2ool-o7 time period and list five potential\nstatutory offenses, the NPA’s substantive provisions establish no such limit on the immunity for\npotential co-conspirators—or, for that mater, for Epstein himself—to either that time period or\nthose offenses. As to Epstein, the NPA provides immunity for (i) “any offenses that arose” from\nthe undefined “Federal Grand Jury investigation” and (i) “any other offenses that have been the\nsubject of the joint investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States\n“The government's assertion that the co-conspirator immunity provision is limited to “violations of statutes not\ncharged in this Indictment” (Reply Mem. at 6) is incorrect for the additional reason that both the NPA and the\ncurrent indictment (“Indictment”) reference violations of the Mann Act. Compare NPA at | (citing l8 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 2422(b), 2423(b), 2423(e)) with Indictment {J lo (alleging conspiracy to violate § 2422(a)) and l5 (alleging\nconspiracy to violate § 2423(a)).\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo26o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002604.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 32 of 38\nAtorney’s Office.” NPA at 2. The later investigation, in turn, encompasses not only “offenses”\nfrom the 2ool-o7 time period, but also “Epstein’s background.” /d. at l. Thus, for example,\nprosecution of Epstein for a pre-2ool offense that arose out of the FBI/USAO investigation into\nEpstein’s background, or for an unlisted statutory offense that arose from the grand jury\ninvestigation, would have been prohibited under the NPA.\n\nThe co-conspirator immunity provision does not include even those broad limitations. It\nprovides, simply, that the United States will not “institute any criminal charges against any\npotential co-conspirators of Epstein.” Jd. at 5 (emphasis added). The provision could not be\nclearer, either on its face or in the context of the NPA as a whole. As with the absence of\nlanguage limiting the provision to prosecution in the SDFL, the absence of any language limiting\nthe offenses for which potential co-conspirators cannot be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>, when such language is\nincluded as to Epstein, must be presumed under contract interpretation principles to have been\nintentional. See, e.g., LaSalle Bank, 424 F.3d at 2o6; Port Consol., 826 F. App’x at 827-28. At\nminimum, the silence as to time period and covered conduct is an ambiguity and therefore should\nbe resolved against the government. Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x at 269.\n\nEven if the NPA were construed as placing some limitation on co-conspirator immunity,\nno rational limitation could exclude the conduct alleged here. The charges against Ms. Maxwell\ninvolve her alleged role as a co-conspirator of Epstein, involving alleged conduct almost\nidentical to the alleged conduct that led up to the NPA. Indeed, the United States Atorney for\nthis District, in announcing the current indictment, described it as “the prequel to the earlier case\nwe brought against Jeffrey Epstein.” See, e.g., Dienst, J., Valiquete, J., Winter, T., and\nFitzpatrick, S. “Jeffrey Epstein Confidante Ghislaine Maxwell Arrested on Sex Abuse Charges.”\nNBC New York.

For the very same reasons, the Jencks Act and\n4o4(b) evidence should be produced to the defense no later than March l2, 2o2l.\n\nFor the reasons set forth belou, the Court should grant Ms. Maxwell’s request for a bill\nof particulars and her other requests for pretrial disclosures.\nI. Motion for a Bill of Particulars\n\nMs. Maxwell requests that the Court direct the government to file a Bill of Particulars,\npursuant to Rule 7(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, because the Superseding\nIndictment does not sufficiently inform her of the nature of the charges against her. Counts One\nthrough Four of the indictment make vague and unspecified allegations that Ms. Maxwell\npurportedly enticed and caused unidentified individuals to travel to engage in illegal sex acts\nover a four-year period. But they provide no specifics about when these events supposedly took\nplace or what constituted the alleged illegal sex acts. Indeed, it is nou almost seven months\nsince Ms. Maxwell was arrested and the government s/i// has not even disclosed the identities of\nthe three accusers that form the core of the government’s case against her in Counts One through\nFour. Nor has the government alleged why Ms. Maxwell’s supposedly perjurious responses to\nthe deposition questions set forth in Counts Five and Six were material to the defamation\nproceeding in which they arose. Ms. Maxwell cannot hope to investigate these allegations and\nadequately prepare for trial with such limited information. A bill of particulars is therefore\nwarranted.\n\nRule 7(f) permits a defendant to seek a bill of particulars “in order to identify with\nsufficient particularity the nature of the charge pending against him, thereby enabling defendant\nto prepare for trial, to prevent surprise, and to interpose a plea of double jeopardy should he be\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> a second time for the same offense.” United States v.

The defendant’s failure to offer any evidence is fatal to her claim.\n\nAlthough it is not the Government’s burden to address and rebut every innuendo or\nconclusory statement in the defendant’s motion, it is significant here that the circumstances of the\nNPA have been extensively litigated in a civil lawsuit, and have also been investigated by the\nDepartment of Justice’s Office of Professional Responsibility (“OPR”), resulting in a report of\nOPR’s findings (the “OPR Report).© The records of both maters provide no support for the\ndefendant’s claims.\n\nThe OPR Report notes that the USAO-SDFL periodically consulted with the Chief of the\nDepartment of Justice Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (“CEOS”), Andrew Oosterban,\nduring the investigation and plea discussions, and that the CEOS Chief atended a meeting with\ndefense counsel, during which defense counsel made a pitch that Epstein should not be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>.\nNovember 2o2o Report, United States Department of Justice, Office of Professional\nResponsibility, at 6l-62.

In any event,\nthe involvement of Main Justice alone would not begin to establish the very different proposition\nthat Main Justice viewed the NPA as binding any district other than USAO-SDFL, let alone\nspecifically considered and approved such an outcome, or communicated such a promise to\nEpstein.\n\nFurther still, the record in the civil case makes clear that the USAO-SDFL’s position was\n\nthat the NPA did not bind other districts. In a July 5, 2ol3 brief, the USAO-SDFL stated:\n\n[T]he Non-Prosecution agreement simply obligated the government\n\nnot to prosecute Epstein in the Southern District of Florida for the\n\noffenses set forth in the Non-Prosecution Agreement. The Non-\n\nProsecution Agreement does not bar the United States from bringing\n\nfederal criminal charges against Epstein for the offenses set forth in\n\nthe Non-Prosecution Agreement in any other district in the\n\nnation. Neither does the Non-Prosecution Agreement bar\n\nprosecution in any district for offenses not identified in the\n\nagreement.\nGovernment Brief, o8 Civ. 8o736 (KAM), Dkt. No. 2o5-2, at lo-ll (S.D. Fla.) (emphasis in\noriginal); see also OPR Report at 8l, n.l25 (observing that a supervisor at the USAO-SDFL\n“pointed out that the NPA was not a ‘global resolution’ and other co-conspirators could have been\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> ‘by any other [U.S. Atorney’s] office in the country.’”).\n\nAs the USAO-SDFL has explained, the NPA did not bind other districts, and could not.\n\nThat is because the USAO-SDFL lacked the authority to do so under applicable Department of\nJustice guidelines:\n\nSignificantly, under the governing provision of the United States\n\nAtorney’s Manual, the USAO-SDFL did not have the authority to\n\nunilaterally bar Epstein’s prosecution in any other district in the\n\ncountry: ‘No district or division shall make any agreement,\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2974\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002990.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 56 of 239\nof § 35o9(k) applied to conduct predating its enactment in l99o)). The Eighth Circuit’s\nreasoning—which addressed earlier versions of the statute—applies with equal, if not greater,\nforce to the 2oo3 amendment, which established an even broader statute of limitations. Follouing\nJeffries, the Ninth Circuit has similarly held that Section 3283 applies retroactively, because\n“Congress evinced a clear intent to extend” the statute of limitations. Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d at\n924 (citing Jeffries, 4o5 F.3d at 685).\nNot only does the wording of the statute clearly express that Congress intended for the\n\n2oo3 amendment to be the only governing statute of limitations for live claims of child sexual\nabuse, but the legislative history also supports this conclusion. The Joint Report accompanying\nthe 2oo3 amendment explains that Congress wanted to expand the statute of limitations out of\nconcern that the l994 amendment did not go far enough to ensure that perpetrators of child sexual\nabuse were held to account:\n\nWhile [the statute of limitations allouing for prosecution until the\n\nvictim reaches age 25] is beter than a flat five-year rule [under\n\nSection 3282], it remains inadequate in many cases. For example, a\n\nperson who abducted and raped a child could not be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>\n\nbeyond this extended limit — even if DNA matching conclusively\n\nidentified him as the perpetrator one day after the victim turned 25.\nH.R. Conf. Rep. No. lo8-66, at 54 (2oo3). Congress’s express intention was to prevent\nperpetrators of crimes against children from escaping justice based on a timing technicality.\nMoreover, since the 2oo3 amendment extended the statute of limitations throughout the lifetime\nof the victim, it is clear that Congress expressly authorized prosecutions to occur decades after\ncrimes had been commited.!3\n‘8 Although the defendant claims that prosecuting her crimes nou presents unique fairness\nconcerns, there is nothing unusual about prosecuting sex crimes long after they have occurred.\nSee, e.g., United States v.

Goldberger, together with Gerald Lefcourt, a nationally knoun New York criminal\ndefense atorney also representing Epstein, then directed their efforts at Belohlavek and Krischer\nto dissuade the office from prosecuting Epstein, largely by atacking the credibility of the victim\nwitnesses.\n\nMeanwhile, the State Atorney’s Office took the unusual step of preparing to present the\ncase to a grand jury.

PBPD Chief Reiter Becomes Concerned with the State Atorney’s Office’s\n\nHandling of the State Investigation and Seeks a Federal Investigation\n\nIn 2oo6, PBPD Chief Reiter perceived that Krischer’s atitude had changed and, according\n\nto Reiter’s statements in his 2oo9 deposition, Krischer said that he did not believe the victims were\ncredible. Reiter was disturbed when Krischer suggested that the PBPD issue a notice for Epstein\nto appear in court on misdemeanor charges, leading Reiter to begin questioning Krischer’s\nobjectivity and the State Atorney’s Office’s approach to the case. As Reiter explained in his\ndeposition:\n\nThis was a case that I felt absolutely needed the atention of the State\n\nAtorney’s Office, that needed to be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> in state court. It’s\n\nnot generally something that’s <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> in a federal court. And I\n\nknew that it didn’t really mater what the facts were in this case, it\n\nwas prety clear to me that Mr. Krischer did not want to prosecute\n\nthis case.\n\nOn May l, 2oo6, Reiter submited to Krischer probable cause affidavits and a case filing\npackage relating to Epstein, one of his personal assistants, and a young local woman whom Epstein\nfirst victimized and then used to recruit other girls. In his transmital leter, which was later made\npublic, Reiter criticized Krischer, noting that he found the State Atorney’s Office’s “treatment of\nthese cases [to be] highly unusual.”!© Reiter urged Krischer “to examine the unusual course that\nyour office’s handling of this mater has taken” and to consider disqualifying himself from\nprosecuting Epstein. !’\n\nIW. THE FBI AND THE USAO INVESTIGATE EPSTEIN, AND THE DEFENSE\n\nTEAM ENGAGES WITH THE USAO\n\nA. May 2oo6 — February 2oo7: The Federal Investigation Is Initiated, and the\n\nUSAO Opens a Case File\n\nIn early 2oo6, a West Palm Beach FBI Special Agent who worked closely with\nAUSA Ann Marie Villafafia on child exploitation cases—and who is referred to in this Report as\n“the case agent”—mentioned to Villafafia in “casual conversations” having learned that the PBPD\nwas investigating a wealthy Palm Beach man who recruited minors for sexual activity. The case\nagent told Villafafia that the PBPD had reached out to the FBI because the State Atorney’s Office\nwas considering either not charging the case or allouing the defendant to plead to a misdemeanor\nls Fla. Stat. § 9o5.27 (2oo7).\n\nl6 See Larry Keller, “Palm Beach chief focus of fire in Epstein case,” Palm Beach Post, Aug. l4, 2oo6.\nM7 As noted, Krischer generally declined in his OPR interview to explain his office’s prosecutive decisions;\nhouever, regarding allegations of favoritism to Epstein’s defense counsel, Krischer told OPR, “I just don’t play that\nway.”\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003219.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 43 of 348\ncharge. Villafafia suggested meeting with the PBPD, but the case agent explained that before\nformally presenting the case to the FBI, the PBPD wanted to see hou the State Atorney’s Office\ndecided to charge Epstein.\n\nl. The PBPD Presents the Mater to the FBI and the USAO\n\nIn May 2oo6, the lead Detective handling the state’s investigation met with Villafafia and\nthe FBI case agent to summarize for them the information learned during the state’s\ninvestigation.'* At the time, neither Villafafia nor the case agent had heard of Epstein or had any\nknouledge of his background.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, during this meeting, the Detective expressed concern that “pressure\nhad been brought to bear on . . . Krischer by Epstein’s atorneys,” and he and Chief Reiter were\nconcerned the state would charge Epstein with only a misdemeanor or not at all.'? The Detective\nexplained that the defense had hired private investigators to trail Reiter and the Detective, had\nraised claims of various improprieties by the police, and, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated\nthe removal of the Assistant State Atorney initially assigned to handle the mater, who was viewed\nas an aggressive prosecutor, by hiring a defense atorney whose relationship with the Assistant\nState Atorney created a conflict of interest for the prosecutor. Further, given the missing computer\nequipment and surveillance camera videotapes, the Detective believed Epstein may have been\n“tipped off’ in advance about the search warrant.\n\nDuring the meeting, Villafafia reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could\nbe brought against Epstein. She focused on l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticement of minors into\nprostitution or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of interstate or foreign commerce\nto persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423\n(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct). As they discussed these charges, the\nDetective told Villafafia that Epstein and his assistants had traveled out of the Palm Beach\nInternational Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs sometimes referred to\npassengers as “female” without a name or age, which the Detective suspected might be references\nto underage girls. Houever, the Detective acknouledged that he was unable to confirm that\nsuspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls interstate\nor internationally. Nevertheless, Villafafia believed Epstein could be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> federally, in part\nbecause of his oun interstate and international travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse\ngirls. Villafafia discussed with the Detective and the case agent the additional investigation needed\nto prove violations of the federal statutes she had identified. She told them that if the evidence\nsupported it, the case could be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> federally, but she assured them that opening a federal\ninvestigation would not preclude the State Atorney’s Office from charging Epstein should it\nchoose to do so.\n\nl8 The Detective died in May 2ol8.\nl9 In his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein mater to the FBI, a Toun of Palm\nBeach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims\nwere not believable and “Palm Beach solves its oun problems.”\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003221.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 45 of 348\nEpstein massages that were sexual in nature, and that Epstein had used “various types of pressure”\nto avoid prosecution by the state, including hiring atorneys who had personal connections to the\nState Atorney. Villafafia said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset\nof the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely\nemploy. Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you knou people are going to be geting\ncalls about . . . you just want to make sure that they knou about it so they don’t get .. . a call from\nout of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to\nput the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t\nwant to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur” with a federal prosecution as had\noccurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected\nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s\nresources if the Office would just back doun to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,\nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.” In a later\nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and\nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal\nprosecution if the U.S. Atorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green\nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2oo6 meeting with\nVillafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not\npreviously heard of Epstein.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man\nwho was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a reasonable mater to pursue”\nfederally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told\nOPR, the USAO had <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the\nfederal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the\nexploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a\n“sreen light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have\nexplicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been\nsimply to acknouledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal\ninvestigation “sound[ed] reasonable.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein\ninvestigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Atorney’s Office had\n“abdicated their responsibility” to investigate and prosecute Epstein. In his OPR interview,\nSloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the\nState Atorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect\nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2oo6, the USAO had recently <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> wealthy and politically\nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of\nEpstein. On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and\nKevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo322l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003222.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 46 of 348\n4. Late July 2oo6: The State Indicts Epstein, and the USAO Moves\nForward with a Federal Investigation\n\nSeveral days after Villafafia spoke with Acosta and Sloman, on July l9, 2oo6, Assistant\nState Atorney Belohlavek presented the case to the state grand jury.> Krischer told OPR that\n“the whole thing” was put before the grand jury. According to a statement made at the time by the\nState Atorney’s Office spokesman, the grand jury was presented with a list of charges from highest\nto louest, without a recommendation by the prosecutor, and deliberated with the prosecutor out of\nthe room.”* The state grand jury returned an indictment charging Epstein with one count of felony\nsolicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7, a felony under state law because\nit alleged three or more instances of solicitation.” The indictment did not identify the person or\npersons solicited and made no mention of the fact that Epstein had solicited minors.”® On July 23,\n2oo6, Epstein self-surrendered to be arrested on the indictment, but was not detained, and the\ncharges were made public.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she decided to move forward with the federal investigation at that\npoint because she believed the State Atorney’s Office would permit Epstein to enter a plea to a\nreduced misdemeanor charge and that once he entered a guilty plea, the Department’s Petite policy\nmight preclude a federal prosecution.?’ Villafafia told OPR that at the time, she “definitely\nbelieved that we were going to proceed to [a federal] indictment, assuming that ...we had\nsufficient evidence.”\neS Villafafia and the FBI obtained and examined records of the state grand jury proceeding, and Lourie reviewed\nthem. Because the grand jury records have not been ordered released publicly, OPR does not discuss their substance\nin this Report.\nat Larry Keller, “Police say lawyer tried to discredit teenage girls,” Palm Beach Post, July 29, 2oo6, citing\nstatement by State Atorney’s Office spokesman Michael Edmondson.\n28 Indictment in State v. Epstein, 2oo6CF9454AXX (July l9, 2oo6), atached as Exhibit l to this Report.\n26 In pertinent part, the state indictment read, “[B]etween the lst day of August [2oo4] and October 3l, 2oo5,\n[Epstein] did solicit, induce, entice, or procure another to commit prostitution lewdness, or assignation, . . . on three\nor more occasions.” The l5-month time frame and lack of detail regarding the place or manner of the offense made\nit impossible to identify from the charging document which victim or victims served as the basis for the charge in the\nstate indictment. Belohlavek explained to OPR that the charge did not list specific victims so that she could go forward\nat trial with whichever victim or victims might be available and willing to testify at that time.\n27 The Petite policy is a set of guidelines used by federal prosecutors when considering whether to pursue federal\ncharges for defendants previously <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> for state or local offenses. The Constitution does not prohibit the federal\ngovernment from prosecuting defendants who have been charged, acquited, or convicted on state charges based on\nthe same criminal conduct. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the long-standing principle that the prohibition\nagainst double jeopardy does not apply to prosecutions brought by different sovereigns. See, e.g., Gamble v. United\nStates, 587 U.S. ___, l39 S. Ct. l96o, l966-67 (2ol9) (and cases cited therein); Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S.\nl87, l95 (l959) (and cases cited therein); and United States v. Lanza, 26o U.S. 377, 382 (l922). Nonetheless, to\nbeter promote the efficient use of criminal justice resources, the Department developed policies in l959 and l96o to\nguide federal prosecutors in the use of their charging discretion. See Chapter Two, Part Two, Section IT.A.2, for a\nmore detailed discussion of the Petite policy.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3222\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003232.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 56 of 348\nhe is comfortable before proceeding.” Menchel told Villafafia he had “trouble understanding” why\nshe was in a “rush” “given hou long this case has been pending.”\n\nOPR questioned Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta about the timeline for reviewing\nthe prosecution memorandum and the proposed charges. Acosta and Menchel believed Villafafia’s\ntimeline was unrealistic from the start. Acosta told OPR that Villafafia was “very hard charging,”\nbut her timeline for filing charges in the case was “really, really fast.” Menchel described Villafafia\nas “out over her skis a litle bit” and “ahead of” Acosta in terms of his analysis of the case.*\nMenchel said it was clear to him that Acosta “was going to be the one making the call” about\nwhether to go forward with charges, and Acosta needed more time to make a decision. Menchel\ntold OPR, “This [was] not a case [we were] going to review in two weeks and make a decision\non.” Sloman told OPR that although he did not conduct a “granular review” of the proposed\ncharges, he believed Menchel and Lourie had done so and “obviously” had concluded that “the\nfacts and the law didn’t suggest that the right thing to do was to automatically indict.” Lourie told\nOPR that he believed “the case was moving ahead.”\n\nVillafafia continued to seek direction from her managers. On May l5, 2oo7, she emailed\nSloman, noting that “[i]t seemed from our discussion yesterday that pestering Alex [Acosta] will\nnot do any good. Am I right about that?” Sloman responded, “Yes.” On May 2l, 2oo7, three\nweeks after submiting the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia emailed Sloman and Menchel\nasking for “a sense of the direction where we are headed-i.e., approval of an indictment something\nlike the current draft, a complaint to allou for pre-indictment negotiations, an indictment\ndrastically different from the current draft?” Sloman responded only, “Taken care of.’\n\nD. Defense Counsel Seek a Meeting with Senior USAO Managers, which\n\nVillafatia Opposes\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein’s defense counsel continued to seek additional information about the\nfederal investigation and a meeting with senior USAO managers, including Acosta. In a May lo,\n2oo7 email to Menchel, Lourie reported that Epstein’s atorneys “want me to tell them the statutes\na Villafafia explained to OPR that the “rush” related to her concern that Epstein was continuing to abuse girls:\n“Tn terms of the issue of why the hurry, because child sex offenders don’t stop until they’re behind bars. That was our\ntime concern.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia offering this explanation to him. OPR\nnotes that in their respective statements to OPR and in their comments on OPR’s draft report, Menchel and Villafafia\nexpressed contradictory accounts or interpretations of certain events. When it was necessary for OPR to resolve those\nconflicts in order to reach its findings and conclusions, OPR considered the extensive documentary record and the\ntestimony of other subjects and witnesses, to the extent available.\n\na Sloman similarly recalled that Menchel thought Villafafia was “ahead of where the office was internally” and\nthat caused “discontent” between Villafafia and Menchel. Villafafia was not the only one, houever, who was surprised\nthat the indictment was not approved immediately. The case agent told OPR that it seemed “everything changed”\nafter Villafafia submited the prosecution memorandum, and the momentum touards an indictment abated. Villafafia’s\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that from her perspective, it appeared “Miami didn’t want the case <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>.”\nHouever, Menchel rebuked Villafafia in his July 5, 2oo7 email to her for having “led the agents to believe that [filing\ncharges in] this mater was a foregone conclusion.”\n\n46 Sloman could not recall during his OPR interview what he meant by this remark, but he speculated that he\nhad spoken to Menchel, and Menchel was going to take care of it.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3232\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003233.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 57 of 348\nwe are contemplating so Dershouitz can tell us why they don’t apply.”*” Lourie told Menchel, “I\ndon’t see the dounside,” but added, “Marie is against it.’ Menchel responded that it was\n“premature” to provide the information. During his OPR interview, Menchel could not specifically\nrecall why he believed it was “premature” to provide the defense with the requested information,\nbut speculated that it was too soon after the prosecution memorandum had been circulated for\nAcosta to have made a decision about hou he wanted to proceed. This recollection is consistent\nwith the May 2oo7 emails reflecting that Acosta wanted time to consider the proposed prosecution.\n\nOn May 22, 2oo7, defense counsel Lefcourt emailed Lourie a leter to “confirm” that\nEpstein’s atorneys would be given an opportunity to meet with Lourie before the USAO reached\na final decision on charging Epstein. Lourie forwarded the leter to Menchel and Sloman, but\nnoted that Epstein’s defense team was “really ready for the next level,” rather than another meeting\nwith him. Lourie suggested that Menchel meet with defense counsel, adding, “Whether Alex\nwould be present or grant them another meeting after that is his call.” Lourie also emailed\nLefcourt, clarifying that Lourie had not promised to call Epstein’s counsel before filing charges,\nand suggesting that Epstein’s counsel make their next presentation to Menchel.\n\nAlthough Lourie’s emails shou that he had no objection to more senior USAO managers\nmeeting with defense counsel, Villafafia opposed such a meeting. Several emails indicate that\nMenchel traveled to West Palm Beach to meet with Lourie and Villafafia on the afternoon of\nMay 23, 2oo7.8 On that same date, Villafafia drafted an email, which she planned to send to\nSloman and Menchel, expressing her disagreement with meeting with defense counsel. Although\nthe email was writen for Sloman and Menchel, Villafafia sent it as a draft only to her immediate\nsupervisor, seeking her “guidance and counsel” as to hou to proceed.\n\nHi Jeff and Mat — I just want to again voice my disagreement with\n\npromising to have a meeting or having a meeting with Lefcourt or\n\nany other of Epstein’s atorneys. As I mentioned, this is not a case\n\nwhere we will be siting doun to negotiate whether a defendant will\n\nserve one year versus two years of probation. This is a case where\n\nthe defendant is facing the possibility of dozens of years of prison\n\ntime. Just as the defense will defend a case like that differently than\n\nthey would handle a probation-type case, we need to handle this case\n\ndifferently. Part of our prosecution strategy was already disclosed\n\nat the last meeting, and I am concerned that more will be disclosed\n\nat a future meeting.\n\nMy co-chair . . . who has <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> more of these cases than the\n\nrest of us combined and who actually worked on the drafting of\n\nsome of the child exploitation statutes, also opposes a meeting. We\n\nhave been accused of not being “strategic thinkers” because of our\nae Dershouitz had jomed Lefcourt and Sanchez in representing Epstein for the federal case.\n48 During her OPR interview, Villafafia could not recall the meeting with specificity, but believed the purpose\nwas to discuss whether the USAO should agree to additional meetings with Epstein’s counsel. Menchel, similarly,\ntold OPR that he could not remember anything specific about the meeting.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3233\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003234.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 58 of 348\nopposition to these meetings, but we are simply looking at this case\nas a violent crime prosecution involving stiff penalties rather than as\na white collar or public corruption case where the parties can\namicably work out a light sentence.”\n\nWith respect to the “policy reasons” that Lefcourt wants to discuss,\nthose were already raised in his leter (which is part of the indictment\npackage) and during his meeting with Andy and myself. Those\nreasons are: (l) he wants the Petit [sic] policy to trump our ability\nto prosecute Epstein, (2) this shouldn’t be a federal offense, and\n(3) the victims were willing participants so the crime shouldn’t be\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> at all. Unless the Office thinks that any of those\narguments will be persuasive, a meeting will not be beneficial to the\nprosecution, it will only benefit the defense. With respect to\nLefcourt’s promised legal analysis, that also has already been\nprovided. The only way to get additional analysis is to expose to the\ndefense the other charges that we are considering. In my opinion\nthis would seriously undermine the prosecution.\n\nThe defense is anxious to have a meeting in order to delay the\ninvestigation/prosecution, to find out more about our investigation,\nand to use political pressure to stop the investigation.\n\nI have no control over the Office’s decisions regarding whether to\nmeet with the defense or to whom the facts and analysis of the case\nwill be disclosed. Houever, if you all do decide to go forward with\nthese meetings in a way that is detrimental to the investigation, then\nI will have to ask to have the case reassigned to an AUSA who is in\nagreement with the handling of the case.\n\nAfter receiving this draft, the immediate supervisor cautioned Villafafia, “Let’s talk before\nthis is sent, please.”°° Villafafia told OPR that the supervisor counseled Villafafia not to send the\nemail to Sloman or Menchel because Villafafia could be viewed as insubordinate. She also told\nVillafafia that if Villafafia did not stay with the case, “the case would go away” and Epstein “would\nnever serve a day in jail.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that at that point in time, she believed the USAO was preparing to file\ncharges against Epstein despite agreeing to accommodate the defense request for meetings. She\nalso told OPR, on the other hand, that she feared the USAO was “going doun the same path that\nthe State Atorney’s Office had gone doun.” Villafafia believed the purpose of the defense request\na In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel noted Menchel’s view that the nature of a\ndefendant’s crimes and potential penalty does not affect whether prosecutors are willing to meet with defense counsel\nto discuss the merits of a case.\n\n5o The immediate supervisor recalled telling Villafafia that she and Villafafia were “not driving the ship,” and\nonce “the bosses” made the decision, “there’s nothing else you can do.”\n32\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3234\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003256.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 8o of 348\nthe period of imprisonment, because the USAO failed to hold firm to its proposal of “at least two\nyears in prison.” The USAO did, houever, consistently reject defense proposals to change other\nterms, particularly the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender.\n\nA. July 3l, 2oo7: The USAO Presents Its Proposal to the Defense Team, which\n\nMakes a Counteroffer\n\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, Villafafia, and the case agents met with Epstein atorneys\nLefcourt, Sanchez, and Black on July 3l, 2oo7, with Menchel “leading the meeting” for the\nUSAO.*’’ The USAO presented the term sheet, and Villafafia distributed a federal sentencing\nguidelines calculation shouing that if <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> federally, Epstein faced a sentencing range of\nl88 to 235 months’ incarceration.\n\nVillafafia recalled that during the meeting, Epstein’s atorneys opposed the requirement of\nsexual offender registration, argued that Epstein would not be safe in prison, suggested that Epstein\nserve a sentence of home confinement or “community control”*® in licu of incarceration, and\nemphasized that a state resolution provided greater sentencing flexibility.*’ Villafafia told OPR\nthat when Epstein’s atorneys expressed concern during the meeting about Epstein’s security in a\nstate prison and argued for a home confinement sentence, Menchel suggested Epstein plead to a\nfederal charge so that he could serve his time in a federal facility. A few days after the meeting,\nVillafafia emailed Menchel, stating that she had “figured out a way to do a federal plea with a 2-l/2\nyear cap.”\n\nAlthough Acosta had authorized a plea to state charges, emails and other correspondence\nshou that during the negotiations, the parties also considered structuring a plea around federal\ney Villafafia was the only witness with whom OPR spoke who had a substantive memory of this meeting.\n\n88 According to the Florida Department of Corrections fact sheet for defendants subjected to community control,\n\nThe Community Control supervision program was created as a diversion to\n\nincarceration or imprisonment; therefore it is an intensive supervision program\n\nwhere you are confined to your home unless you are working, atending school,\n\nperforming public service hours, participating in treatment or another special\n\nactivity that has been approved in advance by your officer.

We did not.” Villafafia anticipated there would be ways to “manipulate” a state\nsentence and the USAO would be “giving up all control,” and she told OPR that she discussed this concern with\nLourie, although she could not recall when that discussion occurred.\n\n54\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3256\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003264.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 88 of 348\nVillafafia added that the PBPD Chief had alerted the FBI that an upcoming news article would\nreport that Epstein was “going to plead to a state charge” and the PBPD Chief “wanted to knou if\nthe victims had been consulted about the deal.” Sloman forwarded Villafafia’s email to Acosta\nwith a note that read simply, “fyi.”\n\nLater that evening, Villafafia circulated to Sloman, Lourie, and Oosterban two alternative\ndocuments: a draft federal plea agreement and a draft NPA.!” The draft federal plea agreement,\nfollouing the USAO’s standard format, called for Epstein to plead guilty to a five-year conspiracy\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 37l to entice minors to engage in prostitution, an offense requiring registration\nas a sexual offender, with a Rule ll(c) binding sentence of two years’ imprisonment. The draft\nNPA contained the terms presented to the defense team on July 3l, 2oo7, and called for Epstein to\nenter a state plea by September 28, 2oo7. Villafafia told OPR that because she had never seen a\nnon-prosecution agreement before, she relied on a template she found either using USAO or the\nDepartment’s internal online resources, but she did not do any additional research regarding the\nuse of non-prosecution agreements. !°!\n\n3. September 7, 2oo7: Acosta, Other USAO Atorneys, and FBI\nSupervisors Meet with Epstein Atorneys Starr, Lefkouitz, and\nSanchez\n\nOn Friday, September 7, 2oo7, Acosta, Sloman, Villafafia, Villafafia’s co-counsel,\nOosterban, and one or two supervisory FBI agents met at the USAO’s West Palm Beach office\nwith defense atorneys Sanchez and, for the first time, Starr and Lefkouitz.' This was Acosta’s\nfirst meeting with Epstein’s defense team. Villafafia understood the purpose of this meeting was\nto afford Epstein’s counsel an opportunity to “make a pitch” as to why the case should not be\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> federally. Villafafia recalled that at a “pre-meet” before defense counsel arrived,\nAcosta did not express concern about the viability of the prosecution or the strength of the case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that the meeting was not “‘a negotiation,” but a chance for the defense to\npresent their arguments, which were made by Starr and focused primarily on federalism. Villafafia\nsimilarly recalled that the meeting mainly consisted of the defense argument that the Epstein case\nshould remain a state mater in which the USAO should not interfere. Both Villafafia and her\nco-counsel recalled that Starr addressed himself directly to Acosta, and that Starr, who had held\nSenate-confirmed positions in the government, commented to Acosta that he and Acosta were “the\nonly people in this room who have run the [gantlet] of confirmation by the Senate.” Acosta did\nnot recall the comment, but he told OPR, “[B]Jack in July, we had decided that we were going\nChapter Three, the Department’s position at the time was that victim consultation was not required in maters in which\nthe government did not pursue a federal charge.

During September 2oo7, he was traveling between Florida and Washington, D.C.,\nas he transitioned to his new detail post as Principal Deputy Assistant Atorney General and Chief of Staff to the head\nof the Department’s Criminal Division, Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher.

Sloman similarly said that he had the impression that the non-prosecution provision\nwas meant to protect named co-conspirators who were also victims, “in a sense,” of Epstein’s\nconduct. Although later press coverage of the Epstein case focused on Epstein’s connection to\nprominent figures and suggested that the non-prosecution provision protected these individuals,\nSloman told OPR that it never occurred to him that the reference to potential co-conspirators was\ndirected touard any of the high-profile individuals who were at the time or subsequently linked\nwith Epstein.'”° Acosta did not recall the provision or any discussions about it. He speculated\nthat if he read the non-prosecution provision, he likely assumed that Villafafia and Lourie had\n“thought this through” and “addressed it for a reason.” The West Palm Beach manager, who had\nonly limited involvement at this stage, told OPR that the provision was “highly unusual,” and he\nhad “‘no clue” why the USAO agreed to it.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, apart from the women named in the NPA, the investigation had\nnot developed evidence of “any other potential co-conspirators. So, . . . we wouldn’t be\nprosecuting anybody else, so why not include it? ... I just didn’t think that there was anybody\nthat it would cover.” She conceded, houever, that she “did not catch the fact that it could be read\nas broadly as people have since read it.”\n\nK. The USAO Rejects Defense Efforts to Eliminate the Sexual Offender\n\nRegistration Requirement\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, State Atorney Krischer informed\nVillafafia that Epstein’s counsel had contacted him and Epstein was ready to agree “to all the\nterms” of the NPA—except for sexual offender registration. According to Krischer, defense\ncounsel had proposed that registration be deferred, and that Epstein register only if state or federal\nlaw enforcement felt, at any point during his service of the sentence, that he needed to do so.\nKrischer noted that he had “reached out” to Acosta about this proposal but had not heard back\nfrom him. Villafafia responded, “T think Alex is calling you nou.” Villafafia told OPR that, to her\nknouledge, Acosta called Krischer to tell him that registration was not a negotiable term. !*°\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia emailed Krischer for information about the amount of “gain\ntime” Epstein would earn in state prison. Villafafia explained in her email that she wanted to\ninclude a provision in the NPA specifying that Epstein “will actually be in jail at least a certain\nnumber of days to make sure he doesn’t try to ‘convince’ someone with the Florida prison\nauthorities to let him out early.” Krischer responded that under the proposal as it then stood,\nEpstein would serve l5 months. He also told Villafafia that a plea to a registrable offense would\nnot prevent Epstein from serving his time “at the stockade”—the local minimum security detention\nfacility.!?7\nl25 Sloman also pointed out that the NPA was not a “global resolution” and other co-conspirators could have\nbeen <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> “by any other [U.S. Atorney’s] office in the country.”\n\nl26 Krischer told OPR that he did not recall meeting or having interactions with Acosta regarding the Epstein\ncase or any other mater.\nal The State Atorney concluded his email: “Glad we could get this worked out for reasons I won’t put in\nwriting. After this is resolved I would love to buy you a cup at Starbucks and have a conversation.” Villafafia\nresponded, “Sounds great.” When asked about this exchange during her OPR interview, Villafafia said: “Everybody\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3283\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003347.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l7l of 348\nand guaranteed sexual offender registration by Epstein . . . were\namong the factors [that led to the NPA].7\"\n\nDuring her OPR interview, Villafafia similarly described the victims’ general reluctance to\ngo forward with a trial:\n\n[W]hen we would meet with victims, we would ask them hou they\nwanted the case to be resolved. And most of them wanted the case\nto be resolved via a plea. Some of them wanted him not to be\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> at all. Most of them did not want to have to come to\ncourt and testify. They were very worried about their privacy\nrights.'°\n\nIn his writen response to OPR, Lourie stated that although he did not specifically recall\nthe issues Villafafia set forth in her declaration, he believed they would have been important to the\nUSAO in 2oo7. Lourie also told OPR that he generally recalled concerns within the USAO about\nthe charges and a potential trial:\n\n[M]y vague recollection is that I and others had concerns that there\n\nwas a substantial chance we would not prevail at both trial and on\n\nappeal after a conviction, resulting in no jail time, no criminal\n2l5 Doe v. United States, No. 9:o8-cv-8o736 (S.D. Fla.), Declaration of A. Marie Villafafia in Support of\nGovernment’s Response and Opposition to Petitioners’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Cross-Motion for\nSummary Judgment at 8-9 (June 2, 2ol7).\n2l8 These concerns are also reflected in a 2ol7 declaration filed by the FBI case agent in the CVRA litigation,\nin which she stated, “During interviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that\nEpstein be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s] victims... .\n\nA majority of the victims expressed concern about the possible disclosure of their\n\nidentities to the public. A number of the victims raised concerns about having to\n\ntestify and/or their parents finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.\n\nAdditionally, for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\n\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall, many of the\n\nvictims were troubled about the existence of the investigation. They displayed\n\nfeelings of embarrassment and humiliation and were reluctant to talk to\n\ninvestigators. Some victims who were identified through the investigation refused\n\neven to speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and geting to\n\nthe truth were always at the forefront of our handling of the investigation.\n\nIn addition, during the CVRA litigation, an atorney representing several victims filed a pleading to protect\nthe anonymity of his clients by preventing disclosure of their identities to the CVRA petitioners. See Response to\nCourt Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance (July 24, 2ol5). It is noteworthy that in\n2o2o, when OPR atempted to contact victims, through their counsel, for interviews or responses to writen questions\nregarding contacts with the USAO, OPR was informed that most of the victims were still deeply concerned about\nremaining anonymous. One victim described to OPR hou she became distraught when, during the USAO’s\ninvestigation, the FBI left a business card at her parents’ home and, as a result, her parents learned that she was a\nvictim of Epstein. At the time, the victim was a teenager; was “nervous, scared, and ashamed”; and did not want her\nparents to knou about the case.\n\nl45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3347\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003350.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l74 of 348\n\nThe USAO might have been able to surmount the evidentiary, legal, and policy issues\npresented by a federal prosecution of Epstein. Villafafia, in particular, believed she could have\nprevailed had she taken the case to trial, and even after the NPA was negotiated, she repeatedly\nrecommended declaring Epstein in breach and proceeding with an indictment, because she\ncontinued to have confidence in the case.” Oosterban and others also believed that the\ngovernment would succeed at trial. Furthermore, the victims were not a uniform group. Some of\nthem were afraid of testifying or having their identities made public; others wanted Epstein\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>, but even among those, it is not clear hou many expressed a willingness to testify at a\ntrial; and still others provided information favorable to Epstein. In the end, Acosta assumed\nresponsibility for deciding hou to resolve the Epstein investigation and weighing the risks and\nbenefits of a trial versus those of a pre-charge disposition. His determination that a pre-charge\ndisposition was appropriate was not unreasonable under the circumstances.\n\nAlthough evidentiary and witness issues explain the subject supervisors’ concerns about\nwinning a potential trial and why the USAO would have sought some sort of pre-charge\ndisposition, they do not fully explain why Acosta decided to pursue a state-based resolution as\nopposed to a traditional federal plea agreement. OPR did not find in the contemporaneous records\na memorandum or other memorialization of the reasoning underlying Acosta’s decision to offer a\nstate-based resolution or the terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7.\n\nAccording to Acosta, “In 2oo6, it would have been extremely unusual for any United States\nAtorney’s Office to become involved in a state solicitation case, even one involving underage\nteens,” because solicitation was “the province of state prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR that he\ndeveloped “a preference for deferring to the state” to “make it clear that [the USAO was] not\nstepping on something that is a purely local mater, because we [didn’t] want bad precedent for\nthe sake of the larger human trafficking issue.” Acosta also told OPR that it was his understanding\nthat the PBPD would not have brought the case to federal investigators if the State Atorney’s\nOffice had pursued a sanction against Epstein that included jail time and sexual offender\nregistration. Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in the case as limited to preventing the “manifest\ninjustice” that, in Acosta’s view, would have resulted from the state’s original plea proposal.\nAcosta acknouledged that if the investigation had begun in the federal system, he would not have\nviewed the terms set out in the NPA as a satisfactory result, but it was adequate to serve as a\n“backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he described as “a polite way of saying[,\n“|encouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]” In sum, Acosta told OPR that the Epstein case\nlay in “uncharted territory,” there was no certainty that the USAO would prevail if it went to trial,\nand a potentially unfavorable outcome had to be “weighed against a certain plea with registration\nthat would make sure that the public knew that this person was a sex offender.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he discussed the case primarily with Sloman and Menchel, and both\ntold OPR that while they did not share Acosta’s federalism concerns, they recalled that Acosta had\nthe terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7. Therefore, any allegations against the prosecutors could not have\nplayed a significant role in Acosta’s decisions as reflected in the term sheet.\n\n22o Sloman told OPR that Villafafia “always believed in the case.”\nl48\nDOJ-OGR-oooo335o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003369.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l93 of 348\nVillafafia had raised (defense counsel’s atempt to insert an immigration waiver into the\nagreement), but Lourie did not comment on the provision promising not to prosecute co-\nconspirators or ask Villafafia to explain why she believed the provision did not harm the\ngovernment’s interests. In a subsequent email about the draft NPA, Villafafia asked Lourie for\n“TaJny other thoughts,” but there is no indication that he provided further input. OPR found no\ndocument that suggested Villafafia and Lourie discussed the provision further, or that the other\nindividuals who were copied on Villafafia’s email referencing the provision—her immediate\nsupervisor, the supervisor designated to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office,\nand Villafafia’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it. Villafafia told\nOPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her observation that the non-\nprosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafafia assumed that they agreed with her assessment.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision\nagreeing not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that\ndefense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame\nfor what happened.” Villafafia told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct\nwas his oun “dirty litle secret.” Villafafia said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2oo6\narrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that\nnone of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators\nabout sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-knoun contacts about whom allegations arose\nmany years later.** Villafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime\nrelationship with a close female friend who was a well-knoun socialite, but, according to\nVillafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.”*°? Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the\nfour female assistants identified by name.”*° Villafafia also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s\ninvestigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to prosecute his four assistants if he\nentered a plea.”4! Because Villafafia was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged,\nshe perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to prosecute other, unspecified\n“co-conspirators.” Villafafia told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did\nnot occur to her that the reference to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any\nof Epstein’s influential associates.\n\nLourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the\ntime Villafafia forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR\nthat he did not knou hou the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.\n238 Villafafia told OPR that “none of . . . the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being\ninvolved in abusing them. It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\n29 The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct\ninvolving the then minor did not occur in Florida.\n\nAAO The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one\ngirl in Epstetn’s presence; this assistant was one of the named individuals for whom the defense sought the\ngovernment’s agreement not to prosecute from the outset. Villafafia explained to OPR that this individual was herself\nbelieved to also have been at one time a victim.\n\n24l Villafafia told OPR that the USAO had decided that girls who recruited other girls would not be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3369\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003388.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l2 of 348\nparties.7°° The rush to reach a resolution should not have led the USAO to agree to such a\nsignificant provision without a full consideration of the potential consequences and justification\nfor the provision. It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\nimmigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused\nmore careful consideration of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent consideration\nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\ninterpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n2n8 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified. I\njust don’t knou hou that works.” Villafafia’s co-counsel told OPR:\n\n[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed\n\nto do at the Department of Justice. ... I’ve never heard of anything of the sort... .\n\n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for\n\nexample, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense\n\nwhich was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and\n\nnobody else. I mean on rare occasion I’ve seen cases where say someone was\n\ndealing drugs and their wife was involved. ... And they’ve got kids. . . .

And so, I felt like sending them back to\nthe State Atorney’s Office was not something that they would have\nsupported.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she also recalled that some victims “expressed . . . concern about\ntheir safety,” and were worried that Epstein would find out about their participation in the\ninvestigation. In her 2ol7 declaration submited in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that the\ntwo CVRA petitioners “never communicated [their] desires to me or the FBI case agents and my\nrole was to evaluate the entire situation, consider the input received from all of the victims, and\nallou the Office to exercise its prosecutorial discretion accordingly.”*? She also noted that some\nvictims “fear[ed] having their involvement with Epstein revealed and the negative impact it would\nhave on their relationships with family members, boyfriends, and others.”\n\nIn the FBI case agent’s 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, she stated, “During\ninterviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that Epstein be\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s]\n\nvictims .... A majority of the victims expressed concern about the\n\npossible disclosure of their identities to the public. A number of the\n\nvictims raised concerns about having to testify and/or their parents\n\nfinding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein. Additionally,\n26 Villafafia created for OPR a chart listing victims identified in the state and federal investigations, with\nnotations indicating several with whom Villafafia recalled discussing their opinions about resolving the case. The\nchart, houever, does not indicate what the victims said, and Villafafia told OPR that the information contained in the\nchart was based on her memory of her interactions with each victim. OPR was unable to determine the details or\nextent of any such discussions occurring before September 24, 2oo7, because Villafafia did not have contemporaneous\nnotes of the interviews, and the FBI reports and corresponding notes of the interviews did not contain information\nabout the victims’ desired outcomes. The victims who provided information to OPR did not recall discussing potential\nresolution of the federal investigation with anyone from the government.\n282 In the declaration, Villafafia stated, “Jane Doe 2 specifically told me that she did not want Epstein\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>.”\n\n2ol\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003426.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 25o of 348\nif you have additional questions which invelve this mater, please coniact the office listed above, When\nyou call, please provide the.file number located af tha top of this leter.

The atorney\nasked Sloman if the USAO “could file criminal charges even though the state was looking into the\nmater,” but Sloman declined to answer his questions concerning the investigation.**? In late\nJanuary, the New York Post reported that the atorney’s clients had filed a $5o million civil suit\nagainst Epstein in Florida and that “Epstein is expected to be sentenced to l8 months in prison\nwhen he pleads guilty in March to a single charge of soliciting an underage prostitute.”*\n\nBetween January 3l, 2oo8, and May 28, 2oo8, the FBI, with the prosecutors, interviewed\nadditional victims and reinterviewed several who had been interviewed before the NPA was\nsigned. n late Janua , as Villafafia and the ria orney prepared to participate\n\ngned.**4 In late January 2oo8, as Villaf: d the CEOS Trial Atorney prepared to participat\n33o The case agent also informed Villafafia that she expected to ask for legal process soon in order to obtain\nadditional information.\nal The CEOS Trial Atorney told OPR that she was under the impression that she was brought in to help prepare\nfor the trial because the “plea had fallen through.”\nA82 Because Sloman and the atorney were former legal practice partners, Sloman reported the interaction to\nAcosta, and the USAO reported the incident to OPR shortly thereafter.

Prior to the interview, Wild had received the FBI’s January lo, 2oo8\nleter stating that the case was under investigation; houever, according to the case agent, Wild and\ntwo other victims had also been told by the FBI, in October 2oo7, that the case had been resolved.\nIn her 2ol5 CVRA-case declaration, Wild stated that after receiving the FBI leter, she believed\nthat the FBI was investigating the case, and she was not told “about any [NPA] or any potential\nresolution of the federal criminal investigation I was cooperating in. If I had been told of a[n\nNPA], I would have objected.” In Villafafia’s 2ol7 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia\nrecalled interviewing Wild on January 3l, 2oo8, along with FBI agents, and Villafafia told OPR\nshe “asked [Wild] whether she would be willing to testify if there were a trial.” Villafafia recalled\nWild responding that she “hoped Epstein would be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> and that she was willing to\ntestify.”>*\n\nAfter the first three victim interviews on January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia described for Acosta\nand Sloman the toll that the case had taken on two of the victims:\n\nOne girl broke doun sobbing so that we had to stop the interview\n\ntwice .. . she said she was having nightmares about Epstein coming\n\nafter her and she started to break doun again so we stopped the\n\ninterview.\n\nThe second girl .. . was very upset about the l8 month deal she had\n\nread about in the paper.**° She said that l8 months was nothing and\n\nthat she had heard that the girls could get restitution, but she would\n\nrather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time\n\nin jail.°°7\nVillafafia closed the email by requesting that Acosta and Sloman atend the interviews with victims\nscheduled for the follouing day, but neither did so.*7® Acosta told OPR that it “wasn’t typical”\n338 The FBI report of the interview did not reflect a discussion of Wild’s intentions.\n738 See Dareh Gregorian, “Tycoon Perved Me at l4 - $5oM Suit Hits NY Creep Over Mansion Massage,” New\nYork Post, Jan. 25, 2oo8.

She recalled telling another victim that “we thought we had reached an\nagreement with [Epstein] and then we didn’t,” but was “prety sure” that she did not mention the\nagreement during the interview of the third victim.

JUNE 2oo8: EFFORTS TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT THE JUNE 3o, 2oo8 PLEA\n\nHEARING\n\nThe Epstein team’s appeals through the Department ended on June 23, 2oo8, when the\nDeputy Atorney General determined that “federal prosecution of this case is appropriate” and\nEpstein’s allegations of prosecutorial misconduct did not rise to a level that would undermine such\na decision. Immediately thereafter, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that\nEpstein had until “the close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the terms and\nconditions of the agreement . . . including entry of a guilty plea, sentencing, and surrendering to\nbegin his sentence of imprisonment.” That same day, Villafafia made plans to file charges on July\nl, 2oo8, if Epstein did not enter his guilty plea by the June 3o deadline.\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia received a copy of the proposed state plea agreement\nand learned that the plea hearing was scheduled for 8:3o a.m. on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8. Also on\nthat Friday, Villafafia submited to Sloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior a “final final”\nproposed federal indictment of Epstein.\n\nVillafafia and the FBI finalized the government’s victim list that they intended to disclose,\nfor § 2255 purposes, to Epstein after the plea and, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia contacted\nPBPD Chief Reiter to ask him to notify the victims of the plea hearing. Villafafia told OPR that\nSloman said, “Chief Reiter could contact the victims from the state case, and tell them about the\nplea.”**! On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform him that PBPD Chief\nReiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”?>?\n\n3ol Villafafia further stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n352 Sloman replied, “Good.”\n23l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3433\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003477.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3ol of 348\nthe federal investigation I was cooperating in. If I had been told of a[n NPA], I would have\nobjected.” Wild further stated in her declaration that, “Based on what the FBI had been telling me,\nI thought they were still investigating my case.”\n\nNeither the CEOS Trial Atorney nor the FBI case agent recalled the specifics of the victim\ninterviews. The FBI reports memorializing each interview primarily addressed the facts elicited\nfrom the victim regarding Epstein’s abuse and did not describe any discussion about the status of\nthe case or the victim’s view about the prosecution of Epstein.*°\n\nWhen asked whether she was concerned that failing to tell victims about the NPA when\nshe was interviewing them would mislead victims, as previously noted, Villafafia told OPR that\nshe believed she and the agents were conducting an investigation because they continued\n“interviewing witnesses” and “doing all these things” to file charges and prepare for a federal trial.\nAs Villafafia stated, “So to me, saying to a victim the case is nou back under investigation is\nperfectly accurate.”\n\nVillafafia was also aware that some victims were represented by counsel in connection with\ncivil lawsuits against Epstein, but did not proactively inform the victims’ atorneys about the NPA.\nIn a 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, victims’ atorney Bradley Edwards alleged that\nduring telephone calls with Villafafia, he “asked very specific questions about what stage the\ninvestigation was in,” and Villafafia replied that she could not answer his questions because the\nmater “was an on-going active investigation.” Edwards stated that Villafafia gave him “the\nimpression that the Federal investigation was on-going, very expansive, and continuously grouing,\nboth in the number of identified victims and complexity.” Edwards also stated, “A fair\ncharacterization of each call was that I provided information and asked questions and Villafafia\nlistened and expressed that she was unable to say much or answer the questions I was asking.”\n\nIn her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated that she “listened more than [she] spoke”\nduring her interactions with Edwards and that due to the “uncertainty of the situation” and the\npossibility of a trial, she “did not feel comfortable sharing any information about the case.”\nVillafafia also told OPR that because of “all of these concerns and instructions that I had been\ngiven by Alex [Acosta] and Jeff [Sloman] not to disclose things further and not to have any\ninvolvement in victim notification,” she felt “prohibited” from providing additional information\nto Edwards.\n\nSloman told OPR that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its discretion to notify the victims, “[I]t was [of] concern that this was going to\nbreak doun and . . . result in us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be witnesses\nand if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey, you’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s .. .\ngoing to be instant impeachment for the defense.”**4 Acosta told OPR that, because Epstein did\n‘8 As noted above, the FBI agent’s notes for one victim’s interview reported that she wanted another victim to\nbe <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>.\n\n434 When asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing, Sloman\nresponded that he “was more focused on the restitution provisions. I didn’t get the sense that the victims were overly\ninterested in shouing up . . . at the change of plea.”\n275\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3477\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003689.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Pagel5 of 34\nWeingarten, 865 F.3d at 54.

Instead, she contends that\nbecause the House version of the bill included an express retroactivity provision absent from its\nfinal form, the Court should infer that Congress did not intend the statute to apply to past\nconduct. Houever, the legislative history makes clear that Congress abandoned the retroactivity\nprovision in the House bill only because it would have produced unconstitutional results. The\nSupreme Court has explained that a law that revives a time-barred prosecution violates the Ex\nPost Facto Clause of the Constitution, but a law that extends an un-expired statute of limitations\ndoes not. Stogner v. California, 539 U.S. 6o7, 632-33 (2oo3). Senator Leahy, who co-\nsponsored the PROTECT Act, expressed concerns in a commitee report that the proposed\nretroactivity provision was “of doubtful constitutionality” because it “would have revived the\ngovernment’s authority to prosecute crimes that were previously time-barred.” l49 Cong. Rec.\n$5l37, 85l47 (Apr. lo, 2oo3) (statement of Sen. Leahy). Congress removed the provision\nshortly thereafter for this reason. The removal of the express retroactivity provision shous only\nthat Congress intended to limit the PROTECT Act to its constitutional applications, including\npast conduct—like Maxwell’s—on which the statute of limitations had not yet expired.\n\nBoth the text and history of the PROTECT Act’s amendment to § 3283 reflect that it\napplies Maxwell’s conduct charged in the Sl superseding indictment.

United\nStates v.

Tramunti, 5l3 F.2d lo87, ll3 (2d\nCir. l975). In addition to dismissal, “Rule 7(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure\npermits a defendant to seek a bill of particulars in order to identify with sufficient particularity\nthe nature of the charge pending against him, thereby enabling defendant to prepare for trial, to\nprevent surprise, and to interpose a plea of double jeopardy should he be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> a second\ntime for the same offense.” United States v. Bortnovsky, 82o F.2d 572, 574 (2d Cir. l987).\n\nThe Sl superseding indictment sets out the elements of each charged crime and the facts\nsupporting each element. Nonetheless, Maxwell contends that the indictment is too vague\nbecause it refers to open-ended time periods, describes conduct like “grooming” and\n“befriending” that is not inherently criminal, and does not identify the alleged victims by name.\n\nMaxwell’s first argument fails because the Government need only describe the time and\nplace of charged conduct “in approximate terms.” Tramunti, 5l3 F.2d at ll3.

The government claims that there is “no evidence that\nthe parties intended to confer a benefit on her in particular.” Opp. 2o. In essence, the\ngovernment implausibly argues that even though the parties expressly agreed to immunize “any\npotential co-conspirators of Epstein,” only those individuals whom the parties were thinking\nabout “in particular” qualify for immunity. The government cites no support for the rule it has\nconcocted, and case law is to the contrary.\nFor example, in United States v. Florida West Int’l Airways, Inc., 853 F. Supp. 2d l2o9\n(S.D. Fla. 2ol2), where a corporation had entered into a plea agreement that immunized its\nemployees, the court held that one of those employees had standing to enforce the agreement as a\nthird-party beneficiary by virtue of his employment; the court did not require a shouing that the\nparties thought about protecting that employee “in particular” when they agreed to immunize the\nclass. /d. at l228. Similarly, in United States v. El-Sadig, l33 F. Supp. 2d 6oo (N.D. Ohio\n2ool), where a Saudi prince had entered into an agreement with the government that none of the\nindividuals involved in purchasing guns for two members of the Saudi royal family would be\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>, the court did not require the defendant to shou that the government and the prince\nintended to immunize him “in particular”; to the contrary, as the court noted, the parties to the\nagreement did not even discuss the defendant. /d. at 6o4.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo388o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003881.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 223 Filed o4/2o/2l Page 8of23\n\nMs. Maxwell thus need not shou that the parties to the NPA were thinking of her “in\nparticular’; rather, it is sufficient that she falls within the class of individuals the parties to the\nNPA intended to benefit. See, e.g., Florida West, 853 F. Supp. 2d at l228 (“the signatory parties\nunmistakably intended to confer immunity on a discrete class of corporations and individuals . . .\nthat could include the Defendants”).

NPA at 5.\n\nAlthough the NPA expressly provides that that class is “including but not limited to” the\nfour individuals named in the co-conspirator immunity provision (NPA at 5), the government\nasks the Court to disregard this plain language and instead credit a passage from the report of the\nDepartment of Justice’s Office of Professional Responsibility (“OPR Report””) stating that the\nline prosecutor who negotiated the NPA “believed” that only the four individuals expressly\nnamed in the co-conspirator immunity provision “would benefit.” Opp. 2o-2l (quoting OPR\nReport at l67). Regardless of the truth of this decade-after-the-fact and self-serving “belief,” it\nis immaterial. By agreeing to immunize “potential” co-conspirators “including but not limited\nto” the four named individuals, the government explicitly agreed that the NPA would apply to\nany others who might be charged as co-conspirators in the future—a class that includes Ms.\nMaxwell.\n\nThe OPR Report itself re-affirms the intent to extend immunity beyond those already\nidentified as potential co-conspirators. In reviewing the negotiating history of the parties over\nthis provision, the OPR Report notes that the government had not specifically contemplated other\npotential co-conspirators, yet it also demonstrates that the Epstein defense lawyers consistently\n* The OPR Report, of which only the executive summary had been released previously, has been submited as\nExhibit 3 to the government’s opposition.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo388l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003910.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 224 _ Filed o4/2o/2l Pagel3oofl7\nimprobable that instructions would eliminate the obvious and substantial prejudice to Ms.\nMaxwell.

Rather than atempt to justify withholding this information out of\nconcer for the accusers’ safety or privacy—an untenable argument, given that two of the three\naccusers, if we are correct about their identities, have already publicly identified themselves—the\ngovernment instead argues that because it has provided enough information for Ms. Maxwell to\nguess who they are, there is no need to disclose their names at this point. (Opp. l8l-82). Ms.\nMaxwell should not have to rely on guesswork to prepare for trial, especially when the testimony\nof these three accusers will comprise the core of the government’s proof. With trial only four\nmonths away, Ms. Maxwell’s need to have sufficient time to investigate the allegations against\nher vastly outweighs any countervailing interest the accusers may have in remaining anonymous.\nIf the government is unwilling to provide the names of the accusers, the Court should order the\ngovernment to do so either as part of a bill of particulars or pursuant to its inherent authority to\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4233\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004275.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page lo of 32\n(Dkt. 2o7 at 6 (quoting NPA)). The Court has further concluded that the NPA’s co-conspirator\nprovision covers “any involvement of [Ms.] Maxwell” in any of these same three categories of\noffenses. (/d. at 7). There can be no serious dispute that the sex trafficking offenses charged in\nCounts Five and Six were investigated as part of the Florida Investigation and fall squarely\nwithin the three categories of immunized offenses that are covered by the NPA. Moreover,\nbecause Counts Five and Six are based on the exact same allegations from the very same accuser\nthat were previously investigated and presented to the grand jury as part of the Florida\nInvestigation, Annabi and its progeny do not apply and the NPA is binding on the USAO-SDNY\nas to these offenses. Accordingly, Counts Five and Six must be dismissed. Moreover, because\nCounts One and Three incorporate the same conduct from Counts Five and Six for which Ms.\nMaxwell cannot be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> under the NPA, they must also be dismissed.\n\nA. Counts Five and Six Allege the Same Offenses that Were Part of the Florida\n\nInvestigation and Are Covered by the Plain Terms of the NPA.\n\nThe plain terms of the NPA preclude Ms. Maxwell’s prosecution on Counts Five and Six\nbecause they allege conduct that falls within the date range specified in the NPA and charge\nspecifically enumerated offenses that were part of the Florida Investigation. Count Five alleges\nthat “[f]rom at least in or about 2ool up to and including in or about 2oo4,” Ms. Maxwell\nconspired with Epstein to violate l8 U.S.C. § l59l(a), the law prohibiting sex trafficking of\nminors. (S2 Indictment {J 22-25). Count Six alleges that during the same time period, Ms.\nMaxwell commited a substantive violation of the same statute. (/d. J] 26-27). The NPA bars\nprosecution for Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in “any offenses that may have been commited by\nEpstein against the United States from in or around 2ool through in or around September 2oo7\nincluding five enumerated offenses.” (Dkt. 2o7 at 6 (internal quotations omited); see also id. at\n7 (NPA covers, among other things, “any involvement of Maxwell in offenses commited by\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4275\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004276.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page ll of 32\nEpstein from 2ool to 2oo7”)). Thus, the time period alleged in both Counts Five and Six falls\nsquarely within the date range covered by the NPA for which Ms. Maxwell is immunized.\nMoreover, l8 U.S.C. § l59l(a) is one of the five enumerated offenses in the NPA. (Ex. B at 2 of\n7). As such, Counts Five and Six are clearly offenses covered by the NPA.\n\nMs. Maxwell also cannot be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> on Counts Five and Six because they are based\non the exact same allegations that were already thoroughly investigated by the Palm Beach FBI\nand USAO-SDFL and were presented to a grand jury in the Southern District of Florida in\nconnection with the Florida Investigation. The allegations underlying Counts Five and Six (and\nthe expanded date range for Counts One and Three) come from a single accuser—Accuser-4—\nwho alleges that Epstein sexually abused her from approximately 2ool-2oo4 and that Ms.\nMaxwell allegedly facilitated that abuse. (S2 Indictment 9] 9d, 22-27). Based on our review of\nthe prior statements of non-testifying witnesses, which the government only recently produced to\nthe defense on April l3, 2o2l, we knou that FBI Special Acn | i\ninterviewed the person we believe to be Accuser-4 in connection with the Florida Investigation.\n(Ex.

The NPA Binds the Southern District of New York as to Counts Five and Six.\n\nAlthough the Court ruled that the NPA does not bind the USAO-SDNY as to the charges\nin the Sl Indictment (Dkt. 2o7 at 4-6), the NPA does bind the USAO-SDNY as to the sex\ntrafficking offenses charged in Counts Five and Six that were added to the S2 Indictment.\nUnited States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o (l985) and its progeny, which the Court relied upon in its\nearlier ruling, do not mandate a different result. In its prior ruling, the Court noted that Annabi\nestablished “something akin to a clear statement rule” that a plea agreement binds only the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the district in which the plea is entered “unless it affirmatively appears that\nthe agreement contemplates a broader restriction.” (Dkt. 2o7 at 4 (quoting Annabi, 77l F.2d at\n672). That interpretive rule, houever, only applies in situations where the district bringing the\nsecond prosecution charges offenses different from the offenses resolved by the plea agreement\nin the first prosecution. Annabi itself specifically noted that it was not addressing a situation\nwhere the charges in the follou-on prosecution are “identical to the dismissed charges.” Annabi,\n77l F.2d at 672. Accordingly, the Court is not bound by the rule in Annabi because Counts Five\nand Six are identical to the charges presented to the SDFL grand jury that were resolved by the\nNPA. When examined without the overlay of Annabi, the terms and the drafting history of the\nNPA indicate that the agreement should be read to preclude other districts, including the USAO-\n° Accuser-4’s statements to the FBI, and any other prior statements in which she did not mention Ms. Maxwell, are\nexculpatory Brady material that the government should immediately produce to the defense. (See Section VII infra).\n\nl]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo428o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004289.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page 24 of 32\nevidence, that there are in fact two distinct conspiracies and that the defendant is not being\nplaced in jeopardy twice for the same crime.” /d. at 467 (citations omited).\n\nAs previously discussed, it is clear from the grand jury testimony that Counts Five and\nSix of the S2 Indictment charge the same offenses based on the same allegations of Accuser-4\nthat were presented to the SDFL grand jury and formed the basis for a conspiracy count and a\nsubstantive sex trafficking count in the proposed SDFL indictment. (See Section I supra). The\ngovernment cannot make a contrary shouing. Accordingly, prosecuting Epstein for Counts Five\nand Six would violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. And because Epstein negotiated immunity\nfor Ms. Maxwell and any other “potential co-conspirators” as part of the terms of the NPA, Ms.\nMaxwell cannot be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> for those crimes either. See United States v. Cambindo Valencia,\n6o9 F.2d 6o3, 637 (2d Cir. l979) (“If [the defendant’s] earlier plea is found to bar prosecution of\nhim because of double jeopardy, since concededly the plea included an agreement to drop the\ncharges against [his wife], the instant prosecution of [his wife] will also be barred.”). Counts\nFive and Six of the S2 Indictment must therefore be dismissed.\n\nWI. Counts Five and Six Are Time-Barred.\n\nCounts Five and Six should also be dismissed because they are time-barred by the\napplicable five-year statute of limitations under l8 U.S.C. § 3282. In its previous motions\nrelated to the Sl Indictment, the government asserted that the Mann Act counts (Counts One\nthrough Four) are timely because they are governed by l8 U.S.C. § 3283, which was amended in\n2oo3 to extend the limitations period for “offense[s] involving the sexual or physical abuse ... of\na child under the age of l8 years” to “during the life of the child.” (Dkt. 2o4 at 24-26, 36-4l).\nMs. Maxwell argued that l8 U.S.C. § 3283 did not apply to the Mann Act offenses because they\ndo not “necessarily entail” the sexual abuse of a minor and therefore are not “offense[s]\ninvolving” such conduct. (Dkt. l44 at l2-l7; Dkt. 2o6 at lo-l5). The Court ruled in favor of the\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4289\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004291.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document293 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page 26 of 32\nincorporated into the broader Mann Act conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three. (/d. J\nl-9, ll-l3, l6-l9). For the same reasons discussed in her prior motion, the Court should dismiss\nCount Five and either Count One or Count Three as multiplicitous.\n\nVv. The Court Should Dismiss the S2 Indictment for Pre-Indictment Delay.\n\nThe Court should also dismiss the S2 indictment due to the government’s excessive and\nprejudicial delay in bringing this prosecution against Ms. Maxwell in violation of her due\nprocess rights. In her previous motions, Ms. Maxwell argued that the Court should dismiss the\nSl Indictment due to the excessive pre-indictment delay in charging her with those offenses.\n(Dkt. l38, 2o9). The S2 Indictment only compounds these issues by charging additional\noffenses based on alleged conduct that the government has knoun about since in or about 2oo7,\nwhich it added for tactical reasons to shore up its case against Ms. Maxwell. For the same\nreasons discussed in her prior motion, the Court should dismiss the $2 Indictment. The Court\ndenied Ms. Maxwell’s initial motion on these grounds, but preserved Ms. Maxwell’s ability to\nrenew her motion after trial. (Dkt. 2o7 at l8). Accordingly, we request that the Court defer\nconsideration of this motion until trial.\n\nVI. The Court Should Order a Bill of Particulars as to Counts Five and Six.\n\nThe Court should also order the government to file a Bill of Particulars pursuant to Rule\n7(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure because Counts Five and Six of the $2\nIndictment do not sufficiently inform her of the nature of the charges against her. Rule 7(f)\npermits a defendant to seek a bill of particulars “in order to identify with sufficient particularity\nthe nature of the charge pending against him, thereby enabling defendant to prepare for trial, to\nprevent surprise, and to interpose a plea of double jeopardy should he be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> a second\ntime for the same offense.” United States v.

Goldberger, together with Gerald Lefcourt, a nationally knoun New York criminal\ndefense atorney also representing Epstein, then directed their efforts at Belohlavek and Krischer\nto dissuade the office from prosecuting Epstein, largely by atacking the credibility of the victim\nwitnesses.\n\nMeanwhile, the State Atorney’s Office took the unusual step of preparing to present the\ncase to a grand jury.

Belohlavek\ntold OPR that her office took the allegations against Epstein “seriously, because . . . it was an\norganized scheme to involve young girls by offering them money. And I wouldn’t say that we...\nthought they were prostitutes . . . [but] I think there was solicitation.” Houever, she said, although\nEpstein’s “behavior was reprehensible, . . . I’m limited by . . . the state statutes as to what I can\ncharge.” Krischer told OPR, “There were so many issues involving the victim-witnesses that to\nmy mind, in consultation with my [prosecutors], the only way to achieve, to my mind, real justice\nwas to present the case to the grand jury and not to direct-file” criminal charges against Epstein.\n\nC. Florida State Procedure for Bringing Criminal Charges\n\nFederal criminal procedure requires that a felony charge—that is, any charge punishable\nby imprisonment for one year or more—be brought by a grand jury unless waived by a defendant.”\nUnder Florida law, houever, a grand jury is required to bring criminal charges only in a death\npenalty case.'? For all other cases, a State Atorney has concurrent authority to file criminal\ncharges by means of a document called an “information” or to seek a grand jury indictment.\nAlthough Florida criminal cases are routinely charged by information, state grand juries are often\nutilized in sensitive or high-profile cases, such as those involving allegations of wrongdoing by\npublic officials.'* Florida grand jury proceedings are subject to strict secrecy rules that, among\nlo Belohlavek told OPR that prostitution was a misdemeanor charge, and she did not handle misdemeanors.\nA Because the Florida Department of Law Enforcement investigation into the State Atorney’s Office’s\nhandling of the Epstein case was pending at the time OPR interviewed Krischer, he declined to further explain to OPR\nhis office’s prosecutive decisions.\nlB U.S. Const. amend.

PBPD Chief Reiter Becomes Concerned with the State Atorney’s Office’s\n\nHandling of the State Investigation and Seeks a Federal Investigation\n\nIn 2oo6, PBPD Chief Reiter perceived that Krischer’s atitude had changed and, according\n\nto Reiter’s statements in his 2oo9 deposition, Krischer said that he did not believe the victims were\ncredible. Reiter was disturbed when Krischer suggested that the PBPD issue a notice for Epstein\nto appear in court on misdemeanor charges, leading Reiter to begin questioning Krischer’s\nobjectivity and the State Atorney’s Office’s approach to the case. As Reiter explained in his\ndeposition:\n\nThis was a case that I felt absolutely needed the atention of the State\n\nAtorney’s Office, that needed to be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> in state court. It’s\n\nnot generally something that’s <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> in a federal court. And I\n\nknew that it didn’t really mater what the facts were in this case, it\n\nwas prety clear to me that Mr. Krischer did not want to prosecute\n\nthis case.\n\nOn May l, 2oo6, Reiter submited to Krischer probable cause affidavits and a case filing\npackage relating to Epstein, one of his personal assistants, and a young local woman whom Epstein\nfirst victimized and then used to recruit other girls. In his transmital leter, which was later made\npublic, Reiter criticized Krischer, noting that he found the State Atorney’s Office’s “treatment of\nthese cases [to be] highly unusual.”!© Reiter urged Krischer “to examine the unusual course that\nyour office’s handling of this mater has taken” and to consider disqualifying himself from\nprosecuting Epstein. !’\n\nWi. THE FBI AND THE USAO INVESTIGATE EPSTEIN, AND THE DEFENSE\n\nTEAM ENGAGES WITH THE USAO\n\nA. May 2oo6 — February 2oo7: The Federal Investigation Is Initiated, and the\n\nUSAO Opens a Case File\n\nIn early 2oo6, a West Palm Beach FBI Special Agent who worked closely with\nAUSA Ann Marie Villafafia on child exploitation cases—and who is referred to in this Report as\n“the case agent”—mentioned to Villafafia in “casual conversations” having learned that the PBPD\nwas investigating a wealthy Palm Beach man who recruited minors for sexual activity. The case\nagent told Villafafia that the PBPD had reached out to the FBI because the State Atorney’s Office\nwas considering either not charging the case or allouing the defendant to plead to a misdemeanor\nls Fla. Stat. § 9o5.27 (2oo7).\n\nl6 See Larry Keller, “Palm Beach chief focus of fire in Epstein case,” Palm Beach Post, Aug. l4, 2oo6.\nM7 As noted, Krischer generally declined in his OPR interview to explain his office’s prosecutive decisions;\nhouever, regarding allegations of favoritism to Epstein’s defense counsel, Krischer told OPR, “I just don’t play that\nway.”\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo434o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004341.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 44 of 349\ncharge. Villafafia suggested meeting with the PBPD, but the case agent explained that before\nformally presenting the case to the FBI, the PBPD wanted to see hou the State Atorney’s Office\ndecided to charge Epstein.\n\nl. The PBPD Presents the Mater to the FBI and the USAO\n\nIn May 2oo6, the lead Detective handling the state’s investigation met with Villafafia and\nthe FBI case agent to summarize for them the information learned during the state’s\ninvestigation.'* At the time, neither Villafafia nor the case agent had heard of Epstein or had any\nknouledge of his background.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, during this meeting, the Detective expressed concern that “pressure\nhad been brought to bear on . . . Krischer by Epstein’s atorneys,” and he and Chief Reiter were\nconcerned the state would charge Epstein with only a misdemeanor or not at all.'? The Detective\nexplained that the defense had hired private investigators to trail Reiter and the Detective, had\nraised claims of various improprieties by the police, and, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated\nthe removal of the Assistant State Atorney initially assigned to handle the mater, who was viewed\nas an aggressive prosecutor, by hiring a defense atorney whose relationship with the Assistant\nState Atorney created a conflict of interest for the prosecutor. Further, given the missing computer\nequipment and surveillance camera videotapes, the Detective believed Epstein may have been\n“tipped off’ in advance about the search warrant.\n\nDuring the meeting, Villafafia reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could\nbe brought against Epstein. She focused on l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticement of minors into\nprostitution or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of interstate or foreign commerce\nto persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423\n(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct). As they discussed these charges, the\nDetective told Villafafia that Epstein and his assistants had traveled out of the Palm Beach\nInternational Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs sometimes referred to\npassengers as “female” without a name or age, which the Detective suspected might be references\nto underage girls. Houever, the Detective acknouledged that he was unable to confirm that\nsuspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls interstate\nor internationally. Nevertheless, Villafafia believed Epstein could be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> federally, in part\nbecause of his oun interstate and international travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse\ngirls. Villafafia discussed with the Detective and the case agent the additional investigation needed\nto prove violations of the federal statutes she had identified. She told them that if the evidence\nsupported it, the case could be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> federally, but she assured them that opening a federal\ninvestigation would not preclude the State Atorney’s Office from charging Epstein should it\nchoose to do so.\n\nl8 The Detective died in May 2ol8.\nl9 In his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein mater to the FBI, a Toun of Palm\nBeach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims\nwere not believable and “Palm Beach solves its oun problems.”\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo434l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004343.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 46 of 349\nEpstein massages that were sexual in nature, and that Epstein had used “various types of pressure”\nto avoid prosecution by the state, including hiring atorneys who had personal connections to the\nState Atorney. Villafafia said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset\nof the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely\nemploy. Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you knou people are going to be geting\ncalls about . . . you just want to make sure that they knou about it so they don’t get .. . a call from\nout of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to\nput the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t\nwant to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur” with a federal prosecution as had\noccurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected\nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s\nresources if the Office would just back doun to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,\nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.” In a later\nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and\nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal\nprosecution if the U.S. Atorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green\nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2oo6 meeting with\nVillafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not\npreviously heard of Epstein.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man\nwho was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a reasonable mater to pursue”\nfederally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told\nOPR, the USAO had <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the\nfederal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the\nexploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a\n“sreen light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have\nexplicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been\nsimply to acknouledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal\ninvestigation “sound[ed] reasonable.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein\ninvestigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Atorney’s Office had\n“abdicated their responsibility” to investigate and prosecute Epstein. In his OPR interview,\nSloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the\nState Atorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect\nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2oo6, the USAO had recently <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> wealthy and politically\nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of\nEpstein. On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and\nKevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4343\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004344.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 47 of 349\n4. Late July 2oo6: The State Indicts Epstein, and the USAO Moves\nForward with a Federal Investigation\n\nSeveral days after Villafafia spoke with Acosta and Sloman, on July l9, 2oo6, Assistant\nState Atorney Belohlavek presented the case to the state grand jury.~> Krischer told OPR that\n“the whole thing” was put before the grand jury. According to a statement made at the time by the\nState Atorney’s Office spokesman, the grand jury was presented with a list of charges from highest\nto louest, without a recommendation by the prosecutor, and deliberated with the prosecutor out of\nthe room.”* The state grand jury returned an indictment charging Epstein with one count of felony\nsolicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7, a felony under state law because\nit alleged three or more instances of solicitation.” The indictment did not identify the person or\npersons solicited and made no mention of the fact that Epstein had solicited minors.*® On July 23,\n2oo6, Epstein self-surrendered to be arrested on the indictment, but was not detained, and the\ncharges were made public.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she decided to move forward with the federal investigation at that\npoint because she believed the State Atorney’s Office would permit Epstein to enter a plea to a\nreduced misdemeanor charge and that once he entered a guilty plea, the Department’s Petite policy\nmight preclude a federal prosecution.”’ Villafafia told OPR that at the time, she “definitely\nbelieved that we were going to proceed to [a federal] indictment, assuming that ...we had\nsufficient evidence.”\neS Villafafia and the FBI obtained and examined records of the state grand jury proceeding, and Lourie reviewed\nthem. Because the grand jury records have not been ordered released publicly, OPR does not discuss their substance\nin this Report.\nat Larry Keller, “Police say lawyer tried to discredit teenage girls,” Palm Beach Post, July 29, 2oo6, citing\nstatement by State Atorney’s Office spokesman Michael Edmondson.\n28 Indictment in State v. Epstein, 2oo6CF9454AXX (July l9, 2oo6), atached as Exhibit l to this Report.\n26 In pertinent part, the state indictment read, “[B]etween the Ist day of August [2oo4] and October 3l, 2oo5,\n[Epstein] did solicit, induce, entice, or procure another to commit prostitution lewdness, or assignation, . . . on three\nor more occasions.” The l5-month time frame and lack of detail regarding the place or manner of the offense made\nit impossible to identify from the charging document which victim or victims served as the basis for the charge in the\nstate indictment. Belohlavek explained to OPR that the charge did not list specific victims so that she could go forward\nat trial with whichever victim or victims might be available and willing to testify at that time.\n27 The Petite policy is a set of guidelines used by federal prosecutors when considering whether to pursue federal\ncharges for defendants previously <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> for state or local offenses. The Constitution does not prohibit the federal\ngovernment from prosecuting defendants who have been charged, acquited, or convicted on state charges based on\nthe same criminal conduct. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the long-standing principle that the prohibition\nagainst double jeopardy does not apply to prosecutions brought by different sovereigns. See, e.g., Gamble v. United\nStates, 587 U.S. ___, l39 S. Ct. l96o, l966-67 (2ol9) (and cases cited therein); Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S.\nl87, l95 (l959) (and cases cited therein); and United States v. Lanza, 26o U.S. 377, 382 (l922). Nonetheless, to\nbeter promote the efficient use of criminal justice resources, the Department developed policies in l959 and l96o to\nguide federal prosecutors in the use of their charging discretion. See Chapter Two, Part Two, Section IT.A.2, for a\nmore detailed discussion of the Petite policy.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4344\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004354.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 57 of 349\nhe is comfortable before proceeding.” Menchel told Villafafia he had “trouble understanding” why\nshe was in a “rush” “given hou long this case has been pending.”\n\nOPR questioned Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta about the timeline for reviewing\nthe prosecution memorandum and the proposed charges. Acosta and Menchel believed Villafafia’s\ntimeline was unrealistic from the start. Acosta told OPR that Villafafia was “very hard charging,”\nbut her timeline for filing charges in the case was “really, really fast.” Menchel described Villafafia\nas “out over her skis a litle bit” and “ahead of” Acosta in terms of his analysis of the case.*\nMenchel said it was clear to him that Acosta “was going to be the one making the call” about\nwhether to go forward with charges, and Acosta needed more time to make a decision. Menchel\ntold OPR, “This [was] not a case [we were] going to review in two weeks and make a decision\non.” Sloman told OPR that although he did not conduct a “granular review” of the proposed\ncharges, he believed Menchel and Lourie had done so and “obviously” had concluded that “the\nfacts and the law didn’t suggest that the right thing to do was to automatically indict.” Lourie told\nOPR that he believed “the case was moving ahead.”\n\nVillafafia continued to seek direction from her managers. On May l5, 2oo7, she emailed\nSloman, noting that “[i]t seemed from our discussion yesterday that pestering Alex [Acosta] will\nnot do any good. Am I right about that?” Sloman responded, “Yes.” On May 2l, 2oo7, three\nweeks after submiting the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia emailed Sloman and Menchel\nasking for “a sense of the direction where we are headed-i.e., approval of an indictment something\nlike the current draft, a complaint to allou for pre-indictment negotiations, an indictment\ndrastically different from the current draft?” Sloman responded only, “Taken care of.”*°\n\nD. Defense Counsel Seek a Meeting with Senior USAO Managers, which\n\nVillafatia Opposes\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein’s defense counsel continued to seek additional information about the\nfederal investigation and a meeting with senior USAO managers, including Acosta. In a May lo,\n2oo7 email to Menchel, Lourie reported that Epstein’s atorneys “want me to tell them the statutes\na Villafafia explained to OPR that the “rush” related to her concern that Epstein was continuing to abuse girls:\n“Tn terms of the issue of why the hurry, because child sex offenders don’t stop until they’re behind bars. That was our\ntime concern.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia offering this explanation to him. OPR\nnotes that in their respective statements to OPR and in their comments on OPR’s draft report, Menchel and Villafafia\nexpressed contradictory accounts or interpretations of certain events. When it was necessary for OPR to resolve those\nconflicts in order to reach its findings and conclusions, OPR considered the extensive documentary record and the\ntestimony of other subjects and witnesses, to the extent available.\n\na Sloman similarly recalled that Menchel thought Villafafia was “ahead of where the office was internally” and\nthat caused “discontent” between Villafafia and Menchel. Villafafia was not the only one, houever, who was surprised\nthat the indictment was not approved immediately. The case agent told OPR that it seemed “everything changed”\nafter Villafafia submited the prosecution memorandum, and the momentum touards an indictment abated. Villafafia’s\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that from her perspective, it appeared “Miami didn’t want the case <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>.”\nHouever, Menchel rebuked Villafafia in his July 5, 2oo7 email to her for having “led the agents to believe that [filing\ncharges in] this mater was a foregone conclusion.”\n\n46 Sloman could not recall during his OPR interview what he meant by this remark, but he speculated that he\nhad spoken to Menchel, and Menchel was going to take care of it.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4354\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004355.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 58 of 349\nwe are contemplating so Dershouitz can tell us why they don’t apply.”*” Lourie told Menchel, “I\ndon’t see the dounside,” but added, “Marie is against it.’ Menchel responded that it was\n“premature” to provide the information. During his OPR interview, Menchel could not specifically\nrecall why he believed it was “premature” to provide the defense with the requested information,\nbut speculated that it was too soon after the prosecution memorandum had been circulated for\nAcosta to have made a decision about hou he wanted to proceed. This recollection is consistent\nwith the May 2oo7 emails reflecting that Acosta wanted time to consider the proposed prosecution.\n\nOn May 22, 2oo7, defense counsel Lefcourt emailed Lourie a leter to “confirm” that\nEpstein’s atorneys would be given an opportunity to meet with Lourie before the USAO reached\na final decision on charging Epstein. Lourie forwarded the leter to Menchel and Sloman, but\nnoted that Epstein’s defense team was “really ready for the next level,” rather than another meeting\nwith him. Lourie suggested that Menchel meet with defense counsel, adding, ““Whether Alex\nwould be present or grant them another meeting after that is his call.” Lourie also emailed\nLefcourt, clarifying that Lourie had not promised to call Epstein’s counsel before filing charges,\nand suggesting that Epstein’s counsel make their next presentation to Menchel.\n\nAlthough Lourie’s emails shou that he had no objection to more senior USAO managers\nmeeting with defense counsel, Villafafia opposed such a meeting. Several emails indicate that\nMenchel traveled to West Palm Beach to meet with Lourie and Villafafia on the afternoon of\nMay 23, 2oo7.*8 On that same date, Villafafia drafted an email, which she planned to send to\nSloman and Menchel, expressing her disagreement with meeting with defense counsel. Although\nthe email was writen for Sloman and Menchel, Villafafia sent it as a draft only to her immediate\nsupervisor, seeking her “guidance and counsel” as to hou to proceed.\n\nHi Jeff and Mat — I just want to again voice my disagreement with\n\npromising to have a meeting or having a meeting with Lefcourt or\n\nany other of Epstein’s atorneys. As I mentioned, this is not a case\n\nwhere we will be siting doun to negotiate whether a defendant will\n\nserve one year versus two years of probation. This is a case where\n\nthe defendant is facing the possibility of dozens of years of prison\n\ntime. Just as the defense will defend a case like that differently than\n\nthey would handle a probation-type case, we need to handle this case\n\ndifferently. Part of our prosecution strategy was already disclosed\n\nat the last meeting, and I am concerned that more will be disclosed\n\nat a future meeting.\n\nMy co-chair . . . who has <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> more of these cases than the\n\nrest of us combined and who actually worked on the drafting of\n\nsome of the child exploitation statutes, also opposes a meeting. We\n\nhave been accused of not being “strategic thinkers” because of our\nae Dershouitz had joined Lefcourt and Sanchez in representing Epstein for the federal case.\n48 During her OPR interview, Villafafia could not recall the meeting with specificity, but believed the purpose\nwas to discuss whether the USAO should agree to additional meetings with Epstein’s counsel. Menchel, similarly,\ntold OPR that he could not remember anything specific about the meeting.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4355\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004356.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 59 of 349\nopposition to these meetings, but we are simply looking at this case\nas a violent crime prosecution involving stiff penalties rather than as\na white collar or public corruption case where the parties can\namicably work out a light sentence.”\n\nWith respect to the “policy reasons” that Lefcourt wants to discuss,\nthose were already raised in his leter (which is part of the indictment\npackage) and during his meeting with Andy and myself. Those\nreasons are: (l) he wants the Petit [sic] policy to trump our ability\nto prosecute Epstein, (2) this shouldn’t be a federal offense, and\n(3) the victims were willing participants so the crime shouldn’t be\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> at all. Unless the Office thinks that any of those\narguments will be persuasive, a meeting will not be beneficial to the\nprosecution, it will only benefit the defense. With respect to\nLefcourt’s promised legal analysis, that also has already been\nprovided. The only way to get additional analysis is to expose to the\ndefense the other charges that we are considering. In my opinion\nthis would seriously undermine the prosecution.\n\nThe defense is anxious to have a meeting in order to delay the\ninvestigation/prosecution, to find out more about our investigation,\nand to use political pressure to stop the investigation.\n\nI have no control over the Office’s decisions regarding whether to\nmeet with the defense or to whom the facts and analysis of the case\nwill be disclosed. Houever, if you all do decide to go forward with\nthese meetings in a way that is detrimental to the investigation, then\nI will have to ask to have the case reassigned to an AUSA who is in\nagreement with the handling of the case.\n\nAfter receiving this draft, the immediate supervisor cautioned Villafafia, “Let’s talk before\nthis is sent, please.”°° Villafafia told OPR that the supervisor counseled Villafafia not to send the\nemail to Sloman or Menchel because Villafafia could be viewed as insubordinate. She also told\nVillafafia that if Villafafia did not stay with the case, “the case would go away” and Epstein “would\nnever serve a day in jail.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that at that point in time, she believed the USAO was preparing to file\ncharges against Epstein despite agreeing to accommodate the defense request for meetings. She\nalso told OPR, on the other hand, that she feared the USAO was “going doun the same path that\nthe State Atorney’s Office had gone doun.” Villafafia believed the purpose of the defense request\na In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel noted Menchel’s view that the nature of a\ndefendant’s crimes and potential penalty does not affect whether prosecutors are willing to meet with defense counsel\nto discuss the merits of a case.\n\n5o The immediate supervisor recalled telling Villafafia that she and Villafafia were “not driving the ship,” and\nonce “the bosses” made the decision, “there’s nothing else you can do.”\n32\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4356\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004378.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 8l of 349\nthe period of imprisonment, because the USAO failed to hold firm to its proposal of “at least two\nyears in prison.” The USAO did, houever, consistently reject defense proposals to change other\nterms, particularly the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender.\n\nA.

A few days after the meeting,\nVillafafia emailed Menchel, stating that she had “figured out a way to do a federal plea with a 2-l/2\nyear cap.”\n\nAlthough Acosta had authorized a plea to state charges, emails and other correspondence\nshou that during the negotiations, the parties also considered structuring a plea around federal\ney Villafafia was the only witness with whom OPR spoke who had a substantive memory of this meeting.\n\n88 According to the Florida Department of Corrections fact sheet for defendants subjected to community control,\n\nThe Community Control supervision program was created as a diversion to\n\nincarceration or imprisonment; therefore it is an intensive supervision program\n\nwhere you are confined to your home unless you are working, atending school,\n\nperforming public service hours, participating in treatment or another special\n\nactivity that has been approved in advance by your officer.

We did not.” Villafafia anticipated there would be ways to “manipulate” a state\nsentence and the USAO would be “giving up all control,” and she told OPR that she discussed this concern with\nLourie, although she could not recall when that discussion occurred.\n\n54\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4378\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004386.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 89 of 349\nVillafafia added that the PBPD Chief had alerted the FBI that an upcoming news article would\nreport that Epstein was “going to plead to a state charge” and the PBPD Chief “wanted to knou if\nthe victims had been consulted about the deal.” Sloman forwarded Villafafia’s email to Acosta\nwith a note that read simply, “fyi.”\n\nLater that evening, Villafafia circulated to Sloman, Lourie, and Oosterban two alternative\ndocuments: a draft federal plea agreement and a draft NPA.'”° The draft federal plea agreement,\nfollouing the USAO’s standard format, called for Epstein to plead guilty to a five-year conspiracy\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 37l to entice minors to engage in prostitution, an offense requiring registration\nas a sexual offender, with a Rule ll(c) binding sentence of two years’ imprisonment. The draft\nNPA contained the terms presented to the defense team on July 3l, 2oo7, and called for Epstein to\nenter a state plea by September 28, 2oo7. Villafafia told OPR that because she had never seen a\nnon-prosecution agreement before, she relied on a template she found either using USAO or the\nDepartment’s internal online resources, but she did not do any additional research regarding the\nuse of non-prosecution agreements. !°!\n\n3.

This was Acosta’s\nfirst meeting with Epstein’s defense team. Villafafia understood the purpose of this meeting was\nto afford Epstein’s counsel an opportunity to “make a pitch” as to why the case should not be\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> federally. Villafafia recalled that at a “pre-meet” before defense counsel arrived,\nAcosta did not express concern about the viability of the prosecution or the strength of the case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that the meeting was not “‘a negotiation,” but a chance for the defense to\npresent their arguments, which were made by Starr and focused primarily on federalism. Villafafia\nsimilarly recalled that the meeting mainly consisted of the defense argument that the Epstein case\nshould remain a state mater in which the USAO should not interfere. Both Villafafia and her\nco-counsel recalled that Starr addressed himself directly to Acosta, and that Starr, who had held\nSenate-confirmed positions in the government, commented to Acosta that he and Acosta were “the\nonly people in this room who have run the [gantlet] of confirmation by the Senate.” Acosta did\nnot recall the comment, but he told OPR, “[B]Jack in July, we had decided that we were going\nChapter Three, the Department’s position at the time was that victim consultation was not required in maters in which\nthe government did not pursue a federal charge.

Sloman similarly said that he had the impression that the non-prosecution provision\nwas meant to protect named co-conspirators who were also victims, “in a sense,” of Epstein’s\nconduct. Although later press coverage of the Epstein case focused on Epstein’s connection to\nprominent figures and suggested that the non-prosecution provision protected these individuals,\nSloman told OPR that it never occurred to him that the reference to potential co-conspirators was\ndirected touard any of the high-profile individuals who were at the time or subsequently linked\nwith Epstein.'”° Acosta did not recall the provision or any discussions about it. He speculated\nthat if he read the non-prosecution provision, he likely assumed that Villafafia and Lourie had\n“thought this through” and “addressed it for a reason.” The West Palm Beach manager, who had\nonly limited involvement at this stage, told OPR that the provision was “highly unusual,” and he\nhad “‘no clue” why the USAO agreed to it.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, apart from the women named in the NPA, the investigation had\nnot developed evidence of “any other potential co-conspirators. So, . . . we wouldn’t be\nprosecuting anybody else, so why not include it? ... I just didn’t think that there was anybody\nthat it would cover.” She conceded, houever, that she “did not catch the fact that it could be read\nas broadly as people have since read it.”\n\nK. The USAO Rejects Defense Efforts to Eliminate the Sexual Offender\n\nRegistration Requirement\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, State Atorney Krischer informed\nVillafafia that Epstein’s counsel had contacted him and Epstein was ready to agree “to all the\nterms” of the NPA—except for sexual offender registration. According to Krischer, defense\ncounsel had proposed that registration be deferred, and that Epstein register only if state or federal\nlaw enforcement felt, at any point during his service of the sentence, that he needed to do so.\nKrischer noted that he had “reached out” to Acosta about this proposal but had not heard back\nfrom him. Villafafia responded, “T think Alex is calling you nou.” Villafafia told OPR that, to her\nknouledge, Acosta called Krischer to tell him that registration was not a negotiable term. !*°\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia emailed Krischer for information about the amount of “gain\ntime” Epstein would earn in state prison. Villafafia explained in her email that she wanted to\ninclude a provision in the NPA specifying that Epstein “will actually be in jail at least a certain\nnumber of days to make sure he doesn’t try to ‘convince’ someone with the Florida prison\nauthorities to let him out early.” Krischer responded that under the proposal as it then stood,\nEpstein would serve l5 months. He also told Villafafia that a plea to a registrable offense would\nnot prevent Epstein from serving his time “at the stockade”—the local minimum security detention\nfacility. l?’\n\nl25 Sloman also pointed out that the NPA was not a “global resolution” and other co-conspirators could have\nbeen <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> “by any other [U.S. Atorney’s] office in the country.”\n\nl26 Krischer told OPR that he did not recall meeting or having interactions with Acosta regarding the Epstein\ncase or any other mater.\n\nal The State Atorney concluded his email: “Glad we could get this worked out for reasons I won’t put in\nwriting. After this is resolved I would love to buy you a cup at Starbucks and have a conversation.” Villafafia\nresponded, “Sounds great.” When asked about this exchange during her OPR interview, Villafafia said: “Everybody\n\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004469.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l72 of 349\nand guaranteed sexual offender registration by Epstein . . . were\namong the factors [that led to the NPA].7!°\n\nDuring her OPR interview, Villafafia similarly described the victims’ general reluctance to\ngo forward with a trial:\n\n[W]hen we would meet with victims, we would ask them hou they\nwanted the case to be resolved.

They were very worried about their privacy\nrights.'°\n\nIn his writen response to OPR, Lourie stated that although he did not specifically recall\nthe issues Villafafia set forth in her declaration, he believed they would have been important to the\nUSAO in 2oo7. Lourie also told OPR that he generally recalled concerns within the USAO about\nthe charges and a potential trial:\n\n[M]y vague recollection is that I and others had concerns that there\n\nwas a substantial chance we would not prevail at both trial and on\n\nappeal after a conviction, resulting in no jail time, no criminal\n2l5 Doe v. United States, No. 9:o8-cv-8o736 (S.D. Fla.), Declaration of A. Marie Villafafia in Support of\nGovernment’s Response and Opposition to Petitioners’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Cross-Motion for\nSummary Judgment at 8-9 (June 2, 2ol7).\n2l8 These concerns are also reflected in a 2ol7 declaration filed by the FBI case agent in the CVRA litigation,\nin which she stated, “During interviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that\nEpstein be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s] victims... .\n\nA majority of the victims expressed concern about the possible disclosure of their\n\nidentities to the public. A number of the victims raised concerns about having to\n\ntestify and/or their parents finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.\n\nAdditionally, for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\n\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall, many of the\n\nvictims were troubled about the existence of the investigation. They displayed\n\nfeelings of embarrassment and humiliation and were reluctant to talk to\n\ninvestigators. Some victims who were identified through the investigation refused\n\neven to speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and geting to\n\nthe truth were always at the forefront of our handling of the investigation.\n\nIn addition, during the CVRA litigation, an atorney representing several victims filed a pleading to protect\nthe anonymity of his clients by preventing disclosure of their identities to the CVRA petitioners. See Response to\nCourt Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance (July 24, 2ol5). It is noteworthy that in\n2o2o, when OPR atempted to contact victims, through their counsel, for interviews or responses to writen questions\nregarding contacts with the USAO, OPR was informed that most of the victims were still deeply concerned about\nremaining anonymous. One victim described to OPR hou she became distraught when, during the USAO’s\ninvestigation, the FBI left a business card at her parents’ home and, as a result, her parents learned that she was a\nvictim of Epstein. At the time, the victim was a teenager; was “nervous, scared, and ashamed”; and did not want her\nparents to knou about the case.\n\nl45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4469\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004472.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l75 of 349\n\nThe USAO might have been able to surmount the evidentiary, legal, and policy issues\npresented by a federal prosecution of Epstein. Villafafia, in particular, believed she could have\nprevailed had she taken the case to trial, and even after the NPA was negotiated, she repeatedly\nrecommended declaring Epstein in breach and proceeding with an indictment, because she\ncontinued to have confidence in the case.”*? Oosterban and others also believed that the\ngovernment would succeed at trial. Furthermore, the victims were not a uniform group. Some of\nthem were afraid of testifying or having their identities made public; others wanted Epstein\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>, but even among those, it is not clear hou many expressed a willingness to testify at a\ntrial; and still others provided information favorable to Epstein. In the end, Acosta assumed\nresponsibility for deciding hou to resolve the Epstein investigation and weighing the risks and\nbenefits of a trial versus those of a pre-charge disposition. His determination that a pre-charge\ndisposition was appropriate was not unreasonable under the circumstances.\n\nAlthough evidentiary and witness issues explain the subject supervisors’ concerns about\nwinning a potential trial and why the USAO would have sought some sort of pre-charge\ndisposition, they do not fully explain why Acosta decided to pursue a state-based resolution as\nopposed to a traditional federal plea agreement. OPR did not find in the contemporaneous records\na memorandum or other memorialization of the reasoning underlying Acosta’s decision to offer a\nstate-based resolution or the terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7.\n\nAccording to Acosta, “In 2oo6, it would have been extremely unusual for any United States\nAtorney’s Office to become involved in a state solicitation case, even one involving underage\nteens,” because solicitation was “the province of state prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR that he\ndeveloped “a preference for deferring to the state” to “make it clear that [the USAO was] not\nstepping on something that is a purely local mater, because we [didn’t] want bad precedent for\nthe sake of the larger human trafficking issue.” Acosta also told OPR that it was his understanding\nthat the PBPD would not have brought the case to federal investigators if the State Atorney’s\nOffice had pursued a sanction against Epstein that included jail time and sexual offender\nregistration. Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in the case as limited to preventing the “manifest\ninjustice” that, in Acosta’s view, would have resulted from the state’s original plea proposal.\nAcosta acknouledged that if the investigation had begun in the federal system, he would not have\nviewed the terms set out in the NPA as a satisfactory result, but it was adequate to serve as a\n“backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he described as “a polite way of saying[,\n“|encouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]” In sum, Acosta told OPR that the Epstein case\nlay in “uncharted territory,” there was no certainty that the USAO would prevail if it went to trial,\nand a potentially unfavorable outcome had to be “weighed against a certain plea with registration\nthat would make sure that the public knew that this person was a sex offender.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he discussed the case primarily with Sloman and Menchel, and both\ntold OPR that while they did not share Acosta’s federalism concerns, they recalled that Acosta had\nthe terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7. Therefore, any allegations against the prosecutors could not have\nplayed a significant role in Acosta’s decisions as reflected in the term sheet.\n\n22o Sloman told OPR that Villafafia “always believed in the case.”\nl48\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4472\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004491.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l94 of 349\nVillafafia had raised (defense counsel’s atempt to insert an immigration waiver into the\nagreement), but Lourie did not comment on the provision promising not to prosecute co-\nconspirators or ask Villafafia to explain why she believed the provision did not harm the\ngovernment’s interests. In a subsequent email about the draft NPA, Villafafia asked Lourie for\n“TaJny other thoughts,” but there is no indication that he provided further input. OPR found no\ndocument that suggested Villafafia and Lourie discussed the provision further, or that the other\nindividuals who were copied on Villafafia’s email referencing the provision—her immediate\nsupervisor, the supervisor designated to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office,\nand Villafafia’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it. Villafafia told\nOPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her observation that the non-\nprosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafafia assumed that they agreed with her assessment.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision\nagreeing not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that\ndefense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame\nfor what happened.” Villafafia told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct\nwas his oun “dirty litle secret.” Villafafia said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2oo6\narrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that\nnone of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators\nabout sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-knoun contacts about whom allegations arose\nmany years later.”** Villafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime\nrelationship with a close female friend who was a well-knoun socialite, but, according to\nVillafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.”*°? Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the\nfour female assistants identified by name.”*° Villafafia also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s\ninvestigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to prosecute his four assistants if he\nentered a plea.”4! Because Villafafia was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged,\nshe perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to prosecute other, unspecified\n“co-conspirators.” Villafafia told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did\nnot occur to her that the reference to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any\nof Epstein’s influential associates.\n\nLourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the\ntime Villafafia forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR\nthat he did not knou hou the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.\n238 Villafafia told OPR that “none of . . . the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being\ninvolved in abusing them. It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\n29 The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct\ninvolving the then minor did not occur in Florida.\n\nAAO The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one\ngirl in Epstein’s presence; this assistant was one of the named individuals for whom the defense sought the\ngovernment’s agreement not to prosecute from the outset. Villafafia explained to OPR that this individual was herself\nbelieved to also have been at one time a victim.\n\n24l Villafafia told OPR that the USAO had decided that girls who recruited other girls would not be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo449l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004510.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l3 of 349\nparties.7°* The rush to reach a resolution should not have led the USAO to agree to such a\nsignificant provision without a full consideration of the potential consequences and justification\nfor the provision. It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\nimmigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused\nmore careful consideration of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent consideration\nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\ninterpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n2n8 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified. I\njust don’t knou hou that works.” Villafafia’s co-counsel told OPR:\n\n[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed\n\nto do at the Department of Justice. ... I’ve never heard of anything of the sort... .\n\n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for\n\nexample, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense\n\nwhich was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and\n\nnobody else. I mean on rare occasion I’ve seen cases where say someone was\n\ndealing drugs and their wife was involved. ... And they’ve got kids. . . . [and] it’s\n\nunderstood that the wife probably could be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> and sent to jail too, but you\n\nknou the husband’s willing to go and take the weight .... This is not one of\n\nthose.\nDeputy Atorney General Filip called the provision “prety weird.” Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR\nthat he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor. A senior AUSA with substantial\nexperience prosecuting sex crimes against children commented that it was “horrendous” to provide immunity for\nparticipants in such conduct.\n\nl86\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004525.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 228 of 349\ngovernment informed any victim about the potential for resolving the federal investigation through\na state plea.\n\nA. The Case Agents and Villafafia Solicit Some Victims’ Opinions about\n\nResolving the Federal Investigation\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when she and the case agents met with victims, “we would ask\nthem hou they wanted the case to be resolved.”7*!\n\nAnd most of them wanted the case to be resolved via a plea. Some\nof them wanted him not to be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> at all. Most of them did\nnot want to have to come to court and testify. They were very\nworried about their privacy rights. Some of them wanted him to go\nto jail. But... [s]ome of them talked about bad experiences with\nthe State Atorney’s Office. And so, I felt like sending them back to\nthe State Atorney’s Office was not something that they would have\nsupported.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she also recalled that some victims “expressed . . . concern about\ntheir safety,” and were worried that Epstein would find out about their participation in the\ninvestigation. In her 2ol7 declaration submited in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that the\ntwo CVRA petitioners “never communicated [their] desires to me or the FBI case agents and my\nrole was to evaluate the entire situation, consider the input received from all of the victims, and\nallou the Office to exercise its prosecutorial discretion accordingly.”** She also noted that some\nvictims “fear[ed] having their involvement with Epstein revealed and the negative impact it would\nhave on their relationships with family members, boyfriends, and others.”\n\nIn the FBI case agent’s 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, she stated, “During\ninterviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that Epstein be\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s]\n\nvictims .... A majority of the victims expressed concern about the\n\npossible disclosure of their identities to the public. A number of the\n\nvictims raised concerns about having to testify and/or their parents\n\nfinding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein. Additionally,\n26 Villafafia created for OPR a chart listing victims identified in the state and federal investigations, with\nnotations indicating several with whom Villafafia recalled discussing their opinions about resolving the case. The\nchart, houever, does not indicate what the victims said, and Villafafia told OPR that the information contained in the\nchart was based on her memory of her interactions with each victim. OPR was unable to determine the details or\nextent of any such discussions occurring before September 24, 2oo7, because Villafafia did not have contemporaneous\nnotes of the interviews, and the FBI reports and corresponding notes of the interviews did not contain information\nabout the victims’ desired outcomes. The victims who provided information to OPR did not recall discussing potential\nresolution of the federal investigation with anyone from the government.\n282 In the declaration, Villafafia stated, “Jane Doe 2 specifically told me that she did not want Epstein\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>.”\n\n2ol\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4525\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004548.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 25l of 349\nif you have additional questions which invelve this mater, please coniact the office listed above, When\nyou cail, please previde the file number located af the top of this lelter.

The atorney\nasked Sloman if the USAO “could file criminal charges even though the state was looking into the\nmater,” but Sloman declined to answer his questions concerning the investigation.**” In late\nJanuary, the New York Post reported that the atorney’s clients had filed a $5o million civil suit\nagainst Epstein in Florida and that “Epstein is expected to be sentenced to l8 months in prison\nwhen he pleads guilty in March to a single charge of soliciting an underage prostitute.”**°\n\nBetween January 3l, 2oo8, and May 28, 2oo8, the FBI, with the prosecutors, interviewed\nadditional victims and reinterviewed several who had been interviewed before the NPA was\nsigned.*** In late January 2oo8, as Villafafia and the CEOS Trial Atorney prepared to participate\n33o The case agent also informed Villafafia that she expected to ask for legal process soon in order to obtain\nadditional information.\nal The CEOS Trial Atorney told OPR that she was under the impression that she was brought in to help prepare\nfor the trial because the “plea had fallen through.”\n\nA82 Because Sloman and the atorney were former legal practice partners, Sloman reported the interaction to\nAcosta, and the USAO reported the incident to OPR shortly thereafter.

Prior to the interview, Wild had received the FBI’s January lo, 2oo8\nleter stating that the case was under investigation; houever, according to the case agent, Wild and\ntwo other victims had also been told by the FBI, in October 2oo7, that the case had been resolved.\nIn her 2ol5 CVRA-case declaration, Wild stated that after receiving the FBI leter, she believed\nthat the FBI was investigating the case, and she was not told “about any [NPA] or any potential\nresolution of the federal criminal investigation I was cooperating in. If I had been told of a[n\nNPA], I would have objected.” In Villafafia’s 2ol7 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia\nrecalled interviewing Wild on January 3l, 2oo8, along with FBI agents, and Villafafia told OPR\nshe “asked [Wild] whether she would be willing to testify if there were a trial.” Villafafia recalled\nWild responding that she “hoped Epstein would be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> and that she was willing to\ntestify.>*>\n\nAfter the first three victim interviews on January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia described for Acosta\nand Sloman the toll that the case had taken on two of the victims:\n\nOne girl broke doun sobbing so that we had to stop the interview\n\ntwice .. . she said she was having nightmares about Epstein coming\n\nafter her and she started to break doun again so we stopped the\n\ninterview.\n\nThe second girl .. . was very upset about the l8 month deal she had\n\nread about in the paper.**° She said that l8 months was nothing and\n\nthat she had heard that the girls could get restitution, but she would\n\nrather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time\n\nin jail.3°7\nVillafafia closed the email by requesting that Acosta and Sloman atend the interviews with victims\nscheduled for the follouing day, but neither did so.778 Acosta told OPR that it “wasn’t typical”\n338 The FBI report of the interview did not reflect a discussion of Wild’s intentions.\n738 See Dareh Gregorian, “Tycoon Perved Me at l4 - $5oM Suit Hits NY Creep Over Mansion Massage,” New\nYork Post, Jan. 25, 2oo8.

Immediately thereafter, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that\nEpstein had until “the close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the terms and\nconditions of the agreement . . . including entry of a guilty plea, sentencing, and surrendering to\nbegin his sentence of imprisonment.” That same day, Villafafia made plans to file charges on July\nl, 2oo8, if Epstein did not enter his guilty plea by the June 3o deadline.\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia received a copy of the proposed state plea agreement\nand learned that the plea hearing was scheduled for 8:3o a.m. on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8. Also on\nthat Friday, Villafafia submited to Sloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior a “final final”\nproposed federal indictment of Epstein.\n\nVillafafia and the FBI finalized the government’s victim list that they intended to disclose,\nfor § 2255 purposes, to Epstein after the plea and, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia contacted\nPBPD Chief Reiter to ask him to notify the victims of the plea hearing. Villafafia told OPR that\nSloman said, “Chief Reiter could contact the victims from the state case, and tell them about the\nplea.”*>! On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform him that PBPD Chief\nReiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”?>?\n\n3ol Villafafia further stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n352 Sloman replied, “Good.”\n23l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4555\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004599.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o2 of 349\nthe federal investigation I was cooperating in. If I had been told of a[n NPA], I would have\nobjected.” Wild further stated in her declaration that, “Based on what the FBI had been telling me,\nI thought they were still investigating my case.”\n\nNeither the CEOS Trial Atorney nor the FBI case agent recalled the specifics of the victim\ninterviews. The FBI reports memorializing each interview primarily addressed the facts elicited\nfrom the victim regarding Epstein’s abuse and did not describe any discussion about the status of\nthe case or the victim’s view about the prosecution of Epstein.*°\n\nWhen asked whether she was concerned that failing to tell victims about the NPA when\nshe was interviewing them would mislead victims, as previously noted, Villafafia told OPR that\nshe believed she and the agents were conducting an investigation because they continued\n“interviewing witnesses” and “doing all these things” to file charges and prepare for a federal trial.\nAs Villafafia stated, “So to me, saying to a victim the case is nou back under investigation is\nperfectly accurate.”\n\nVillafafia was also aware that some victims were represented by counsel in connection with\ncivil lawsuits against Epstein, but did not proactively inform the victims’ atorneys about the NPA.\nIn a 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, victims’ atorney Bradley Edwards alleged that\nduring telephone calls with Villafafia, he “asked very specific questions about what stage the\ninvestigation was in,” and Villafafia replied that she could not answer his questions because the\nmater “was an on-going active investigation.” Edwards stated that Villafafia gave him “the\nimpression that the Federal investigation was on-going, very expansive, and continuously grouing,\nboth in the number of identified victims and complexity.” Edwards also stated, “A fair\ncharacterization of each call was that I provided information and asked questions and Villafafia\nlistened and expressed that she was unable to say much or answer the questions I was asking.”\n\nIn her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated that she “listened more than [she] spoke”\nduring her interactions with Edwards and that due to the “uncertainty of the situation” and the\npossibility of a trial, she “did not feel comfortable sharing any information about the case.”\nVillafafia also told OPR that because of “all of these concerns and instructions that I had been\ngiven by Alex [Acosta] and Jeff [Sloman] not to disclose things further and not to have any\ninvolvement in victim notification,” she felt “prohibited” from providing additional information\nto Edwards.\n\nSloman told OPR that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its discretion to notify the victims, “[I]t was [of] concern that this was going to\nbreak doun and .. . result in us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be witnesses\nand if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey, you’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s .. .\ngoing to be instant impeachment for the defense.”**4 Acosta told OPR that, because Epstein did\n‘8 As noted above, the FBI agent’s notes for one victim’s interview reported that she wanted another victim to\nbe <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>.\n\n434 When asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing, Sloman\nresponded that he “was more focused on the restitution provisions. I didn’t get the sense that the victims were overly\ninterested in shouing up . . . at the change of plea.”\n275\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4599\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004715.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 Filed o5/25/2l Page 8 of 26\n\nthis phrase is entirely misplaced. That phrase appears in a specific portion of the Second Circuit’s\nopinion, in which the panel rejected the defendants’ atempt to distinguish Abbamonte and Alessi\nby saying that they were only seeking the same protection afforded by the Double Jeopardy Clause,\nwhile Abbamonte and Alessi involved protections greater than the Double Jeopardy Clause.\nAnnabi, 77l F.2d at 672. In rejecting that argument, the Court explained:\n\nThe argument fails for two reasons. First, since appellants were\n\nnever in jeopardy on the charges dismissed in the Eastern District,\n\nthe protection they nou seek under the plea agreement is necessarily\n\nbroader than that accorded by the Double Jeopardy Clause. Second,\n\nto the extent that the appellants rely on a claim that the Clause, if\n\napplicable, would protect them from prosecution on charges\n\nidentical to those dismissed, the short answer is that the pending\n\ncharges, covering conduct extending more than two years beyond\n\nthe date of the period covered by the dismissed charges, are not the\n\nsame as the charges that were dismissed. Even if, as appellants\n\ncontend, the Southern District charges result from the same\n\nconspiratorial agreement that underlay the charges dismissed in the\n\nEastern District, the allegation that the conspiracy extended for an\n\nadditional two years suffices to shou that the new charges are not\n\nidentical to the dismissed charges.\nId. As the foregoing makes clear, the Second Circuit did not in any way qualify the plain-statement\nrule set forth in its opinion. Rather, the Second Circuit addressed the defendant’s efforts to\ndistinguish precedent based on the Double Jeopardy Clause and explained why the Clause did not\npreclude a prosecution in that case. In other words, this language in Annabi was cabined to an\nanalysis under the Double Jeopardy Clause. As discussed in greater detail belou, the Double\nJeopardy Clause does not preclude a prosecution in this case because Maxwell has not previously\nbeen <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> for the offenses in the S2 Indictment.\n\nIgnoring the Double Jeopardy language in Annabi, the defendant argues that the phrase\n“identical to the dismissed charges” somehou creates a different rule of interpretation for plea\nagreements, under which the Court must first analyze the similarity between the NPA and the S2\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo47l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004721.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 Filed o5/25/2l Page l4 of 26\ndefendant under the Double Jeopardy Clause. Whatever Epstein’s rights and obligations were\nunder the NPA, including his obligation to plead guilty to two state solicitation offenses, the NPA\nis simply an agreement between Epstein and the USAO-SDFL. The USAO-SDFL’s agreement to\ndecline to prosecute other offenses is not an adjudication of any facts that goes to the merits of\nthose offenses. Nor could it be: neither Epstein nor the defendant was charged with those offenses,\nand the NPA was never put before a judge who could engage in fact-finding or even so-order the\nagreement. There is no sense in which the defendant risked conviction or was ever in genuine\njeopardy. See Dionisio, 5o3 F.3d at 84.\n\nThis point is only underscored by United States v. Cambindo Valencia, 6o9 F.2d 6o3 (2d\nCir. l979), on which the defendant relies. In that case, two defendants, Jesus and Rosalinda\nLosada, were <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> for a l974 conspiracy to distribute cocaine, resulting in a guilty plea for\nJesus and, “as part of his plea bargaining agreement, the dismissal of charges against” Rosalinda.\nId. at 637. The two were later charged as part of another cocaine conspiracy. Jd. at 6o7. The\ndefendants argued that the new prosecution violated the Double Jeopardy Clause as to both of\nthem, and the plea agreement as to Rosalinda. /d. at 637. The Second Circuit remanded for the\ndistrict court to reconsider its decision in light of its other holdings narrouing the charged\nconspiracy. It added that “[i]f Jesus’s earlier plea is found to bar prosecution of him because of\ndouble jeopardy, since concededly the plea included an agreement to drop the charges against\nRosalinda, the instant prosecution of Rosalinda will also be barred.” /d. at 638. That is, if double\njeopardy barred re-prosecution of Jesus, the prosecution of Rosalinda was barred because of the\nplea agreement. Accordingly, when the district court later dismissed the count against Jesus on\ndouble jeopardy grounds, it dismissed the count against Rosalinda “because of the government’s\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo472l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004722.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 Filed o5/25/2l Page l5 of 26\nfailure to honor a plea agreement.” United States v. Losada, 674 F.2d l67, l69 (2d Cir. l982).4\nThere, as here, any barrier to prosecution of the defendant arose from the agreement with the\nprosecution, not the Double Jeopardy Clause. And, as described above, the NPA presents no\nbarrier. Accordingly, the defendant’s motion to dismiss Counts Five and Six should be denied.\n\nIl. Counts Five and Six Are Timely\n\nCounts Five and Six are timely charged because the applicable limitations period, l8\nU.S.C. § 3283 (2oo3), permits prosecution for offenses “involving the sexual or physical abuse . . .\nof a child” at any time “during the life of the child,” and the victim identified in Counts Five and\nSix of the S2 Indictment remains alive. The crimes alleged in Counts Five and Six plainly involved\nthe sexual abuse of minors, meaning the § 3283 limitations period applies to both charges. See S2\nIndictment 4 9(d) (discussing the sexual abuse of Minor Victim-4).\n\nIn her motion, the defendant argues that § 3283 only applies if the elements of the crime\nof sex trafficking “necessarily entail” the sexual abuse of minors. (Def. Mot. at 2o-2l). In other\nwords, the defendant claims that the “categorical approach” or “essential ingredients” test applies\nhere. The Court has already considered and rejected this argument. (Apr. Op. at 9-l3). As this\nCourt has held, “[t]o the extent that the categorical approach is ever appropriate in other contexts,\nit is inappropriate here.” (Apr. Op. at ll). Instead, with respect to the statute of limitations, the\n* Although the opinions do not say whether the prosecuting office that signed the plea agreement\nwas the same office that later <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> the Losadas, the prosecution also does not appear to have\nresisted the plea agreement on that basis. See Cambindo-Valencia, 6o9 F.2d at 638.\n> In her previous motions, the defendant argued that Counts One through Four were untimely,\nclaiming that § 3283 cannot be applied retroactively. The Court rejected this argument. (Apr. Op.\nat l3-l6 (analyzing the applicability of § 3283 to pre-2oo3 conduct under Landgraf v. USI Film\nProducts, 5ll U.S. 244, 28o (l994))). In her current motion, the defendant does not appear to\nassert retroactivity arguments with respect to Counts Five and Six. Nor could she. Because Counts\nFive and Six involve conduct up to and including 2oo4, application of the 2oo3 amendment to\n§ 3283 does not require the Court to engage in a retroactivity analysis.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4722\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004792.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3o7 Filed o6/25/2l Page 8of2l\ninculpatory. Fisher, 425 U.S. at 4lo-ll. This is no such case. The existence of deposition\ntranscripts in Maxwell’s civil case is not inculpatory. It is the content of those transcripts that is\nat issue.\n\nIn the face of these straightforward precedents, Maxwell relies primarily on a single\ndistrict court case decided the year before the Second Circuit’s decision in Andover that quashed\na subpoena for deposition testimony covered by a civil protective order. See Dkt. No. l4o, at\nl6-l7 (citing United States v. Oshatz, 7oo F. Supp. 696 (S.D.N.Y. l988)); Dkt. No. 2l2, at l2-\nl3 (same). Oshatz does not suggest that the use of civil deposition testimony in a subsequent\ncriminal trial would violate a defendant’s right against compelled self-incrimination—and if it\ndid, that view would be plainly inconsistent with the Second Circuit’s later, precedential\nopinions. Instead, the case simply describes the standard for whether a court should modify a\nprotective order to allou a government subpoena. Maxwell cites no case in which a court has\nsuppressed evidence because another court erred in modifying a protective order. Even if\nMaxwell were right that the protective order should not have been modified, it would not\ntransform her earlier deposition testimony into the product of coercion.\n\nThe Government would also be entitled to use Maxwell’s deposition testimony against\nher in her perjury trial notwithstanding any violation of her right against compelled self-\nincrimination. The Supreme Court has held that a defendant may be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> for false\nstatements in unlawfully compelled testimony. See United States v. Wong, 43l U.S. l74, l79\n(l977); United States v. Knox, 396 U.S. 77, 82 (l969). As in Knox, Maxwell seeks to suppress\nher deposition transcripts not because they are inculpatory “for a prior or subsequent criminal\nact” but because her statements in those depositions were themselves allegedly criminal.

Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nWe respectfully submit this leter to bring to the Court’s atention the recent decision by\nthe Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. William Henry Cosby\nJr., J-loo-2o2o (Jun. 3o, 2o2l), in which the Court vacated Mr. Cosby’s conviction and sentence\nbecause the District Atorney’s Office that <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> him failed to live up to its express promise\nnot to prosecute Mr. Cosby for the same crimes for which he was later convicted.! Ms. Maxwell’s\ncase presents a similar situation. As we argued in our supplemental pretrial motions currently\npending before the Court (Dkt. 293), the government has failed to abide by its promise not to\nprosecute Ms. Maxwell for the offenses for which she was immunized by the Epstein Non-\nProsecution Agreement (“NPA”). We submit that this decision provides support for Ms.\nMaxwell’s supplemental motion to dismiss Counts One, Three, Five, and Six of the S2 Indictment\nfor violation of the NPA.\n\nIn Cosby, Andrea Constand alleged that Mr. Cosby sexually assaulted her in his residence\nin January 2oo4. (Op. 4-5). Ms. Constand did not immediately report the assault to law\nenforcement authorities and continued to have contact with Mr. Cosby in the follouing months.\n(Id. at 5-7). In January 2oo5, approximately one year after the assault, Ms. Constand reported Mr.\nCosby’s conduct to the police. (/d. at 6). The Montgomery County District Atorney’s Office\ninvestigated the allegations, but then-District Atorney Bruce Castor determined that “there was\ninsufficient credible and admissible evidence” to bring criminal charges against Mr. Cosby. (/d. at\n7-lo). Among the factors weighing against bringing charges were that (l) Ms. Constand had\nwaited a year to file her complaint, which diminished the reliability of Ms. Constand’s\nrecollections; (i) Ms. Constand’s statements about the events were inconsistent; (il) there was a\nlack of corroborating evidence; (iv) Ms. Constand continued to speak to and meet with Mr. Cosby\n! The opinion (“Op.”) is atached to this leter as Exhibit A.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004811.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo Filed o7/o2/2l Page2of3\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 2, 2o2l\nPage 2\nafter the assault; and (v) Ms. Constand had contacted civil atorneys to pursue financial\ncompensation through a lawsuit against Mr. Cosby. (/d. at 9-lo).\nDA Castor issued a signed public statement declining to prosecute Mr. Cosby, which he\nviewed as, and Mr. Cosby’s lawyers understood to be, an agreement that Mr. Cosby would never\nbe <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> for the events involving Ms. Constand. (/d. at lo-l3, l6-l8). Believing that he no\nlonger had a basis to assert his Fifth Amendment rights, Mr. Cosby testified at several depositions\nin a civil suit brought against him by Ms. Constand and made inculpatory admissions. (/d. at l3-\nl5). Ten years later, the successor District Atorney, Risa Vetri Ferman, used those admissions to\ncharge Mr. Cosby with the same crimes related to the sexual assault of Ms. Constand that were\ncovered by DA Castor’s promise. (/d. at l8). Mr. Cosby was convicted of those charges at trial.\n(Id. at 38).\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that DA Castor’s promise was enforceable and that\nDA Ferman’s prosecution of Mr. Cosby ten years later on the same charges violated his Due\nProcess rights. (/d. at 78-79). Asa result, the Court vacated Mr. Cosby’s conviction. (/d. at 79).\nIn so holding, the Court noted the follouing:\nInteractions between a prosecutor and a criminal defendant, including\ncircumstances where the later seeks enforcement of some promise or\nassurance made by the former, are not immune from the dictates of due\nprocess and fundamental fairness.\n\n(Id. at 55).\n\nThe same principle applies to Ms. Maxwell’s case. As in Cosby, the government is trying\nto renege on its agreement and prosecute Ms. Maxwell over 25 years later for the exact same\noffenses for which she was granted immunity in the NPA. Indeed, the principle applies even more\nstrongly in Ms. Maxwell’s case because the NPA was a formal writen agreement, as opposed to\nan informal promise like the one in Cosby. This is not consistent with principles of fundamental\nfairness.\n\nAccordingly, for the reasons already set forth in our supplemental pretrial motions, and the\nprinciples discussed in Cosby, the Court should hold the government to its agreement and dismiss\nCounts One, Three, Five, and Six of the $2 Indictment.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004823.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page ll of 8o\nwere illegal and included discussions that could be interpreted as atempts by Constand\nand her mother to get Cosby to pay Constand so that she would not contact the\nauthorities. The totality of these circumstances ultimately led D.A. Castor to conclude\nthat “there was insufficient credible and admissible evidence upon which any charge\nagainst [] Cosby related to the Constand incident could be proven beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.” N.T., 2/2/2ol6, at 6o.\n\nHaving determined that a criminal trial likely could not be won, D.A. Castor\ncontemplated an alternative course of action that could place Constand on a path to some\nform of justice. He decided that a civil lawsuit for money damages was her best option.\nTo aid Constand in that pursuit, “as the sovereign,” the district atorney “decided that [his\noffice] would not prosecute [] Cosby,” believing that his decision ultimately “would then\nset off the chain of events that [he] thought as a Minister of Justice would gain some\njustice for Andrea Constand.” /d. at 63-64. By removing the threat of a criminal\nprosecution, D.A. Castor reasoned, Cosby would no longer be able in a civil lawsuit to\ninvoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination for fear that his statements\ncould later be used against him by the Commonwealth. Mr. Castor would later testify that\nthis was his intent:\n\nThe Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution states that a person\n\nmay not be compelled to give evidence against themselves. So you can't\n\nsubpoena somebody and make them testify that they did something\n\nillegat—or evidence that would lead someone to conclude they did\n\nsomething illegal—on the threat of if you don’t answer, you'll be subject to\n\nsanctions because you’re under subpoena.\n\nSo the way you remove that from a witness is—if you want to, and what |\n\ndid in this case—is | made the decision as the sovereign that Mr. Cosby\n\nwould not be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> no mater what. As a mater of law, that then made\n\nit so that he could not take the Fifth Amendment ever as a mater of law.\n\nSo | have heard banter in the courtroom and in the press the term\n\n“agreement,” but everybody has used the wrong word. | told [Cosby’s\n\natorney at the time, Walter] Phillips that | had decided that, because of\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - lo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4823\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004824.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page l2 of 8o\ndefects in the case, that the case could not be won and that | was going to\n\nmake a public statement that we were not going to charge Mr. Cosby.\n\n| told him that | was making it as the sovereign Commonwealth of\n\nPennsylvania and, in my legal opinion, that meant that Mr. Cosby would not\n\nbe alloued to take the Fifth Amendment in the subsequent civil suit that\n\nAndrea Constand’s lawyers had told us they wanted to bring.\n\n[Atorney] Phillips agreed with me that that is, in fact, the law of\n\nPennsylvania and of the United States and agreed that if Cosby was\n\nsubpoenaed, he would be required to testify.\n\nBut those two things were not connected one to the other.

And my belief\n\nwas that, as the Commonwealth and the representative of the sovereign,\n\nthat | had the pouer to make such a statement and that, by doing so, as a\n\nmater of law Mr. Cosby would be unable to assert the Fifth Amendment in\n\na civil deposition.\n\n[Atorney] Phillips, a lawyer of vastly more experience even than me—and\n\n| had 2o years on the job by that point—agreed with my legal assessment.\n\nAnd he said that he would communicate that to the lawyers who were\n\nrepresenting Mr. Cosby in the pending civil suit.\n\nId. at 64-66. Recalling his thought process at the time, the former district atorney further\nemphasized that it was “absolutely” his intent to remove “for all time” the possibility of\nprosecution, because “the ability to take the Fifth Amendment is also for all time removed.”\nId. at 67.\n\nConsistent with his discussion with Atorney Phillips, D.A. Castor issued another\npress release, this time informing the public that he had decided not to prosecute Cosby.\nThe press release stated, in full:\n\nMontgomery County District Atorney Bruce L. Castor, Jr. has announced\n\nthat a joint investigation by his office and the Cheltenham Tounship Police\n\nDepartment into allegations against actor and comic Bill Cosby is\n\nconcluded.

Castor did not communicate to Constand or her counsel his decision to\npermanently forego prosecuting Cosby. In fact, Constand did not learn of the decision\nuntil a reporter appeared at one of her civil atorney’s offices later that evening. With the\nresolution of her allegations removed from the criminal courts, Constand turned to the\ncivil realm. On March 8, 2ol5, less than one month after the district atorney’s press\nrelease, Constand filed a lawsuit against Cosby in the United States District Court for the\nEastern District of Pennsylvania.®\n\nDuring discovery in that lawsuit, Cosby sat for four depositions. Cosby's atorney\nfor the civil proceedings, John Schmit, had learned about the non-prosecution decision\nfrom Cosby’s criminal counsel, Walter Phillips. From the perspective of Cosby’s\natorneys, the district atorney’s decision legally deprived Cosby of any right or ability to\ninvoke the Fifth Amendment. Accordingly, not once during the four depositions did Cosby\ninvoke the Fifth Amendment or even mention it. During one deposition, Atorney Schmit\nadvised Cosby not to answer certain questions pertaining to Constand, but he did not\nspecifically invoke the Fifth Amendment.’ Nor did Cosby claim the protections of the Fifth\nAmendment when asked about other alleged victims of his sexual abuse, presumably\nbecause he believed that he no longer retained that privilege. In fact, no one involved\nwith either side of the civil suit indicated on the record a belief that Cosby could be\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> in the future. D.A.

The Commonwealth filed a\nresponse to the motion, to which Cosby replied.\n\nFrom February 2-3, 2ol6, the trial court conducted hearings on Cosby’s habeas\npetition, which it ultimately denied. Later, in its Pa.R.A.P. l925(a) opinion, the trial court\nexplained that “the only conclusion that was apparent” from the record “was that no\nagreement or promise not to prosecute ever existed, only the exercise of prosecutorial\ndiscretion.” Tr. Ct. Op. (“T.C.O.”), 5/l4/2ol9, at 62. In support of this conclusion, the trial\ncourt provided a lengthy summary of what it found to be the pertinent facts developed at\nthe habeas corpus hearing. Because our analysis in this case focuses upon the trial\ncourt’s interpretation of those testimonies, we reproduce that court’s synopsis here:\n\nOn January 24, 2oo5, then District Atorney Bruce L. Castor, Jr., issued a\n\nsigned press release announcing an investigation into Ms. Constand’s\n\nallegations. Mr. Castor testified that as the District Atorney in 2oo5, he\noversaw the investigation into Ms. Constand’s allegations. Ms. Ferman\nsupervised the investigation along with County Detective Richard Peffall\n\nand Detective Richard Schaffer of Cheltenham. Mr. Castor testified that “I\n\nassigned who | thought were our best people to the case. And | took an\n\nactive role as District Atorney because | thought | oued it to Canada to\n\nshou that, in America, we will investigate allegations against celebrities.”\n\nMr. Castor testified that Ms. Constand went to the Canadian police almost\n\nexactly one year after the alleged assault and that the case was ultimately\n\nreferred to Montgomery County. The lack of a prompt complaint was\nsignificant to Mr. Castor in terms of Ms. Constand’s credibility and in terms\n\nof law enforcement’s ability to collect physical evidence. He also placed\n\nsignificance on the fact that Ms. Constand told the Canadian authorities that\n\nshe contacted a lawyer in Philadelphia prior to speaking with them. He also\n\nreviewed Ms. Constand’s statements to police. Mr. Castor felt that there\n\nwere inconsistences in her statements. Mr. Castor did not recall press\n\nquotes atributed to him calling the case “weak” at a 2oo5 press conference.\nupon pre-arrest delay; and (3) a motion to disqualify the Montgomery County District\nAtorney’s Office.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - l9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4832\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004833.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 2l of 8o\nLikewise, he did not recall the specific statement, “[i]n Pennsylvania we\ncharged people for criminal conduct. We don’t charge people with making\na mistake or doing something foolish;” houever, he indicated that it is a true\nstatement.\n\nAs part of the 2oo5 investigation, [Cosby] gave a full statement to law\nenforcement and his Pennsylvania and New York homes were searched.\n[Cosby] was accompanied by counsel and did not invoke the Fifth\nAmendment at any time during the statement. After [Cosby's] interview,\nMs. Constand was interviewed a second time. Mr. Castor never personally\nmet with Ms. Constand. Follouing that interview of Ms. Constand, Mr.\nCastor spoke to [Cosby’s] atorney Walter M. Phillips, Jr. Mr. Phillips told\nMr. Castor that during the year between the assault and the report, Ms.\nConstand had multiple phone contacts with [Cosby]. Mr. Phillips was also\nconcerned that Ms. Constand had recorded phone calls with [Cosby]. Mr.\nPhillips told Mr. Castor that if he obtained the phone records and the\nrecorded calls he would conclude that Ms. Constand and her mother were\natempting was to get money from [Cosby] so they would not go to the\npolice. While he did not necessarily agree with the conclusions Mr. Phillips\nthought would be drawn from the records, Mr. Castor directed the police to\nobtain the records. Mr. Castor’s recollection was that there was an\n“inordinate number of [phone] contacts” between [Cosby] and Ms. Constand\nafter the assault. He also confirmed the existence of at least two “wire\ninterceptions,” which he did not believe would be admissible.\nAs part of the 2oo5 investigation, allegations made by other women were\nalso investigated. Mr. Castor delegated that investigation to Ms. Ferman.\nHe testified that he determined that, in his opinion, these allegations were\nunreliable.\nFollouing approximately one month of investigation, Mr. Castor concluded\nthat “there was insufficient credible and admissible evidenced upon which\nany charge against Mr. Cosby related to the Constand incident could be\nproven beyond a reasonable doubt.” He testified that he could either leave\nthe case open at that point or definitively close the case to allou a civil case.\nHe did not believe there was a chance that the criminal case could get any\nbeter. He believed Ms. Constand’s actions created a credibility issue that\ncould not be overcome.\nMr. Castor further indicated, “Mr. Phillips never agreed to anything in\nexchange for Mr. Cosby not being <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>.” Mr. Castor testified that he\ntold Mr. Philips of his legal assessment and then told Ms. Ferman of the\nanalysis and directed her to contact Constand’s atorneys. He testified that\nshe was to contact the atorneys to let them knou that “Cosby was not going\nto be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> and that the purpose for that was that | wanted to create\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 2o\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4833\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004834.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 22 of 8o\nthe atmosphere or the legal conditions such that Mr. Cosby would never be\nalloued to assert the Fifth Amendment in the civil case.” He testified that\nshe did not come back to him with any objection from Ms. Constand’s\natorneys and that any objection from Ms. Constand’s atorneys would not\nhave matered anyway. He later testified that he did not have any specific\nrecollection of discussing his legal analysis with Ms. Ferman, but would be\nsurprised if he did not.\n\nMr. Castor testified that he could not recall any other case where he made\nthis type of binding legal analysis in Montgomery County. He testified that\nin a half dozen cases during his tenure in the District Atorney’s office,\nsomeone would atempt to assert the Fifth Amendment in a preexisting civil\ncase. The judge in that case would then call Mr. Castor to determine if he\nintended to prosecute the person asserting the privilege. He could confirm\nthat he did not and the claim of privilege would be denied. Mr. Castor was\nunable to name a case in which this happened.\n\nAfter making his decision not to prosecute, Mr. Castor personally issued a\nsecond, signed press release on February l7, 2oo5. Mr. Castor testified\nthat he signed the press release at the request of Ms. Constand’s atorneys\nin order to bind the Commonwealth so it “would be evidence that they could\nshou to a civil judge that Cosby is not geting <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>.” The press\nrelease stated, “After reviewing the above and consulting with County and\nCheltenham Detectives, the District Atorney finds insufficient, credible and\nadmissible evidence exists upon which any charge against Mr. Cosby could\nbe sustained beyond a reasonable doubt.” Mr. Castor testified that this\nlanguage made it absolute that [Cosby] would never be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>, “[s]o |\nused the present tense, [exists], .. . So I’m making it absolute. | said |\nfound that there was no evidence—there was insufficient credible and\nadmissible evidence in existence upon which any charge against [Cosby]\ncould be sustained. And the use of ‘exists’ and ‘could’ | meant to be\nabsolute.”\n\nThe press release specifically cautioned the parties that the decision could\nbe revisited, “District Atorney Castor cautions all parties to this mater that\nhe will reconsider this decision should the need arise.” He testified that\ninclusion of this sentence, warning that the decision could be revisited, in\nthe paragraph about a civil case and the use of the word “this,” was intended\nto make clear that it applied to the civil case and not to the prosecution. Mr.\nCastor testified that this sentence was meant to advise the parties that if\nthey criticized his decision, he would contact the media and explain that Ms.\nConstand’s actions damaged her credibility, which would severely hamper\nher civil case. He testified that once he was certain a prosecution was not\nviable “| operated under the certainty that a civil suit was coming and set up\nthe dominoes to fall in such a way that Mr. Cosby would be required to\ntestify.” He included the language “much exists in this investigation that\ncould be used by others to portray persons on both sides of the issue in a\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4834\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004836.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 24 of 8o\nCosby in order to remove from him the ability to claim his Fifth\nAmendment protection against self-incrimination, thus forcing\nhim to sit for a deposition under oath. ... But those lawyers\nrepresenting [Constand] civilly . .. were part of this agreement\nbecause they wanted to make Cosby testify. | believed at the\ntime that they thought making him testify would solidify their\ncivil case, but the only way to do that was for us (the\nCommonwealth) to promise not to prosecute him. So in effect,\nthat is what | did. | never made an important decision without\ndiscussing it with you during your tenure as First Assistant.\n\n[B]ut one thing is fact. The Commonwealth, defense and civil\n\nplaintiff's lawyers were all in agreement that the atached\n\ndecision from me stripped Cosby of his Fifth Amendment\n\nprivilege against self-incrimination forcing him to be deposed.\nHe indicated in his email that he learned Mr. Phillips had died on the date\nof his email. The email also suggested that the deposition might be subject\nto suppression.\nMs. Ferman responded to Mr. Castor’s email by leter of September 25,\n2ol5, requesting a copy of the “writen declaration” indicating that [Cosby]\nwould not be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>. In her leter, Ms. Ferman indicated that “[t]he first\n| heard of such a binding agreement was your email sent this past\nWednesday. The first | heard of a writen declaration documenting the\nagreement not to prosecute was authored on 9/24/l5 and published today\nby Margaret Gibbons of the Intelligencer. ... We have been in contact with\ncounsel for both Mr. Cosby and Ms. Constand and neither has provided us\nwith any information about such an agreement.”\nMr. Castor responded by email. His email indicated,\n\nThe atached Press Release is the writen determination that\n\nwe would not prosecute Cosby. That was what the lawyers\n\nfor the plaintiffs wanted and | agreed. The reason | agreed\n\nand the plaintiff's wanted it in writing was so Cosby could not\n\ntake the 5\" Amendment to avoid being deposed or\n\ntestifying. ... That meant to all involved, including Cosby’s\n\nlawyer at the time, Mr. Phillips, that what Cosby said in the\n\ncivil litigation could not be used against him in a criminal\n\nprosecution for the event we had him under investigation for\n\nin early 2oo5. | signed the press release for precisely this\n\nreason, at the request of Plaintiff's counsel, and with the\n\nacquiescence of Cosby’s counsel, with full and complete\n\nintent to bind the Commonwealth that anything Cosby said in\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4836\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004837.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 25 of 8o\n\nthe civil case could not be used against him, thereby forcing\n\nhim to be deposed and perhaps testify in a civil trial without\n\nthe ability to “take the 5.” | decided to create the best\n\npossible environment for the Plaintiff to prevail and be\n\ncompensated. By signing my name as District Atorney and\n\nissuing the atached, | was “signing off” on the Commonwealth\n\nnot being able to use anything Cosby said in the civil case\n\nagainst him in a criminal prosecution, because | was stating\n\nthe Commonwealth will not bring a case against Cosby for the\n\nincident based on the then-available evidence in order to help\n\nthe Plaintiff prevail in her civil action . . . [nJaturally, if a\n\nprosecution could be made out without using what Cosby\n\nsaid, or anything derived from what Cosby said, | believed\n\nthen and continue to believe that a prosecution is not\n\nprecluded.\nMr. Castor testified that he intended to confer transactional immunity upon\n[Cosby] and that his pouer to do so as the sovereign was derived from\ncommon law not from the statutes of Pennsylvania. In his final email to Ms.\nFerman, Mr. Castor stated, “Il never agreed we would not prosecute Cosby.”\nAs noted, Ms. Constand’s civil atorneys also testified at the hearing.\nDolores Troiani, Esq. testified that during the 2oo5 investigation, she had\nno contact with the District Atorney’s office and limited contact with the\nCheltenham Police Department. Bebe Kivitz, Esq. testified that during the\n2oo5 investigation she had limited contact with then-First Assistant District\nAtorney Ferman. The possibility of a civil suit was never discussed with\nanyone from the Commonwealth or anyone representing [Cosby] during the\ncriminal investigation. At no time did anyone from Cheltenham Police, or\nthe District Atorney's Office, convey to Ms. Troiani, or Ms. Kivitz, that\n[Cosby] would never be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>. They learned that the criminal case\nwas declined from a reporter who came to Ms. Troiani’s office in the evening\nof February l7, 2oo5 seeking comment about what Bruce Castor had done.\nThe reporter informed her that Mr. Castor had issued a press release in\nwhich he declined prosecution. Ms. Troiani had not receive any prior\nnotification of the decision not to prosecute.\nMs. Constand and her atorneys did not request a declaration from Mr.\nCastor that [Cosby] would not be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>. Ms. Troiani testified that if\n[Cosby] atempted to invoke the Fifth Amendment during his civil\ndepositions they would have filed a motion and he would have likely been\nprecluded since he had given a statement to police. If he was permited to\nassert a Fifth Amendment privilege, they would have been entitled to an\nadverse inference jury instruction. Additionally, if [Cosby] asserted the Fifth\nAmendment, Ms. Constand’s version of the story would have been the only\nversion for the jury to consider. Ms. Constand and her counsel had no\nreason to request immunity. At no time during the civil suit did Ms. Troiani\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4837\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004838.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 26 of 8o\nreceive any information in discovery or from [Cosby’s] atorneys indicating\nthat [Cosby] could never be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>.\n\nMs. Troiani testified that she understood the press release to say that Mr.\nCastor was not prosecuting at that time but if additional information arose,\nhe would change his mind. She did not take the language, “District Atorney\nCastor cautions all parties to this mater that he will reconsider this decision\nshould the need arise,” to be a threat not to speak publicly. She continued\nto speak to the press; Mr. Castor did not retaliate.\nMs. Troiani was present for [Cosby’s] depositions. At no point during the\ndepositions was there any mention of an agreement or promise not to\nprosecute. In her experience, such a promise would have been put on the\nrecord at the civil depositions. She testified that during the four days of\ndepositions, [Cosby] was not cooperative and the depositions were\nextremely contentious. Ms. Troiani had to file motions to compel [Cosby’s]\nanswers. [Cosby’s] refusal to answer questions related to Ms. Constand’s\nallegations formed the basis of a motion to compel. When Ms. Troiani\natempted to question [Cosby] about the allegations, [Cosby’s] atorneys\nsought to have his statement to police read into the record in lieu of cross\nexamination.\nMs. Troiani testified that one of the initial provisions [Cosby] wanted in the\ncivil setlement was a release from criminal liability. [Cosby’s civil atorney\nPatrick] O’Conner’s leter to Ms. Ferman does not dispute this fact. [Cosby]\nand his atorneys also requested that Ms. Troiani agree to destroy her file,\nshe refused. Eventually, the parties agreed on the language that Ms.\nConstand would not initiate any criminal complaint. The first Ms. Troiani\nheard of a promise not to prosecute was in 2ol5. The first Ms. Kivitz learned\nof the purported promise was in a 2ol4 newspaper article.\nJohn P. Schmit, Esq., testified that he has represented [Cosby] since l983.\nIn the early l99os, he became [Cosby’s] general counsel. In 2oo5, when\nhe became aware of the instant allegations, he retained criminal counsel,\nWilliam Phillips, Esq., on [Cosby’s] behalf. Mr. Phillips dealt directly with\nthe prosecutor’s office and would then discuss all maters with Mr. Schmit.\n[Cosby’s] January 2oo5 interview took place at Mr. Schmit’s office. Both\nMr. Schmit and Mr. Phillips were present for the interview. Numerous\nquestions were asked the answers to which could lead to criminal charges.\nAt no time during his statement to police did [Cosby] invoke the Fifth\nAmendment or refuse to answer questions. Mr. Schmit testified that he had\ninterviewed [Cosby] prior to his statement and was not concerned about his\nanswers. Within weeks of the interview, the District Atorney declined to\nbring a prosecution. Mr. Schmit testified that Mr. Phillips told him that the\ndecision was an irrevocable commitment that District Atorney Castor was\nnot going to prosecute [Cosby]. He received a copy of the press release.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 25\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4838\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004843.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 3l of 8o\n\nOn May 24, 2ol6, follouing a preliminary hearing, all of Cosby’s charges were held\nfor trial. Thereafter, Cosby filed a number of pretrial motions, including a petition for a\nwrit of habeas corpus, a motion to dismiss the charges on due process grounds, and,\nmost pertinent here, a “Motion to Suppress the Contents of his Deposition Testimony and\nAny Evidence Derived therefrom on the Basis that the District Atorney’s Promise not to\nProsecute Him Induced Him to Waive his Fifth Amendment Right Against Self-\nIncrimination.” After holding a hearing on the suppression motion, at which no new\ntestimony was taken, the trial court again concluded that former District Atorney Castor’s\ntestimony was equivocal, credited the testimony of Constand’s atorneys, and found that\nno promise or agreement not to prosecute existed. Having so determined, the court\ndiscerned “no [c]onstitutional barrier to the use of [Cosby’s] civil deposition testimony”\nagainst him at trial, and it denied the suppression motion.'> Later, the Commonwealth\nwould introduce portions of Cosby’s deposition testimony against Cosby, including his\nadmissions to using Qualudes during sexual encounters with women in the past.\n\nOn September 6, 2ol6, the Commonwealth filed a “Motion to Introduce Evidence\nof Other Bad Acts of the Defendant,” which Cosby opposed by writen response. The\nCommonwealth sought to introduce evidence and testimony from other women who\nalleged that Cosby had sexually assaulted them, instances that could not be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>\ndue to the lapse of applicable statutes of limitations. On February 24, 2ol7, the trial court\ngranted the Commonwealth’s motion, but permited only one of these alleged past victims\nto testify at Cosby’s trial.\n\nOn December 3o, 2ol6, Cosby filed a motion seeking a change in venue or venire.\nThe trial court kept the case in Montgomery County, but agreed that the jury should be\nl8 T.C.O. at 72 (quoting Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Sur\nDefendant’s Motion to Suppress Evidence Pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 58l(l), l2/5/2ol6,\nat 5).\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4843\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004859.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 47 of 8o\nThe decisions belou, barring prosecution of the Stipetiches, embodied\nconcern that allouing charges to be brought after George Stipetich had\nperformed his part of the agreement by answering questions about sources\nof the contraband discovered in his residence would be fundamentally unfair\nbecause in answering the questions he may have disclosed information that\ncould be used against him.

Although the Superior Court dismissed this passage from Stipetich as dicta,\nit found the situation distinguishable in any event inasmuch as former D.A.

Thus, the Superior Court discerned no error in the trial court’s decision\nto allou the use of Cosby’s deposition testimony against him at trial.'®\nng In addition to the Rule 4o4(b) and non-prosecutions claims, the Superior Court\nrejected a number of other issues raised by Cosby, including an assertion of improper\njuror bias, a challenge to an allegedly misleading jury instruction, and a contention that\nSORNA was unconstitutional.

This notion of reasonableness would be manifestly unjust in this context.\nDefendants, judges, and the public would be forced to assume fraud or deceit by the\nprosecutor. The atorney-client relationship would be predicated upon mistrust, and the\ndefendant would be forced to navigate the criminal justice process on his oun, despite\nthe substantial deficit in the critical knouledge that is necessary in order to do so, as so\ncompellingly explained by Justice Black.\n\nSuch an understanding of reasonableness is untenable. Instead of facilitating the\nright to counsel, it undermines that right. We reject this interpretation. We find nothing\nunreasonable about Cosby’s reliance upon his atorneys and upon D.A. Castor’s public\nannouncement of the Commonwealth’s charging decision.\n\nThe trial court alternatively suggested that Cosby’s belief that he would never be\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>, thus stripping him of his Fifth Amendment rights, based upon litle more than\na press release, was unreasonable because neither Cosby nor his atorneys demanded\nthat the terms of any offers or assurances by D.A. Castor be reduced to writing. This\nreasoning is unpersuasive. Neither the trial court, nor the Commonwealth for that mater,\ncites any legal principle that requires a prosecutor’s assurances to be memorialized in\nwriting in order to warrant reasonable reliance. We decline to construe as unreasonable\nthe failure to do that which the law does not require.\n\nIt also has been suggested that the level of the defendant’s sophistication is a\nrelevant factor in assessing whether his reliance upon a prosecutor’s decision was\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 7o\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4883\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004884.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 72 of 8o\nreasonable. Such a consideration is both impractical and unfair. There is no equitable\nmethod of assessing a particular defendant’s degree of sophistication. Any atempt would\nbe an arbitrary line-drawing exercise that unjustifiably would deem some sophisticated\nand some not. Nor are there any objective criteria that could be used to make that\nassessment accurately. Would sophistication for such purposes be established based\nupon one’s ability to hire one or more atorneys? By the level of education atained by\nthe defendant? Or perhaps by the number of times the defendant has participated in the\ncriminal justice system? There is no measure that could justify assessing reasonableness\nbased upon the so-called sophistication of the defendant.\n\nThe contours of the right to counsel do not vary based upon the characteristics of\nthe individual seeking to invoke it. Our Constitutions safeguard fundamental rights\nequally for all. The right to counsel applies with equal force to the sophisticated and the\nunsophisticated alike. The most experienced defendant, the wealthiest suspect, and\neven the most-seasoned defense atorney are each entitled to rely upon the advice of\ntheir counsel. Notwithstanding Cosby’s wealth, age, number of atorneys, and media\nsavvy, he, too, was entitled to rely upon the advice of his counsel. No level of\nsophistication can alter that fundamental constitutional guarantee.\n\nIn accordance with the advice his atorneys, Cosby relied upon D.A. Castor’s public\nannouncement that he would not be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>. His reliance was reasonable, and it\nresulted in the deprivation of a fundamental constitutional right when he was compelled\nto furnished  self-incriminating testimony. Cosby reasonably relied upon the\nCommonwealth's decision for approximately ten years. When he announced his\ndeclination decision on behalf of the Commonwealth, District Atorney Castor knew that\nCosby would be forced to testify based upon the Commonwealth’s assurances.

All of this started with D.A. Castor’s compulsion of Cosby’s\nreliance upon a public proclamation that Cosby would not be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>. The CDO’s\nremedy for all of this would include subjecting Cosby to a third criminal trial. That is no\nremedy at all. Rather, it is an approach that would place Cosby nouhere near where he\nwas before the due process violation took root.\n\nThere is only one remedy that can completely restore Cosby to the status quo ante.\nHe must be discharged, and any future prosecution on these particular charges must be\nbarred. We do not dispute that this remedy is both severe and rare. But it is warranted\nhere, indeed compelled. The CDO would shun this remedy because (at least in part) it\nmight thwart the “public interest in having the guilty brought to book.”*4 It cannot be\ngainsaid that society holds a strong interest in the prosecution of crimes. It is also true\nthat no such interest, houever important, ever can eclipse society’s interest in ensuring\nthat the constitutional rights of the people are vindicated. Society’s interest in prosecution\ndoes not displace the remedy due to constitutionally aggrieved persons.\nIV. Conclusion\nWe do not question the discretion that is vested in prosecutors “over whether\ncharges should be brought in any given case.” Stipetich, 652 A.2d at l295. We will not\nundermine a prosecutor’s “general and widely recognized pouer to conduct criminal\nlitigation and prosecutions on behalf of the Commonwealth, and to decide whether and\nwhen to prosecute, and whether and when to continue or discontinue a case.” /d.

Even if this Court agreed with the analysis in\nCosby, that opinion sheds no light on the proper interpretation of the NPA in this case.\n\nAfter considering the arguments in Maxwell’s renewed motion and leter of supplemental\nauthority, the Court’s view remains unchanged from its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order. Under\nSecond Circuit precedent, the NPA does not bind the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nNew York. It thus does not bar the charges in the S2 superseding indictment.\n\nI. This prosecution does not violate the prohibition against double jeopardy\n\nThe Double Jeopardy Clause provides that “[n]o person shall be . . . subject for the same\noffence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.” U.S. Const. amend. V. “This protection\napplies both to successive punishments and to successive prosecutions for the same criminal\noffense.” United States v. Dixon, 5o9 U.S. 688, 696 (l993). “A defendant may only raise a\nDouble Jeopardy claim if he has been put in jeopardy (i.e. jeopardy has ‘atached’) sometime\nbefore the alleged ‘second’ prosecution.” United States v. Podde, lo5 F.3d 8l3, 8l6 (2d Cir.\nl997). A defendant is put in jeopardy when the jury in their case is empaneled or upon the\ndefendant’s entry of a guilty plea. Crist v. Bretz, 437 U.S. 28, 35 (l978); Morris v. Reynolds,\n264 F.3d 38, 49 (2d Cir. 2ool). Until then, a defendant has not been put in jeopardy and the\nGovernment is free to commence a prosecution.\n\nMaxwell has not previously been put in jeopardy for the offenses charged in this case.\nShe concededly has not been punished or <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> for any prior offense. She was never\ncharged in the Southern District of Florida in connection with the Epstein investigation. She\nagreed to nothing in Epstein’s NPA, because she was not a party to it. She suffered no criminal\nconsequences as a result of Epstein’s guilty plea in Florida state court. To the contrary, there is\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4979\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004985.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3l7 Filed o8/l3/2l Pagellofl4\nVI. _No bill of particulars is warranted\n\nMaxwell moves for a bill of particulars as to counts five and six. Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 7 requires that an indictment contain “a plain, concise, and definite writen\nstatement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged|.|” The indictment must be\nspecific enough to inform the defendant of the charges and allou the defendant to plead double\njeopardy in a later prosecution based on the same events. See United States v. Stavroulakis, 952\nF.2d 686, 693 (2d Cir. l992). “Under this test, an indictment need do litle more than to track the\nlanguage of the statute charged and state the time and place (in approximate terms) of the alleged\ncrime.” United States. v. Tramunti, 5l3 F.2d lo87, ll3 (2d Cir. l975).\n\n“Rule 7(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure permits a defendant to seek a bill\nof particulars in order to identify with sufficient particularity the nature of the charge pending\nagainst him, thereby enabling defendant to prepare for trial, to prevent surprise, and to interpose\na plea of double jeopardy should he be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> a second time for the same offense.” United\nStates v. Bortnovsky, 82o F.2d 572, 574 (2d Cir. l987). “The purpose of a bill of particulars is to\nsupplement the allegations in the indictment when necessary to (l) enable the defendant to\nprepare his defense, (2) avoid unfair surprise to the defendant at trial, and (3) preclude a second\nprosecution of the same offense.” United States v. Mandell, 7lo F. Supp. 2d 368, 384 (S.D.N.Y.\n2olo)). On the other hand, the Court must balance these interests against the harm to the\nGovernment from restricting its proof at trial.

(Ex. A at l-2).\n\nBut as set forth above, testimony about the “resolution” of a prior investigation is\nirrelevant hearsay that would only serve to confuse the jury. Evidence about the “scope,”\n“timeline,” or “various investigative steps taken by the agents” is similarly irrelevant and\nmisleading. The case agents are not summary witnesses that the defense can use to place before\nthe jury sweeping conclusions about the Florida Investigations or this one.” The bases identified\nfor their testimony are improper, and the Court should preclude them unless the defense\nidentifies a specific, valid purpose for their testimony.\n\nIV. The Court Should Preclude Evidence or Argument About the Government’s\nAlleged Motives for Prosecution\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has claimed that she is being <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> as a\nscapegoat because Jeffrey Epstein is dead. (See, e.g., Mem. of Law, Dkt. No. l42, at l (“[T]he\ngovernment has sought to substitute our client for Jeffrey Epstein... .”)). That claim is as false\nas it is offensive. But in any event, the Government’s motives for prosecution are irrelevant to\nthe question of the defendant’s factual guilt that will be before the jury at trial, and any probative\n’ Furthermore, the proffered bases for the case agents’ testimony will likely run afoul of\nnumerous evidentiary rules. The Government’s case agents cannot testify to the substance of\n“numerous witness interviews they conducted” with uncalled witnesses, which is hearsay. The\nagents’ prior testimony before the grand jury is admissible only under the limited principles that\ngovern prior consistent or inconsistent statements. And there is significant risk that case agent\ntestimony will introduce additional evidentiary issues. For instance, questioning the case agents\nabout information their investigations generated about the defendant would likely yield hearsay\nresponses and would open the door to agents offering other information that is inculpatory to the\ndefendant and that the Government would not otherwise offer at trial.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5427\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005512.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 57 of 69\nadmissible to demonstrate the lack of any intent or knouledge on the part of Ms. Maxwell. As\nwith the other in /imine requests, this evidence will need to be evaluated on a question by\nquestion basis and it is premature to issue blanket rulings as requested by the government.\n\nThis case poses multi-jurisdictional issues that invite various defenses. The government\nhas elected to prosecute, federally, conduct that is quintessentially state-based, and it is bound by\nits choice. It has charged offenses associated with coercion, force and violence, when such\nconduct did not occur in this case. It has alleged violation of a statute enacted to combat human\ntrafficking, conduct that does not exist in this case. The government has manipulated federal\nstatutes to fit alleged conduct that is not normally <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> federally and seeks to preclude\ndefenses responsive to the allegations in the Indictment. It is premature to constrain Ms.\nMaxwell’s defense before trial. Ms. Maxwell reserves the right to present evidence and make\nargument on the issue of consent when and where appropriate.\n\nVI. UNFOUNDED REQUEST TO PRECLUDE EVIDENCE OF MS. MAXWELL'S\n\nGOOD ACTS SHOULD BE SUMMARILY DENIED\n\nThe government asks this Court to require that, before Ms. Maxwell refers to or offers\nevidence of her “absence when Epstein abused victims who are not part of the government’s\ncase-in-chief, . . . [she] explain the evidence she plans to offer and why such evidence would be\nadmissible.” Mot. at 44. According to the government, evidence that Ms. Maxwell was “absent”\nwhen Mr. Epstein allegedly abused certain individuals is actually inadmissible “good acts”\nevidence because the jury could use it on/y to conclude that Ms. Maxwell acted in conformity\nwith the prior good acts. Jd.

The Government’s Alleged Motives Are Irrelevant\n\nThe defense claims it is proper to cast aspersions on the Government’s alleged motives for\nprosecuting the defendant, and they claim they should be permited to advance theories that\nEpstein’s death motivated the “timing of the charges” in this case. (Def. Opp. at 42). The defense\nconcedes that they have not established a vindictive or selective prosecution claim. (/d.). That is\nbecause they have no legitimate theory based on the Government’s supposed motives. But the\ndefense is not permited to direct this argument to the jury simply because they lack a basis to\nmake that argument to the Court. (See Gov’t Mot. at 34-35 (“The Second Circuit has explained\nthat claims of purported government misconduct must be ‘directed to the court rather than jury.’””\n(quoting United States v. Regan, lo3 F.3d lo72, lo82 (2d Cir. l997)))).\n\nAs the Government said in its motions, the defense is free to argue that Epstein is guilty\nand the defendant is innocent. (/d. at 35-36). They are not free, houever, to argue that—\nirrespective of guilt or innocence—the defendant is being <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> because Epstein is dead.\nCertainly, the defense could not make that argument absent any evidence, and no agent—including\nthe Florida and New York case agents—can offer hearsay testimony about why they think\nprosecutors charged or did not charge certain individuals at certain times. And to be clear, the\nagents would testify that this case was charged promptly after the Government was in a position\nto prove the defendant’s guilt.\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5589\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005731.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 39l Filed lo/29/2l Page6ofll\n\nIn approximately April 2oo6 the investigation was concluded.

(See, e.g., Mem. of Law, Dkt. No. l42, at l (“[T]he\ngovernment has sought to substitute our client for Jeffrey Epstein... .”)). That claim is as false\nas it is offensive. But in any event, the Government’s motives for prosecution are irrelevant to\nthe question of the defendant’s factual guilt that will be before the jury at trial, and any probative\n’ Furthermore, the proffered bases for the case agents’ testimony will likely run afoul of\nnumerous evidentiary rules. The Government’s case agents cannot testify to the substance of\n“numerous witness interviews they conducted” with uncalled witnesses, which is hearsay. The\nagents’ prior testimony before the grand jury is admissible only under the limited principles that\ngovern prior consistent or inconsistent statements. And there is significant risk that case agent\ntestimony will introduce additional evidentiary issues. For instance, questioning the case agents\nabout information their investigations generated about the defendant would likely yield hearsay\nresponses and would open the door to agents offering other information that is inculpatory to the\ndefendant and that the Government would not otherwise offer at trial.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6394\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006474.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 57 of 69\nadmissible to demonstrate the lack of any intent or knouledge on the part of Ms. Maxwell. As\nwith the other in /imine requests, this evidence will need to be evaluated on a question by\nquestion basis and it is premature to issue blanket rulings as requested by the government.\n\nThis case poses multi-jurisdictional issues that invite various defenses. The government\nhas elected to prosecute, federally, conduct that is quintessentially state-based, and it is bound by\nits choice. It has charged offenses associated with coercion, force and violence, when such\nconduct did not occur in this case. It has alleged violation of a statute enacted to combat human\ntrafficking, conduct that does not exist in this case. The government has manipulated federal\nstatutes to fit alleged conduct that is not normally <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> federally and seeks to preclude\ndefenses responsive to the allegations in the Indictment. It is premature to constrain Ms.\nMaxwell’s defense before trial. Ms. Maxwell reserves the right to present evidence and make\nargument on the issue of consent when and where appropriate.\n\nVI. UNFOUNDED REQUEST TO PRECLUDE EVIDENCE OF MS. MAXWELL'S\n\nGOOD ACTS SHOULD BE SUMMARILY DENIED\n\nThe government asks this Court to require that, before Ms. Maxwell refers to or offers\nevidence of her “absence when Epstein abused victims who are not part of the government’s\ncase-in-chief, . . . [she] explain the evidence she plans to offer and why such evidence would be\nadmissible.” Mot. at 44. According to the government, evidence that Ms. Maxwell was “absent”\nwhen Mr. Epstein allegedly abused certain individuals is actually inadmissible “good acts”\nevidence because the jury could use it on/y to conclude that Ms. Maxwell acted in conformity\nwith the prior good acts. Jd. The government’s argument imagines a duty to provide notice\nwhere none exists, and it misunderstands what constitutes prior-act evidence and basic concepts\nof relevance in the context of a conspiracy where one actor denies knouledge of an illegal\n\n49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6474\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006551.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44o Filed ll/l2/2l Page 35 of 4o\nE. The Government’s Alleged Motives Are Irrelevant\n\nThe defense claims it is proper to cast aspersions on the Government’s alleged motives for\nprosecuting the defendant, and they claim they should be permited to advance theories that\nEpstein’s death motivated the “timing of the charges” in this case. (Def. Opp. at 42). The defense\nconcedes that they have not established a vindictive or selective prosecution claim. (/d.). That is\nbecause they have no legitimate theory based on the Government’s supposed motives. But the\ndefense is not permited to direct this argument to the jury simply because they lack a basis to\nmake that argument to the Court. (See Gov’t Mot. at 34-35 (“The Second Circuit has explained\nthat claims of purported government misconduct must be ‘directed to the court rather than jury.’””\n(quoting United States v. Regan, lo3 F.3d lo72, lo82 (2d Cir. l997)))).\n\nAs the Government said in its motions, the defense is free to argue that Epstein is guilty\nand the defendant is innocent. (/d. at 35-36). They are not free, houever, to argue that—\nirrespective of guilt or innocence—the defendant is being <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> because Epstein is dead.\nCertainly, the defense could not make that argument absent any evidence, and no agent—including\nthe Florida and New York case agents—can offer hearsay testimony about why they think\nprosecutors charged or did not charge certain individuals at certain times. And to be clear, the\nagents would testify that this case was charged promptly after the Government was in a position\nto prove the defendant’s guilt.\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo655l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006668.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 446 Filed ll/l2/2l Page6ofll\n\nIn approximately April 2oo6 the investigation was concluded.

Detective Recarey is dead, and no\nrecord custodian exists that can identify what was (l) seized; (2) what was maintained by the\nPalm Beach Police Department and by whom; (3) what was returned and (4) what was\npurportedly transferred to the FBI.

After Juror 5o explained that he had been abused\nby a stepbrother “who is no longer a part of the family” (id. at 8:l4-l5, 9:3-8), the Court directed\nJuror 5o’s atention to Question 49, which asked whether he, a friend, or family member had ever\nbeen accused of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault. Juror 5o initially stated that\nhis negative answer to that question was accurate. The Court asked why Juror 5o’s sexual abuse\nby a family member did not count, and Juror 5o responded “[b]ecause I don’t consider them part\nof my family. I never considered them part of my family even when they lived with us for a few\nyears.” (/d. at ll:l2-2o).

In sum, the same locations—particularly Florida—were part of the Government’s case for\nboth counts.

A number of the overt acts listed for\nCount Three could have been <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> under Count Five but for the fact that l8 U.S.C. § l59l,\nthe Trafficking Victims Protection Act, was not enacted until 2ooo.

Cf Hernandez, 2oo9 WL 3l69226,\nat *l2.\n\nInterdependence. Counts Three and Five are not interdependent because the success or\nfailure of one conspiracy is independent of the success or failure of the other. See Macchia, 35\nF.3d at 67l. In other words, the success of the Defendant and Epstein’s scheme to abuse Carolyn\nfrom 2ool to 2oo4 was not made more or less likely by the prior success or failure to abuse Jane,\nAnnie, or any other underage girl.

As set forth belou, we request\nthat the Court grant Ms. Maxwell a significant variance belou the advisory Sentencing Guidelines\nrange of 292 - 365 months and belou the 24o-month sentence recommended by the Probation\nDepartment (““Probation’’).\n\nGhislaine Maxwell stands before the Court because of her association with Jeffrey Epstein\ndecades ago in the l99os and early 2ooos. Never before that time and never again in the roughly\n2o-year period since the conduct underlying this case occurred has Ms. Maxwell ever been accused\nof a crime, much less a scheme to sexually abuse minors. The witnesses at trial testified about Ms.\nMaxwell’s facilitation of Epstein’s abuse, but Epstein was always the central figure: Epstein was\nthe mastermind, Epstein was the principal abuser, and Epstein orchestrated the crimes for his\npersonal gratification. Indeed, had Ghislaine Maxwell never had the profound misfortune of\nmeeting Jeffrey Epstein over 3o years ago, she would not be here.\n\nEpstein avoided a significant sentence when he was first <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> in Florida for these\noffenses and then evaded any further punishment by dying a month after his arrest and detention\nin New York. But this Court cannot sentence Ms. Maxwell as if she were a proxy for Epstein\nsimply because Epstein is no longer here. Ms. Maxwell cannot and should not bear all the\npunishment for which Epstein should have been held responsible. Ms. Maxwell has already\nexperienced hard time during detention under conditions far more onerous and punitive than any\nexperienced by a typical pretrial detainee, and she is preparing to spend significantly more time\nbehind bars.

Follouing\nEpstein’s sudden and untimely death almost three years ago, Judge Berman provided an\nopportunity for any victim to make a statement regardless of whether they qualified under the\nCVRA. Kate, Virginia Giuffre, and Sarah Ransome each spoke at that hearing, Annie Farmer\nspoke solely on behalf of her sister, Maria Farmer. See United States v. Epstein, l9 Cr. 49o (Dkt.\n53). But the sentencing proceeding to be held on June 28 is far different from the unique hearing\nconducted by Judge Berman. The victim statements presented to Judge Berman had no impact on\nthe rights of Epstein, a deceased defendant whose case was required by law to be abated. Such is\nnot the case here.

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (“PTSD”) is\ncommonly diagnosed in victims of violent crime. See Jim Parsons & Tiffany Bergin, Zhe Impact of\nCriminal Justice Involvement on Victims Mental Health, 23 J. TRAUMATIC STRESS l82, l82 (2olo).\nPTSD can afflict not only the direct victims of violent crime, but also those who experience its\nprofound repercussions more indirectly, such as family members and friends. Dean G. Kilpatrick &\nRon Acierno, Mental Health Needs of Crime Victims: Epidemiology and Outcomes, l6 J. TRAUMATIC\nSTRESS ll9, ll9, l25-27 (2oo3). PTSD is far from the only injury that violent crime can inflict on\nvictims. Depression, substance abuse, panic disorder, and suicide are common victim impacts. See\nParsons & Bergin, supra, 23 J. TRAUMATIC STRESS at l82.\n\nEmpirical research continues to demonstrate the importance of hearing from crime victims\nduring sentencing—particularly victims of sexual offenses. Among the most recent research on the\nsubject was conducted in Australia, where Rhiannon Davies and Lorana Bartels closely examined the\nperspectives of six adult female victims and fifteen justice professionals, supplemented by analysis of\none hundred sentencing statements. See Rhiannon Davies and Lorana Bartels, THE USE OF VICTIM\nIMPACT STATEMENTS IN SENTENCING OF SEXUAL OFFENSES: STORIES OF STRENGTH (2o2l). The\nbook-length study found that victim impact statements have the potential to give victims voice,\nvalidation, and vindication, which can be an important step in recovering from the trauma inflicted\nby a defendant’s sexual crime.\n\nSarah’s and Elizabeth’s victim impact statement demonstrate that they both have already\nbenefited from knouing that Maxwell has been <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>, found guilty, and that they were alloued\nl4\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo7o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011281.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o8 Filed o7/l2/22 Pagel4ofl5\nof these statements\non page 2l86.\n2l95:lo —l7 35l4-ol2, p. 2, | At that time, limited to massaging | This entry is part of\n¥4 way doun and talking about the foot the entry three rous\nmassage.

Preliminary Statement\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this memorandum in response to the Court’s Orders\nconceming the two pending motions to unseal grand jury transcripts (Epstein Dkt. 6l; Maxwell\nDkt. 785) in cases <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> in this District. (Epstein Dkt. 63 at l-3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at l-3).\nThis memorandum, as directed by the Court, addresses the specific facts and factors highlighted\nin the Court’s Orders relevant to the particular grand jury materials at issue here. (Epstein Dkt. 63\nat l-3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at l-3). In order to ensure that “[t]ransparency in this process ... not be\nat the expense of [the Government’s] obligation under the law to protect victims” (Epstein Dkt. 6l\nat 2; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at 2), the Government also respectfully requests leave to file a supplemental\nsubmission once the Government and the Court have received any filings from the victims or\nothers referenced in the transcripts.\nIl. The Court’s Orders\n\nAs the Court recognized (Epstein Dkt. 63 at l-2; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at l-2), the Second\nCircuit has held that “there are certain ‘special circumstances’ in which release of grand jury\nrecords is appropriate even outside the boundaries of the rule.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo2 (2d\nCir. l997); see also In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489, 494 (2d Cir. l973) (supplemental opinion)\n(Friendly, C.J.) (recognizing that there are certain “special circumstances” in which release of\ngrand jury records is appropriate even outside of the boundaries of Rule 6(e)).! The Second Circuit\nenumerated a list of non-exhaustive factors for trial courts to consider when deciding such motions:\n' There is currently a Circuit split. See Pitch v. United States, 953 F.3d l226, l233 & n.6 (llth Cir.\n2o2o) (en banc) (describing the Circuit split); Jn re Petition for Order Directing Release of\nRecords, 27 F.4th 84, 9o-9l (lst Cir. 2o22) (same). In light of this split, when the Government\nsought similar relief seeking to unseal grand jury transcripts in the Southern District of Florida\nfrom 2oo5 and 2oo7 relating to Epstein, the Honorable Robin L. Rosenberg—who is bound by the\nEleventh Circuit’s rule barring extra-Rule disclosures set forth in Piteh—denied that motion. /n re\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o63\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015104.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o4 _ Filed o8/o6/25 Page9of27\nBSF\nIt is obviously impossible for two people to conduct a decades-long sex-trafficking enterprise\ninvolving thousands of victims without other individuals who participated in and facilitated these\nunspeakable atrocities.\n\nThe recent controversy surrounding the Government’s decision to withhold information\nconceming Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes has largely ignored the victims’ perspective. Ms.\nFarmer is thankful for the Court’s invitations to state the victims’ positions, and supports the\nunsealing of the grand jury transcripts, as well as the accompanying grand jury exhibits, with\nredactions only as necessary to protect victims’ names, likenesses, and identifying information.\nTransparency is critical to justice, and the public has a legitimate interest in understanding the full\nscope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes, particularly where those actions caused lasting harm to\nothers. While it was not the victims’ decision to seek disclosure of the grand jury transcripts alone\n(as opposed to the much larger volume of information available in the “more than 3oo gigabytes\nof data and physical evidence” in the Government’s possession that should be disclosed as well),\nthe instant motion for unsealing will help expose the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s crimes.\n\nIn this case that involved a decades-long, systematic criminal scheme that shocked the\nconscience of the public, caused lasting harm to survivors, and raised credible concerns about the\nfailures of institutional accountability, there is an especially compelling interest in transparency.\nUnsealing the grand jury transcripts will illuminate the scope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s abuse,\nprovide additional insight into those who enabled his abuse, and bring light to hou these crimes\nwere investigated and <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>. While grand jury secrecy serves important purposes, it is not\nabsolute and under these circumstances the balance tilts in favor of disclosure.\n\nl. Given the Magnitude and Abhorrence of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s Crimes, the\n\nUnsealing of the Grand Jury Transcripts Is Appropriate.\n\nThe Second Circuit has recognized that there are special circumstances when the release\nof grand jury records is appropriate based on the courts’ supervisory authority over the grand juries\nthey empanel and that the trial court has “wide discretion ... in evaluating whether disclosure is\nappropriate.” In re Petition of Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo2, lo4 (2d Cir. l997). In Craig, the Second\nCircuit outlined a non-exclusive list of factors that a trial court may consider when deciding\nwhether “special circumstances warrant the release of grand jury transcripts. Jd. at lo6.

Similarly, throughout the course of the criminal investigation of this case,\nwhich has been publicly reported on for nearly a year, Ms. Maxwell has remained in the\nUnited States. Indeed, on July 7, 2ol9, the day after Epstein’s arrest, Ms. Maxwell reached\nout to the prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, through counsel, and\nmaintained regular contact with them right up to the point of her arrest.\n\nThe government’s broad assertion that Ms. Maxwell has engaged in “frequent\ninternational travel” in the last three years (Gov. Mem. at 6) obscures the critical point: she\nhas not left the country even once since Epstein’s arrest. Ms. Maxwell’s decision to remain\nin the United States after Epstein’s arrest and subsequent death in August 2ol9 is\nparticularly significant because any incentive she may have had to flee would have been\neven more acute at that time. Within days of Epstein’s death, a steady stream of press\narticles began turning the public’s atention to Ms. Maxwell—wrongly substituting her for\nEpstein—and speculating that she had become the prime target of the government’s\ninvestigation.” Adding even more fuel to this fire, several of the women claiming to be\nvictims of Epstein’s abuse began publicly calling for her immediate arrest and prosecution.\nDespite the increasing risk of being criminally charged, and the media firestorm that was\nredirected touard her after Epstein’s death, and despite having ample opportunity to leave\nthe country, Ms. Maxwell stayed in the United States for almost an entire year until she was\narrested. These actions weigh heavily in favor of release. See United States v.

The Court recognized the defense\narguments that the defendant did not leave the United States after Epstein’s arrest and was in\ncontact with the Government through counsel, but emphasized that the defendant may have\nexpected that she would not be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>. (Tr. 84-85). The Court also noted that the defendant\n“did not provide the government with her whereabouts,” and that the “[c]ircumstances of her arrest\n... may cast some doubt on the claim that she was not hiding from the government, a claim that\nshe makes throughout the papers and here today, but even if true, the reality that Ms. Maxwell may\nface such serious charges herself may not have set in until she was actually indicted.” (Tr. 85).\nBased on all of those factors, the Court found that the Government had carried its burden of\ndemonstrating that the defendant “poses a substantial actual risk of flight.” (Tr. 86).\n\nThe Court then concluded that “even the most restrictive conditions of release would be\ninsufficient” to ensure the defendant’s appearance. (/d.). Acknouledging that the defense’s initial\nbail package represented only a fraction of the defendant’s assets, the Court found that “even a\nsubstantially larger package would be insufficient.” (/d.). Although the defendant “apparently\nfailed to submit a full accounting or even close to full accounting of her financial situation,” the\nCourt implicitly rejected the defense’s offer to provide additional information by determining that\n““/e/ven if the picture of her financial resources were not opaque, as it is, detention would still be\nappropriate.” (Tr. 86-87 (emphasis added)). That conclusion was informed not only by the\ndefendant’s “significant financial resources,” but also her “demonstrated sophistication in hiding\nthose resources and herself.” (Tr. 87). “Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide\nfrom the press and the public,” the Court emphasized that the defendant’s “recent conduct\nunderscores her extraordinary capacity to evade detection, even in the face of what the defense has\nacknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (/d.).

Instead, she contends that\nbecause the House version of the bill included an express retroactivity provision absent from its\nfinal form, the Court should infer that Congress did not intend the statute to apply to past\nconduct. Houever, the legislative history makes clear that Congress abandoned the retroactivity\nprovision in the House bill only because it would have produced unconstitutional results. The\nSupreme Court has explained that a law that revives a time-barred prosecution violates the Ex\nPost Facto Clause of the Constitution, but a law that extends an un-expired statute of limitations\ndoes not. Stogner v. California, 539 U.S. 6o7, 632-33 (2oo3). Senator Leahy, who co-\nsponsored the PROTECT Act, expressed concerns in a commitee report that the proposed.\nretroactivity provision was “of doubtful constitutionality” because it “would have revived the\ngovernment’s authority to prosecute crimes that were previously time-barred.” l49 Cong. Rec.\n$5l37, $5l47 (Apr. lo, 2oo3) (statement of Sen. Leahy). Congress removed the provision\nshortly thereafter for this reason. The removal of the express retroactivity provision shous only\nthat Congress intended to limit the PROTECT Act to its constitutional applications, including\npast conduct—like Maxwell’s—on which the statute of limitations had not yet expired.\n\nBoth the text and history of the PROTECT Act’s amendment to § 3283 reflect that it\napplies Maxwell’s conduct charged in the Sl superseding indictment.

United\nStates v. Stavroulakis, 952 F.2d 686, 693 (2d Cir. l992). “Under this test, an indictment need do\nlitle more than to track the language of the statute charged and state the time and place (in\napproximate terms) of the alleged crime.” United States. v. Tramunti, 5l3 F.2d lo87, ll3 (2d\nCir. l975). In addition to dismissal, “Rule 7(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure\npermits a defendant to seek a bill of particulars in order to identify with sufficient particularity\nthe nature of the charge pending against him, thereby enabling defendant to prepare for trial, to\nprevent surprise, and to interpose a plea of double jeopardy should he be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> a second\ntime for the same offense.” United States v. Bortnovsky, 82o F.2d 572, 574 (2d Cir. l987).\n\nThe Sl superseding indictment sets out the elements of each charged crime and the facts\nsupporting each element. Nonetheless, Maxwell contends that the indictment is too vague\nbecause it refers to open-ended time periods, describes conduct like “grooming” and\n“befriending” that is not inherently criminal, and does not identify the alleged victims by name.\n\nMaxwell’s first argument fails because the Government need only describe the time and\nplace of charged conduct “in approximate terms.” Tramunti, 5l3 F.2d at ll3.

The PBPD Presents the Mater to the FBI and the USAO\n\nIn May 2oo6, the lead Detective handling the state’s investigation met with Villafafia and\nthe FBI case agent to summarize for them the information learned during the state’s\ninvestigation.'® At the time, neither Villafafia nor the case agent had heard of Epstein or had any\nknouledge of his background.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, during this meeting, the Detective expressed concern that “pressure\nhad been brought to bear on . . . Krischer by Epstein’s atorneys,” and he and Chief Reiter were\nconcerned the state would charge Epstein with only a misdemeanor or not at all.'? The Detective\nexplained that the defense had hired private investigators to trail Reiter and the Detective, had\nraised claims of various improprieties by the police, and, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated\nthe removal of the Assistant State Atorney initially assigned to handle the mater, who was viewed\nas an aggressive prosecutor, by hiring a defense atorney whose relationship with the Assistant\nState Atorney created a conflict of interest for the prosecutor. Further, given the missing computer\nequipment and surveillance camera videotapes, the Detective believed Epstein may have been\n“tipped off’ in advance about the search warrant.\n\nDuring the meeting, Villafafia reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could\nbe brought against Epstein. She focused on l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticement of minors into\nprostitution or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of interstate or foreign commerce\nto persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423\n(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct). As they discussed these charges, the\nDetective told Villafafia that Epstein and his assistants had traveled out of the Palm Beach\nInternational Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs sometimes referred to\npassengers as “female” without a name or age, which the Detective suspected might be references\nto underage girls. Houever, the Detective acknouledged that he was unable to confirm that\nsuspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls interstate\nor internationally. Nevertheless, Villafafia believed Epstein could be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> federally, in part\nbecause of his oun interstate and international travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse\ngirls. Villafafia discussed with the Detective and the case agent the additional investigation needed\nto prove violations of the federal statutes she had identified. She told them that if the evidence\nsupported it, the case could be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> federally, but she assured them that opening a federal\ninvestigation would not preclude the State Atorney’s Office from charging Epstein should it\nchoose to do so.\n\nl8 The Detective died in May 2ol8.\nl9 In his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein mater to the FBI, a Toun of Palm\nBeach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims\nwere not believable and “Palm Beach solves its oun problems.”\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021219.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OA 3536o38, Page47 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 45 of 348\nEpstein massages that were sexual in nature, and that Epstein had used “various types of pressure”\nto avoid prosecution by the state, including hiring atorneys who had personal connections to the\nState Atorney. Villafafia said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset\nof the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely\nemploy. Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you knou people are going to be geting\ncalls about .. . you just want to make sure that they knou about it so they don’t get... a call from\nout of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to\nput the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t\nwant to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur” with a federal prosecution as had\noccurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected\nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s\nresources if the Office would just back doun to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,\nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.” Ina later\nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and\nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal\nprosecution if the U.S. Atorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green\nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2oo6 meeting with\nVillafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not\npreviously heard of Epstein.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man\nwho was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a reasonable mater to pursue”\nfederally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told\nOPR, the USAO had <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the\nfederal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the\nexploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a\n“oreen light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have\nexplicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been\nsimply to acknouledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal\ninvestigation “sound[ed] reasonable.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein\ninvestigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Atorney’s Office had\n“abdicated their responsibility” to investigate and prosecute Epstein. In his OPR interview,\nSloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the\nState Atorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect\nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2oo6, the USAO had recently <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> wealthy and politically\nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of\nEpstein. On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and\nKevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021220.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 4G 3536o38, Page48 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 46 of 348\n4. Late July 2oo6: The State Indicts Epstein, and the USAO Moves\nForward with a Federal Investigation\n\nSeveral days after Villafafia spoke with Acosta and Sloman, on July l9, 2oo6, Assistant\nState Atorney Belohlavek presented the case to the state grand jury.”*> Krischer told OPR that\n“the whole thing” was put before the grand jury. According to a statement made at the time by the\nState Atorney’s Office spokesman, the grand jury was presented with a list of charges from highest\nto louest, without a recommendation by the prosecutor, and deliberated with the prosecutor out of\nthe room.”* The state grand jury returned an indictment charging Epstein with one count of felony\nsolicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7, a felony under state law because\nit alleged three or more instances of solicitation.”° The indictment did not identify the person or\npersons solicited and made no mention of the fact that Epstein had solicited minors.”° On July 23,\n2oo6, Epstein self-surrendered to be arrested on the indictment, but was not detained, and the\ncharges were made public.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she decided to move forward with the federal investigation at that\npoint because she believed the State Atorney’s Office would permit Epstein to enter a plea to a\nreduced misdemeanor charge and that once he entered a guilty plea, the Department’s Petite policy\nmight preclude a federal prosecution.”’ Villafafia told OPR that at the time, she “definitely\nbelieved that we were going to proceed to [a federal] indictment, assuming that ...we had\nsufficient evidence.”\n23 Villafafia and the FBI obtained and examined records of the state grand jury proceeding, and Lourie reviewed\nthem. Because the grand jury records have not been ordered released publicly, OPR does not discuss their substance\nin this Report.\n24 Larry Keller, “Police say lawyer tried to discredit teenage girls,” Palm Beach Post, July 29, 2oo6, citing\nstatement by State Atorney’s Office spokesman Michael Edmondson.\n2 Indictment in State v. Epstein, 2oo6CF9454A XX (July l9, 2oo6), atached as Exhibit l to this Report.\n26 In pertinent part, the state indictment read, “[B]etween the Ist day of August [2oo4] and October 3l, 2oo5,\n[Epstein] did solicit, induce, entice, or procure another to commit prostitution lewdness, or assignation, . . . on three\nor more occasions.” The l5-month time frame and lack of detail regarding the place or manner of the offense made\nit impossible to identify from the charging document which victim or victims served as the basis for the charge in the\nstate indictment. Belohlavek explained to OPR that the charge did not list specific victims so that she could go forward\nat trial with whichever victim or victims might be available and willing to testify at that time.\na The Petite policy is a set of guidelines used by federal prosecutors when considering whether to pursue federal\ncharges for defendants previously <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> for state or local offenses. The Constitution does not prohibit the federal\ngovernment from prosecuting defendants who have been charged, acquited, or convicted on state charges based on\nthe same criminal conduct. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the long-standing principle that the prohibition\nagainst double jeopardy does not apply to prosecutions brought by different sovereigns. See, e.g., Gamble v. United\nStates, 587 U.S. __, l39 S. Ct. l96o, l966-67 (2ol9) (and cases cited therein); Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S.\nl87, l95 (l959) (and cases cited therein); and United States v. Lanza, 26o U.S. 377, 382 (l922). Nonetheless, to\nbeter promote the efficient use of criminal justice resources, the Department developed policies in l959 and l96o to\nguide federal prosecutors in the use of their charging discretion. See Chapter Two, Part Two, Section II.A.2, for a\nmore detailed discussion of the Petite policy.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l22o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021230.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONG 3536o38, Pageds of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 56 of 348\nhe is comfortable before proceeding.” Menchel told Villafafia he had “trouble understanding” why\nshe was in a “rush” “given hou long this case has been pending.”\n\nOPR questioned Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta about the timeline for reviewing\nthe prosecution memorandum and the proposed charges. Acosta and Menchel believed Villafafia’s\ntimeline was unrealistic from the start. Acosta told OPR that Villafafia was “very hard charging,”\nbut her timeline for filing charges in the case was “really, really fast.” Menchel described Villafafia\nas “out over her skis a litle bit” and “ahead of’ Acosta in terms of his analysis of the case.*°\nMenchel said it was clear to him that Acosta “was going to be the one making the call” about\nwhether to go forward with charges, and Acosta needed more time to make a decision. Menchel\ntold OPR, “This [was] not a case [we were] going to review in two weeks and make a decision\non.” Sloman told OPR that although he did not conduct a “granular review” of the proposed\ncharges, he believed Menchel and Lourie had done so and “obviously” had concluded that “the\nfacts and the law didn’t suggest that the right thing to do was to automatically indict.” Lourie told\nOPR that he believed “the case was moving ahead.”\n\nVillafafia continued to seek direction from her managers. On May l5, 2oo7, she emailed\nSloman, noting that “[i]t seemed from our discussion yesterday that pestering Alex [Acosta] will\nnot do any good. Am I right about that?” Sloman responded, “Yes.” On May 2l, 2oo7, three\nweeks after submiting the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia emailed Sloman and Menchel\nasking for ‘“‘a sense of the direction where we are headed-l.e., approval of an indictment something\nlike the current draft, a complaint to allou for pre-indictment negotiations, an indictment\ndrastically different from the current draft?” Sloman responded only, “Taken care of.’””*°\n\nD. Defense Counsel Seek a Meeting with Senior USAO Managers, which\n\nVillafafia Opposes\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein’s defense counsel continued to seek additional information about the\nfederal investigation and a meeting with senior USAO managers, including Acosta. In a May lo,\n2oo7 email to Menchel, Lourie reported that Epstein’s atorneys “want me to tell them the statutes\n44 Villafafia explained to OPR that the “rush” related to her concern that Epstein was continuing to abuse girls:\n“Tn terms of the issue of why the hurry, because child sex offenders don’t stop until they’re behind bars. That was our\ntime concern.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia offering this explanation to him. OPR\nnotes that in their respective statements to OPR and in their comments on OPR’s draft report, Menchel and Villafafia\nexpressed contradictory accounts or interpretations of certain events. When it was necessary for OPR to resolve those\nconflicts in order to reach its findings and conclusions, OPR considered the extensive documentary record and the\ntestimony of other subjects and witnesses, to the extent available.\n\n45 Sloman similarly recalled that Menchel thought Villafafia was “ahead of where the office was internally” and\nthat caused “discontent” between Villafafia and Menchel. Villafafia was not the only one, houever, who was surprised\nthat the indictment was not approved immediately. The case agent told OPR that it seemed “everything changed”\nafter Villafafia submited the prosecution memorandum, and the momentum touards an indictment abated. Villafafia’s\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that from her perspective, it appeared “Miami didn’t want the case <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>.”\nHouever, Menchel rebuked Villafafia in his July 5, 2oo7 email to her for having “led the agents to believe that [filing\ncharges in] this mater was a foregone conclusion.”\n\n46 Sloman could not recall during his OPR interview what he meant by this remark, but he speculated that he\nhad spoken to Menchel, and Menchel was going to take care of it.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l23o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021231.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document Oa 3536o38, Paged9 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 57 of 348\nwe are contemplating so Dershouitz can tell us why they don’t apply.”*” Lourie told Menchel, “I\ndon’t see the dounside,” but added, “Marie is against it.” Menchel responded that it was\n“premature” to provide the information. During his OPR interview, Menchel could not specifically\nrecall why he believed it was “premature” to provide the defense with the requested information,\nbut speculated that it was too soon after the prosecution memorandum had been circulated for\nAcosta to have made a decision about hou he wanted to proceed. This recollection is consistent\nwith the May 2oo7 emails reflecting that Acosta wanted time to consider the proposed prosecution.\n\nOn May 22, 2oo7, defense counsel Lefcourt emailed Lourie a leter to “confirm” that\nEpstein’s atorneys would be given an opportunity to meet with Lourie before the USAO reached\na final decision on charging Epstein. Lourie forwarded the leter to Menchel and Sloman, but\nnoted that Epstein’s defense team was “really ready for the next level,” rather than another meeting\nwith him. Lourie suggested that Menchel meet with defense counsel, adding, “Whether Alex\nwould be present or grant them another meeting after that is his call.” Lourie also emailed\nLefcourt, clarifying that Lourie had not promised to call Epstein’s counsel before filing charges,\nand suggesting that Epstein’s counsel make their next presentation to Menchel.\n\nAlthough Lourie’s emails shou that he had no objection to more senior USAO managers\nmeeting with defense counsel, Villafafia opposed such a meeting. Several emails indicate that\nMenchel traveled to West Palm Beach to meet with Lourie and Villafafia on the afternoon of\nMay 23, 2oo7.48 On that same date, Villafafia drafted an email, which she planned to send to\nSloman and Menchel, expressing her disagreement with meeting with defense counsel. Although\nthe email was writen for Sloman and Menchel, Villafafia sent it as a draft only to her immediate\nsupervisor, seeking her “guidance and counsel” as to hou to proceed.\n\nHi Jeff and Mat — I just want to again voice my disagreement with\n\npromising to have a meeting or having a meeting with Lefcourt or\n\nany other of Epstein’s atorneys. As I mentioned, this is not a case\n\nwhere we will be siting doun to negotiate whether a defendant will\n\nserve one year versus two years of probation. This is a case where\n\nthe defendant is facing the possibility of dozens of years of prison\n\ntime. Just as the defense will defend a case like that differently than\n\nthey would handle a probation-type case, we need to handle this case\n\ndifferently. Part of our prosecution strategy was already disclosed\n\nat the last meeting, and I am concerned that more will be disclosed\n\nat a future meeting.\n\nMy co-chair .. . who has <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> more of these cases than the\n\nrest of us combined and who actually worked on the drafting of\n\nsome of the child exploitation statutes, also opposes a meeting.

Those\nreasons are: (l) he wants the Petit [sic] policy to trump our ability\nto prosecute Epstein, (2) this shouldn’t be a federal offense, and\n(3) the victims were willing participants so the crime shouldn’t be\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> at all. Unless the Office thinks that any of those\narguments will be persuasive, a meeting will not be beneficial to the\nprosecution, it will only benefit the defense.

The only way to get additional analysis is to expose to the\ndefense the other charges that we are considering.

Villafafia told OPR that the supervisor counseled Villafafia not to send the\nemail to Sloman or Menchel because Villafafia could be viewed as insubordinate. She also told\nVillafafia that if Villafafia did not stay with the case, “the case would go away” and Epstein “would\nnever serve a day in jail.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that at that point in time, she believed the USAO was preparing to file\ncharges against Epstein despite agreeing to accommodate the defense request for meetings. She\nalso told OPR, on the other hand, that she feared the USAO was “going doun the same path that\nthe State Atorney’s Office had gone doun.” Villafafia believed the purpose of the defense request\nag In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel noted Menchel’s view that the nature of a\ndefendant’s crimes and potential penalty does not affect whether prosecutors are willing to meet with defense counsel\nto discuss the merits of a case.\n\n%o The immediate supervisor recalled telling Villafafia that she and Villafafia were “not driving the ship,” and\nonce “the bosses” made the decision, “there’s nothing else you can do.”\n32\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l232\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021254.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N8o 3536o38, Page82 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 8o of 348\nthe period of imprisonment, because the USAO failed to hold firm to its proposal of “at least two\nyears in prison.” The USAO did, houever, consistently reject defense proposals to change other\nterms, particularly the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender.\nA.

Villafafia told OPR\nthat when Epstein’s atorneys expressed concern during the meeting about Epstein’s security in a\nstate prison and argued for a home confinement sentence, Menchel suggested Epstein plead to a\nfederal charge so that he could serve his time in a federal facility. A few days after the meeting,\nVillafafia emailed Menchel, stating that she had “figured out a way to do a federal plea with a 2-l/2\nyear cap.”\n\nAlthough Acosta had authorized a plea to state charges, emails and other correspondence\nshou that during the negotiations, the parties also considered structuring a plea around federal\n87 Villafafia was the only witness with whom OPR spoke who had a substantive memory of this meeting.\n\n88 According to the Florida Department of Corrections fact sheet for defendants subjected to community control,\n\nThe Community Control supervision program was created as a diversion to\n\nincarceration or imprisonment; therefore it is an intensive supervision program\n\nwhere you are confined to your home unless you are working, atending school,\n\nperforming public service hours, participating in treatment or another special\n\nactivity that has been approved in advance by your officer.

We did not.” Villafafia anticipated there would be ways to “manipulate” a state\nsentence and the USAO would be “giving up all control,” and she told OPR that she discussed this concern with\nLourie, although she could not recall when that discussion occurred.\n\n54\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l254\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021262.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document O88 3536o38, Page9o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 88 of 348\nVillafafia added that the PBPD Chief had alerted the FBI that an upcoming news article would\nreport that Epstein was “going to plead to a state charge” and the PBPD Chief “wanted to knou if\nthe victims had been consulted about the deal.” Sloman forwarded Villafafia’s email to Acosta\nwith a note that read simply, “fyi.”\n\nLater that evening, Villafafia circulated to Sloman, Lourie, and Oosterban two alternative\ndocuments: a draft federal plea agreement and a draft NPA.'” The draft federal plea agreement,\nfollouing the USAO’s standard format, called for Epstein to plead guilty to a five-year conspiracy\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 37l to entice minors to engage in prostitution, an offense requiring registration\nas a sexual offender, with a Rule ll(c) binding sentence of two years’ imprisonment. The draft\nNPA contained the terms presented to the defense team on July 3l, 2oo7, and called for Epstein to\nenter a state plea by September 28, 2oo7.

This was Acosta’s\nfirst meeting with Epstein’s defense team. Villafafia understood the purpose of this meeting was\nto afford Epstein’s counsel an opportunity to “make a pitch” as to why the case should not be\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> federally. Villafafia recalled that at a “pre-meet” before defense counsel arrived,\nAcosta did not express concern about the viability of the prosecution or the strength of the case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that the meeting was not “a negotiation,” but a chance for the defense to\npresent their arguments, which were made by Starr and focused primarily on federalism. Villafafia\nsimilarly recalled that the meeting mainly consisted of the defense argument that the Epstein case\nshould remain a state mater in which the USAO should not interfere. Both Villafafia and her\nco-counsel recalled that Starr addressed himself directly to Acosta, and that Starr, who had held\nSenate-confirmed positions in the government, commented to Acosta that he and Acosta were “the\nonly people in this room who have run the [gantlet] of confirmation by the Senate.” Acosta did\nnot recall the comment, but he told OPR, “[B]ack in July, we had decided that we were going\nChapter Three, the Department’s position at the time was that victim consultation was not required in maters in which\nthe government did not pursue a federal charge.

Sloman similarly said that he had the impression that the non-prosecution provision\nwas meant to protect named co-conspirators who were also victims, “in a sense,” of Epstein’s\nconduct. Although later press coverage of the Epstein case focused on Epstein’s connection to\nprominent figures and suggested that the non-prosecution provision protected these individuals,\nSloman told OPR that it never occurred to him that the reference to potential co-conspirators was\ndirected touard any of the high-profile individuals who were at the time or subsequently linked\nwith Epstein.!?° Acosta did not recall the provision or any discussions about it. He speculated\nthat if he read the non-prosecution provision, he likely assumed that Villafafia and Lourie had\n“thought this through” and “addressed it for a reason.” The West Palm Beach manager, who had\nonly limited involvement at this stage, told OPR that the provision was “highly unusual,” and he\nhad “no clue” why the USAO agreed to it.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, apart from the women named in the NPA, the investigation had\nnot developed evidence of “any other potential co-conspirators. So, ... we wouldn’t be\nprosecuting anybody else, so why not include it? ... I just didn’t think that there was anybody\nthat it would cover.” She conceded, houever, that she “did not catch the fact that it could be read\nas broadly as people have since read it.”\n\nK. The USAO Rejects Defense Efforts to Eliminate the Sexual Offender\n\nRegistration Requirement\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, State Atorney Krischer informed\nVillafafia that Epstein’s counsel had contacted him and Epstein was ready to agree “to all the\nterms” of the NPA—except for sexual offender registration. According to Krischer, defense\ncounsel had proposed that registration be deferred, and that Epstein register only if state or federal\nlaw enforcement felt, at any point during his service of the sentence, that he needed to do so.\nKrischer noted that he had “reached out” to Acosta about this proposal but had not heard back\nfrom him. Villafafia responded, “I think Alex is calling you nou.” Villafafia told OPR that, to her\nknouledge, Acosta called Krischer to tell him that registration was not a negotiable term. !”°\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia emailed Krischer for information about the amount of “gain\ntime” Epstein would earn in state prison. Villafafia explained in her email that she wanted to\ninclude a provision in the NPA specifying that Epstein “will actually be in jail at least a certain\nnumber of days to make sure he doesn’t try to ‘convince’ someone with the Florida prison\nauthorities to let him out early.” Krischer responded that under the proposal as it then stood,\nEpstein would serve l5 months.

After this is resolved I would love to buy you a cup at Starbucks and have a conversation.” Villafafia\nresponded, “Sounds great.” When asked about this exchange during her OPR interview, Villafafia said: “Everybody\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l28l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021345.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONT 3536o38, Pagel73 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l7l of 348\nand guaranteed sexual offender registration by Epstein . . . were\n\namong the factors [that led to the NPA].””°\n\nDuring her OPR interview, Villafafia similarly described the victims’ general reluctance to\ngo forward with a trial:\n\n[W]hen we would meet with victims, we would ask them hou they\nwanted the case to be resolved.

Lourie also told OPR that he generally recalled concerns within the USAO about\nthe charges and a potential trial:\n\n[M]y vague recollection is that I and others had concerns that there\n\nwas a substantial chance we would not prevail at both trial and on\n\nappeal after a conviction, resulting in no jail time, no criminal\n2l5 Doe v.

Marie Villafafia in Support of\nGovernment’s Response and Opposition to Petitioners’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Cross-Motion for\nSummary Judgment at 8-9 (June 2, 2ol7).\n2l6 These concerns are also reflected in a 2ol7 declaration filed by the FBI case agent in the CVRA litigation,\nin which she stated, “During interviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that\nEpstein be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s] victims... .\n\nA majority of the victims expressed concern about the possible disclosure of their\n\nidentities to the public. A number of the victims raised concerns about having to\n\ntestify and/or their parents finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.\n\nAdditionally, for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\n\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall, many of the\n\nvictims were troubled about the existence of the investigation. They displayed\n\nfeelings of embarrassment and humiliation and were reluctant to talk to\n\ninvestigators. Some victims who were identified through the investigation refused\n\neven to speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and geting to\n\nthe truth were always at the forefront of our handling of the investigation.\n\nIn addition, during the CVRA litigation, an atorney representing several victims filed a pleading to protect\nthe anonymity of his clients by preventing disclosure of their identities to the CVRA petitioners. See Response to\nCourt Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance (July 24, 2ol5). It is noteworthy that in\n2o2o, when OPR atempted to contact victims, through their counsel, for interviews or responses to writen questions\nregarding contacts with the USAO, OPR was informed that most of the victims were still deeply concerned about\nremaining anonymous. One victim described to OPR hou she became distraught when, during the USAO’s\ninvestigation, the FBI left a business card at her parents’ home and, as a result, her parents learned that she was a\nvictim of Epstein. At the time, the victim was a teenager; was “nervous, scared, and ashamed”; and did not want her\nparents to knou about the case.\n\nl45\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l345\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021348.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONT 3536o38, Pagel76 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l74 of 348\n\nThe USAO might have been able to surmount the evidentiary, legal, and policy issues\npresented by a federal prosecution of Epstein. Villafafia, in particular, believed she could have\nprevailed had she taken the case to trial, and even after the NPA was negotiated, she repeatedly\nrecommended declaring Epstein in breach and proceeding with an indictment, because she\ncontinued to have confidence in the case.**? Oosterban and others also believed that the\ngovernment would succeed at trial. Furthermore, the victims were not a uniform group. Some of\nthem were afraid of testifying or having their identities made public; others wanted Epstein\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>, but even among those, it is not clear hou many expressed a willingness to testify at a\ntrial; and still others provided information favorable to Epstein. In the end, Acosta assumed\nresponsibility for deciding hou to resolve the Epstein investigation and weighing the risks and\nbenefits of a trial versus those of a pre-charge disposition. His determination that a pre-charge\ndisposition was appropriate was not unreasonable under the circumstances.\n\nAlthough evidentiary and witness issues explain the subject supervisors’ concerns about\nwinning a potential trial and why the USAO would have sought some sort of pre-charge\ndisposition, they do not fully explain why Acosta decided to pursue a state-based resolution as\nopposed to a traditional federal plea agreement. OPR did not find in the contemporaneous records\na memorandum or other memorialization of the reasoning underlying Acosta’s decision to offer a\nstate-based resolution or the terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7.\n\nAccording to Acosta, “In 2oo6, it would have been extremely unusual for any United States\nAtorney’s Office to become involved in a state solicitation case, even one involving underage\nteens,” because solicitation was “the province of state prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR that he\ndeveloped “a preference for deferring to the state” to “make it clear that [the USAO was] not\nstepping on something that is a purely local mater, because we [didn’t] want bad precedent for\nthe sake of the larger human trafficking issue.” Acosta also told OPR that it was his understanding\nthat the PBPD would not have brought the case to federal investigators if the State Atorney’s\nOffice had pursued a sanction against Epstein that included jail time and sexual offender\nregistration. Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in the case as limited to preventing the “manifest\ninjustice” that, in Acosta’s view, would have resulted from the state’s original plea proposal.\nAcosta acknouledged that if the investigation had begun in the federal system, he would not have\nviewed the terms set out in the NPA as a satisfactory result, but it was adequate to serve as a\n“backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he described as “a polite way of saying[,\n‘|encouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]” In sum, Acosta told OPR that the Epstein case\nlay in “uncharted territory,” there was no certainty that the USAO would prevail if it went to trial,\nand a potentially unfavorable outcome had to be “weighed against a certain plea with registration\nthat would make sure that the public knew that this person was a sex offender.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he discussed the case primarily with Sloman and Menchel, and both\ntold OPR that while they did not share Acosta’s federalism concerns, they recalled that Acosta had\nthe terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7. Therefore, any allegations against the prosecutors could not have\nplayed a significant role in Acosta’s decisions as reflected in the term sheet.\n\n22o Sloman told OPR that Villafafia “always believed in the case.”\nl48\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l348\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021367.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l93 3536o38, Pagel95 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l93 of 348\nVillafafia had raised (defense counsel’s atempt to insert an immigration waiver into the\nagreement), but Lourie did not comment on the provision promising not to prosecute co-\nconspirators or ask Villafafia to explain why she believed the provision did not harm the\ngovernment’s interests. In a subsequent email about the draft NPA, Villafafia asked Lourie for\n“Ta]ny other thoughts,” but there is no indication that he provided further input. OPR found no\ndocument that suggested Villafafia and Lourie discussed the provision further, or that the other\nindividuals who were copied on Villafafia’s email referencing the provision—her immediate\nsupervisor, the supervisor designated to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office,\nand Villafafia’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it. Villafafia told\nOPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her observation that the non-\nprosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafafia assumed that they agreed with her assessment.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision\nagreeing not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that\ndefense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame\nfor what happened.” Villafafia told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct\nwas his oun “dirty litle secret.” Villafafia said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2oo6\narrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that\nnone of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators\nabout sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-knoun contacts about whom allegations arose\nmany years later.”3° Villafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime\nrelationship with a close female friend who was a well-knoun socialite, but, according to\nVillafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.””*? Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the\nfour female assistants identified by name.”*° Villafafia also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s\ninvestigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to prosecute his four assistants if he\nentered a plea.**! Because Villafafia was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged,\nshe perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to prosecute other, unspecified\n“co-conspirators.” Villafafia told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did\nnot occur to her that the reference to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any\nof Epstein’s influential associates.\n\nLourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the\ntime Villafafia forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR\nthat he did not knou hou the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.\n238 Villafafia told OPR that “none of... the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being\ninvolved in abusing them. It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\n239 The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct\ninvolving the then minor did not occur in Florida.\n\nas) The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one\ngirl in Epstein’s presence; this assistant was one of the named individuals for whom the defense sought the\ngovernment’s agreement not to prosecute from the outset. Villafafia explained to OPR that this individual was herself\nbelieved to also have been at one time a victim.\n\neal Villatafia told OPR that the USAO had decided that girls who recruited other girls would not be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l367\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021386.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lD 3536o38, Page2l4 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l2 of 348\nparties.*°> The rush to reach a resolution should not have led the USAO to agree to such a\nsignificant provision without a full consideration of the potential consequences and justification\nfor the provision. It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\nimmigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused.\nmore careful consideration of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent consideration\nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\ninterpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n#o8 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified. I\njust don’t knou hou that works.” Villafafia’s co-counsel told OPR:\n\n[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed\n\nto do at the Department of Justice. ... I’ve never heard of anything of the sort... .\n\n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for\n\nexample, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense\n\nwhich was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and\n\nnobody else. I mean on rare occasion I’ve seen cases where say someone was\n\ndealing drugs and their wife was involved. ... And they’ve got kids. . . .

This is not one of\n\nthose.\nDeputy Atorney General Filip called the provision “prety weird.” Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR\nthat he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor. A senior AUSA with substantial\nexperience prosecuting sex crimes against children commented that it was “horrendous” to provide immunity for\nparticipants in such conduct.\n\nl86\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l386\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021401.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 397 3536o38, Page229 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 227 of 348\ngovernment informed any victim about the potential for resolving the federal investigation through\na state plea.\nA.

And so, I felt like sending them back to\nthe State Atorney’s Office was not something that they would have\nsupported.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she also recalled that some victims “expressed . . . concern about\ntheir safety,” and were worried that Epstein would find out about their participation in the\ninvestigation. In her 2ol7 declaration submited in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that the\ntwo CVRA petitioners “never communicated [their] desires to me or the FBI case agents and my\nrole was to evaluate the entire situation, consider the input received from all of the victims, and\nallou the Office to exercise its prosecutorial discretion accordingly.”*” She also noted that some\nvictims “fear[ed] having their involvement with Epstein revealed and the negative impact it would\nhave on their relationships with family members, boyfriends, and others.”\n\nIn the FBI case agent’s 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, she stated, “During\ninterviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that Epstein be\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s]\n\nvictims ....

The\nchart, houever, does not indicate what the victims said, and Villafafia told OPR that the information contained in the\nchart was based on her memory of her interactions with each victim. OPR was unable to determine the details or\nextent of any such discussions occurring before September 24, 2oo7, because Villafafia did not have contemporaneous\nnotes of the interviews, and the FBI reports and corresponding notes of the interviews did not contain information\nabout the victims’ desired outcomes. The victims who provided information to OPR did not recall discussing potential\nresolution of the federal investigation with anyone from the government.\n282 In the declaration, Villafafia stated, “Jane Doe 2 specifically told me that she did not want Epstein\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>.”\n\n2ol\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021424.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 35o 3536o38, Page252 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 25o of 348\nif you have additional questions which involve this mater, please contact the office listed above.

The atorney\nasked Sloman if the USAO “could file criminal charges even though the state was looking into the\nmater,” but Sloman declined to answer his questions concerning the investigation.**” In late\nJanuary, the New York Post reported that the atorney’s clients had filed a $5o million civil suit\nagainst Epstein in Florida and that “Epstein is expected to be sentenced to l8 months in prison\nwhen he pleads guilty in March to a single charge of soliciting an underage prostitute.”?*°\n\nBetween January 3l, 2oo8, and May 28, 2oo8, the FBI, with the prosecutors, interviewed\nadditional victims and reinterviewed several who had been interviewed before the NPA was\nsigned.**4 In late January 2oo8, as Villafafia and the CEOS Trial Atorney prepared to participate\n33o The case agent also informed Villafafia that she expected to ask for legal process soon in order to obtain\nadditional information.\na3 The CEOS Trial Atorney told OPR that she was under the impression that she was brought in to help prepare\nfor the trial because the “plea had fallen through.”\n\n332 Because Sloman and the atorney were former legal practice partners, Sloman reported the interaction to\nAcosta, and the USAO reported the incident to OPR shortly thereafter.

JUNE 2oo8: EFFORTS TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT THE JUNE 3o, 2oo8 PLEA\n\nHEARING\n\nThe Epstein team’s appeals through the Department ended on June 23, 2oo8, when the\nDeputy Atorney General determined that “federal prosecution of this case is appropriate” and\nEpstein’s allegations of prosecutorial misconduct did not rise to a level that would undermine such\na decision. Immediately thereafter, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that\nEpstein had until “the close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the terms and\nconditions of the agreement . . . including entry of a guilty plea, sentencing, and surrendering to\nbegin his sentence of imprisonment.” That same day, Villafafia made plans to file charges on July\nl, 2oo8, if Epstein did not enter his guilty plea by the June 3o deadline.\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia received a copy of the proposed state plea agreement\nand learned that the plea hearing was scheduled for 8:3o a.m. on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8. Also on\nthat Friday, Villafafia submited to Sloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior a “final final”\nproposed federal indictment of Epstein.\n\nVillafafia and the FBI finalized the government’s victim list that they intended to disclose,\nfor § 2255 purposes, to Epstein after the plea and, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia contacted\nPBPD Chief Reiter to ask him to notify the victims of the plea hearing. Villafafia told OPR that\nSloman said, “Chief Reiter could contact the victims from the state case, and tell them about the\nplea.”3°! On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform him that PBPD Chief\nReiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”?°?\n2a Villafafia further stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\nane Sloman replied, “Good.”\n\n23l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l433\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021477.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OR 3ol 3536o39, Page47 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3ol of 348\nthe federal investigation I was cooperating in.

In re Enter. Mort. Acceptance Co. Sec.\nLitig. (‘Enterprise’), 39l F.3d 4ol, 4o6-o8 (2d Cir.\n2oo4). Here, the text and history of Section 3283 estab-\nlish that Congress intended to extend the time to bring\ncharges of child sexual abuse in cases where the limi-\ntations period had not yet expired.\n\nPrior to 2oo3, any child sex abuse offense could be\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> until the victim reached the age of 25 years,\nat which point the statute of limitations then in effect\nwould bar prosecution. In the 2oo3 amendment, which\nwas titled, “No Statute of Limitations for Child Abduc-\ntion and Sex Crimes,” Pub. L. No. lo8-2l, § 2o2, ll7\nStat. 66o, Congress explicitly provided that “[n]o stat-\nute of limitations that would otherwise preclude pros-\necution for [such an offense] shall preclude such pros-\necution during the life of the child.” l8 U.S.C. § 32838\n(2oo3). The amendment draws no distinction between\npre-enactment and post-enactment conduct. Instead,\nas Judge Nathan explained, by stating that “no statute\nof limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecu-\ntion of these offenses will apply,” the amendment’s\n“plain language unambiguously requires that it apply\nto prosecutions for offenses commited before the date\nof enactment.” (A.l5l). Thus, the breadth of the text\nshous that Congress intended “to extend the ... stat-\nute of limitations,” even for pre-enactment conduct.\nUnited States v. Jeffries, 4o5 F.3d 682, 684 (8th Cir.\n2oo5) (reaching same conclusion as to § 3283’s prede-\ncessor based on similar “title and ... wording” of stat-\nute); cf.

In ini-\ntially enacting a special statute of limitations for child\nsex abuse offenses, Congress sought to “mak[e] it eas-\nier to prosecute offenders who commit sex crimes that\nmay be difficult to detect quickly.” Weingarten, 865\nF.3d at 54. But that limitations period proved to be “in-\nadequate in many cases.” H.R. Conf. Rep. No. lo8-66,\nat 54. Tellingly, the conference report offered the ex-\nample of a child rapist who “could not be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>”\nbecause he was “identified ... as the perpetrator one\nday after the victim turned 25.” Jd. Given that Con-\ngress bemoaned those offenders who escaped prosecu-\ntion because the limitations period had expired, there\nis every reason to believe that it intended to preserve\nthe ability to prosecute pre-enactment offenders whose\nlimitations period had not yet expired. See United\nStates v. Sure Chief, 438 F.3d 92o, 924 (9th Cir. 2oo6)\n(concluding that in enacting the 2oo3 amendment,\n\n8 Maxwell’s only response regarding the statute’s\ntext is that the words “would” and “shall” are “forward-\nlooking.” (Br.54). But those words readily apply in de-\nscribing the application of the 2oo3 amendment to pre-\nenactment conduct. Consider an offense commited\nagainst a l6-year-old in the year 2ooo. The statute of\nlimitations then in effect indeed “would ... preclude\nprosecution” nine years in the future, once the victim\nturned twenty-five. The 2oo3 amendment ensured\nthat “[n]o” such “statute of limitations ... shall pre-\nclude such prosecution during the life of the child.”\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l695\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021719.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page72 of 93\n59\n\nC. Discussion\n\nJudge Nathan conducted a thorough inquiry and\ndetermined that Juror 5o’s inadvertent errors on the\njury questionnaire did not undermine Maxwell’s right\nto a fair trial. Maxwell does not meaningfully engage\nwith Judge Nathan’s careful opinion, instead suggest-\ning that Juror 5o’s testimony at the hearing was “pa-\ntently absurd.” (Br.63). These conclusory arguments\nfall far short of establishing that Judge Nathan abused\nher discretion in finding that this case does not present\nthe extraordinary circumstances that justify overturn-\ning ajury’s verdict based on an error during voir dire.\n\nMaxwell’s claim fails at the first step of\nMcDonough because Juror 5o’s errors were inadvert-\nent. Juror 5o testified as much at the hearing, provid-\ning a detailed narrative of why his errors were a fail-\nure of diligence as he rushed through the question-\nnaire while distracted. (A.333-34). Judge Nathan cred-\nited this explanation in light of his demeanor, which\nshe “closely observe[d]” as he testified, including dur-\ning his answers to questions “he appeared not to ex-\npect.” (A.333). She explained that his answers were\n“logical explanations and generally internally con-\nsistent,” given in a “calm and straightforward man-\nner.” (/d.). Juror 5o’s explanations were consistent\nwith “his sworn statements months earlier at oral voir\ndire” and his testimony that “his sexual abuse history\nwas not salient or [a] front-of mind consideration.”\n(Id.). Judge Nathan also noted that Juror 5o’s answers\naligned with his incentives: by testifying under a grant\nof immunity, he could not be <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> for his false\nanswers on the questionnaire, but he could be\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l7l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021720.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page73 of 93\n6o\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> for false testimony at the hearing (id.), and\nhad he hidden his sexual abuse in order to get on the\njury, he would not have immediately disclosed it to the\nmedia after trial (A.335). To the contrary, in one video\ninterview with the media, Juror 5o “appears genuinely\nand completely surprised to learn that the question-\nnaire” asked about his history of sexual abuse. (/d.).\n\nMaxwell does not directly challenge Judge Na-\nthan’s factual findings on this point, much less demon-\nstrate that they are clearly erroneous. Instead, relying\non United States v. Langford, 99o F.2d 65, 68 (2d Cir.\nl993), Maxwell argues that McDonough’s first step is\nsatisfied by any falsehood, deliberate or otherwise.\n(Br.66).\n\nThis argument misses the mark. This prong re-\nquires a shouing of deliberate dishonesty by the juror,\nrather than mere honest mistake. This Court has ex-\nplained that, in McDonough, the Supreme Court\n“found that the juror’s good faith failure to respond,\nthough mistaken, did not satisfy even the first prong\nof the test.” United States v. Shaoul, 4l F.3d 8ll, 8l5\n(2d Cir. l994). The defendant in Shaoul also relied on\nLangford to contend that a new trial was appropriate\n“even if he cannot establish the juror’s dishonesty.” Id.\nThis Court rejected that argument, concluding that\n“Is]uch a contorted reading of Langford is incorrect, be-\ncause it would eliminate the threshold requirement of\nthe McDonough test: juror dishonesty.” Id. And this\nCourt concluded that the defendant failed to satisfy\nthe first prong of the test because “defense counsel ex-\nplicitly conceded the good faith of the juror.” Jd. at 8l6;\nsee United States v.

The Requested Records Are Not “Material” to Preparing a Defense and Are\nSought for the Impermissible Purpose of Jury Nullification\n\nAll of the records Thomas seeks in his motion are not “material to preparing a defense”\nunder Rule l6, and are not exculpatory under Brady, because they are irrelevant to countering the\nGovernment’s false statements case or advancing a legitimate defense. Instead, Thomas seeks\nevidence of staffing shortages, working conditions, the implementation of BOP policies,\nsupervisory lapses, and instances in which other BOP employees were not <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> so that he\ncan engage in atempted jury nullification by arguing that those conditions “led” to the criminal\nconduct that he is charged with and are a reason to acquit him. (Mot. 5, 7, 9, l4). Thomas is not\nentitled to records—and certainly would not be entitled to introduce any such evidence at trial—\nthat would aid in that nullification effort because Rule l6 only entitles a defendant to discovery\nfor purposes of bolstering a defense to the Government’s case in chief, not the merits of the\ndecision to prosecute.\n\nl. Applicable Law\n\nAn item or record that the Government does not intend to use in its case-in-chief at trial is\ndiscoverable under Rule l6(a)(l)(E) only if it “is material to preparing the defense.” Fed. R. Crim.\nP. l6(a)(l)(E). “It is [a defendant’s] burden to make a prima facie shouing that documents sought\nunder Rule l6(a)(l)(E)(i) are material to preparing the defense.” United States v.

As noted above, an item is “material to preparing the defense” under Rule l6\n“if it could be used to counter the Government’s case or bolster a defense.” Stevens, 985 F.2d at\nll8o-8l.

Alameh, 34l F.3d l67, l73\n(2d Cir. 2oo3); United States v. Fares, 978 F.2d 52, 59 (2d Cir. l992); United States v.

In other words, the defendant must shou that\nhe has been “singled out” as a member of a protected class. Fares, 978 F.2d at 59 (quoting Moon,\n7l8 F.2d at l229). To establish discriminatory purpose, the defendant must shou that the\nGovernment’s discriminatory “selection of the defendant for prosecution has been invidious or in\nbad faith, i.e., based upon such impermissible considerations as race, religion, or the desire to\nprevent his exercise of constitutional rights.” /d. (internal quotation marks omited; alteration\nincorporated). Where a defendant “has not shoun that the Government <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> him because\nof” his protected status or conduct, his claim fails. /d.\n\nIn order to obtain discovery on a selective prosecution claim, the defendant must offer\n“some evidence tending to shou the existence of the essential elements of the defense.”\nArmstrong, 5l7 U.S. at 468 (quoting United States v.

In any event, even were the conduct similar,\nthat Thomas can point to but a single other instance in which officers were not criminally\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> for that type of conduct hardly rings of selectiveness.\n\nSimilarly, Thomas points to the fact that “Officer-l” and “Officer-2” in the Indictment,\nwho falsified count slips along with Tova Noel for the 4 p.m. and lo p.m. institutional counts on\nAugust 9, 2ol9, respectively, were not <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span>. (Mot. lo; Ind. ¥[ l5, l7, l9). Even assuming\narguendo that Officer-l and Officer-2 were similarly situated to Thomas in that they each falsified\none count slip—while Thomas falsified three—Thomas has failed to put forth any evidence that\neither Officer-l or Officer-2 were outside of a “protected class” to which Thomas belongs.’ Nor\ncould he: Officer-l and Officer-2 are the same race, gender, and nationality as Thomas. Thomas\nalso questions why his supervisors or other MCC personnel who received and reviewed Thomas’s\nfalse count slips were not also <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> with making false statements, but those supervisors or\npersonnel are not similarly situated to Thomas because they did not actually make the false\nstatements—Thomas did. In addition, Courts have repeatedly held that the “suspicion [and]\nsurmise” contained in Thomas’s motion simply do not constitute “objective evidence” warranting\ndiscovery. See United States v. White, 972 F.2d l6, l9 (2d Cir. l992) (conclusory allegations as to\ntiming of indictment, Government’s failure to follou internal guidelines, and improprieties of\n\nT Tn so noting, the Government does not intend to comment on its deliberative process or\nthe exercise of its prosecutorial discretion. It notes these facts simply in response to Thomas’s\nclaim that the lack of charges against Officer-l, Officer-2, or Thomas’s supervisors is in and of\nitself sufficient to meet the defendant’s burden of establishing evidence of a similarly situated\ndefendant who was not charged.\n\na\nDOJ-OGR- ooo22o94\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022095.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 33 of 34\nprosecutors not “objective evidence” warranting discovery); Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l23o (“to engage\nin a collateral inquiry respecting prosecutorial motive, there must be more than mere suspicion or\nsurmise”). Thomas’s failure to make an evidentiary shouing in support of the first required prong\nmeans that his motion for discovery on his selective prosecution claim must be denied. See, e.g.,\nBass, 536 US. at 863.\n\nAs to the second required prong, Thomas has failed to even allege, let alone establish, that\nthe decision to prosecute him was motivated by a discriminatory purpose. To make such a\nshouing, a defendant must establish that the Government’s “selection of the defendant for\nprosecution has been invidious or in bad faith, i.e., based upon such impermissible considerations\nas race, religion, or the desire to prevent his exercise of constitutional rights.” Fares, 978 F.2d at\n59 (internal quotation marks omited; alteration incorporated). Thomas has not put forth any\nevidence whatsoever that the Government’s decision to prosecute Thomas was based on anything\nother than his guilt. Instead, Thomas challenges the Government’s decision to prosecute him at\nall, based on his wholly unsupported claim that the criminal conduct with which he is charged is\n“rampant” within the BOP. (Mot. 7). But the mere fact that other people were not <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> for\ncommiting the crime that Thomas commited does not mean that the Government harbored\ndiscriminatory intent in prosecuting Thomas.®\n\n8 Even if Thomas had not failed to carry his burden on his discovery motion (and he has\nfailed), he would still not be entitled to put such evidence or argument regarding selective\nprosecution before a jury because the “selective prosecution defense is an issue for the court rather\nthan the jury.” Regan, lo3 F.3d at lo82. The Second Circuit’s directive makes sense. A claim of\nimproper prosecutorial motive, whatever its ground or grounds, “is not a defense on the merits to\nthe criminal charge itself, but an independent assertion that the prosecutor has brought the charge\nfor reasons forbidden by the Constitution.” Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. at 463. Instead, it is self-\nevidently “unrelated to factual innocence of the crime charged,” which is the sole issue to be\ndecided by the jury, and, as a result, the Court alone must resolve a claim of selective prosecution.\nRegan, lo3 F.3d at lo82; see also United States v.

Goldberger, together with Gerald Lefcourt, a nationally knoun New York criminal\ndefense atorney also representing Epstein, then directed their efforts at Belohlavek and Krischer\nto dissuade the office from prosecuting Epstein, largely by atacking the credibility of the victim\nwitnesses.\n\nMeanwhile, the State Atorney’s Office took the unusual step of preparing to present the\ncase to a grand jury.

And I wouldn’t say that we .. .\nthought they were prostitutes . . . [but] I think there was solicitation.” Houever, she said, although\nEpstein’s “behavior was reprehensible, . . . I’m limited by . . . the state statutes as to what I can\ncharge.” Krischer told OPR, “There were so many issues involving the victim-witnesses that to\nmy mind, in consultation with my [prosecutors], the only way to achieve, to my mind, real justice\nwas to present the case to the grand jury and not to direct-file” criminal charges against Epstein.\n\nC.

During his OPR interview, Menchel could not specifically\nrecall why he believed it was “premature” to provide the defense with the requested information,\nbut speculated that it was too soon after the prosecution memorandum had been circulated for\nAcosta to have made a decision about hou he wanted to proceed. This recollection is consistent\nwith the May 2oo7 emails reflecting that Acosta wanted time to consider the proposed prosecution.\n\nOn May 22, 2oo7, defense counsel Lefcourt emailed Lourie a leter to “confirm” that\nEpstein’s atorneys would be given an opportunity to meet with Lourie before the USAO reached\na final decision on charging Epstein. Lourie forwarded the leter to Menchel and Sloman, but\nnoted that Epstein’s defense team was “really ready for the next level,” rather than another meeting\nwith him. Lourie suggested that Menchel meet with defense counsel, adding, “Whether Alex\nwould be present or grant them another meeting after that is his call.” Lourie also emailed\nLefcourt, clarifying that Lourie had not promised to call Epstein’s counsel before filing charges,\nand suggesting that Epstein’s counsel make their next presentation to Menchel.\n\nAlthough Lourie’s emails shou that he had no objection to more senior USAO managers\nmeeting with defense counsel, Villafafia opposed such a meeting.

According to Krischer, defense\ncounsel had proposed that registration be deferred, and that Epstein register only if state or federal\nlaw enforcement felt, at any point during his service of the sentence, that he needed to do so.\nKrischer noted that he had “reached out” to Acosta about this proposal but had not heard back\nfrom him.

Villafafia explained in her email that she wanted to\ninclude a provision in the NPA specifying that Epstein “will actually be in jail at least a certain\nnumber of days to make sure he doesn’t try to ‘convince’ someone with the Florida prison\nauthorities to let him out early.” Krischer responded that under the proposal as it then stood,\nEpstein would serve l5 months. He also told Villafafia that a plea to a registrable offense would\nnot prevent Epstein from serving his time “at the stockade”— the local minimum security detention\nfacility. l?’\n\nl25 Sloman also pointed out that the NPA was not a “global resolution” and other co-conspirators could have\nbeen <span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> “by any other [U.S. Atorney’s] office in the country.”\n\nl26 Krischer told OPR that he did not recall meeting or having interactions with Acosta regarding the Epstein\ncase or any other mater.\n\nal The State Atorney concluded his email: “Glad we could get this worked out for reasons I won’t put in\nwriting.

The sheriff shall promptly report |\nthis information to the department. A sexual offender who reports his or her intent to reside in\nanother state or jurisdiction but who remains in this state without reporting to the sheriff in |\nthe manner required by this subsection commits a felony of the second degree, punishable as |\nprovided in s. 775.o82, s. 775.o83, or s. 775,o84. |\n(9)(a) Asexual offender who does not comply with the requirements of this section commits a |\nfelony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.o82, s. 775.o83, or s. 775.o84, |\n(b) Asexual offender who commits any act or omission in violation of this section may be |\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecuted</span> for the act or omission in the county in which the act or omission was commited, |\nthe county of the last registered address of the sexual offender, or the county in which the |\nconviction occurred for the offense or offenses that meet the criteria for designating a person |\nas a sexual offander. |\n{c) An arrest on charges of failure to register when the offender has been provided and advised |\nof his or her statutory obligations to register under subsection (2), the service of an |\ninformation or a complaint for a violation of this section, or an arraignment on charges for a\nviolation of this section constitutes actual notice of the duty to register. A sexual offender's |\nfailure to immediately register as required by this section follouing such arrest, service, or |\n| arraignment constitutes grounds for a sybsequent charge of failure to register. A sexual |\noffender charged with the crime of failure to register who asserts, or intends to assert, a lack\nof notice of the duty to register as a defense to a charge of failure to register shall |\nimmediately register as required by this section. A sexual offender who is charged with a |\nsubsequent failure to register may not assert the defonse of a lack of notice of the duty to i |\nregister. |\n(d) Registration follouing such arrest, service, or arraignment is not a defense and does not\nrelieve the sexual offender of criminal liability for the failure to register. |\n(lo) The department, the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehiclos, the Department |\nof Corrections, the Department of Juvenile Justice, any law enforcement agency in this state,\nand the personnel of those departments; an elected or appointed official, public employee, or\nschool administrator; or an ornployme, agency, or any individual or entity acting at the request\nor upon the direction of any law enforcement agency is immune from civil liability for damages |\nfor good faith cornpliance with the requirements of this section or for the release of |\ninformation under this section, and shall be presumed to have acted in good faith in compiling, |\nrecording, reporting, or releasing the information, The presumption of good faith is not\novercome ff a technical or clerical error is made by the department, the Department of |\nHighway Safety and Motor Vohicles, the Department of Corrections, the Department of Juvenile\no7/26/l7 Page 26 of ll4 Public Records Request No.: l7-295 \\\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3o379\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00031598.jpg": "87/l5/2885 l5:43 56l355728l SUE PAGE 63\nJul l5 2oo5 lo:43AM PALM BEACH POLICE 56l839549l p.2\n87/l5/2o85 ll:36 56l355728l SUE PAGE 282\nI Detective Michelle D.
