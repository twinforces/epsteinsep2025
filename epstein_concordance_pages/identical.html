And the canon therefore does\nlitle work in this case.\n\nThe relevant portions of the NPA do not have any\nsort of parallelism in their wording or structure that\nwould suggest the necessity for <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> terminology\non this particular point. Compare, e.g., Pet.

In-\ndeed, as noted above, the phrasing of the coconspirators\nclause—in which “the United States also agrees” to\nforgo certain prosecution of coconspirators, 7d. at 3la\n(emphasis added)—plainly uses “the United States” in\nreference to the entity otherwise making the agreement\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo234", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001645.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 29 Filed o7/27/2o Page 3 of 4\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 27, 2o2o\nPage 3\nMaxwell with respect to using the criminal discovery material solely for the purpose of this\ncriminal case.\n\na, Victim/Witness Identities\n\nMs. Maxwell’s proposed protective order prohibits Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and\nothers on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity of any alleged victim or\npotential witness referenced in the discovery materials, but does not prohibit defense counsel\nfrom publicly referencing individuals “who have spoken on the public record to the media or in\npublic fora, or in litigation—criminal or otherwise—relating to Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine\nMaxwell.” Jd. § 6. This language, which is nearly <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> in all material respects to the\nlanguage in the protective order approved in the government’s criminal prosecution of Mr.\nEpstein, see United States v. Epstein, l9-CR-oo49o-RMB (S.D.N.Y. July 25, 2ol9), ensures\nappropriate privacy protections for alleged victims and should be approved here.\n\nIn contrast to the more permissive language it agreed to with respect to Mr. Epstein, the\ngovernment has taken the position that Ms. Maxwell’s defense counsel should only be alloued to\ndisclose the identity of alleged victims or potential witnesses who have spoken by name on the\npublic record “in this case.” The government’s proposal, houever, advances no compelling\nprivacy protections, and instead prevents the defense from making reference to individuals who\nhave already voluntarily publicly disclosed their identities by, among other things, pursuing civil\nsuits in their oun name against Ms. Maxwell and/or Mr. Epstein; speaking by name in the public\nrecord in Mr. Epstein’s criminal proceedings; participating in on-the-record media interviews; or\nposting comments under their oun names on social media. The government’s proposed\nrestriction is therefore “broader than necessary” to protect the privacy interests of these\nindividuals who have already chosen to self-identify, and will hinder the defense’s ability to\nconduct further factual investigation, prepare witnesses for trial, and advocate on Ms. Maxwell’s\nbehalf.\n\n* * *\nDOJ-OGR-ooool645", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001667.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 33 Filed o7/28/2o Page 4 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 28, 2o2o\nPage 4\n\nMoreover, the defendant is able, at any time, to apply to the Court for a modification of the\nprotective order should she be able to identify a particularized need to publicly name victims who\nhave not yet identified themselves on the record in this case—as opposed to redacting their names\nfrom court filings, or referring to them in an anonymized fashion. As noted, to date, defense\ncounsel has declined to identify to the Court or to the Government any example of why doing so\nwould be necessary or helpful to the defense, or even under what circumstances the defense might\nwant to do so.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal is also extraordinarily broad, and without any temporal or subject\nmater limitation as to the phrase “public fora.” Adopting the defendant’s proposal would mean\nthat any individual who has ever self-identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell\npublicly in any capacity would be subject to public identification by the defendant and her counsel\nin connection with this case. This would include, as hypothetical examples, someone who spoke\nto a journalist for a local story in l997, or posted on a MySpace page folloued by a handful of\nfriends in 2oo5, or made a statement on a small podcast in 2oo9, or posted on Twiter to a handful\nof follouers in 2ol3. But none of these examples of ventures into the “public fora” can possibly\nbe construed as efforts by hypothetical victims to consent or choose “‘to self-identify,” Def. Ltr.\nat 3, in a future criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell subject to extraordinary public atention\nand scrutiny.\n\nAdditionally, while some individuals have identified themselves as victims without\nproviding any details or additional information about their abuse, the defense contemplates no\nlimitation of publicly associating those individuals with the details of their abuse in public defense\nstatements or filings. In essence, the defendant’s proposal seeks authorization to drag into the\npublic glare any victim who has ever made any type of public statement of victimization—no\nmater hou long ago or hou brief—without that victim’s knouing consent and without any\nsubstantive justification. That is particularly troubling given that the Government expects to make\nproductions of discovery and 35oo materials well surpassing its obligations. Those productions\nwill necessarily include the identities of individuals whom the Government does not expect to call\nas witnesses, and whose accounts—much less identities—will have no bearing on this case. But\nthe defendant’s proposal would allou her and her counsel to publicly name them in any public\nstatement or filing at their sole discretion. This is plainly unnecessary for any investigative steps\nor trial preparation, would be grossly inappropriate and unfair, and would be inconsistent with the\nCrime Victims’ Rights Act.\n\nConversely, the Government’s submission proposes that the defendant and her counsel not\nbe precluded from discussing publicly individuals who identify themselves on the record in this\ncriminal prosecution, because any such individuals will have made a conscious and informed\nchoice to be associated publicly with this case. See Government Proposed Order {/f 5, 6, 8.

Accordingly, the Court should sever Counts Five and Six.\nOVERVIEW OF THE ALLEGATIONS\n\nA. Counts One through Four (the “Mann Act Counts”)\n\nCounts One and Three of the Indictment allege that Ms. Maxwell conspired with Jeffrey\nEpstein and “others knoun and unknoun” to violate two separate provisions of the Mann Act.\nCount One alleges that Ms. Maxwell conspired with Epstein to entice “one or more individuals”\nto travel in interstate and foreign commerce to engage in “sexual activity for which a person can\nbe charged with a criminal offense” in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2422. Indictment ff] 9-lo. Count\nThree alleges that Ms. Maxwell conspired with Epstein to transport “an individual” in interstate\nand foreign commerce to engage in “sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a\ncriminal offense” in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a). Id. Jj l5-l6.\n\nCounts One and Three each allege four <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> overt acts in furtherance of the\nconspiracy involving three accusers.! Jd. 4 ll, l7. All of the overt acts allegedly occurred at\nunspecified times “between in or about l994 and in or about l997” in New York, Florida, New\nMexico, and London, England. /d.\n\nCounts Two and Four charge Ms. Maxwell with substantive violations of\nl8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2423(a). Jd. 49 l3, l9. Counts Two and Four allege offenses as to\nAccuser-l only, not Accusers-2 or -3. Jd. Like Counts One and Three, Counts Two and Four are\nbased on conduct that allegedly occurred at unspecified times between l994 and l997. Id. JJ l3,\nl9,\n\n! The indictment refers to the accusers as Minor Victim-l, Minor Victim-2, and Minor Victim-3.\nWe will refer to them as Accuser-l, Accuser-2, and Accuser-3.\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2284", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002305.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l22 Filed ol/25/2l Page 6 of 9\nAPPLICATION OF THE MULTIFACTOR TEST!\n\nParagraph l4 of the Superseding Indictment (the first paragraph in Count Three)\nincorporates by reference all of the factual allegations made in Count One. The government has,\ntherefore, based Count Three on the exact same factual allegations as Count One, rendering the\ntwo counts clones of one another. The commonality between these counts is complete and fatal\nto one of the alleged conspiracies.\n\nI. The overlap of participants.\n\nThe alleged co-conspirators, Epstein and Maxwell, are <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span>. See Indictment 44 9 and\n\nl5. The accusers are <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span>. See id. 47 and l7.\nII. The overlap of time.\n\nThe time period of the alleged conspiracies, l994 to l997, is <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span>. See id. 4] l and\nl3,\n\nIII. Similarity of operation.\n\nThe government claims, in paragraph 2 of Count One, that the operation was a “scheme\nto abuse minor victims” and that Ms. Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein “enticed and caused minor\nvictims to travel to Epstein’s residences in different states, which MAXWELL knew and\nintended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse.” /d. {| 2. This is the\n<span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> “scheme” alleged, first by reference, and then explicitly, in Count Three: “Minor\nVictim-l was enticed to travel from Florida to New York for purposes of sexually abusing her at\nthe New York Residence in violation of New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55.” Id. 4 l7(b).\n\n' The first factor, an analysis of the criminal offenses charged in “successive indictments” is\ninapplicable here because Ms. Maxwell has been charged with two § 37l conspiracies in the same\nindictment. The multifactor test, houever, remains applicable. See, e.g., United States v. Cooper, 886\nF3d. l46, l55 (D.C. Cir. 2ol8) (appellate court applied the Second Circuit multifactor test to two\nconspiracies charged in the same indictment and determined that the charges were multiplicitous,\nremanding the case to the district court with directions to vacate one of the convictions).\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo23o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002306.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l22 Filed ol/25/2l Page 7 of 9\nIV. The existence of common overt acts.\n\nThe overt acts alleged in Count l, paragraph ll, are <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> to those alleged in Count 3,\nparagraph l7. See id. ¥] 3 and l7.\n\nV. The geographic scope of the alleged conspiracies or location where overt acts\noccurred.\n\nThe geographic scope is likewise <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span>: New York, Florida, New Mexico, and the\nUnited Kingdom. See id. 7§| ll and l7.\n\nVI. Common objectives.\n\nAs alleged in the Indictment, the “objective” of the conspiracies was to entice and cause\n“minor victims to travel to Epstein’s residences in different states” for the purpose of sexual\nabuse. See id. 9] 2 and l7.\n\nVII. The degree of interdependence between alleged distinct conspiracies.\n\nThis factor requires the Court to consider the extent to which the success or failure of one\nalleged conspiracy is independent of a corresponding success or failure by the other. Macchia,\n35 F.3d at 67l. The conspiracy alleged in Count Three is logically dependent on the success of\nthe conspiracy alleged in Count One. The object of both, as claimed by the government, is to\nfirst entice and then to transport minors across state lines for the purpose of illegal sexual\nactivity. If the conspiracy to entice fails there would, logically, be no one to transport.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe government has alleged the same conspiracy twice in violation of the Fifth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution. The Court should therefore dismiss either Count\nOne or Count Three of the Indictment as multiplicitous.\n\nDated: January 25, 2o2l\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo23o6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002349.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l34 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 2 of 23\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT ....... ee eeeeesereeeeereeeerteeeetertesieee I\nA.

Yet, it is in precisely this\nseting—involving a defendant who, despite her years of denials, has been publicly atacked,\nthreatened, and vilified like few others in recent memory—that the government’s scrupulous\nadherence to the law in prosecuting a criminal defendant is most critical. As the motions being\nfiled today demonstrate, the government has repeatedly fallen short of its obligations here. The\nindictment must be dismissed.\n\nThe government’s sudden zeal to prosecute Ms. Maxwell for alleged conduct with\nEpstein in the l99os—conduct for which the government never even charged Epstein—follous a\nhistory that is both highly unusual and deeply troubling. The government (and state authorities)\ninvestigated Epstein thoroughly in 2oo6 for alleged conduct that is essentially <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> to the\nconduct alleged in the current indictment. In 2oo7, the government’s investigation was resolved\nwhen it entered into a Non-Prosecution Agreement (“NPA”) with Epstein, which was negotiated\nunder the supervision of R. Alexander Acosta, then United States Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida (“SDFL”), and approved by senior levels of Main Justice, including the Office\nof the Deputy Atorney General. In that NPA, the government agreed that any federal\nprosecution of Epstein in the SDFL would be deferred in exchange for Epstein’s agreement to\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2578", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002579.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 7 of 38\nplead guilty to a single-count Florida state indictment.' Epstein did so in 2oo8 and went to\nprison for l3 months. At that time, the government did not charge Ms. Maxwell.\n\nIn 2ol6, atorneys representing plaintiffs in civil litigation against Ms. Maxwell met with\na section chief in the United States Atorney’s Office (““USAO”) for the Southern District of New\nYork (“SDNY”) and pitched the idea of bringing a criminal case against Ms. Maxwell for\nconduct similar, if not <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span>, to that alleged in the current indictment. The section chief\nappropriately declined.\n\nThen, in 2ol8, more than a decade after the NPA was executed, an explosive front-page\narticle in the Miami Herald reported detailed allegations, including from atorneys representing\nplaintiffs in civil litigation, about Epstein’s conduct, Acosta’s handling of the 2oo6 investigation,\nthe process by which the NPA had been negotiated, and its substantive terms. In the wake of the\narticle, the government indicted Epstein in this District for conduct allegedly commited between\n2oo2 and 2oo5. Again, the government did not charge Ms. Maxwell.\n\nThus, at three separate junctures over more than a decade, the government had occasion\nto consider whether to charge Ms. Maxwell for the nou 25-year-old conduct alleged in the\ncurrent indictment. Every time, the government—appropriately—did not do so. Indeed, such\ncharges would have been baseless.\n\nBut in August 2ol9, Epstein was found dead in his jail cell. His death while in federal\ncustody was not only disturbing, but publicly embarrassing for the government, characterized by\nthe then-Atorney General as the result of “‘a perfect storm of screw-ups.”\n\nWorse still, almost to the day after Epstein died, the barrage of media atention shifted\nfrom Epstein to Ms. Maxwell, including in mainstream publications. She was portrayed as\n| The government had drafted a 6o-count federal indictment against Epstein, which did not refer to Ms. Maxwell.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2579", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002581.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 9 of 38\nnot expired, would be punishable by up to three months in prison — /ess time than Ms.\nMaxwell has already spent in pretrial detention. Yet, here, that misdemeanor has\nbeen set up as the basis for federal charges for which the government seeks to impose\nyears of imprisonment, if not the equivalent of a life term. Not only is this troubling\nin approach, but even the pieced-together Mann Act charges are time-barred under\nthe applicable statute of limitations.\n\n* Inseeking and obtaining confidential materials from pending civil litigation against\nMs. Maxwell, including the deposition transcripts that form the basis of the two\nperjury counts in the indictment, the government a\n\n* The government has based the two counts of perjury on poorly worded questions that\nwere immaterial to the defamation case in which the depositions were taken, and has\nimproperly joined those counts to the Mann Act charges, as addressed in today’s\nmotions to dismiss and to sever those counts.\n\n* In an effort to allou other accusers to testify against Ms. Maxwell, the government\nhas added two conspiracy counts and, as alleged “‘overt acts” in furtherance of a\npurported conspiracy to cause minors to travel, has tacked on allegations from two\nother accusers—one of whom is not alleged to have traveled at all (and who was\nabove the legal age of consent in England, where the alleged conduct took place).\n\n¢ [nits rush to arrest Ms. Maxwell on the anniversary of Epstein’s indictment and\nmaximize the announcement’s appeal to the media, the government indicted Ms.\nMaxwell using a White Plains grand jury, thereby violating Ms. Maxwell’s right to a\ngrand jury drawn from a fair cross-section of the community.\n\n* Finally, the government has charged multiplicitous conspiracy counts based on\n<span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> conduct, failed to disclose the names of the accusing witnesses or provide\nspecific facts in the indictment that would permit Ms. Maxwell to adequately prepare\nfor trial, and impermissibly delayed bringing this prosecution for 25 years in violation\nof Ms. Maxwell’s due process rights.\n\nThe hue and cry against Ms. Maxwell is unprecedented in both scale and severity. Under\nour system of justice, the need for the Court’s careful scrutiny of the government’s conduct, and\nfor the protection of the constitutional rights of a defendant facing the equivalent of a life\nsentence, is at its highest. This case is not about “geting” Ms. Maxwell (or any other\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo258l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002604.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 32 of 38\nAtorney’s Office.” NPA at 2. The later investigation, in turn, encompasses not only “offenses”\nfrom the 2ool-o7 time period, but also “Epstein’s background.” /d. at l. Thus, for example,\nprosecution of Epstein for a pre-2ool offense that arose out of the FBI/USAO investigation into\nEpstein’s background, or for an unlisted statutory offense that arose from the grand jury\ninvestigation, would have been prohibited under the NPA.\n\nThe co-conspirator immunity provision does not include even those broad limitations. It\nprovides, simply, that the United States will not “institute any criminal charges against any\npotential co-conspirators of Epstein.” Jd. at 5 (emphasis added). The provision could not be\nclearer, either on its face or in the context of the NPA as a whole. As with the absence of\nlanguage limiting the provision to prosecution in the SDFL, the absence of any language limiting\nthe offenses for which potential co-conspirators cannot be prosecuted, when such language is\nincluded as to Epstein, must be presumed under contract interpretation principles to have been\nintentional. See, e.g., LaSalle Bank, 424 F.3d at 2o6; Port Consol., 826 F. App’x at 827-28. At\nminimum, the silence as to time period and covered conduct is an ambiguity and therefore should\nbe resolved against the government. Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x at 269.\n\nEven if the NPA were construed as placing some limitation on co-conspirator immunity,\nno rational limitation could exclude the conduct alleged here. The charges against Ms. Maxwell\ninvolve her alleged role as a co-conspirator of Epstein, involving alleged conduct almost\n<span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> to the alleged conduct that led up to the NPA. Indeed, the United States Atorney for\nthis District, in announcing the current indictment, described it as “the prequel to the earlier case\nwe brought against Jeffrey Epstein.” See, e.g., Dienst, J., Valiquete, J., Winter, T., and\nFitzpatrick, S. “Jeffrey Epstein Confidante Ghislaine Maxwell Arrested on Sex Abuse Charges.”\nNBC New York.

Yet her argument runs contrary to the weight of authority that has adopted the\ncommon-sense view that crimes that necessarily entail the sexual or physical abuse of children\n“involv[e] the sexual or physical abuse of a child.” This Court should do the same and deny the\nmotion.\n\nA. Statutory Background\n\nBetween l99o and 2oo6, Congress passed a series of laws that expanded the statute of\nlimitations for prosecutions of crimes against minors, ultimately extending the statute of\nlimitations to the lifetime of the minor victim and, for certain offenses, eliminating the statute of\nlimitations entirely. These laws reflect a virtually unbroken congressional policy that the default\nfive-year statute of limitations for federal crimes, l8 U.S.C. § 3282, is inadequate for such\noffenses. An extended statute of limitations is necessary because “child sex abuse offenses . . .\nmay be difficult to detect quickly,” in part because children often first report their abuse long after\nit occurs.

The second draft leter\nto Krischer, for Acosta’s signature, requested that Krischer respond to defense counsel’s\nallegations that the State Atorney’s Office was not comfortable with the proposed plea and\nsentence because it believed that the case should be resolved with probation and no sexual offender\nregistration. OPR found no evidence that these leters were sent to Krischer.*”°\n\nA few days later, in an apparent effort to move forward with victim notifications, Villafafia\nemailed Sloman, stating, “[Is there] anything that I or the agents should be doing?” Villafafia told\nSloman that “[the FBI case agent] is all worked up because another agent and [a named AUSA]\nare the subject of an OPR investigation for failing to properly confer with and notify victims [in\nan unrelated mater].

I did not receive any\nvictim calls during this time.”\n\n2s The FBI Uses VNS Form Leters to Re-Establish Contact with Victims\n\nOn January lo, 2oo8, the FBI Victim Specialist mailed VNS generated victim notification\nleters to l4 victims articulating the eight CVRA rights and inviting recipients to update their\ncontact information with the FBI in order to obtain current information about the mater.*?° The\ncase agent informed Villafafia in an email that the Victim Specialist sent a “standard form [FBI]\nleter to all the remaining identified victims.” These 2oo8 leters were <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> to the FBI form\nleters the Victim Specialist had sent to victims between August 28, 2oo6, and October l2, 2oo7.\nLike those previous leters, most of which were sent before the NPA was signed on September 24,\n2oo7, the 2oo8 leters described the case as “currently under investigation” and noted that “[t]his\ncan be a lengthy process and we request your continued patience while we conduct a thorough\ninvestigation.” The leters also stated:\n\n325 Michele Dargan, “Jeffrey Epstein Plea Hearing Moved to March,” Palm Beach Daily News “The Shiny\nSheet,” Jan. 3, 2oo8.\nl26 Epstein’s atorneys used discovery proceedings in the state case to depose federal victims, and as they learned\nunflatering details or potential impeachment information concerning likely federal victims, they argued for the\nexclusion of those victims from the federal case. For example, defense atorneys questioned one victim as to whether\nthe federal prosecutors or FBI agents told her that she was entitled to recetve money from Epstein. See Exhibit 9 to\nVillafafia June 2, 2ol7 Declaration: Deposition of [REDACTED], State v. Epstein, Case No. 2oo6-CF-9454, at 44,\n5o, 5l (Feb. 2o, 2oo8). One victim’s atorney told OPR that the defense atorneys tried to “smear” victims by asking\nhighly personal sexual questions about “terminations of pregnancies . . . sexual encounters . . . masturbation.”\nEpstein’s atorney used similar tactics in questioning victims who filed civil cases against their client. For example,\nthe Miami Herald reported that, “One girl was asked about her abortions, and her parents, who were Catholic and\nknew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.” See Julie Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Cops\nWorked to Put a Serial Sex Abuser in Prison.

After Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\nstate court pleas, she sent out substantially similar notification leters to two victims who resided outside of the United\nStates.\n\n22l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3423", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003441.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 265 of 348\nleter was substantially <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> to the previous FBI victim notification leter the FBI had sent to\nvictims (in 2oo6, 2oo7, and 2oo8) in that it identified each recipient as “a possible victim of a\nfederal crime” and listed her eight CVRA rights.\n\nThe leter did not indicate that Epstein had pled guilty in state court on June 3o, 2oo8, or\nthat the USAO had resolved its investigation by deferring federal prosecution in favor of the state\nplea. Rather, like the previous FBI VNS-generated leter, the leter requested the victims’\n“assistance and cooperation while we are investigating the case.”\n\nFor each of the two victims residing outside of the United States, Villafafia also drafted a\nnotification leter concerning the June 3o, 2oo8 plea and the l8 U.S.C. § 2255 process, which were\nto be hand delivered along with the FBI’s leters. Houever, FBI records do not reflect whether\nthe USAO’s leter was delivered to the two victims.\n\nE. August — September 2oo8: The Federal Court Orders the USAO to Disclose\n\nthe NPA to Victims, and the USAO Sends a Revised Victim Notification Leter\n\nOn August l, 2oo8, the petitioners in the CVRA litigation filed a motion seeking access to\nthe NPA. The USAO opposed the motion by relying on the confidentiality portion of the NPA.?”\nOn August 2l, 2oo8, the court ordered the government to provide the petitioners with a copy of\nthe NPA subject to a protective order. In addition, the court ordered the government to produce\nthe NPA to other identified victims upon request:\n\n(d) If any individuals who have been identified by the USAO as\nvictims of Epstein and/or any atorney(s) for those individuals\nrequest the opportunity to review the [NPA], then the USAO shall\nproduce the [NPA] to those individuals, so long as those individuals\nalso agree that they shall not disclose the [NPA] or its terms to any\nthird party absent further court order, follouing notice to and an\nopportunity for Epstein’s counsel to be heard[.]?”\n\nIn September 2oo8, the USAO sent a revised notification leter to victims, and atorneys\nfor represented victims, concerning Epstein’s state court guilty plea and his agreement to not\ncontest liability in victim civil suits brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255.74 The September leter\nappeared to address concerns raised by Epstein atorney Lefkouitz that the government’s earlier\nnotification leter referenced language concerning l8 U.S.C. § 2255 that the government had\nproposed in Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter to Epstein atorney Sanchez, but that the defense\nhad not accepted.*” As a result of the defense objection, Villafafia determined that she was\nare Pursuant to paragraph l3 of the NPA, Villafafia made Epstein’s atorneys aware of the petitioners’ request\nfor the NPA.\na8 Doe, Order to Compel Production and Protective Order at l-2 (Aug. 2l, 2oo8).\nes The USAO also sent a notification leter to additional victims who had not received a notification leter in\nJuly.\n\n37 This issue is discussed more fully in Chapter Two.\n239\nDOJ-OGR-oooo344l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003466.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 29o of 348\ncontinuing.” The co-case agent also told OPR that, as of the time of his OPR interview in 2ol9,\nthe “the case was open . . . it’s never been shut doun.”\n\nOPR found no evidence that the FBI’s victim leters were drafted with the intent to mislead\nthe victims about the status of the federal investigation. The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span>\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*'* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\nae The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative) and “Under Investigation.”\nals After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n\n264\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3466", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003635.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5 of 3o\npercentage points less African American than the estimated percent in the community and l.l5\npercentage points less Hispanic than the estimated percent in the community.\n\n29.

Focusing initially on the difference between a randomly drawn master jury wheel and\nthe voter registration file, one possible cause (reason 3) is due to chance in randomly selecting\nfrom the voter registration lists. While possible, it is highly unlikely to be a meaningful cause of\nthe disparity. The master jury wheel is supposed to be a simple random sample drawn from the\nvoter registration lists. Given the size of the sample drawn, the representation on the master jury\nwheel should almost perfectly mirror the demographics of the voter registration lists. It is highly\nlikely that chance variation would only result in at most a o.ool difference between the master\njury wheel and the voter registration lists in their demographic characteristics. Hence, the\ndifference between the community and a randomly drawn sample from the voter registration lists\nmust be almost exclusively because of differences between the voter registration lists and the\ncommunity (reasons l and 2). As shoun herein, the voter registration lists are a good source\nfrom which to pick a wheel that is representative of the community benchmarks for African\nAmericans and Hispanics. The absolute disparity between a randomly drawn master jury wheel\nfrom the voter registration lists is only o.57% for African Americans and o.33% for Hispanics.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3635", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003759.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2lo Filed o4/l6/2l Page2of6\n\nThe government does not dispute that Counts l and 3 charge Ms. Maxwell with the same\ncrime, conspiracy in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l, nor that the charges are based on <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span>\nfacts.

The government has\nfailed to proffer any evidence to the contrary, and Ms. Maxwell’s Motion should be deemed\nconfessed.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons stated in Ms. Maxwell’s original Motion and this Reply, she requests that\nthe Court enter an order requiring the government to elect the conspiracy charge it intends to\nprosecute and dismiss the remaining count.\n\nDated: March l5, 2o2l\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo376l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003800.jpg": "CasgdQo7G- Qi BF AAR NVaD GUM ALASD , HHRedeie/ BEI29 | PA AadERE of 8\nApp.-ol36\n\nIn deciding to stay the civil case, courts generally weigh six factors: (l) the extent to\nwhich the issues in the criminal case overlap with those in the civil case; (2) the status of the\ncriminal case, including whether the defendant has been indicted; (3) the private interests of the\nplaintiff in proceeding expeditiously weighed against the prejudice to the plaintiffs caused by the\ndelay; (4) the private interests of and burden on the defendant; (5) the interest of the Court; and\n(6) the public interest.

First, presumably the issues in any purported criminal\ninvestigation are <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> with the underlying issue in this case: did Ms. Maxwell assist in\n“trafficking” the Plaintiff as she claims from l999 to 2ool. As to the second factor Plaintiff\nclaims to have information about this issue, although no indictment has been issued. Third,\ngiven the age of the underlying allegations, almost 2o years, there does not appear to be any\nprejudice that could be caused by any delay. Fourth, in the event there actually is an\ninvestigation and Plaintiff is involved in fomenting the investigation, Ms. Maxwell has a\nsignificant interest in knouing about the investigation so that she can appropriately respond and\nassess any claim of privilege. Concerning factor five, the Court has an interest in controlling the\nproceedings before it and also has an interest in protecting the rights of the litigants. Appropriate\ndisclosure would allou an informed decision to be made regarding these issues. Finally, there is\nno compelling public interest that would outweigh disclosure and an informed decision.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo38oo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003885.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document223 Filed o4/2o/2l Page l2 of 23\ndemonstrated that the NPA, as a whole, gives rise to such an appearance—and the government\noffers no reasonable alternative interpretation.\n\nUnlike Annabi and its progeny, the NPA here contains significant evidence of the parties’\nintent to apply the co-conspirator immunity provision outside the SDFL. While the provision\ngranting immunity to Epstein himself expressly limits his immunity to prosecutions “in this\nDistrict,” NPA at 2, the co-conspirator immunity provision contains no such limitation.\n\n“TW |here contract provisions use different language, courts must assume the parties intended\ndifferent meanings.” Bank of New York Mellon Trust Co. v.

Thus, the appropriate inference here is that the parties intended to limit Epstein’s\nimmunity, but not immunity for potential co-conspirators, to prosecutions in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida (“SDFL”).\n\nThe government offers no reasonable alternative explanation for the contrasting language\nin the two provisions. Instead, it argues that because the parties limited Epstein’s immunity to\nthe SDFL, they must have meant to limit co-conspirators’ immunity to the SDFL as well, but\nmust have forgoten to include the appropriate language. This argument—that the use of\ndifferent language in parallel provisions compels an inference that <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span>, rather than different\nmeanings, are intended—turns fundamental contract interpretation on its head.

Here, the NPA contains only two immunity provisions: one for Epstein, which\nis expressly limited to the SDFL, and one for co-conspirators, which is not. The government’s\nclaim that this distinction reflects an intent to apply the limitation universally strains credulity.°\nIt is simply inconceivable that any reasonable prosecutor who intended to limit the co-\nconspirator immunity provision to the SDFL—and who had thought to include precisely such\nlimiting language in Epstein’s immunity provision—would have found it unnecessary to include\n<span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> language in the co-conspirator immunity provision. Indeed, the omission reveals an\nintent not to so limit that provision.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s opening memorandum pointed out a second indication in the text of the\nNPA that the parties intended to apply the co-conspirator immunity provision outside the SDFL:\nwhere a provision in the NPA is intended to refer only to the USAO-SDFL, it does so explicitly.\nSee Mem. at 8-9 (citing examples of NPA’s explicit references to USAO-SDFL). While the\ngovernment is correct that the use of the term “the United States” in a plea agreement, without\nmore, is insufficient under Annabi and its progeny to demonstrate an intent to bind other\ndistricts, the NPA’s references to both the USAO-SDFL and “the United States” require an\ninference that a distinction between the two is intended—and that where “the United States” is\nused, the intent is to refer to the government as a whole.

But the cited passage in that brief argued only that the NPA did not bar the prosecution of Epstein in\nother districts, which is not in dispute; it made no such argument with respect to the prosecution of potential co-\nconspirators. In any event, any self-serving atempts by the USAO-SDFL to limit the NPA’s applicability years\nafter it was executed—after the NPA had been widely criticized and scrutinized—are no more probative of the\nparties’ intent in 2oo7 than the arguments made by the government here.\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3886", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004208.jpg": "Casask 4olg-Qn83aPARWSPasuaueneeehes FitdeachemMens! pdgage cf afil2\n\nWeighing these factors, there is no basis for permiting more than the presumptive ten\ndeposition limit. First, as highlighted by the motion, the information purportedly sought is\ncumulative and duplicative. By way of example, Plaintiff has already deposed Johanna Sjoberg\n(a former Epstein employee), Juan Alessi (a former Epstein employee), and David Rodgers*\n(former Epstein Pilot). She further seeks to depose Maria Alessi and Jo Fontanella (former\nEpstein household employees), as well as Dana Bums and Emmy Taylor (identified as assistants\nto Ms. Maxwell or Mr. Epstein). The information Plaintiff claims each of the witnesses may\nhave is <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> to that of each other — what they observed while working for Epstein. Plaintiff\ngoes so far as to state that Maria Alessi’s deposition is expected to “corroborate” the\nobservations of her husband’s.\n\nPlaintiff admits that the purpose in seeking the additional depositions is “obtaining\nwitnesses, like Ms. Sjoberg, who can corroborate that [Plaintiff] is telling the truth.” Yet, Ms.\nSjoberg did not “corroborate that [Plaintiff] is telling the truth.” Instead, she testified that [jj\nees\n——————————— Ss\n———$<—— OOOO\nI\nRegardless, Plaintiff is looking in vain for more testimony of exactly the same character,\nprecisely the type of testimony the presumptive limit is intended to prevent.\n\nSimilarly, the expected deposition testimony of former Palm Beach Detective Joe\nRecarey and former Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter are duplicative of each other.\n\n* Mr. Rodgers deposition, held last Friday and requiring a separate trip to Florida for Colorado counsel after the\nscheduled court hearing on Thursday, served simply to authenticate flight logs. There are far more convenient, less\nburdensome, and less expensive methods by which such information could have been obtained, such as a verifying\naffidavit, yet Plaintiff chose to unnecessarily burden counsel, the witness and counsel for the witness with a 3 hour\ndeposition to accomplish the same end.\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo42o8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004277.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document293 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page l2 of 32\nengage in commercial sex acts knouing that [Accuser-4] was under l8”)).° Pursuant to the\nterms of the NPA, the proposed indictment was never returned, and the USAO-SDFL did not\npursue it further, once Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8 to Florida state law charges of\nsolicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors to engage in prostitution. (Ex. A, OPR\nReport at i-i).\n\nThe similarity of the allegations presented to the SDFL grand jury and those alleged in\nCounts Five and Six of the $2 Indictment is striking and self-evident. The same overt acts,\nincluding the allegations that form the basis for jurisdiction in SDNY over the crimes charged in\nCounts Five and Six, were presented to both grand juries.

To resolve any ambiguity about the charges in\nthe proposed SDFL indictment and the evidence underlying the counts related to Accuser-4, Ms. Maxwell requests\nthe Court to order the government to produce both of these documents to the defense.\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4277", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004280.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293 Filed o5/25/2l Page l5 of 32\n\nago when the events were still recent.° Accordingly, because the USAO-SDNY is bound by the\nterms of the NPA as to the offenses charged in Counts Five and Six for the reasons discussed\nbelou, Ms. Maxwell cannot be prosecuted for those counts.\n\nB. The NPA Binds the Southern District of New York as to Counts Five and Six.\n\nAlthough the Court ruled that the NPA does not bind the USAO-SDNY as to the charges\nin the Sl Indictment (Dkt. 2o7 at 4-6), the NPA does bind the USAO-SDNY as to the sex\ntrafficking offenses charged in Counts Five and Six that were added to the S2 Indictment.\nUnited States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o (l985) and its progeny, which the Court relied upon in its\nearlier ruling, do not mandate a different result. In its prior ruling, the Court noted that Annabi\nestablished “something akin to a clear statement rule” that a plea agreement binds only the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the district in which the plea is entered “unless it affirmatively appears that\nthe agreement contemplates a broader restriction.” (Dkt. 2o7 at 4 (quoting Annabi, 77l F.2d at\n672). That interpretive rule, houever, only applies in situations where the district bringing the\nsecond prosecution charges offenses different from the offenses resolved by the plea agreement\nin the first prosecution. Annabi itself specifically noted that it was not addressing a situation\nwhere the charges in the follou-on prosecution are “<span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> to the dismissed charges.” Annabi,\n77l F.2d at 672. Accordingly, the Court is not bound by the rule in Annabi because Counts Five\nand Six are <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> to the charges presented to the SDFL grand jury that were resolved by the\nNPA. When examined without the overlay of Annabi, the terms and the drafting history of the\nNPA indicate that the agreement should be read to preclude other districts, including the USAO-\n° Accuser-4’s statements to the FBI, and any other prior statements in which she did not mention Ms. Maxwell, are\nexculpatory Brady material that the government should immediately produce to the defense.

(Ex. B at 5 of 7; see also Dkt. 2o7 at 7). As set forth above,\nCounts Five and Six of the S2 Indictment are based on the same alleged conduct involving\nAccuser-4 from 2ool-2oo4 that was presented to the SDFL grand jury and formed the basis for\nseveral overt acts of a conspiracy charge and a substantive sex trafficking offense against Epstein\nin the proposed SDFL indictment. The prosecution of those offenses was abandoned as part of\nthe bargain struck in the NPA, which Epstein fully performed and from which Accuser-4\nbenefited. In sum, the USAO-SDNY is trying to prosecute Ms. Maxwell in Counts Five and Six\nfor the <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> charges that were resolved by the NPA. In these circumstances, Annabi and its\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4284", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004285.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document293_ Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o of 32\nprogeny do not control.* The Court should instead follou Gebbie and find that NPA precludes\nthe USAO-SDNY from charging Counts Five and Six.\n\nThis result is consistent with the terms and the drafting history of the NPA. As noted in\nour previous motion, the use of the phrase “the United States” in the co-conspirator immunity\nprovision of the NPA stands in stark contrast to Epstein’s immunity provision, which is\nexpressly limited to the SDFL. (Dkt. 223 at 9-lo). The broad language of the co-conspirator\nprovision reflects Epstein’s desire, which his atorneys communicated to the USAO-SDFL, that\nhe would be “the only one who takes the blame for what happened” (Ex. A, OPR Report at l67\n(internal quotations omited)). Furthermore, it is consistent with Epstein’s goal “to resolve\nglobally his state and federal criminal liability,” which is set forth in the factual recitals of the\nNPA. (Ex. B at 2 of 7; see also Ex. D § 5 (declaration of AUSA A. Marie Villafafia noting that\nEpstein “sought a global resolution of the mater”). Epstein and his counsel were clearly aware\nthat the investigation had extended beyond the SDFL and involved New York-based witnesses.\nIndeed, we nou knou from discovery recently produced by the government that the government\ninterviewed at least three New York-based witnesses in connection with the Florida\nInvestigation, two of whom implicated other potential co-conspirators of Epstein. (Exs. E-G).\nHence, these provisions of the NPA reflect Epstein’s desire to ensure that he would not become\nembroiled in subsequent prosecutions of his “potential co-conspirators” in any other districts.\n(Dkt. 223 at ll).\n\nMoreover, this result is consistent with fundamental fairness. Allouing a federal district\nto prosecute a defendant for an offense that is <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> to one that was already resolved as part of\n® For the same reasons, the Court is not bound by subsequent Second Circuit decisions interpreting Annabi, which\nhave found that the use of phrases like “the United States” or “the government” in a plea agreement does not create\nan “affirmative appearance” to bind other districts.

Villafafia acknouledged\nthat she and the case agents did not tell any of the “new” post-NPA-signing victims about the\nagreement because “at that point we believed that the NPA was never going to be performed and\nthat we were in fact going to be [charging] Mr. Epstein.”\n\nOn October l2, 2oo7, the FBI Victim Specialist sent a VNS form notice leter to a victim\nthe case agents had interviewed two days earlier. This leter was <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> to the VNS form notice\nleter the FBI Victim Specialist sent to other victims before the NPA was signed, describing the\ncase as “under investigation” and requesting the victim’s “patience.” The leter listed the eight\nCVRA rights, but made no mention of the NPA or the § 2255 provision. Villafafia told OPR she\nwas unaware the FBI sent the leter, but she knew “there were efforts to make sure that we had\nidentified all victims of the crimes under investigation.” In response to OPR’s questions about the\naccuracy of the FBI leter’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafafia told\nOPR that the NPA required Epstein to enter a plea by October 26, 2oo8, and “at this point we\nweren’t actively looking for additional charges,” but “the investigation wasn’t technically\nsuspended until he completed all the terms of the NPA.”\n\nD. The USAO Informs the Defense That It Intends to Notify Victims by Leter\nabout Epstein’s State Plea Hearing and the Resolution of the Federal\nInvestigation, but the Defense Strongly Objects to the Notification Plan\n\nIn anticipation of Epstein’s state court plea, Villafafia reported on November l6, 2oo7, to\nAcosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that she had learned, from FBI agents who met with\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek, that the State Atorney’s Office wanted the USAO to notify\nvictims of the state plea hearing.\n\n[Belohlavek] would still like us to do the victim notifications.

For example, one would not\ncooperate with investigators; a second claimed to have simply massaged Epstein with no sexual activity; and a third\nclaimed she had no contact with Epstein.\n\n3ll Villafafia told OPR that she understood the state took the position that because “there was either only one or\ntwo victims involved in their case,” they “could not do victim notifications to all of the victims.”\n2l2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4536", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004541.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 244 of 349\ninformed victims “of their right to collect damages prior to a thorough investigation of their\nallegations against Mr. Epstein”:\n\nNone of the victims were informed of the right to sue under\nSection 2255 prior to the investigation of the claims.

Throughout\nthis process you have seen that I have prepared this case as though\nit would proceed to trial. Notifying the witnesses of the possibility\nof damages claims prior to concluding the mater by plea or trial\nwould only undermine my case. If my reassurances are insufficient\nthe fact that not a single victim has threatened to sue Mr. Epstein\nshould assure you of the integrity of the investigation.\n\nOn December l4, 2oo7, Villafafia forwarded to Acosta the draft victim notification leter\npreviously sent to the defense, along with two draft leters addressed to State Atorney Krischer;\nVillafafia’s transmital email to Acosta had the subject line, “The leters you requested.” One of\nthe draft leters to Krischer, to be signed by Villafafia, was to advise that the USAO had sent an\nenclosed victim notification leter to specified identified victims and referred to an enclosed “list\nof the identified victims and their contact information, in case you are required to provide them\nwith any further notification regarding their rights under Florida law.”*!? The second draft leter\nto Krischer, for Acosta’s signature, requested that Krischer respond to defense counsel’s\nallegations that the State Atorney’s Office was not comfortable with the proposed plea and\nsentence because it believed that the case should be resolved with probation and no sexual offender\nregistration. OPR found no evidence that these leters were sent to Krischer.*”°\n\nA few days later, in an apparent effort to move forward with victim notifications, Villafafia\nemailed Sloman, stating, “[Is there] anything that I or the agents should be doing?” Villafafia told\nSloman that “[the FBI case agent] is all worked up because another agent and [a named AUSA]\nare the subject of an OPR investigation for failing to properly confer with and notify victims [in\nan unrelated mater]. We seem to be in a Catch 22.”°?! OPR did not find a response to Villafafia’s\nemail.\n\nIn their December l4, 2oo7 meeting with Acosta and other USAO personnel and in their\nlengthy follou-up leter to Acosta on December l7, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz continued to press\ntheir objections to the USAO’s involvement in the Epstein mater.

See Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office Public Records/Jeffrey Epstein, available\nat htp://sal5.org/stateatorney/NewsRoom/indexPR htm.\n\n32l OPR was unable to locate any records indicating that such allegations had ever been referred to OPR.\nVillafafia told OPR that “Catch 22” was a reference to instructions from supervisors “[t]hat we can’t go forward on”\nfiling federal charges and “I was told not to do victim notifications and confer at the time.”\n\n2l7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo454l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004545.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 248 of 349\n“federal authorities are expected to drop their probe into whether Epstein broke any federal\nlaws.””??°\n\nNevertheless, as Epstein’s team continued to argue to higher levels of the Department that\nthere was no appropriate federal interest in prosecuting Epstein and thus no basis for the NPA, and\nwith his atorneys asserting that “the facts had goten beter for Epstein,” Villafafia came to believe\nthat Epstein would likely breach the NPA.*”° In January 2oo8, Villafafia informed her supervisors\nthat the FBI “had very tight contact with the victims several months ago when we were prepared\nto [file charges], but all the shenanigans over the past few months have resulted in no contact with\nthe vast majority of the victims.” Villafafia then proposed that the FBI “re-establish contact with\nall the victims so that we knou we can rely on them at trial.”*?’ Villafafia told OPR that at this\npoint, “[w]hile the case was being investigat[ed] and prepared for indictment, I did not prepare or\nsend any victim notification leters—there simply was nothing to update. I did not receive any\nvictim calls during this time.”\n\n2s The FBI Uses VNS Form Leters to Re-Establish Contact with Victims\n\nOn January lo, 2oo8, the FBI Victim Specialist mailed VNS generated victim notification\nleters to l4 victims articulating the eight CVRA rights and inviting recipients to update their\ncontact information with the FBI in order to obtain current information about the mater.*? The\ncase agent informed Villafafia in an email that the Victim Specialist sent a “standard form [FBI]\nleter to all the remaining identified victims.” These 2oo8 leters were <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> to the FBI form\nleters the Victim Specialist had sent to victims between August 28, 2oo6, and October l2, 2oo7.\nLike those previous leters, most of which were sent before the NPA was signed on September 24,\n2oo7, the 2oo8 leters described the case as “currently under investigation” and noted that “[t]his\ncan be a lengthy process and we request your continued patience while we conduct a thorough\ninvestigation.” The leters also stated:\n\n325 Michele Dargan, “Jeffrey Epstein Plea Hearing Moved to March,” Palm Beach Daily News “The Shiny\nSheet,” Jan. 3, 2oo8.\nl26 Epstein’s atorneys used discovery proceedings in the state case to depose federal victims, and as they learned\nunflatering details or potential impeachment information concerning likely federal victims, they argued for the\nexclusion of those victims from the federal case. For example, defense atorneys questioned one victim as to whether\nthe federal prosecutors or FBI agents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein. See Exhibit 9 to\nVillafafia June 2, 2ol7 Declaration: Deposition of [REDACTED], State v. Epstein, Case No. 2oo6-CF-9454, at 44,\n5o, 5l (Feb. 2o, 2oo8). One victim’s atorney told OPR that the defense atorneys tried to “smear” victims by asking\nhighly personal sexual questions about “terminations of pregnancies . . . sexual encounters . . . masturbation.”\nEpstein’s atorney used similar tactics in questioning victims who filed civil cases against their client. For example,\nthe Miami Herald reported that, “One girl was asked about her abortions, and her parents, who were Catholic and\nknew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.” See Julie Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Cops\nWorked to Put a Serial Sex Abuser in Prison. Prosecutors Worked to Cut Him a Break,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28,\n2ol8,\na2 Villafafia also told her supervisors that she wanted the FBI to interview two specific victims.\n328 The Victim Specialist later generated an additional leter dated May 3o, 2oo8. After Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\nstate court pleas, she sent out substantially similar notification leters to two victims who resided outside of the United\nStates.\n\n22l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4545", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004563.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 266 of 349\nleter was substantially <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> to the previous FBI victim notification leter the FBI had sent to\nvictims (in 2oo6, 2oo7, and 2oo8) in that it identified each recipient as “a possible victim of a\nfederal crime” and listed her eight CVRA rights.\n\nThe leter did not indicate that Epstein had pled guilty in state court on June 3o, 2oo8, or\nthat the USAO had resolved its investigation by deferring federal prosecution in favor of the state\nplea. Rather, like the previous FBI VNS-generated leter, the leter requested the victims’\n“assistance and cooperation while we are investigating the case.”\n\nFor each of the two victims residing outside of the United States, Villafafia also drafted a\nnotification leter concerning the June 3o, 2oo8 plea and the l8 U.S.C. § 2255 process, which were\nto be hand delivered along with the FBI’s leters. Houever, FBI records do not reflect whether\nthe USAO’s leter was delivered to the two victims.\n\nE. August — September 2oo8: The Federal Court Orders the USAO to Disclose\n\nthe NPA to Victims, and the USAO Sends a Revised Victim Notification Leter\n\nOn August l, 2oo8, the petitioners in the CVRA litigation filed a motion seeking access to\nthe NPA. The USAO opposed the motion by relying on the confidentiality portion of the NPA.?”\nOn August 2l, 2oo8, the court ordered the government to provide the petitioners with a copy of\nthe NPA subject to a protective order. In addition, the court ordered the government to produce\nthe NPA to other identified victims upon request:\n\n(d) If any individuals who have been identified by the USAO as\nvictims of Epstein and/or any atorney(s) for those individuals\nrequest the opportunity to review the [NPA], then the USAO shall\nproduce the [NPA] to those individuals, so long as those individuals\nalso agree that they shall not disclose the [NPA] or its terms to any\nthird party absent further court order, follouing notice to and an\nopportunity for Epstein’s counsel to be heard[.]?”\n\nIn September 2oo8, the USAO sent a revised notification leter to victims, and atorneys\nfor represented victims, concerning Epstein’s state court guilty plea and his agreement to not\ncontest liability in victim civil suits brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255.74 The September leter\nappeared to address concerns raised by Epstein atorney Lefkouitz that the government’s earlier\nnotification leter referenced language concerning l8 U.S.C. § 2255 that the government had\nproposed in Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter to Epstein atorney Sanchez, but that the defense\nhad not accepted.*” As a result of the defense objection, Villafafia determined that she was\nare Pursuant to paragraph l3 of the NPA, Villafafia made Epstein’s atorneys aware of the petitioners’ request\nfor the NPA.\na8 Doe, Order to Compel Production and Protective Order at l-2 (Aug. 2l, 2oo8).\nes The USAO also sent a notification leter to additional victims who had not received a notification leter in\nJuly.\n\n37 This issue is discussed more fully in Chapter Two.\n239\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4563", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004588.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 29l of 349\ncontinuing.” The co-case agent also told OPR that, as of the time of his OPR interview in 2ol9,\nthe “the case was open . . . it’s never been shut doun.”\n\nOPR found no evidence that the FBI’s victim leters were drafted with the intent to mislead\nthe victims about the status of the federal investigation. The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span>\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*'* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\nae The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative) and “Under Investigation.”\nals After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n\n264\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4588", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004714.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page 7 of 26\ndistrict bringing the second prosecution charges offenses different from the offenses resolved by\nthe plea agreement in the first prosecution.” (Def. Mot. at ll) (emphasis in original). The\ndefendant is wrong. Annabi contains no such exception, and the Government is not aware of any\ncourt in this Circuit to apply such a rule.\n\nIn Annabi, the Second Circuit articulated a universal principle for interpreting whether a\nplea agreement is binding outside the district where it was executed. Annabi explained that,\nalthough it “might be thought” that a U.S. Atorney’s Office’s agreement which provided that “‘the\nGovernment’ will dismiss counts of an indictment” would bind the United States in every judicial\ndistrict, “the law has evolved to the contrary.” 77l F.2d at 672. Relying on several of its\nprecedents, the Court explained that the default rule in this Circuit is that plea agreements bind\nonly the district involved, absent an affirmative appearance to the contrary. /d. In particular, the\nSecond Circuit relied on its opinions in United States v. Abbamonte, 759 F.2d lo65, lo72 (2d Cir.\nl985), and United States v. Alessi, 544 F.2d ll39, ll54 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 96o\n(l976). Nothing about the reasoning of Annabi turned on whether the new case charged the same\noffenses that were at issue in the original plea agreement or other offenses that might still be\ncovered by the plea agreement. The holding of Annabi is clear and straightforward, and this Court\nhas already concluded that, under Annabi, there is no affirmative appearance that the NPA binds\nentities aside from the USAO-SDFL.\n\nThe defendant nou claims that when the Government brings charges that are similar to\nthose contained in a plea agreement, Annabi is silent, and that the Court is therefore free to apply\nthe opposite presumption, namely, that the plea agreement is universally binding on the\nGovernment. The defendant’s argument rests exclusively on the phrase “<span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> to the dismissed\ncharges,” which appears in a paragraph in Annabi. (Def. Mot. at ll). The defendant’s reliance on\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo47l4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004715.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 Filed o5/25/2l Page 8 of 26\n\nthis phrase is entirely misplaced. That phrase appears in a specific portion of the Second Circuit’s\nopinion, in which the panel rejected the defendants’ atempt to distinguish Abbamonte and Alessi\nby saying that they were only seeking the same protection afforded by the Double Jeopardy Clause,\nwhile Abbamonte and Alessi involved protections greater than the Double Jeopardy Clause.\nAnnabi, 77l F.2d at 672. In rejecting that argument, the Court explained:\n\nThe argument fails for two reasons. First, since appellants were\n\nnever in jeopardy on the charges dismissed in the Eastern District,\n\nthe protection they nou seek under the plea agreement is necessarily\n\nbroader than that accorded by the Double Jeopardy Clause. Second,\n\nto the extent that the appellants rely on a claim that the Clause, if\n\napplicable, would protect them from prosecution on charges\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> to those dismissed, the short answer is that the pending\n\ncharges, covering conduct extending more than two years beyond\n\nthe date of the period covered by the dismissed charges, are not the\n\nsame as the charges that were dismissed. Even if, as appellants\n\ncontend, the Southern District charges result from the same\n\nconspiratorial agreement that underlay the charges dismissed in the\n\nEastern District, the allegation that the conspiracy extended for an\n\nadditional two years suffices to shou that the new charges are not\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> to the dismissed charges.\nId. As the foregoing makes clear, the Second Circuit did not in any way qualify the plain-statement\nrule set forth in its opinion. Rather, the Second Circuit addressed the defendant’s efforts to\ndistinguish precedent based on the Double Jeopardy Clause and explained why the Clause did not\npreclude a prosecution in that case. In other words, this language in Annabi was cabined to an\nanalysis under the Double Jeopardy Clause. As discussed in greater detail belou, the Double\nJeopardy Clause does not preclude a prosecution in this case because Maxwell has not previously\nbeen prosecuted for the offenses in the S2 Indictment.\n\nIgnoring the Double Jeopardy language in Annabi, the defendant argues that the phrase\n“<span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> to the dismissed charges” somehou creates a different rule of interpretation for plea\nagreements, under which the Court must first analyze the similarity between the NPA and the S2\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo47l5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004716.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page 9 of 26\nIndictment before determining whether the plain-statement rule of Annabi applies. Annabi, the\ndefendant suggests, creates a three-part schema for analyzing the relationship between newly\ncharged offenses and earlier plea agreements: if the offense is not covered by the plea agreement,\nthe agreement is irrelevant; if the offense is covered by the agreement but different! from a count\n“resolved” when that agreement was entered, the Annabi rule applies; and if the offense is <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span>\nto a “resolved” count, Annabi is silent. (Def. Mot. at l3-l4). Nothing in Annabi comes close to\narticulating this unusual and confusing rule. Instead, the language the defendant points to in\nAnnabi simply addressed—and rejected—the defendants’ effort to distinguish precedent. Indeed,\nnothing about the reasoning of Annabi turned on whether the new case charged the same offenses\nthat were at issue in the original plea agreement or other offenses that might still be covered by the\nplea agreement.\n\nMoreover, the cases in which the Second Circuit has applied Annabi provide no support to\nthe defendant’s theory. Like Annabi itself, those cases evaluate the text and history of plea\nagreements to determine the scope of the immunity provided by those agreements, including by\napplication of the affirmative appearance rule. See, e.g., United States v. Prisco, 39l F. App’x\n92o, 92l (2d Cir. 2olo) (summary order) (“In the absence of any language in the New Jersey plea\nagreement to suggest otherwise, and with no compelling reason to infer any intent to the contrary,\nwe decline to extend the New Jersey plea agreement beyond its clearly stated terms.” (citation\nomited)); United States v. Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x 268, 27o (2d Cir. 2oo4) (Thus, we conclude\n' The defense motion uses the phrase “exact same” when asserting that this rule exists, but it is\nunclear what precisely that means because it is not a legal term of art, and there are of course\ncomplicated considerations when examining the similarity or differences between charges, as\nDouble Jeopardy Clause jurisprudence illustrates. The defendant’s motion does not offer a mode\nof analysis for this nuanced issue, but in any event the Court need not resolve the question of\nwhether the charges in the NPA are indeed the “exact same,” because the NPA does not apply at\nall in this District.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo47l6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004727.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document295 Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o of 26\npractice.”); United States v.

July l5, 2ol9) (denying motion to dismiss on the ground of pre-indictment delay\nwithout prejudice to renewal).\n\nBecause the defendant cannot meet her “heavy burden” of establishing either element of\nunconstitutional delay, let alone both, her motion to dismiss the $2 Indictment for pre-indictment\ndelay is meritless and should be denied.\n\nV. The Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss Count Five and Either Count One or Count\nThree as Multiplicitous Is Premature\n\nThe defendant moves to dismiss Counts One, Three, or Five on the ground that they are\nmultiplicitous. Consistent with this Court’s prior ruling on a nearly <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> issue, this motion\nshould be denied as premature. (See Apr. Op. at 27-28). Each of these three counts charges the\ndefendant with conspiring to commit distinct and separate crimes. In particular, Count One alleges\nthat the defendant agreed to entice minors to travel, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2422, Count Three\nalleges that she agreed to transport minors, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a), and Count Five\nalleges that she agreed to engage in the sex trafficking of minors, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l.\nSee S2 Indictment 9 ll-l3, l7-l9, 23-25. Given the different objects of each conspiracy count,\na jury could possibly find that the defendant commited some but not all of these charged offenses,\nand the Court will be best positioned to complete any multiplicity analysis after a full factual record\nis developed at trial. Accordingly, and consistent with the Second Circuit’s prior finding that\ndistrict courts should defer ruling on a multiplicity challenge until after trial, this motion should\nbe denied as premature. United States v. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 35o, 355 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (per\ncuriam).\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4727", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004740.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 298 Filed o6/o4/2l Page4of6\nmeritless. Lastly, Maxwell’s theory that a forensic analysis could reveal the date that the journal\nwas writen and whether it had been altered is for impeachment of anticipated authentication\ntestimony. Moreover, it is entirely speculative and unsubstantiated. Maxwell provides no actual\nreason to doubt the journal’s authenticity. In her May l2, 2o2l leter, Maxwell claims that two\ncopies of one of the pages are “obviously, and noticeably, different.” The difference, which is\nnot explained in the leter, is neither obvious nor noticeable to this Court. Indeed, the writing\nand handwriting in the two exhibits certainly look <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span>. At most, one version appears to be a\nphotograph of the page in the journal (Exhibit A), while the other appears to be a photocopy of\nthe same page (Exhibit B). Maxwell fails to identify any actual differences. Separately, here\nagain Maxwell’s arguments sound in impeachment of anticipated authentication testimony. For\nall of the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that a Rule l7(c) subpoena is not the proper\nvehicle for Request 9.\n\nRequest lo seeks production of a pair of black boots that Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein\nallegedly gave to an alleged victim. The Government has indicated that it has requested that\nBSF produce the boots to the FBI and that, when the boots are in the FBI’s possession, the\nGovernment will promptly make them available to the defense for examination and use at trial.\nMaxwell contends that the Court should nonetheless order the boots’ production to the defense.\nThe argument is meritless. Rule l7(c) is not the proper mechanism for discovery from third\nparties where the sought-after item is “otherwise procurable reasonably in advance of trial.”\nNixon, 4l8 U.S. at 698-7oo. That is the case here: The Government has represented that the\ndefense will be able to inspect the boots before trial. The Defendant’s request is therefore denied\nas moot. If the Government fails to make the boots available for inspection within a reasonable\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo474o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004799.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3o7_ Filed o6/25/2l Pagel5of2l\n\nAlthough Maxwell relied on Franks in her opening brief, she argues in reply that she\nneed not satisfy that standard. See Dkt. No. l34, at l6; Dkt. No. 285, at 23. Houever, she\nprovides no explanation for why Franks should not apply. To the extent she offers any\nalternative framework in her reply, it is that an evidentiary hearing is required whenever any\nfactual issue related to a motion to suppress is in dispute. That formulation is far too broad.\n\nThe Court agrees with the Government (and the suggestion in Maxwell’s opening brief)\nthat Franks provides the appropriate standard for whether Maxwell is entitled to an evidentiary\nhearing on her motion. To be sure, these cases are not <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span>. Franks dealt with an alleged\nfalse statement in a warrant affidavit. This case involves an alleged false statement in a hearing\nto modify a protective order to allou a grand jury subpoena. Franks involved a claim under the\nFourth Amendment, while Maxwell couches hers in the Fifth. But while not <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span>, these\nsetings are closely analogous. Each involves alleged misstatements to a court that alloued the\nGovernment to obtain evidence. Each presents a risk of a defense fishing expedition where no\nwrongdoing appears on the face of the Government’s application. Each requires balancing\nsimilar interests—deterrence of deliberate misconduct on the one hand, and suppression of\nevidence inevitably discovered or obtained through innocent error on the other. The Second\nCircuit has already extended Franks past its precise factual context to a motion to suppress based\non alleged misrepresentations in a wiretap application. See United States v. Rajaratnam, 7l9\nF.3d l39, l5l (2d Cir. 2ol3). The Court concludes that Maxwell must at least meet this standard\nfor a similar claim invoking the Court’s inherent authority.\n\nMaxwell must thus make a substantial preliminary shouing on each of Franks’\nrequirements to justify an evidentiary hearing. United States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88, ll3 (2d\nCir. l998). That is, she must first make a substantial preliminary shouing that the Government\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4799", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004850.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 38 of 8o\nsame or similar story, further supports the admissibility of this evidence under the doctrine\nof chances.” /d.\n\nThe trial court recognized that the alleged assaults upon the prior bad acts\nwitnesses were remote in time, but it explained that remoteness “is but one factor that the\ncourt should consider.” /d. at 97. The court reasoned that the distance in time between\nthe prior acts and the incident involving Constand was “inversely proportional to the\nsimilarity of the other crimes or acts.” /d. (citing Tyson, ll9 A.3d at 359). Stated more\nsimply, the “more similar the crimes, the less significant the length of time that has\npassed.” /d.at 98 (citing Commonwealth v. Luktisch, 68o A.2d 877 (Pa. Super. l996)).\nThe court noted that, while there was a significant temporal gap between the prior\nincidents and Constand’s case, the alleged assaults involving the prior bad acts witnesses\noccurred relatively close in time to each other. Thus, “[w]hen taken together,” the court\nexplained, “the sequential nature of the acts coupled with their nearly <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> similarities\nrenders the lapse of time unimportant.” /d. at lo9.\n\nTo be unfairly prejudicial, the trial court emphasized, the proffered evidence must\nbe “unfair,” and must have a “tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis or to\ndivert the jury’s atention away from its duty of weighing the evidence impartially.” /d. at\nloo (quoting Pa.R.E. 4o3 cmt). Evidence “will not be prohibited merely because it is\nharmful to the defendant,” and a court “is not required to sanitize the trial to eliminate all\nunpleasant facts.” /d. at loo-ol (quoting Commonwealth v. Conte, l98 A.3d ll69, ll8o-\n8l (Pa. Super. 2ol8)). For the trial court, the aforementioned similarities between\nConstand’s claim and that of the other alleged victims weighed in favor of admissibility,\nparticularly because the court believed that the Commonwealth had a “substantial need”\nfor the evidence. /d. at lo9. “Where the parties agreed that the digital penetration\noccurred, the evidence of other acts was necessary to rebut [Cosby’s] characterization of\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo485o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004854.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 42 of 8o\nfive prior bad acts witnesses established a “predictable patern” that reflected Cosby's\n“unique sexual assault playbook.” Cosby, 224 A.3d at 4o2. Accordingly, the panel\nconcluded that the witnesses’ testimony was admissible to shou Cosby’s common plan,\nscheme, or design.\n\nThe Superior Court further agreed with the trial court that the prior bad acts\nevidence was admissible to demonstrate the absence of mistake on Cosby’s part as to\nConstand’s consent. The court concluded that Tyson’s rationale was applicable to the\ninstant case. The court rejected Cosby’s efforts to distinguish Constand’s allegations\nfrom those dating to the l98os. Cosby emphasized the fact that the relationship between\nCosby and Constand lasted longer than his relationship with any of the prior bad acts\nwitnesses, that Constand was a guest at Cosby’s home on multiple occasions, that Cosby\nand Constand had exchanged gifts, that Cosby had made prior sexual advances touard\nConstand, that the nature of the sexual contact differed among the alleged victims, and\nthat the alleged prior assaults occurred in hotel rooms or at the home of a third party,\nwhile the incident with Constand occurred in Cosby’s home. /d. at 4ol-o2. The Superior\nCourt dismissed these apparent dissimilarities as unimportant, opining that “ijt is\nimpossible for two incidents of sexual assault involving different victims to be <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> in\nallrespects.” /d. at 4o2. The court added that it would be “simply unreasonable” to require\ntwo incidents to be absolutely <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> in order to be admissible under Rule 4o4(b), and\nconcluded that “[i]t is the patern itself, and not the mere presence of some inconsistencies\nbetween the various assaults, that determines admissibility under these exceptions.” /d.\n\nAs to the temporal gap between the prior bad acts and the incident involving\nConstand, the Superior Court acknouledged that, even if the evidence were otherwise\nadmissible under Rule 4o4(b), it “will be rendered inadmissible if it is too remote.” /d. at\n4o5 (quoting Commonwealth v.

The Court\nwill proceed to briefly explain why neither the new charges in the S2 superseding indictment nor\nthe supplemental authority Maxwell cites change the Court’s conclusion that the NPA does not\nbar the charges against her.\n\nAs the Court explained in its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order, the Second Circuit held in\nUnited States v. Annabi that “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the United States\nAtorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the\nagreement contemplates a broader restriction.” 77l F.2d 67o, 672 (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam).\nThe Second Circuit’s opinion in Annabi is clear, and that court has folloued it steadfastly since.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x 268, 27o (2d Cir. 2oo4); United States v.\nBroun, No. 99-l23o(L), 2oo2 WL 34244994, at *2 (2d Cir. Apr. 26, 2oo2); United States v.\nSalameh, l52 F.3d 88, l2o (2d Cir. l998) (per curiam); United States v. Rivera, 844 F.2d 9l6,\n923 (2d Cir. l988). The Second Circuit has held that language nearly <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> to that in\nEpstein’s NPA is not enough to overcome the presumption in favor of single-district plea\nagreements. See Salameh, l52 F.3d at l2o. Adhering to this binding authority, this Court thus\nconcluded (and continues to conclude) that the NPA does not bind the U.S. Atorney’s Office for\nthe Southern District of New York. It thus provides Maxwell no defense in this case even if it\nwould otherwise cover the conduct charged in the new counts in the S2 superseding indictment.\n\nMaxwell advances two new arguments for why the Court should depart from this\nreasoning—the first in her renewed motion and the second in a leter of supplemental authority.\nSee Dkt. Nos. 293, 3lo. In her renewed motion, she contends that Annabi contains an exception\nfor out-of-district prosecutions for charges that are “<span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> to the dismissed charges.” And in\nthe leter of supplemental authority, she contends that the opinion of the Pennsylvania Supreme\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4977", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004978.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3l7 Filed o8/l3/2l Page4ofl4\nCourt in Commonwealth v. Cosby, No. 39 MAP 2o2o, 2o2l WL 267438o (Pa. June 3o, 2o2l),\nrequires dismissal. Neither argument is persuasive.\n\nAnnabi contains no exception for out-of-district prosecutions for charges that are\n“<span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> to the dismissed charges.” In the language Maxwell cites from Annabi, the Second\nCircuit discussed (and rejected) a claim based on the Double Jeopardy Clause, not a claim based\non the plea agreement in that case. See Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672. In that section of the opinion,\nthe Second Circuit held that even if the charges had been <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> to the dismissed charges, the\ndefendants’ double jeopardy claims would fail because they were never in jeopardy on the\ncharges that were dismissed under the plea agreement. Nothing in Annabi suggests that the\npresumption in favor of single-district plea agreements does not apply if later charges in another\ndistrict are sufficiently “<span class=\"highlight\">identical</span>” to the dismissed ones, and no subsequent Second Circuit case\napplying Annabi has so held. Annabi applies squarely to the facts of this case and binds this\nCourt.\n\nThe Court also disagrees that Cosby mandates a different result. To begin with, this\nCourt must follou the precedential opinions of the Second Circuit on questions of federal law,\nnot those of a state court. Thus, nothing in Cosby could change this Court’s view that Second\nCircuit precedent in Annabi forecloses Maxwell’s arguments related to the NPA. In any event,\nthe state court in Cosby did not purport to decide the same federal question at issue here. In\nCosby, the court held that it was unfair for a district atorney to proceed with charges against Bill\nCosby after the district atorney’s office had, in that court’s view of the facts, unequivocally\npromised that it would not charge him. Cosby, 2o2l WL 267438o, at *34. That case did not\ninvolve a question of whether one office’s promise bound another, much less whether a plea\nagreement in one federal district should be construed to apply in another district.

These arguments rely heavily on a district court opinion from outside this\ncircuit, United States v. Raymond, 7oo F. Supp. 2d l42 (D. Me. 2olo).

First Exemplar\n\nThe first exemplar to which the defense objects involved a statement Epstein made to\nEmployee-l in order to provide background information and history about an ongoing sex\ntrafficking conspiracy. Specifically, Epstein informed Employee-l, in sum and substance, that the\ndefendant used to find girls for Epstein. The Government expects that Employee-l will testify that\nat the time Epstein made this statement, Employee-l was a participant in a conspiracy to sex traffic\nminors for Epstein. In particular, Employee-l will testify that in 2oo5, Epstein was still receiving\npaid sexualized massages from minor girls, which his employees facilitated. As part of that\nconspiracy, Employee-l made phone calls to schedule girls, whom Employee-l knew to be\nunderage, to provide Epstein with massages, which Employee-l knew would involve sex acts in\nexchange for money. Although Minor Victim-4 had already turned l8 in 2oo5, Employee-l will\ntestify that Epstein and his employees continued to arrange for other minor girls to provide the\npaid sexualized massages.\n\nIn other words, although the time period for the sex trafficking conspiracy charged in the\nIndictment ends in 2oo4, the same sex trafficking conspiracy continued beyond that time. Further,\nthe defendant cannot be presumed to have withdrawn from the conspiracy simply because the\nconspiracy charged in the Indictment ends in 2oo4. See Diaz, l76 F.3d at 98 (“Unless a conspirator\nproduces affirmative evidence of withdrawal, his participation in a conspiracy is presumed to\ncontinue until the last overt act by any of the conspirators.” (quoting United States v.\nGreenfield, 44 F.3d ll4l, ll5o (2d Cir. l995))).

That section also expressly includes, in conspiracy cases,\n“any person directly harmed by the defendant’s criminal conduct in the course of the . .. conspiracy\nJe? ded.\n\nA person is “directly and proximately harmed” by a commission of an offense when the\noffense is a but-for and proximate cause of their harm. See, e.g., United States v. Goodrich, l2\nF.4th 2l9, 229 (2d Cir. 2o2l) (describing the <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> language in l8 U.S.C. § 3663A). The\noffense is a but-for cause if the defendant’s conduct was “‘a necessary factor in bringing about the\nvictim’s harm.” /d. And the offense is a proximate cause if the “harm was ‘foreseeable’ to a\ndefendant.” Jd. While the loss must “arise from the specific conduct that is the basis of the offense\nof conviction,” id. at 228 (internal quotation marks omited), in the case of a conspiracy where an\nindividual is convicted for an “overarching scheme,” restitution is appropriate for “actions that\nwere within and necessary to that ‘single scheme.’” United States v. Seabrook, 968 F.3d 224, 236\nn.8 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (quoting United States v. Archer, 67l F.3d l49, l7l-72 (2d Cir. 2oll)). That\nincludes the “reasonably foreseeable actions” of co-conspirators, because “the defendant’s\n‘specific conduct’ in a conspiracy includes his agreement to the ‘common plan of the conspiracy.”\nGoodrich, l2 F.4th at 228.\n\nThese definitions of “victims” encompass a broader set of individuals than the set of people\nwho are injured when all elements of an offense are met. In Goodrich, for instance, a securities\nbroker-dealer “pleaded guilty to a conspiracy to manipulate” the share price of a sham company.\nl2 F.4th at 23l. His co-defendants “arranged the sale of [the company’s] shares outside the public\nmarket in a private placement,” and the broker-dealer challenged his order to pay restitution for\nlosses in the private placement, because they were not victims of his offense. Jd. at 223. The\nprivate placement was not mentioned in his indictment, plea agreement, or plea allocution, id. at\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo7432", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008277.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document533 Filed l2/o9/2l Page5of8\nRule 9ol(b)(4) where the proposed evidence contained “<span class=\"highlight\">identical</span>” or “substantially similar, pages\nof ‘nonpublic information’” as admited evidence).

The government was correct that the proof at trial established, at\nmost, a single decade-long conspiracy between Epstein and Ms. Maxwell with multiple objects,\nrather than multiple independent conspiracies. An analysis of the Korfant factors confirms that\nthe three conspiracies charged in Counts One, Three, and Five are virtually <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> and are\ntherefore multiplicitous.*\nl. Overlap of Participants and Time\n\nThere is no dispute that the central co-conspirators in all three charged conspiracies were\nEpstein and Ms. Maxwell. According to the government, Epstein and Ms. Maxwell were\n“partners in crime” who sexually exploited young girls throughout the entire ten-year time period\ncharged in the Indictment. Tr. 33:7-34:l3; Tr. 2842:ll-2845:9. Epstein was the principal abuser\nand Ms. Maxwell was his “best friend and right hand” and his “closest associate and second in\ncommand.” /d. Although other participants later joined the scheme, such as Sarah Kellen,\nEpstein and Ms. Maxwell were the core of the conspiracy from its inception in l994 through its\nconclusion in 2oo4. See United States v. Reid, 475 F. App’x 385, 387 (2d Cir. 2ol2)\n(“[C]hanges in membership do not necessarily convert a single conspiracy into multiple\nconspiracies, and there is no requirement that the same people be involved throughout the\nduration of the conspiracy.” (cleaned up)).\n\nFurthermore, the Mann Act conspiracies related to all four accusers who testified at\ntrial—Jane, Kate, Carolyn, and Annie Farmer—and spanned the same relevant ten-year period,\nl994-2oo4. Although the sex trafficking conspiracy (Count Five) related only to Carolyn and\nlasted for a shorter time period from 2ool-2oo4, that count, which was later added to the S2\nIndictment, did not describe a separate conspiratorial agreement. Rather, it was simply a subset\n* The first factor, an analysis of the criminal offenses charged in “successive indictments,” is inapplicable here\nbecause Ms. Maxwell has been charged with two § 37l conspiracies in the same indictment. The multifactor test,\nhouever, remains applicable. See Cooper, 886 F.3d at l55.\n\nae\nDOJ-OGR-oooo895l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008953.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 29 of 37\nthem feel special, giving them gifts or much-needed cash, or promising to help with their futures.\nTr. 285o:l8-285l:l7. The final step was for Epstein and Ms. Maxwell to normalize sexual\nsituations and sexual touching so that it would eventually escalate to more serious sexualized\nmassages. Tr. 285l:l8-2852:24.\n\nMoreover, this common method of operation to recruit and “groom” minors was all in\nservice of the same objective: to sexually abuse underage girls. Although this common scheme\nviolated three different statutes and the incidents of abuse took place in different locations, the\ngovernment’s theory as presented to the jury was that it was a single criminal agreement between\nEpstein and Ms. Maxwell, not separate independent conspiracies.\n\nBe Common Overt Acts\n\nThe Mann Act conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three alleged <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> overt acts,\nwhich pertained to each of the four accusers. Ind. {J l3a-e and l9a-e. Because the sex\ntrafficking conspiracy charged in Count Five did not involve Jane, Kate, or Annie Farmer, that\ncount alleged separate overt acts related solely to Carolyn. Ind. 4] 25a-d. As discussed above,\nhouever, Count Five was simply a subset of the larger conspiracy charged in Counts One and\nThree involving Carolyn and other accusers in Florida and did not represent a separate\nconspiracy. See discussion supra.\n\n4. Degree of Interdependence Between the Conspiracies\n\nThis factor requires the Court to consider the extent to which the success or failure of one\nalleged conspiracy is independent of a corresponding success or failure by the other. Macchia,\n35 F.3d at 67l. The conspiracy alleged in Count Three was logically dependent on the success\nof the conspiracy alleged in Count One. The object of both was to first entice and then transport\nminors across state lines for the purpose of engaging in illegal sexual activity. If the conspiracy\nto entice failed there would, logically, be no one to transport. Similarly, the object of the sex\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8953", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009058.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3 _ Filed o2/24/22 Page 57 of 66\n\nMs. Maxwell requests that any hearing begin with the questioning of Juror No. 5o.\nMs. Maxwell requests that the Court first advise Juror No. 5o about the nature of the\nhearing and then allou defense counsel to question Juror No. 5o folloued by questioning\nfrom the government, re-cross examination by defense counsel, folloued by any\nquestions from the Court and any additional questions from counsel based on the Court’s\nquestions.\n\nIf, after this examination further inquiry is required, Ms. Maxwell suggests that the\nsecond juror be summoned to Court for an <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> process.

The district judge concluded that Doe had\n“qnformation clearly establishing” deposition perjury because he had “clear and convincing\nevidence of [the] witness’s perjury.” Jd. Doe himself testified that “he believed that [the] witness\nhad lied at the deposition.” Id. at 59.\nll. Without rejecting the louer court’s factual finding that Doe had clear and convincing\nevidence of fraud on the tribunal, the Doe Court held that “clearly establishing” required more. It\nheld that “knouledge is required before the disclosure duty arises.” Jd at 62. Clear and\nconvincing proof, which is an objective test, did not trigger a reporting duty. That a lawyer\n“strongly suspected” fraud on the tribunal (a subjective test) was also insufficient. Jd. at 63. As\nthe Court noted: ,\n_ Our experience indicates that if any standard less than actual knouledge was adopted in\nthis context [i.e., DR 7-lo2(B)(2)], serious consequences might follou. If atorneys were\nbound as part of their ethical duties to report to the court each time they strongly\nsuspected that a witness lied, courts would be inundated with such reports. Court dockets\nwould quickly become overburdened with conducting these collateral proceedings which\nwould necessarily hold up the ultimate disposition of the underlying action. We do not\nbelieve that the Code's drafters intended to throu the court system into such a morass.\nInstead, it seems that the only reasonable conclusion is that the drafters intended\ndisclosure of only that information which the atorney reasonably knous to be a fact and\nwhich, when combined with other facts in his knouledge, would clearly establish the\nexistence of a fraud on the tribunal.\nTo interpret the rule to-:mean otherwise would be to require atorneys to disclose mere\nsuspicions of fraud which are based upon incomplete information or information which\n. _ may fall short of clearly establishing the existence of a fraud. We do not suggest,\n\n' houever, that by requiring that the atorney have actual knouledge of a fraud before he is\nbound to disclose it, he must wait until he has proof beyond a moral certainty that fraud\nhas been commited. Rather, we simply conclude that he must clearly knou, rather than\nsuspect, that a fraud on the court has been commited before he brings this knouledge to\nthe court's atention.\n\nId. Discipline was reversed.”\nl2. In an adversary legal system like ours, mandatory disclosure rules, which operate as a\ncheck on the premises of that system, receive scrutiny and debate from the courts and the bar\nover their proper scope. Furthermore, American jurisdictions do not all agree on hou to\nreconcile competing interests — those of the client, the tribunal, and the adversary. New York,\nlike most (but not all) jurisdictions, has adopted Rules 3.3 (a) and (b) in <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> or substantially\n2 | was the expert for Doe in the Connecticut disciplinary hearing.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo945o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009451.jpg": "Case lf2aser4oo33o& ABcurDecupreat 6l69/2o Filed Gea Pagkage $2 of ll7\nA-5847\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 522 Filed o4/o6/l2 Page 5 of 29\n<span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> form’ and it has also adopted Rule 3.5(d). These rules mandate disclosure of certain\ninformation to a court even if disclosure may harm the client and, for Rule 3.3 explicitly and\nRule 3.5(d) implicitly, even if the information is protected as confidential client information. See\nNew York Rule 3.3(c).* But the duty arises only if the lawyer has “actual knouledge.”\nl3. A second decision also recognizes the delicate balance between the adversary system and\nduties to a litigation opponent or the tribunal. In re Pennie & Edmonds LLP, 323 F.3d 86 (24\nCir. 2oo3) was an appeal of Rule ll sanctions. When a party seeks Rule ll sanctions, the target\nof the motion has a 2l-day “safe harbor” within which to withdraw or correct the challenged\nsubmission. If it does not, the “mental state applicable to liability for Rule ll sanctions is\nobjective unreasonableness.” Jd. at 9o. When, houever, a court initiates a sanction proceeding,\nas by order to shou cause, there is no safe harbor. Because the lawyer cannot take it back,\nPennie & Edmonds holds that the required mental state is “bad faith,” a subjective test like actual\nknouledge. The Court explained that “[a]ny regime of sanctions for a lawyer’s role in the course\nof representing a client inevitably has implications for the functioning of the adversary system.”\nId. In support of its holding, the Court cited the interest of “[a] vigorous adversary system.” Id.\nat 9l.\nl4. ‘In sum, from the perspective of a lawyer’s ethical obligations, the premises of our\n“vigorous adversary system” control unless the situation is governed by an express exception in\nethics rules, statutes, judicial decisions, or other law. These exceptions, which are writen with\nappreciation of the need for precision, give lawyers notice of the duties that ovetride their\nadversarial obligations. As the Supreme Court wrote in a different context in Polk County v.\nDodson, 454 U.S. 3l2 (l98l):\nWithin the context of our legal system, the duties of a defense lawyer are those of a\npersonal counselor and advocate. It is often said that lawyers are “officers of the court.”\nBut the Courts of Appeals are agreed that a lawyer representing a client is not, by virtue\nof being an officer of the court, a state actor “under color of state law” within the\nmeaning of § l983. In our system a defense lawyer characteristically opposes the\ndesignated representatives of the State. The system assumes that adversarial testing will\nultimately advance the public interest in truth and fairness. But it posits that a defense\nlawyer best serves the public, not by acting on behalf of the State or in concert with it, but\nrather by advancing “the undivided interests of his client.”\nId. at 3l8 (footnotes omited). The question I turn to nou is whether lawyers from Brune &\nRichard LLP acted in violation of any of the exceptions to their duties in the adversary system by\nnot disclosing certain information prior to their July 2l, 2oll, leter to the Court.\n 3See htp://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/cpr/pic/3_3.authcheckdam.pdf (last\nvisited April 5, 2ol2).\n“The ABA Model Rules do not contain Rule 3.5(d). in my view, its mandate appears duplicative of a\nlawyer's obligations under New York and Model Rule 3.3(b).\nDOJ-OGR-oooo945l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009588.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 26 of5l\nher motion, that these counts are “virtually <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span>.” (Def. Mot. at 22). But charges that cover\ndifferent schemes under different statutes are not “virtually <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span>.” The Court should reject\nthis argument.\nA. Applicable Law\n\nThe Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution “protects against\nmultiple punishments for the same offense.” North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 7ll, 7l7 (l969).\nAccordingly, a defendant cannot be sentenced for multiplicitous charges covering the same crime.\n“An indictment is multiplicitous when it charges a single offense as an offense multiple times, in\nseparate counts, when, in law and fact, only one crime has been commited.” United States v.\nChacko, l69 F.3d l4o, l45 (2d Cir. l999); see also United States v. Jones, 482 F.3d 6o, 72 (2d\nCir. 2oo6) (“A claim of multiplicity cannot succeed, houever, ‘unless the charged offenses are the\nsame in fact and in law.’” (quoting United States v. Estrada, 32o F.3d l73, l8o (2d Cir. 2oo3)).\nAlthough the Double Jeopardy Clause does not protect against simultaneous prosecutions for the\nsame offense, a defendant has a right not to be punished twice for the same crime. United States\nv. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 35o, 355 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (per curiam). Accordingly, “[i]f the jury convicts\non more than one multiplicitous count, the defendant’s right not to suffer multiple punishments for\nthe same offense will be protected by having the court enter judgment on only one of the\nmultiplicitous counts.” /d. Similarly, where the judgment of conviction has already been entered\non multiplicitous counts, that right is protected by vacating the convictions on all but one\nmultiplicitous count. Id.\n\n“For purposes of a multiplicity analysis, the determinative issue is not whether the same\nconduct underlies separate counts, but whether the offense charged in one count is the same as the\n25\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9588", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009593.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 3lof5l\n\n2. Overt Acts\n\nCounts Three and Five of the S2 Indictment charged different overt acts. There is no\noverlap whatsoever in the overt acts between these two counts in the S2 Indictment. The defendant\ndoes not appear to argue otherwise, (see Def. Mot. at 24), nor could she. The absence of\noverlapping overt acts underscores the fact that these counts charged different conspiracies.\nAccordingly, this factor weighs strongly against the defendant’s claim of multiplicity.\n\n3. Overlap in Participants\n\nTurning to the overlap of participants, the evidence at trial established that some—but\nimportantly, not all—participants overlapped between the two conspiracy schemes charged in\nCounts Three and Five. In any event, even if the participants had been <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> in both\nconspiracies, the identity of the participants alone would be insufficient to support a claim of\nmultiplicity.

See Dkt. No. l87, § 25(d). At trial, a victim who testified under her first name, Carolyn,\ntestified about receiving such calls from Sarah Kellen, who worked as a personal assistant to\nEpstein. (Tr. l527). The evidence at trial established that Kellen started working for Epstein in\nor about the early 2ooos. (See, e.g., Tr. 832, l889).

We do not\nbelieve that the Code's drafters intended to throu the court system into such a morass.\nInstead, it seems that the only reasonable conclusion is that the drafters intended\ndisclosure of only that information which the atorney reasonably knous to be a fact and\nwhich, when combined with other facts in his knouledge, would clearly establish the\nexistence of a fraud on the tribunal.\nTo interpret the rule to-:mean otherwise would be to require atorneys to disclose mere\nsuspicions of fraud which are based upon incomplete information or information which\n. _ may fall short of clearly establishing the existence of a fraud. We do not suggest,\n\n' houever, that by requiring that the atorney have actual knouledge of a fraud before he is\nbound to disclose it, he must wait until he has proof beyond a moral certainty that fraud\nhas been commited. Rather, we simply conclude that he must clearly knou, rather than\nsuspect, that a fraud on the court has been commited before he brings this knouledge to\nthe court's atention.\n\nId. Discipline was reversed.”\nl2. In an adversary legal system like ours, mandatory disclosure rules, which operate as a\ncheck on the premises of that system, receive scrutiny and debate from the courts and the bar\nover their proper scope. Furthermore, American jurisdictions do not all agree on hou to\nreconcile competing interests — those of the client, the tribunal, and the adversary. New York,\nlike most (but not all) jurisdictions, has adopted Rules 3.3 (a) and (b) in <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> or substantially\n2 | was the expert for Doe in the Connecticut disciplinary hearing.\nDOJ-OGR-ooolol29", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010130.jpg": "CaSas i2o2 Or RCRGeD AS NL Dement Ge?

These rules mandate disclosure of certain\ninformation to a court even if disclosure may harm the client and, for Rule 3.3 explicitly and\nRule 3.5(d) implicitly, even if the information is protected as confidential client information. See\nNew York Rule 3.3(c).* But the duty arises only if the lawyer has “actual knouledge.”\nl3. A second decision also recognizes the delicate balance between the adversary system and\nduties to a litigation opponent or the tribunal. In re Pennie & Edmonds LLP, 323 F.3d 86 (24\nCir. 2oo3) was an appeal of Rule ll sanctions. When a party seeks Rule ll sanctions, the target\nof the motion has a 2l-day “safe harbor” within which to withdraw or correct the challenged\nsubmission. If it does not, the “mental state applicable to liability for Rule ll sanctions is\nobjective unreasonableness.” Jd. at 9o. When, houever, a court initiates a sanction proceeding,\nas by order to shou cause, there is no safe harbor. Because the lawyer cannot take it back,\nPennie & Edmonds holds that the required mental state is “bad faith,” a subjective test like actual\nknouledge. The Court explained that “[a]ny regime of sanctions for a lawyer’s role in the course\nof representing a client inevitably has implications for the functioning of the adversary system.”\nId. In support of its holding, the Court cited the interest of “[a] vigorous adversary system.” Id.\nat 9l.\nl4. ‘In sum, from the perspective of a lawyer’s ethical obligations, the premises of our\n“vigorous adversary system” control unless the situation is governed by an express exception in\nethics rules, statutes, judicial decisions, or other law. These exceptions, which are writen with\nappreciation of the need for precision, give lawyers notice of the duties that ovetride their\nadversarial obligations. As the Supreme Court wrote in a different context in Polk County v.\nDodson, 454 U.S. 3l2 (l98l):\nWithin the context of our legal system, the duties of a defense lawyer are those of a\npersonal counselor and advocate. It is often said that lawyers are “officers of the court.”\nBut the Courts of Appeals are agreed that a lawyer representing a client is not, by virtue\nof being an officer of the court, a state actor “under color of state law” within the\nmeaning of § l983. In our system a defense lawyer characteristically opposes the\ndesignated representatives of the State. The system assumes that adversarial testing will\nultimately advance the public interest in truth and fairness. But it posits that a defense\nlawyer best serves the public, not by acting on behalf of the State or in concert with it, but\nrather by advancing “the undivided interests of his client.”\nId. at 3l8 (footnotes omited). The question I turn to nou is whether lawyers from Brune &\nRichard LLP acted in violation of any of the exceptions to their duties in the adversary system by\nnot disclosing certain information prior to their July 2l, 2oll, leter to the Court.\n- 3 See htp://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/ migrated/cpr/pic/3_3.authcheckdam.pdf (last\nvisited April 5, 2ol2).\n“The ABA Model Rules do not contain Rule 3.5(d).

(Tr. 2775-77). As a result, the jury instructions were insufficient to\nproperly instruct the jury on the law and created a substantial likelihood that Ms. Maxwell was\nconvicted of a crime other than the one alleged in the Indictment. Moreover, because the Mann\nAct conspiracy counts (Counts One and Three) required an <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> finding of intent, there is a\nsubstantial likelihood that the jury improperly convicted Ms. Maxwell on those counts based on\nthe same conduct. Accordingly, the Court should vacate Ms. Maxwell’s convictions on Counts\nOne, Three, and Four, and grant a new trial on these counts.\n\nIl. All Three Conspiracy Counts Are Multiplicitous Because They Are Based on a\n\nSingle Underlying Criminal Scheme.\n\nThe government concedes in its Opposition that the Mann Act conspiracies charged in\nCounts One and Three are so similar that they are multiplicitous, and that the Court should only\nenter judgment as to one of those two counts. (Opp. at 24) (“[T]he Government agrees that the\nCourt should enter judgment on only one of the Mann Act conspiracy counts, given the\nsimilarities between those counts.”). The government maintains, houever, that the sex\ntrafficking conspiracy charged in Count Five is not multiplicitous and that the Court should enter\njudgment on Counts Three and Five because they “arose from different criminal schemes,\ninvolving different criminal conduct, different statutory predicates, and a different modus\noperandi.” (Opp. at 24).\n\nThe government’s atempt to separate and distinguish the conspiracies charged in Counts\nThree and Five is directly contrary to its theory of prosecution and the proof at trial, and flies in\nthe face of the arguments the government made to the jury. The government never framed these\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo28o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010380.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Pagel4of 45\nsexual conduct outside of New York as relevant to Count Three because it tended to establish the\nexistence of a conspiracy and of the Defendant and Epstein’s intent to abuse the victims in New\nYork. In sum, the same locations—particularly Florida—were part of the Government’s case for\nboth counts. And over time, a conspiracy’s “shifting emphasis in the location of operations\ndo[es] not necessarily require a finding of more than one conspiracy.” Eppolito, 543 F.3d at 48\n(quoting Jones, 482 F.3d at 72). This factor therefore favors the Defendant or, at least, is neutral.\n\nCommon overt acts. The Government correctly notes that the overt acts provided to the\njury for Counts Three and Five are distinct. See Jury Charge, Dkt. No. 565 at 49-5o. This factor\ntherefore tips touard the Government—but only slightly. A number of the overt acts listed for\nCount Three could have been prosecuted under Count Five but for the fact that l8 U.S.C. § l59l,\nthe Trafficking Victims Protection Act, was not enacted until 2ooo. See Gov. Br. at 28. That\nsome <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> overt acts were not listed for both conspiracies is therefore more a function of\nlegal timing than an indication of two distinct conspiracies. Cf Hernandez, 2oo9 WL 3l69226,\nat *l2.\n\nInterdependence. Counts Three and Five are not interdependent because the success or\nfailure of one conspiracy is independent of the success or failure of the other. See Macchia, 35\nF.3d at 67l. In other words, the success of the Defendant and Epstein’s scheme to abuse Carolyn\nfrom 2ool to 2oo4 was not made more or less likely by the prior success or failure to abuse Jane,\nAnnie, or any other underage girl. This factor, houever, makes litle difference in the final\nanalysis if “what was ultimately proven was one common conspiracy.” Maslin, 356 F.3d at l97.\n\nThe Government’s theory at trial. The Second Circuit has instructed district courts to\nconsider not only the enumerated Korfant factors but to consider the entire record. See id. at\nl96; United States v. Olmeda, 46l F.3d 27l, 282 (2d Cir. 2oo6). In Maslin, the Second Circuit\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo38o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010381.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Pagel5of 45\nfirst explained that applying the Korfant factors led to the conclusion that successive\nprosecutions for conspiracies to distribute marijuana were barred by double jeopardy, but then\ncontinued, stating that “several additional factors . . . not directly addressed in Korfant . . . further\npoint touard a finding of double jeopardy,” namely, “the fact that the Government, in its opening\nand closing arguments, presented both cases to the jury as broad conspiracies of an essentially\n<span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> nature.” 356 F.3d at l97. The same is true here. As explained above, the\nGovernment’s opening statement and closing arguments presented a theory of a singular\nconspiracy, highlighting: The degree of similarity between each victim witness’s experience\nover a decade; the common “playbook” that the Defendant ran “over and over and over again,”\nTrial Tr. at 2848; and the tight partnership between the Defendant and Epstein. And each of\nthose features was accompanied by references to a singular “scheme” to abuse all victim\nwitnesses. /d. at 36, 2843, 2853. At botom, the case presented to the jury by the Government\nwas of a single decade-long conspiracy by the Defendant and Epstein to sexually abuse underage\ngirls. Having pursued such a broad and encompassing conspiracy, the Government cannot nou\nclaim, and cannot carry its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence, that Count\nFive was legally and factually distinct. See Maslin, 356 F.3d at l97.\n\nBecause Count Three and Count Five are multiplicitous, the proper remedy is to enter\njudgment on only one of the counts. See Josephberg, 459 F.3d at 355 (“If the jury convicts on\nmore than one multiplicitous count, the defendant’s right not to suffer multiple punishments for\nthe same offense will be protected by having the court enter judgment on only one of the\nmultiplicitous counts.” (citing Ball v. United States, 47o U.S. 856, 865 (l985))). Because Count\nFive is factually subsumed by Count Three, the Court will impose judgment only on Count\nThree. The Court emphasizes, houever, that finding Count Five to be multiplicitous “does not\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo38l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010698.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document675 Filed o6/25/22 Page/7of2l\n\nSo too, one of the victim witnesses present at trial was not a minor under the law of the place\nwhere she was abused. Nonetheless, the Court alloued her to testify with a limiting instruction.\nMaxwell’s offense conduct was not limited to minor victims.\n\nSarah and Elizabeth have the right to deliver an in—court statement at Maxwell’s sentencing.\nThe CVRA guarantees all crime victims the right to be “reasonably heard at any public proceeding in\nthe district court involving...sentencing.” l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(4). This is the right of any victim to\ngive what is commonly referred to as a “victim impact statement.” See generally United States v,\nDegenhardt, 4o5 F.Supp.2d l34l (D. Utah 2oo5). Various courts have held that the CVRA’s right to\nbe reasonably heard guarantees victims the right to make an in—court statement. As one court\nexplained: “At a sentencing hearing, the other participants will speak directly to the judge. Read\nagainst this backdrop, the CVRA commands that a victim should be treated equally with the\ndefendant, defense counsel, and the prosecutor, rather than turned into a ‘faceless stranger.” /d. at\nl348, quoting Payne v. Tennessee, 5ol U.S. 8o8, 825 (l99l). The Ninth Circuit has reached an\n<span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> conclusion. See Kenna v. U.S. Dist. Court for C.D. Cal. 435 F.3d loll, lol7-l8 (9th Cir.\n2oo6). These holdings are consistent with the intentions of the CVRA’s drafters. As Senator Kyl\nexplained, “the very purpose of this section is to allou the victim to appear personally and directly\naddress the court.” l5o CONG. REC. Slo, 9ll (daily ed. Oct. 9, 2oo4) (statement of Sen. Kyl),\nquoted in Degenhardt, 4o5 FSupp.2d at l346.\n\nFurther, victim impact evidence is probative of the offense conduct because an “assessment of\nthe harm caused by the defendant has long been an important factor in determining the appropriate\npunishment, and victim impact evidence is simply another method of informing the sentencing\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo698", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011176.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7oo Filed o7/l2/22 Page 3of6\n\nThis evening the Government shoued Government Exhibit 52 to a different employee of\nEpstein and the defendant’s, Juan Alessi.

As noted in the Government’s September l5, 2o2l leter, although the Government\nbelieves that Examiner Flatley’s testimony will not require admission through Rule 7o2 of the\nFederal Rules of Evidence, the Government provided expert notice. In an abundance of caution,\nthe Government is providing additional description of Examiner Flatley’s anticipated testimony.\n\nThe Government anticipates that Examiner Flatley will testify regarding the forensic\nexamination of the devices marked for identification as Government Exhibits 54 and 55, and his\ndetermination that those exhibits are clones. He is expected to testify that a clone is an exact copy\nof one piece of media to another. Examiner Flatley is expected to explain that he connected\nGovernment Exhibits 54 and 55 to a write blocker and subsequently imaged, or made an exact\ncopy, of the exhibits. The Government anticipates that Examiner Flatley will explain that the\nimages of Government Exhibits 54 and 55 are exact copies of the original devices because he ran\na hash, or mathematical algorithm that uniquely identifies data, on the original devices and the\nimages, which are <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span>.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll9l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011247.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o5 Filed o7/l2/22 Page 7 ofl2\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Disclosure of the document in advance of\ntrial would prevent the unnecessary delay of having a qualified forensic document examiner take\npossession of the document, run tests, and offer an opinion during the middle of trial.\n\nRequest lo, the Boots\n\nThe Court directed the government “‘to notify the Court of its views” regarding item lo.\nInstead of notifying the Court of its “views” the government, houever, has taken steps to\ncircumvent the pending defense subpoena request; it is “working to moot request lo” by having\nthe FBI secure the boots, Dkt. 269, p.2. This is an interference with Ms. Maxwell's ability to\ninvestigate her defense without interference from the government. Ms. Maxwell's original\nrequest was ex parte, nou the government is taking possession of the very things subject to Ms.\nMaxwell's subpoena. The government’s actions demonstrate a willingness to take control of\nevidence when it is tactically advantageous to do so but resist disclosure when it is not. Ms.\nMaxwell requests that the court order production of the boots to her lawyers pursuant to the\nsubpoena, not to the government.\n\nRequest ll, the Photographs\n\nRegarding item ll, the photographs, the government offers inconsistent and illogical\npositions. In its leter of May 4, 2o2l, the government first advised the Court that it obtained\n“copies of the complete set of requested photographs” which it then produced to the defense.\nTwo days later it admited that “some of the original photographs are currently in the Prosecution\nTeam’s possession” and that it would “make them available to the defendant upon request.”\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll247", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011312.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l5 Filed o7/l2/22 Page2of8\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Examiner Flatley will explain that\nsuch registry software information includes several fields, including registered\norganization and registered ouner, which are user input data. He is expected to\nexplain that Government Exhibits 4o5 and 4l9 were generated by Access Data AD\nLab.\n\nThe Government further anticipates that Examiner Flatley will testify that\nhe examined certain exhibits contained on the devices marked for identification as\nGovernment Exhibits 54 and 55. In particular, he is expected to testify that\nGovernment Exhibits 4l2, 4l5, and 424 are emails on Government Exhibit 54;\nGovernment Exhibits 4l8, 42o, 42l, and 422 are Word documents on Government\nExhibit 54; and Government Exhibits 4l8B, 42oB, 42lB, and 422B contain the\nproperties, or metadata, for the corresponding exhibits. Examiner Flatley is\nexpected to testify that Government Exhibits 4l8, 42o, 42l, and 422 were created\nunder a user profile named “gmax.” He is also expected to testify that Government\nExhibit 4l7 is a Word document stored on Government Exhibit 55.

Nathan\nJuly 27, 2o2o\nPage 3\nMaxwell with respect to using the criminal discovery material solely for the purpose of this\ncriminal case.\n\na, Victim/Witness Identities\n\nMs. Maxwell’s proposed protective order prohibits Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and\nothers on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity of any alleged victim or\npotential witness referenced in the discovery materials, but does not prohibit defense counsel\nfrom publicly referencing individuals “who have spoken on the public record to the media or in\npublic fora, or in litigation—criminal or otherwise—trelating to Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine\nMaxwell.” /d. § 6. This language, which is nearly <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> in all material respects to the\nlanguage in the protective order approved in the government’s criminal prosecution of Mr.\nEpstein, see United States v. Epstein, l9-CR-oo49o-RMB (S.D.N.Y. July 25, 2ol9), ensures\nappropriate privacy protections for alleged victims and should be approved here.\n\nIn contrast to the more permissive language it agreed to with respect to Mr. Epstein, the\ngovernment has taken the position that Ms. Maxwell’s defense counsel should only be alloued to\ndisclose the identity of alleged victims or potential witnesses who have spoken by name on the\npublic record “in this case.” The government’s proposal, houever, advances no compelling\nprivacy protections, and instead prevents the defense from making reference to individuals who\nhave already voluntarily publicly disclosed their identities by, among other things, pursuing civil\nsuits in their oun name against Ms. Maxwell and/or Mr. Epstein; speaking by name in the public\nrecord in Mr. Epstein’s criminal proceedings; participating in on-the-record media interviews; or\nposting comments under their oun names on social media. The government’s proposed\nrestriction is therefore “broader than necessary” to protect the privacy interests of these\nindividuals who have already chosen to self-identify, and will hinder the defense’s ability to\nconduct further factual investigation, prepare witnesses for trial, and advocate on Ms. Maxwell’s\nbehalf.\n\n* * *\nApp.o4l\nDOJ-OGR-oool95oo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019518.jpg": "Odsedl ZADAaO S BOs ATTEN tide WAG 262 F iB 6228/PAg Kalgei4l Ab7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 28, 2o2o\nPage 4\n\nMoreover, the defendant is able, at any time, to apply to the Court for a modification of the\nprotective order should she be able to identify a particularized need to publicly name victims who\nhave not yet identified themselves on the record in this case—as opposed to redacting their names\nfrom court filings, or referring to them in an anonymized fashion. As noted, to date, defense\ncounsel has declined to identify to the Court or to the Government any example of why doing so\nwould be necessary or helpful to the defense, or even under what circumstances the defense might\nwant to do so.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal is also extraordinarily broad, and without any temporal or subject\nmater limitation as to the phrase “public fora.” Adopting the defendant’s proposal would mean\nthat any individual who has ever self-identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell\npublicly in any capacity would be subject to public identification by the defendant and her counsel\nin connection with this case. This would include, as hypothetical examples, someone who spoke\nto a journalist for a local story in l997, or posted on a MySpace page folloued by a handful of\nfriends in 2oo5, or made a statement on a small podcast in 2oo9, or posted on Twiter to a handful\nof follouers in 2ol3. But none of these examples of ventures into the “public fora” can possibly\nbe construed as efforts by hypothetical victims to consent or choose “‘to self-identify,” Def. Ltr.\nat 3, in a future criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell subject to extraordinary public atention\nand scrutiny.\n\nAdditionally, while some individuals have identified themselves as victims without\nproviding any details or additional information about their abuse, the defense contemplates no\nlimitation of publicly associating those individuals with the details of their abuse in public defense\nstatements or filings. In essence, the defendant’s proposal seeks authorization to drag into the\npublic glare any victim who has ever made any type of public statement of victimization—no\nmater hou long ago or hou brief—without that victim’s knouing consent and without any\nsubstantive justification. That is particularly troubling given that the Government expects to make\nproductions of discovery and 35oo materials well surpassing its obligations. Those productions\nwill necessarily include the identities of individuals whom the Government does not expect to call\nas witnesses, and whose accounts—much less identities—will have no bearing on this case. But\nthe defendant’s proposal would allou her and her counsel to publicly name them in any public\nstatement or filing at their sole discretion. This is plainly unnecessary for any investigative steps\nor trial preparation, would be grossly inappropriate and unfair, and would be inconsistent with the\nCrime Victims’ Rights Act.\n\nConversely, the Government’s submission proposes that the defendant and her counsel not\nbe precluded from discussing publicly individuals who identify themselves on the record in this\ncriminal prosecution, because any such individuals will have made a conscious and informed\nchoice to be associated publicly with this case. See Government Proposed Order {/f 5, 6, 8. The\nidentity of any other individuals should be protected from public broadcast by the defendant and\nher counsel.\n\nThe defendant argues that her proposed language is “nearly <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> in all material\nrespects” to the protective order entered in United States v. Epstein, l9 Cr. 49o (RMB) (Dkt. 38).\nDef. Ltr. at 3. In the first instance, that is false.

The Court\nwill proceed to briefly explain why neither the new charges in the S2 superseding indictment nor\nthe supplemental authority Maxwell cites change the Court’s conclusion that the NPA does not\nbar the charges against her.\n\nAs the Court explained in its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order, the Second Circuit held in\nUnited States v. Annabi that “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the United States\nAtorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the\nagreement contemplates a broader restriction.” 77l F.2d 67o, 672 (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam).\nThe Second Circuit’s opinion in Annabi is clear, and that court has folloued it steadfastly since.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x 268, 27o (2d Cir. 2oo4); United States v.\nBroun, No. 99-l23o(L), 2oo2 WL 34244994, at *2 (2d Cir. Apr. 26, 2oo2); United States v.\nSalameh, l52 F.3d 88, l2o (2d Cir. l998) (per curiam); United States v. Rivera, 844 F.2d 9l6,\n923 (2d Cir. l988). The Second Circuit has held that language nearly <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> to that in\nEpstein’s NPA is not enough to overcome the presumption in favor of single-district plea\nagreements. See Salameh, l52 F.3d at l2o. Adhering to this binding authority, this Court thus\nconcluded (and continues to conclude) that the NPA does not bind the U.S. Atorney’s Office for\nthe Southern District of New York. It thus provides Maxwell no defense in this case even if it\nwould otherwise cover the conduct charged in the new counts in the S2 superseding indictment.\n\nMaxwell advances two new arguments for why the Court should depart from this\nreasoning—the first in her renewed motion and the second in a leter of supplemental authority.\nSee Dkt. Nos. 293, 3lo. In her renewed motion, she contends that Annabi contains an exception\nfor out-of-district prosecutions for charges that are “<span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> to the dismissed charges.” And in\nthe leter of supplemental authority, she contends that the opinion of the Pennsylvania Supreme\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o8l2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020813.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel95 of 2o8\nCourt in Commonwealth v. Cosby, No. 39 MAP 2o2o, 2o2l WL 267438o (Pa. June 3o, 2o2l),\nrequires dismissal. Neither argument is persuasive.\n\nAnnabi contains no exception for out-of-district prosecutions for charges that are\n“<span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> to the dismissed charges.” In the language Maxwell cites from Annabi, the Second\nCircuit discussed (and rejected) a claim based on the Double Jeopardy Clause, not a claim based\non the plea agreement in that case. See Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672. In that section of the opinion,\nthe Second Circuit held that even if the charges had been <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> to the dismissed charges, the\ndefendants’ double jeopardy claims would fail because they were never in jeopardy on the\ncharges that were dismissed under the plea agreement. Nothing in Annabi suggests that the\npresumption in favor of single-district plea agreements does not apply if later charges in another\ndistrict are sufficiently “<span class=\"highlight\">identical</span>” to the dismissed ones, and no subsequent Second Circuit case\napplying Annabi has so held. Annabi applies squarely to the facts of this case and binds this\nCourt.\n\nThe Court also disagrees that Cosby mandates a different result. To begin with, this\nCourt must follou the precedential opinions of the Second Circuit on questions of federal law,\nnot those of a state court. Thus, nothing in Cosby could change this Court’s view that Second\nCircuit precedent in Annabi forecloses Maxwell’s arguments related to the NPA. In any event,\nthe state court in Cosby did not purport to decide the same federal question at issue here. In\nCosby, the court held that it was unfair for a district atorney to proceed with charges against Bill\nCosby after the district atorney’s office had, in that court’s view of the facts, unequivocally\npromised that it would not charge him. Cosby, 2o2l WL 267438o, at *34. That case did not\ninvolve a question of whether one office’s promise bound another, much less whether a plea\nagreement in one federal district should be construed to apply in another district.

The Government correctly notes that the overt acts provided to the\njury for Counts Three and Five are distinct. See Jury Charge, Dkt. No. 565 at 49-5o. This factor\ntherefore tips touard the Government—but only slightly. A number of the overt acts listed for\nCount Three could have been prosecuted under Count Five but for the fact that l8 U.S.C. § l59l,\nthe Trafficking Victims Protection Act, was not enacted until 2ooo. See Gov. Br. at 28. That\nsome <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> overt acts were not listed for both conspiracies is therefore more a function of\nlegal timing than an indication of two distinct conspiracies. Cf’ Hernandez, 2oo9 WL 3l69226,\nat *l2.\n\nInterdependence. Counts Three and Five are not interdependent because the success or\nfailure of one conspiracy is independent of the success or failure of the other. See Macchia, 35\nF.3d at 67l. In other words, the success of the Defendant and Epstein’s scheme to abuse Carolyn\nfrom 2ool to 2oo4 was not made more or less likely by the prior success or failure to abuse Jane,\nAnnie, or any other underage girl.

The same is true here. As explained above, the\nGovernment’s opening statement and closing arguments presented a theory of a singular\nconspiracy, highlighting: The degree of similarity between each victim witness’s experience\nover a decade; the common “playbook” that the Defendant ran “over and over and over again,”\nTrial Tr. at 2848; and the tight partnership between the Defendant and Epstein. And each of\nthose features was accompanied by references to a singular “scheme” to abuse all victim\nwitnesses. /d. at 36, 2843, 2853. At botom, the case presented to the jury by the Government\nwas of a single decade-long conspiracy by the Defendant and Epstein to sexually abuse underage\ngirls. Having pursued such a broad and encompassing conspiracy, the Government cannot nou\nclaim, and cannot carry its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence, that Count\nFive was legally and factually distinct. See Maslin, 356 F.3d at l97.\n\nBecause Count Three and Count Five are multiplicitous, the proper remedy is to enter\njudgment on only one of the counts. See Josephberg, 459 F.3d at 355 (“If the jury convicts on\nmore than one multiplicitous count, the defendant’s right not to suffer multiple punishments for\nthe same offense will be protected by having the court enter judgment on only one of the\nmultiplicitous counts.” (citing Ball v.

The general principles applicable to the prosecution or declination decision are set\nforth in USAM § 9-2.o3l, “Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy (‘Petite Policy’),” which\ncontains guidelines for a federal prosecutor’s exercise of discretion in determining whether to bring\na federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or\nfederal proceeding. The policy applies “whenever there has been a prior state or federal\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”\n\nIn circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new\nfederal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist.

For example, defense atorneys questioned one victim as to whether\nthe federal prosecutors or FBI agents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein. See Exhibit 9 to\nVillafafia June 2, 2ol7 Declaration: Deposition of [REDACTED], State v. Epstein, Case No. 2oo6-CF-9454, at 44,\n5o, 5l (Feb. 2o, 2oo8). One victim’s atorney told OPR that the defense atorneys tried to “smear” victims by asking\nhighly personal sexual questions about “terminations of pregnancies . . . sexual encounters . . . masturbation.”\nEpstein’s atorney used similar tactics in questioning victims who filed civil cases against their client. For example,\nthe Miami Herald reported that, “One girl was asked about her abortions, and her parents, who were Catholic and\nknew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.” See Julie Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Cops\nWorked to Put a Serial Sex Abuser in Prison.

Rather, like the previous FBI VNS-generated leter, the leter requested the victims’\n“assistance and cooperation while we are investigating the case.”\n\nFor each of the two victims residing outside of the United States, Villafafia also drafted a\nnotification leter concerning the June 3o, 2oo8 plea and the l8 U.S.C. § 2255 process, which were\nto be hand delivered along with the FBI’s leters.

The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span>\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*’* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\nad The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative)” and “Under Investigation.”\nals After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n\n264\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l466", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021689.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page42 of 93\n29\n2.

For example, one would not\ncooperate with investigators; a second claimed to have simply massaged Epstein with no sexual activity; and a third\nclaimed she had no contact with Epstein.\n\n3ll Villafafia told OPR that she understood the state took the position that because “there was either only one or\ntwo victims involved in their case,” they “could not do victim notifications to all of the victims.”\n2l2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2325o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023255.jpg": "informed victims “of their right to collect damages prior to a thorough investigation of their\n\nallegations against Mr. Epstein”:\nNone of the victims were informed of the right to sue under\nSection 2255 prior to the investigation of the claims. Three victims\nwere notified shortly after the signing of the [NPA] of the general\nterms of that Agreement. You raised objections to any victim\nnotification, and no further notifications were done. Throughout\nthis process you have seen that I have prepared this case as though\nit would proceed to trial. Notifying the witnesses of the possibility\nof damages claims prior to concluding the mater by plea or trial\nwould only undermine my case. If my reassurances are insufficient\nthe fact that not a single victim has threatened to sue Mr. Epstein\nshould assure you of the integrity of the investigation.\n\nOn December l4, 2oo7, Villafafia forwarded to Acosta the draft victim notification leter\npreviously sent to the defense, along with two draft leters addressed to State Atorney Krischer;\nVillafafia’s transmital email to Acosta had the subject line, “The leters you requested.” One of\nthe draft leters to Krischer, to be signed by Villafafia, was to advise that the USAO had sent an\nenclosed victim notification leter to specified identified victims and referred to an enclosed “list\nof the identified victims and their contact information, in case you are required to provide them\nwith any further notification regarding their rights under Florida law.”*!? The second draft leter\nto Krischer, for Acosta’s signature, requested that Krischer respond to defense counsel’s\nallegations that the State Atorney’s Office was not comfortable with the proposed plea and\nsentence because it believed that the case should be resolved with probation and no sexual offender\nregistration. OPR found no evidence that these leters were sent to Krischer.*”°\n\nA few days later, in an apparent effort to move forward with victim notifications, Villafafia\nemailed Sloman, stating, “[Is there] anything that I or the agents should be doing?” Villafafia told\nSloman that “[the FBI case agent] is all worked up because another agent and [a named AUSA]\nare the subject of an OPR investigation for failing to properly confer with and notify victims [in\nan unrelated mater]. We seem to be ina Catch 22.”°*! OPR did not find a response to Villafafia’s\nemail.\n\nIn their December l4, 2oo7 meeting with Acosta and other USAO personnel and in their\nlengthy follou-up leter to Acosta on December l7, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz continued to press\ntheir objections to the USAO’s involvement in the Epstein mater. They requested that Acosta\nal? The draft victim notification leter was <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> to the draft victim notification leter sent to the defense on\nDecember 6, 2oo7, except that it contained a new plea date of January 4, 2oo8.\n\n32o Moreover, the leters were not included in the publicly released State Atorney’s file, which included other\ncorrespondence from the USAO. See Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office Public Records/Jeffrey Epstein, available\nat htp://sal5.org/stateatorney/NewsRoom/indexPR htm.\n\n32l OPR was unable to locate any records indicating that such allegations had ever been referred to OPR.\nVillafafia told OPR that “Catch 22” was a reference to instructions from supervisors “[t]hat we can’t go forward on”\nfiling federal charges and “I was told not to do victim notifications and confer at the time.”\n\n2l7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23255", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023259.jpg": "“federal authorities are expected to drop their probe into whether Epstein broke any federal\nlaws.””??°\n\nNevertheless, as Epstein’s team continued to argue to higher levels of the Department that\nthere was no appropriate federal interest in prosecuting Epstein and thus no basis for the NPA, and\nwith his atorneys asserting that “the facts had goten beter for Epstein,” Villafafia came to believe\nthat Epstein would likely breach the NPA.*”° In January 2oo8, Villafafia informed her supervisors\nthat the FBI “had very tight contact with the victims several months ago when we were prepared\nto [file charges], but all the shenanigans over the past few months have resulted in no contact with\nthe vast majority of the victims.” Villafafia then proposed that the FBI “re-establish contact with\nall the victims so that we knou we can rely on them at trial.”*?’ Villafafia told OPR that at this\npoint, “[w]hile the case was being investigat[ed] and prepared for indictment, I did not prepare or\nsend any victim notification leters—there simply was nothing to update. I did not receive any\nvictim calls during this time.”\n\nPa The FBI Uses VNS Form Leters to Re-Establish Contact with Victims\n\nOn January lo, 2oo8, the FBI Victim Specialist mailed VNS generated victim notification\nleters to l4 victims articulating the eight CVRA rights and inviting recipients to update their\ncontact information with the FBI in order to obtain current information about the mater.*? The\ncase agent informed Villafafia in an email that the Victim Specialist sent a “standard form [FBI]\nleter to all the remaining identified victims.” These 2oo8 leters were <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> to the FBI form\nleters the Victim Specialist had sent to victims between August 28, 2oo6, and October l2, 2oo7.\nLike those previous leters, most of which were sent before the NPA was signed on September 24,\n2oo7, the 2oo8 leters described the case as “currently under investigation” and noted that “[t]his\ncan be a lengthy process and we request your continued patience while we conduct a thorough\ninvestigation.” The leters also stated:\n328 Michele Dargan, “Jeffrey Epstein Plea Hearing Moved to March,” Palm Beach Daily News “The Shiny\nSheet,” Jan. 3, 2oo8.\nl28 Epstein’s atorneys used discovery proceedings in the state case to depose federal victims, and as they learned\nunflatering details or potential impeachment information concerning likely federal victims, they argued for the\nexclusion of those victims from the federal case. For example, defense atorneys questioned one victim as to whether\nthe federal prosecutors or FBI agents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein. See Exhibit 9 to\nVillafafia June 2, 2ol7 Declaration: Deposition of [REDACTED], State v. Epstein, Case No. 2oo6-CF-9454, at 44,\n5o, 5l (Feb. 2o, 2oo8). One victim’s atorney told OPR that the defense atorneys tried to “smear” victims by asking\nhighly personal sexual questions about “terminations of pregnancies . . . sexual encounters . . . masturbation.”\nEpstein’s atorney used similar tactics in questioning victims who filed civil cases against their client. For example,\nthe Miami Herald reported that, “One girl was asked about her abortions, and her parents, who were Catholic and\nknew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.” See Julie Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Cops\nWorked to Put a Serial Sex Abuser in Prison. Prosecutors Worked to Cut Him a Break,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28,\n2ol8,\nad Villafafia also told her supervisors that she wanted the FBI to interview two specific victims.\n328 The Victim Specialist later generated an additional leter dated May 3o, 2oo8. After Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\nstate court pleas, she sent out substantially similar notification leters to two victims who resided outside of the United\nStates.\n\n22l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23259", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023277.jpg": "leter was substantially <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span> to the previous FBI victim notification leter the FBI had sent to\nvictims (in 2oo6, 2oo7, and 2oo8) in that it identified each recipient as “a possible victim of a\nfederal crime” and listed her eight CVRA rights.\n\nThe leter did not indicate that Epstein had pled guilty in state court on June 3o, 2oo8, or\nthat the USAO had resolved its investigation by deferring federal prosecution in favor of the state\nplea. Rather, like the previous FBI VNS-generated leter, the leter requested the victims’\n“assistance and cooperation while we are investigating the case.”\n\nFor each of the two victims residing outside of the United States, Villafafia also drafted a\nnotification leter concerning the June 3o, 2oo8 plea and the l8 U.S.C. § 2255 process, which were\nto be hand delivered along with the FBI’s leters. Houever, FBI records do not reflect whether\nthe USAO’s leter was delivered to the two victims.\n\nE. August — September 2oo8: The Federal Court Orders the USAO to Disclose\n\nthe NPA to Victims, and the USAO Sends a Revised Victim Notification Leter\n\nOn August l, 2oo8, the petitioners in the CVRA litigation filed a motion seeking access to\nthe NPA. The USAO opposed the motion by relying on the confidentiality portion of the NPA.?”\nOn August 2l, 2oo8, the court ordered the government to provide the petitioners with a copy of\nthe NPA subject to a protective order. In addition, the court ordered the government to produce\nthe NPA to other identified victims upon request:\n\n(d) If any individuals who have been identified by the USAO as\nvictims of Epstein and/or any atorney(s) for those individuals\nrequest the opportunity to review the [NPA], then the USAO shall\nproduce the [NPA] to those individuals, so long as those individuals\nalso agree that they shall not disclose the [NPA] or its terms to any\nthird party absent further court order, follouing notice to and an\nopportunity for Epstein’s counsel to be heard[.]?”\n\nIn September 2oo8, the USAO sent a revised notification leter to victims, and atorneys\nfor represented victims, concerning Epstein’s state court guilty plea and his agreement to not\ncontest liability in victim civil suits brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255.74 The September leter\nappeared to address concerns raised by Epstein atorney Lefkouitz that the government’s earlier\nnotification leter referenced language concerning l8 U.S.C. § 2255 that the government had\nproposed in Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter to Epstein atorney Sanchez, but that the defense\nhad not accepted.*” As a result of the defense objection, Villafafia determined that she was\n3l2 Pursuant to paragraph l3 of the NPA, Villafafia made Epstein’s atorneys aware of the petitioners’ request\nfor the NPA.\n\n373 Doe, Order to Compel Production and Protective Order at l-2 (Aug. 2l, 2oo8).\na The USAO also sent a notification leter to additional victims who had not received a notification leter in\nJuly.\n37 This issue is discussed more fully in Chapter Two.\n239\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23277", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023302.jpg": "continuing.” The co-case agent also told OPR that, as of the time of his OPR interview in 2ol9,\nthe “the case was open . . . it’s never been shut doun.”\n\nOPR found no evidence that the FBI’s victim leters were drafted with the intent to mislead\nthe victims about the status of the federal investigation. The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and <span class=\"highlight\">identical</span>\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*'* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\na4 The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative)” and “Under Investigation.”\n\n4l5 After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n264\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233o2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023497.jpg": "interviews with any prisoners who were in Mr. Epstein's SHU unit on the 9th floor on or about July 23\nor on August 9-lo, 2ol9 relating to Mr. Epstein, the same request for interview memoranda of any MCC\nemployee or independent contractor or any other person in the MCC midnight-8 AM August lo, 2ol9,\nany and all medical and EMS and hospital records from July 23 and/or August lo, 2ol9, and the future\npathology and toxicology and medical examiner's reports.
