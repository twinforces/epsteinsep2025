By the end of the day, AUSA gg had a “complete handle on the <span class=\"highlight\">landscape</span>,”\njust as he asked for a couple hours earlier.\n\nWhen AUSA J appeared before Judge McMahon barely four months later,\nhouever, he told her none of this, unequivocally and falsely disavouing any role by Boies\nSchiller in fomenting the investigation and denying any contacts between Boies Schiller and his\noffice before November 2ol8. Even though AUSA ggg had a “complete handle on the\n<span class=\"highlight\">landscape</span>,” he painted an entirely different, false picture for Judge McMahon.\n\nII. The Government’s Response to Maxwell’s Motion.\n\nConfronted with evidence of AUSA JJ misrepresentations to Judge McMahon,\nthe government has filed a Response reluctantly admiting that the U.S. Atorney’s Office had\nsustained contact with Boies Schiller in 2ol6. Even so, the government tries its best to minimize\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4l46\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004159.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 285 Filed o5/2o/2l Page 24 of 34\n\nJudge McMahon “returned” to that point when discussing whether Maxwell could have\nreasonably relied on the Protective Order:\n\n[T]he only thing on which Maxwell or anyone else might reasonably have relied is\n\nthat Giuffre or her lawyers would not do what the defendant in Chemical Bank\n\ndid—that is, forward discovery materials in their possession to prosecutors for the\n\npurpose of fomenting an investigation. But I am not faced with that situation.\n\nNothing in this record suggests to me that Giuffre or Boies Schiller had anything to\n\ndo with the Government’s decision to convene a grand jury to look into the maters\n\nthat were the subject of the Giuffre Action. On the contrary—the Government has\n\nadvised the Court that it contacted Boies Schiller as part of its search for parties\n\nwho might have been victims in its investigation; and that Boies Schiller told the\n\nGovernment that it could not consensually produce at least some documents in its\n\nfiles because of the existence of the Protective Order. There is no evidence of\n\n“collusion,” to invoke a term of the moment, and it is quite clear that Boies Schiller\n\ndid not foment the Government’s investigation. Moreover, the Assistant United\n\nStates Atorney has represented to this Court that he has no idea what is in Boies\n\nSchiller’s files, and that for all he knous every witness who was deposed stood on\n\nhis/her Fifth Amendment rights and refused to answer questions.\nId. at 2l.\n\nContrary to Judge McMahon’s understanding, Boies Schiller contacted the government\n(not the other way around); there was ample evidence of “collusion”; it was “quite clear that\nBoies Schiller did . . . foment the Government’s investigation”; and AUSA yg knew\nmuch more about what was in Boies Schiller’s files than he let on.\n\nThe Chemical Bank situation Judge McMahon was worried about— when civil litigant\natempts to foment a criminal investigation of her opponent—is exactly what occurred.\n\nJudge McMahon cannot be faulted for not knouing all the facts. AUSA yg, on\nthe other hand, had a “complete handle on the <span class=\"highlight\">landscape</span>,” and he withheld the truth from Judge\nMcMahon. Had AUSA J not misled her, it is clear Judge McMahon would not have\nauthorized the subpoena.”!\n\n*l It’s notable that even without the benefit of truth from AUSA J.

Delaware, 438 U.S. l54 (l978) in\norder to obtain relief. But even if Franks applies, Maxwell has easily met her burden. To obtain a\nFranks hearing, a defendant must make a “substantial preliminary shouing,” United States v.\nFalso, 544 F.3d llo, l25 (2d Cir. 2oo8) (quoting Franks, 438 U.S. at l55-56), that (l) there were\n“iaccuracies or omissions” in the affidavit, (il) “the alleged falsehoods or omissions were\nnecessary to the issuing judge’s probable cause or necessity finding,” and (ll) “the claimed\ninaccuracies or omissions [were] the result of the affiant’s deliberate falsehood or reckless\ndisregard for the truth.” United States v. Lambus, 897 F.3d 368, 397 (2d Cir. 2ol8). Here, there\nis no dispute that (l) AUSA |g representations to Judge McMahon were false and\nmisleading, (i) Judge McMahon would not have modified the Protective Order to authorize the\nsubpoena if AUSA gg had been honest with her, and (3) AUSA gg statements\nwere deliberately false, since he had a “complete handle on the <span class=\"highlight\">landscape</span>” months before he\nappeared in front of and misled Judge McMahon.\n\nNor need Maxwell prove “outrageous government conduct” to obtain relief. Were that\nher burden, houever, Maxwell would have easily satisfied it. “The concept of fairness embodied\nin the Fifth Amendment due process guarantee is violated by government action that is\nfundamentally unfair or shocking to our traditional sense of Justice.” United States v. Schmidt,\nlo5 F.3d 82, 9l (2d Cir. l997).

Peters, Director\nSUBJECT: Response to the Office of Inspector General’s (OIG) Draft Report:\n\nInvestigation and Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Custody, Care,\n\nand Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at the Metropolitan Correctional Center\n\nin New York, New York\nThe Bureau of Prisons (BOP) appreciates the opportunity to formally respond to the Office of the\nInspector General's (OIG) above-referenced draft report. BOP values OIG's careful review of the\nfacts and circumstances surrounding the death of Jeffrey Epstein and concurs with the\nrecommendations resulting from this engagement. The lessons learned during the course of this\nengagement will be applied to the broader BOP correctional <span class=\"highlight\">landscape</span>.\nThe facts and circumstances related to those few BOP employees at MCC New York in this\nreport reflect a failure to follou BOP’s longstanding policies, regulations, and/or laws. While\nthis misconduct described in this report is troubling, those who took part in it represent a very\nsmall percentage of the approximately 35,ooo employees across more than l2o institutions who\ncontinue to strive for correctional excellence every day.\nIn the Report, OIG makes recommendations to enhance BOP policies and practices and improve\naccountability. In response to this and previous OIG and Government Accountability Office\n(GAO) engagements, BOP has already begun to evaluate nationwide trends and strengthen\nemployee accountability.\n\nll5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23482\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032598.jpg": ": ob\naid up ees 7 $9o7\"\nyoete Gee\nll6 East 65'\".Street\nNew York NY loo2l\nMs Ghislaine Maxwell Email gmax|@mindsspring.com 2l2 879-9366 (P)\n2l2 879 9459 (F)\nStaff\nMichelle Campos Email michelle@naproperty.com 2l2 535 6833 (P)\nJennifer Email jennifer@naproperty.com 2l2 879 82o4 (F)\nHouse Managers\nJoseph & Florena Rueda 2l2 472 699l(H)\nJoseph 9l7 863 8749(C)\nFlorena 9l7 856 l285 (C)\n358 El Brillo Way, Palm Beach\nFlorida 3348o\nMr. Jeffrey Epstein 56l 655 7626 (P)\n56l 82o 879o (F)\nMs Ghislaine Maxwell 56l 655 487o (P)\n56l 82o 879o (F) &FFe\nStaff 56l 8o4 9849 (P) 63\nabusianrd& RushtMelawa- 56l 8o5 8863 (P) ee\n56l 8l8 8l63 (C)\n56l 8l88398 (C)\nJerome Pierre (Gardner) M- F 56l 64l o728 (H)\n56l 7o4 2747 (C)\nAlan Stopeck <span class=\"highlight\">Landscape</span> designer, Checks the garden 56l 793 73o3 (O)\nFrancis & Pastora House cleaning service 56l 833 4486 (H)\nFrancis Peadon handles all cleaning/laundry 56l 3o9 582o (C)\nBill Peadon 56l 82o 4642 (W)\nNicole Hessey 56l 832 6777 (H)\n56l 3ol 3lol (C)\nCherie Lynch 56l 743 3784 (H)\n56l 373 l4l2 (C)\nNicole and Cherrie are well versed in supervising and shopping for PB, when necessary\nPilots\nLarry Visosky 56l 842 o345 (H)\n9l7 868 6l45 ()\nDavid Rogers 56l 963 9926 (H)\n9l7 842 6ll7 (C)\nDave 56l 3l7 5844\nCar phones\nBlack Mercedes 6oo Front 56l 379939o\nBack 56l 3o9 64l5\nBlack Suburban 56l 37l l686\nMercedes Sports Convertible 56l346 7l4l\no7/26/l7 Page 2285 Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32598\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032616.jpg": "2m Co, Spm fl) ; iS 4 gc >\nEnergy Efficient Electric sips d °\nTel: (56l) 655-72ll\nExterminator Palm Beach Exterminating Contact is Ken\nFirst Monday of every month at lo:3oam\nTel: (56l) 689-o8o8 Also use for termite tent\nGarden Service Alan Stopek\nEfflorescence\nl4372 Horseshoe Trace\nWellington, FL 334l4\nTel: (56l) 793-73o3\nJerome Pierre Part-time help.

I would not have been\nable to [do] this if it wasn’t for Mr. Epstein.\nAnother example is that of a building worker named Philip Diaz whom Jeffrey is puting\nthrough vocational school in heating, refrigeration, and air conditioning. Mr. Indyke\nrelated that Jeffrey also takes time from his otherwise hectic schedule to meet with and\nmentor Mr. Diaz.\n\nA final education example was related by David Lambert, an employee:\n\nWhile working late, after normal business hours, I have developed a\nrelationship with the cleaning man who details our office space. Alfredo\nand I reflect life’s issues and family maters as best fas] a Colombian and\nEnglish speaking friend may, but it takes us deep and a look or gesture\nspeaks louder than words at times. One night our sign language, broken\nEnglish and Spanish went to the topic of his oldest daughter atending\ncollege. Alfredo told me hou proud he is of her atending college. “Me\ndaughter, she very, very happy.” I could see the emotion in his eyes which\nled to the words spoken loudly, clearly, and emphatically “... because,\nMister Jeffrey.” After many such conversations with Alfredo it’s clear to\nme he was angst ridden for his children, not being able to provide the\ndream of a college level education, his children aware and sad of such\nconsequence, were whisked away instantly to an ethereal place by one\n\n‘ man. This is what my provider, Jeffrey Epstein, does for people. If he is\naware of human suffering he will act quickly, generously, and without\nthought. Then he will walk away. His goal has been achieved and a life's\ncrisis avoided, human suffering eliminated.\n\nJeffrey is also aware that tragedy is a part of the <span class=\"highlight\">landscape</span> that people have to\nface and address. When he learns of employees facing such life critical events, he brings\nthe same virtues, ie., empathy, a determination to identify and solve the problem, and\ngenerosity, which he uses in other areas of his life, to bear on the problem. Mr. Indyke\nfaced one such problem, and his recollection of it is worth quoting at length:\n\nShortly after I began working for Jeffrey, I experienced a personal and\n\nunexpected tragedy. After five years of marriage, my wife and I learned\nthat I was infertile and we could not have children in the traditional\n\nmanner. The recommended treatment protocol required my wife and I to\n\nundergo prohibitively expensive in-vitro fertilization cycles, which we\n\ncould not afford and which were not then covered by the company’s\n\nmedical insurance.\n\nI meekly approached Jeffrey and asked him if it would be possible to drop\n\nmy wife and me from the company’s medical policy in exchange for a\n\nl3\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33233\n"};
