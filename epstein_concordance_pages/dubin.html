Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this motion to preclude certain testimony of certain\ndefense witnesses. After reviewing the defendant’s witness list and related material, it appears\nthat certain witnesses are expected to testify about maters that are irrelevant, prejudicial, or\nimproper impeachment.\n\nSpecifically, the Government moves to preclude the follouing:\n\ne Testimony from Eva <span class=\"highlight\">Dubin</span>, Michelle Healy, or Kelly Bovino about whether they\n\nparticipated in a sexualized massage with Jane;\n\ne Testimony from Alexander Hamilton as contained in the affidavit atached as Exhibit\n\nAS\ne Testimony from Dr. Loftus about suggestive activities that did not occur in this case;\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooll253\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011256.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o6 Filed o7/l2/22 Page4ofl2\nIl. The Court Should Preclude Testimony by Eva <span class=\"highlight\">Dubin</span>, Michelle Healy, or Kelly\nBovino About Sexualized Massages with Jane\n\nIt appears that the defendant seeks to offer testimony from Eva <span class=\"highlight\">Dubin</span>, Michelle Healy, and\nKelly Bovino that they did not participate in sexualized massages with Jane. This testimony would\nnot contradict Jane’s testimony at all. But even if it did, such contradiction is impeachment about\na collateral mater through extrinsic evidence, and it is impeachment of supposedly contradictory\nstatements made on cross examination, rather than on direct examination, each of which renders\nimpeachment improper. Such testimony should be precluded.\n\nA. Factual Background\n\nOn cross-examination, the defense asked Jane a series of questions about what she had told\nthe Government about other participants in group sexual encounters with Epstein and the\ndefendant. Tr. 523-24. In the course of that testimony, Jane confirmed that she “told the\nGovernment” there was “a woman named Eva” who “joined in” with another woman. Tr. 525-26.\nShe also “remembered” another participant “named Michelle,” who was “short.” Tr. 526-27. And\nfinally, Jane “remembered” a participant “name Kelly,” whose last name Jane also “remembered,”\nand who Jane thought was “‘a model who was older than [Jane].” Tr. 527.\n\nDefense counsel confirmed that Jane told the Government that Jane thought she could\nrecognize photos of at least a few of the participants, but the Government had not shoun her photos\nof Eva, Michelle, or Kelly. Tr. 527, 53o. Despite this line of questioning, defense counsel did not\nshou Jane photos on the stand or ask Jane for last names of any of these individuals or any other\nidentifying information.\n\nB. Discussion\nThe Government expects that the defendant plans to call Eva <span class=\"highlight\">Dubin</span>, Michelle Healy, and\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooll256\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011257.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o6 Filed o7/l2/22 Page5ofl2\nKelly Bovino to testify that they did not participate in group sexualized massages with Jane,\nEpstein, and the defendant. The Court should preclude this testimony, which does not contradict\nJane’s, and is in any event improper impeachment about a topic of cross-examination that is\ncollateral to the case.\n\nFirst, the anticipated testimony does not contradict Jane’s. Jane testified that she had told\nthe Government that she remembered group sexualized massages involving “Eva,” “Michelle,”\nand “Kelly.” Defense counsel did not ask Jane, and Jane did not testify, that these people were\nEva <span class=\"highlight\">Dubin</span>, Michelle Healy, or Kelly Bovino. The defense had an opportunity to elicit specific\nnames or identities from Jane, such as by eliciting a last name or pointing to a photograph, but they\nchose not to do so. Indeed, defense counsel elicited no description of Eva, and only elicited that\nMichelle was “short.” (Tr. 527). With respect to Kelly, defense counsel only asked whether Jane\ntold the Government that Kelly was an older model whose last name Jane knew—but then chose\nnot to elicit that last name. (/d.)\n\nHaving failed to develop the record, defense counsel cannot nou atempt to impeach Jane’s\ntestimony by calling specific individuals they claim are Eva, Michelle, and Kelly. Indeed, as\ndefense counsel is aware, Jane had previously been asked in meetings with the Government about\nEva <span class=\"highlight\">Dubin</span>, and she answered that she knew <span class=\"highlight\">Dubin</span> and “does not remember <span class=\"highlight\">DUBIN</span> being\ninvolved in massages.” See 35o9-o2o at l. That is, Jane knous who Eva <span class=\"highlight\">Dubin</span> is and has denied\nthat Eva <span class=\"highlight\">Dubin</span> was involved in sexualized massages. See id.! Testimony from Eva <span class=\"highlight\">Dubin</span> that\n' In her interviews with the Government, Jane has not always agreed that another “Eva” exists who\nparticipated in massages, as she testified on the stand. Compare 35o9-oo8 at 4 (recalling that Eva\nwould join in) and 35o9-oo9 at 7 (unclear notation in the notes underlying 35o9-oo8 about the\nname of the person who joined the massage) with 35o9-o2o at 2 (not recalling another Eva). But\nJane has been consistent in saying that she knous Eva <span class=\"highlight\">Dubin</span> and that Jane had no personal\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooll257\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011258.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o6 Filed o7/l2/22 Page6ofl2\nshe did not engage in sexualized massages with Jane therefore in no way contradicts Jane’s\ntestimony.\n\nSimilarly, atempting to identify Michelle Healy as the “Michelle” Jane mentioned lacks a\nbasis in the record. Michelle Healy was far from the only Michelle in the defendant and Epstein’s\nworld. For instance, the list of masseuses in the exhibit marked for identification as Government\nExhibit 4l7 includes three entries for various people named Michelle, none identified with the last\nname Healy. And although Jane has previously told the Government that Kelly Bovino was\ninvolved in group sexualized encounters with her, she did not so testify under oath, and that fact\nwas not put before the jury. Contrary testimony nou from Kelly Bovino would only confuse the\njury, and not contradict any of Jane’s testimony.”\n\nSecond, even if the anticipated testimony did impeach Jane’s testimony, it does so only on\na collateral mater, namely, Jane’s adult sexual activity. The only time marker the defendant\nelicited in connection with any of Eva, Michelle, or Kelly is testimony that Jane knew Michelle\nwhile Jane was living in New York. (Tr. 533). As Jane testified on direct, she moved to New\nknouledge of sexualized massages involving Eva <span class=\"highlight\">Dubin</span>. See 35o9-oo8 at 7 (explaining that Jane\nwas “not sure if [the Eva on the flight records—that is, Eva <span class=\"highlight\">Dubin</span>] was part of the massages’’);\n35o9-o2o (explaining that Jane “does not remember <span class=\"highlight\">DUBIN</span> being involved in massages”).\n\n? Even if the defense had elicited the last names of the individuals Jane had in mind, their testimony\nstill would not contradict Jane’s. Defense counsel asked Jane whether she told the Government\nabout Eva, Michelle, and Kelly. Jane was not asked, and did not testify, that these individuals in\nfact participated in the group sexualized massages. If <span class=\"highlight\">Dubin</span>, Healy, and Bovino testify that they\ndid not, it in no way contradicts Jane’s testimony about what she did and did not tell the\nGovernment in a prior interview. Although defense counsel asked Jane whether Eva and Kelly—\nbut not Michelle—could confirm Jane’s “story,” those questions were continuations of counsel’s\nquestions regarding what Jane had told the Government in earlier interviews. (Tr. 526 (“You said\n[Eva] joined in with Sophie? . . . . She knew the routine? . . . So she could also confirm your\nstory?”); Tr. 527 (“And you told the government [Kelly] could back up what you were talking\nabout, right?”).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooll258\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011344.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 72o Filed o7/l2/22 Page3of3\nThe Honorable Alison J.

These women included Eva,\nMichelle, and Kelly. TR. at 523-3o.

Given that allegation, Ms. Maxwell has a constitutional right to call Eva <span class=\"highlight\">Dubin</span> to the\nstand and present her testimony, which will deny the allegations and contradict Jane’s claims.\n\nPerhaps hoping this Court won’t notice, the government buries most of the facts about\nJane’s allegations about Eva in a footnote. Gov. Leter, pp 5-6 n.l. But even that footnote\nmischaracterizes what Jane said about Eva. Jane did not tell the government that Eva <span class=\"highlight\">Dubin</span> was\nnot involved in group sexualized massages. At most, Jane said she “does not remember <span class=\"highlight\">DUBIN</span>\nbeing involved in massages.” See 35o9-o2o, p l. But that’s contrary to what she said in February\n2o2o, and it’s contrary to what she said on the stand. And it’s wholly inconsistent with Jane’s\nstatement that she “does not recall there being another Eva.” /d. at 2.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll368\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011373.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 723 Filed o7/l2/22 Pagellofl3\nThe Honorable Alison J.

The government’s other arguments fail.\n\nThe government offers three other arguments. First, the government faults Ms. Maxwell\nfor not shouing Jane pictures of Eva, Michelle, and Kelly. Nothing required Ms. Maxwell to do\nthat, and the government cites no authority for its argument.\n\nWhat’s more telling is that the government never shoued Jane their photographs. The\ngovernment’s deliberate choice to muddy the waters is not Ms. Maxwell’s fault or her problem.\nThe record shous Eva <span class=\"highlight\">Dubin</span>, Michelle Healy, and Kelly Bovino are the “Eva,” “Michelle,” and\n“Kelly” who Jane testified about. Their testimony is admissible.\n\nSecond, it’s irrelevant that Ms. Maxwell did not use last names in her examination of\nJane. For one thing, Jane also did not use last names in her interviews with the FBI. For another\nthing, Eva <span class=\"highlight\">Dubin</span>’s name was already on the record from Mr. Visoski’s testimony, and Jane\nadmited knouing Kelly’s last name. Finally, Ms. Maxwell did not use Michelle’s last name in\npart because she intended to ask this Court for anonymity. It’s immaterial that this Court\nsubsequently denied that request.\n\nFinally, the government mistakenly relies on cases purporting to hold that a defendant,\nthrough cross-examination, cannot open the door to proving collateral issues by extrinsic\n\n> The government quite rightly does not make a 4o3 argument. And its relevance\nargument—that the testimony of Eva, Michelle, and Kelly does not contradict Jane’s\ntestimony—is wrong, as described above.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll373\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011374.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 723 Filed o7/l2/22 Pagel2oofl3\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Even if that is what those cases hold (which Ms. Maxwell\ndisputes), the cases have no applicability here, because the details of the sexualized massages are\nnot collateral issues. They are the central issues in this case.\n\nAt best, the government’s arguments go to weight, not admissibility. If the government\nwants to argue that Eva <span class=\"highlight\">Dubin</span>, Michelle Healy, and Kelly Bovino are not the Eva, Michelle, and\nKelly who Jane was referring to, the government is free to make that argument. In fact, the\ngovernment has already made precisely that argument as to I. responding to the\nflight logs’ use of the name [J But that argument is no basis for denying Ms. Maxwell her\nconstitutional right to present a defense.

MOE: Thank you. Your Honor, this is an issue I\n\n3 believe we raised in advance of trial about the relevance of\n\n4 asking witnesses about uncharged conduct and whether the\n\n5 defendant or Epstein commited crimes in other instances that\n\n6 are not charged. I think the foundation here is about the\n\n7 entirety of a very broad relationship between, I think, the\n\n8 l98os and the present, and the question is whether, over\n\n9 several decades, she was aware of any kind of inappropriate\n\nlo conduct with other people. It's extraordinarily broad. And as\nll we briefed in advance of trial, there is no relevance, it's\n\nl2 inappropriate to suggest that there are uncharged conduct on\n\nl3 other occasions is probative of what happened with the\n\nl4 particular individuals at issue in this case. So we think this\nl5 line of questioning is inappropriate.\n\nl6 I would also note, your Honor, as we briefed in\n\nl7 advance of this witness's testimony, we don't believe there is\nl8 a foundation to suggest that this person was in the room with\nl9 Jane. We think our notes on this are clear, that Jane has\n2o expressly said that this person was not involved in sexualized\n2l massages. So we think that questions that are designed to\n22 impeach and the misimpression that defense counsel has created\n23 are inappropriate.\n24 And for those reasons, we would object.\n25 THE COURT: So the specific objection is to other than\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool42o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014204.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 763 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 98 of l97 2639\nLCHCmax3 <span class=\"highlight\">Dubin</span> —- direct\n\nl what I alloued in overruling your motion to preclude is\n\n2 timeframed.

It's not before the\n7 jury whether Maxwell and Epstein commited misconduct with\n\n8 other people, the question is whether she has relevant\n\n9 knouledge about misconduct with the people who are at issue in\nlo this case. The absence of misconduct with other people who are\nll not at issue in this case is not relevant.\n\nl2 THE COURT: I think you should narrou the timeframe in\nl3 which the witness testifies.\n\nl4 MR. PAGLIUCA: I can do that, your Honor.\n\nl5 Just so the record is clear, I don't believe this was\nl6 litigated at all pretrial. This witness was not questioned\n\nl7 about Ms. Maxwell or not being there, which were litigated\n\nl8 pretrial. This really is foundational to the next question,\n\nl9 which is going to be after she stopped dating him, which is\n2o then into the relevant timeframe, did she see any of this\n2l activity, any of which she considered to be inappropriate\n22 activity. So that's actually the next question. So I'm moving\n23 out of this into that.

It's extraordinarily broad. And as\nll we briefed in advance of trial, there is no relevance, it's\n\nl2 inappropriate to suggest that there are uncharged conduct on\n\nl3 other occasions is probative of what happened with the\n\nl4 particular individuals at issue in this case.

It's not before the\n7 jury whether Maxwell and Epstein commited misconduct with\n\n8 other people, the question is whether she has relevant\n\n9 knouledge about misconduct with the people who are at issue in\nlo this case. The absence of misconduct with other people who are\nll not at issue in this case is not relevant.\n\nl2 THE COURT: I think you should narrou the timeframe in\nl3 which the witness testifies.\n\nl4 MR. PAGLIUCA: I can do that, your Honor.\n\nl5 Just so the record is clear, I don't believe this was\nl6 litigated at all pretrial. This witness was not questioned\n\nl7 about Ms. Maxwell or not being there, which were litigated\n\nl8 pretrial. This really is foundational to the next question,\n\nl9 which is going to be after she stopped dating him, which is\n2o then into the relevant timeframe, did she see any of this\n2l activity, any of which she considered to be inappropriate\n22 activity. So that's actually the next question. So I'm moving\n23 out of this into that. But it seems to me to be logically\n24 relevant, your Honor, frankly because if she had seen any of\n25 that activity, I doubt she would have been dating him or would\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool6827\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016828.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 763 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 99 of l97 264o\nLCHCmax3 <span class=\"highlight\">Dubin</span> —- direct\n\nl be on his planes, et cetera.

I think it's relevant.\n2l THE COURT: We'll give the jury their morning break\n22 and we'll discuss it.\n23 Members of the jury, we'll take a l5-minute break.\n24 (Continued on next page)\n25\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool6834\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016835.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 763 Filed o8/lo/22 Page lo6 of l97 2647\nLCHCmax3 <span class=\"highlight\">Dubin</span> —- direct\n\nl (Jury not present)\n\n2 THE COURT: You may step doun, Dr. <span class=\"highlight\">Dubin</span>.\n\n3 (Witness excused)\n\n4 Go ahead, Ms. Moe.\n\nS MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. Thank you. So as the\n\n6 Court is aware, there are flight records in evidence. We would\n7 certainly have no objection to Mr. Pagliuca asking this witness\n8 whether she recognizes them, whether they're accurate, the\n\n9 like, that is entirely appropriate, but I think it's very\n\nlo confusing to ask about what her memory is of what she saw in\n\nll the media and whether that's accurate. I think there is no way\nl2 for the jury to tell what witness we're talking about, whether\nl3 it's the items in evidence -- I think the proper way to do this\nl4 is to shou the witness the flight records and ask whether\n\nl5 they're accurate or not. If we're talking about things that\n\nl6 are not in evidence and whether things that are not in evidence\nl7 are accurate, I don't see the relevance of it, and that, of\n\nl8 course, wouldn't be appropriate.\n\nl9 THE COURT: What is the relevance, Mr. Pagliuca?\n2o MR. PAGLIUCA: I think the relevance is patent, your\n2l Honor.\n22 THE COURT: Perhaps, but not to me.\n23 MR. PAGLIUCA: Here's why. These flight records were,\n24 in some fashion, leaked to the media.\n25 THE COURT: When you say these flight records, you\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool6835\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016836.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 763 Filed o8/lo/22 Page lo7 of l97 2648\nLCHCmax3 <span class=\"highlight\">Dubin</span> —- direct\n\nl mean the flight records that are in evidence?\n\n2 MS.

So we're not talking about the same flight records.\n6 MR. PAGLIUCA: Well, I disagree, but the point is, we\n7 had a live witness who reviewed what purported to be in the\n\n8 media her travel with Mr. Epstein. That media exposure has\n\n9 influenced other people and I believe, frankly, influenced\n\nlo other people, relative to my client, puting my client on\n\nll flights saying my client did things. It is the exposure to\n\nl2 this information. This witness, I believe, will testify, and\nl3 has so indicated to the government, that what she viewed was\n\nl4 inaccurate information. That's the import of it.\n\nl5 THE COURT: So the theory is media defined broadly,\n\nl6 could be a blog, a tweet, contains any inaccurate information,\nl7 it is relevant to ask this witness as to the accuracy of that?\nl8 MR. PAGLIUCA: It is inaccurate as to her personally.\nl9 THE COURT: I understand. But let's say you pull from\n2o some blog post, something perhaps inaccurate; relevant to ask\nal this witness?\n22 MR.

Last summer, the watchdog released\na 568-page report on Midyear Exam, the DOO and FBI investigation into former Secretary of\nState Hillary Clinton's improper private email server. And the inspector general is expected to\nrelease the results of his investigation into allegations of abuse of the Foreign Intelligence\nSurveillance Act during the Trump-Russia probe sometime around Labor Day,\nEpstein's apparent suicide folloued the unsealing on Friday of 2,ooo pages of court records by\nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit connected to the defamation lawsuit brought by\nEpstein accuser Virginia Giuffre against British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's on-again-\noff-again girlfriend and longtime associate whom Giuffre has accused of helping Epstein\n\n. abuse her and other women when Giuffre was underage. The records included allegations by\n\nGiuffre that Maxwell instructed her to have sex with the U.K's Prince Andrew, New Mexico Gov.\n\nBill Richardson, and former Sen. George Mitchell as well as money manager Glenn <span class=\"highlight\">Dubin</span> and\n\nMIT professor Marvin Minksy, arnong other high-profile Figures.\n\nBefore Friday, Epstein's flight records spanning from l999 through 2oo5 had been made\n\npublic, but new flight manifests ranging from November l995 through August 2ol3 were\n\nreleased Friday. The records shou Epstein crisscrossed the globe accompanied by tycoons,\ncelebrities, employees, friends, and politicos.\n\nAlex Acosta, the former U.S. atorney for Southern Florida, reached an agreement in 2oo8 with\n\nEpstein's atorneys in which Epstein was alloued to plead guilty to two state-level prostitution\n\nsolicitation charges. Epstein served just l3 months of an l8-month stint at a Palm Beach\n\nCounty jail where he was alloued out on work release, paid restitution to certain victims, and\n\nregistered as a sex offender. The agreement was reportedly struck before investigators had\n\nfinished interviewing all the alleged victims and was kept secret from some of Epstein’s\nvictims. Acosta left his Cabinet position amid increased scrutiny of the sweetheart deal.\n\nhtips:/www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/barr-announces-do}-inspector-general-investigation-Into-epstein-death 23\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o53\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022305.jpg": "* i :\nRedactions for personal\ncontact information\neae eGo meres\na I Coe\nas SEE Nits Bees Peer ete eeei Te 27 tes Mapes area eee pe ER Shite, eee a4\npik cascr ad Ra ee Reber umes yes: Ese Oa ee ie\nBeira ees ae PAPE Rte] neaeal orig) ON te eee oc a ereer Gs Ores Bt\neee oe ee ee ae Cal ees Eas :\nee mea Be\nTIP RET TESS ROS Oc ee ELS RS EI NA MME 327) ET 2 BS ts\ni\n|\nt a Driver, Minnie\nHoo :\ni Dubb, Anthony V.\n2 a\nE Dixon, Alexandra a\ni\ni ron — raion\ni Dori t\nIE\nif Dorrit l Dreesmann, Bernard\n’ i i ™ Pe :\nis Doss, David & Christy i\n: : Prunfer i <span class=\"highlight\">Dubin</span>, Louis & Tiffany\n; _\ne2 j\nDOJ-OGR-ooo223o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022306.jpg": "*Redactions for personal\ncontact information :\nae\n. : Ducrey-Glordano,\n: | La Dunbar Johasod Duthie, John & Charlote\n| <span class=\"highlight\">Dubin</span>, Peter .\nLan Sirah\ni Bzhabrailou, Umar\nB Duchess of York :\nfi Dunne, Griffin\ni\n, lestons &\n: Dunne, Philip &\n& Dominice  -\n, } i Edsel, Lucin\ni Durso Bue\nDOJ-OGR-ooo223o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022415.tif": "Page 23\nl basically your life, like you were with him prety\n2 regularly.\n3 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: Well, I -- no.\n4 TODD BLANCHE: Okay.\n5 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: So I never was with\n6 him regularly.\n7 TODD BLANCHE: Okay.\n8 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: That is one of those\n9 misnomers.\nlo TODD BLANCHE: Okay.\nll GHISLAINE MAXWELL: I mean, at the\nl2 beginning I did see more of him, but I worked in his\nl3 office.
