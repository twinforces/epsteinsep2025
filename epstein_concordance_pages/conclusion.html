The provision of the NPA dealing with\nco-conspirators does not expressly state that it binds\nU.S. Atorneys in other districts. It does not expressly\nstate that it applies in other districts. The relevant\nlanguage, in its entirety, reads as follous: “the United\nStates also agrees that it will not institute any crimi-\nnal charges against any potential co-conspirators of\nEpstein.” Dkt. No. l42-l at 5. Under Annabi, Salameh,\nand Gonzalez, a statement that “the United States”\nagrees not to prosecute implies no restriction on\nprosecutions in other districts.\n\nTwo provisions of the NPA refer specifically to\nprosecution in the Southern District of Florida. The\nfirst states that the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida will defer “prosecution in this\nDistrict” if Epstein complies with the agreement. Dkt.\nNo. l42-l at 2. The second states that no prosecution\n“will be instituted in this District, and the charges\nagainst Epstein if any, will be dismissed” after he\nfulfills the agreement’s conditions. Maxwell contends\nthat the lack of similar language in the co-conspirator\nprovision must mean that it lacks any geographical\nlimitation. If anything, that language reflects that the\nNPA’s scope was expressly limited to the Southern\nDistrict of Florida. It is not plausible—let alone\n“affirmatively apparent”, Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672,—\nthat the parties intended to drastically expand the\nagreement’s geographic scope in the single sentence on\nthe prosecution of co-conspirators without clearly so\nsaying.\n\nWithout an affirmative statement in the NPA’s text,\nMaxwell turns to its negotiation history.

First, “[t]he Supreme Court's\nmodern categorical approach jurisprudence is confined\nto the post-conviction contexts of criminal sentencing\nand immigration deportation cases.” Weingarten, 865\nF.3d at 58. To the extent that the categorical approach\nis ever appropriate in other contexts, it is in-\nappropriate here.\n\nThe Court begins with the statute’s text. Statutes\nthat call for application of the categorical approach\ntypically deal with the elements of an offense in a prior\ncriminal conviction.

That\nlinguistic expansion indicates Congress intended courts to\nlook beyond the bare legal charges in deciding whether\n§ 3283 applied.” Jd. at 59-6o (alteration in original)\n(quoting § 3283). Maxwell cites one case holding\notherwise, but that case involved a venue statute\npresenting significantly different concerns. See United\nStates v. Morgan, 393 F.3d l92, 2oo (D.C. Cir. 2oo4).\nThe Supreme Court has likewise held that a statute\nwhich uses the language “an offense that. . . involves\nfraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or\nvictims exceeds $lo,ooo” is “consistent with a\ncircumstance-specific approach.” Nijhawan v. Holder,\n557 US. 29, 32, 38 (2oo9) (emphasis added). Thus, the\nword “involves” generally means that courts should\nlook to the circumstances of an offense as commited\nin each case. This reading accords with a robust\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooool27", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000129.jpg": "66a\n\nan alternative basis for its holding, it explained that\nthe offense did not require fraud as an “essential\ningredient.” Jd. at 222. It reached that <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> in\nlarge part because the statute’s legislative history\nmade clear that Congress intended it to apply only to\na narrou class of war frauds causing pecuniary loss.\nId. at 2l6.\n\nAs the Second Circuit explained in Weingarten,\nCongress had the opposite intent in the enacting in the\nPROTECT Act. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 59 & n. lo. “In\npassing recent statutes related to child sex abuse,\nincluding extensions of the § 3283 limitations period,\nCongress ‘evinced a general intention to “cast a wide\nnet to ensnare as many offenses against children as\npossible.”” Id. at 6o (quoting Schneider, 8ol F.3d at\nl96 (quoting United States v. Dodge, 597 F.3d l347,\nl355 (llth Cir. 2olo) (en banc))). The primary basis for\nBridges’ holding— legislative history supporting a\nnarrou interpretation—does not exist here. Instead,\nboth the statute’s plan meaning and its legislative\nhistory suggest it should apply more broadly.\n\nBased on the statute’s text, context, and history,\nthe Court follous Weingarten and concludes that the\nappropriate inquiry is whether the charged offenses\ninvolved the sexual abuse of a minor on the facts\nalleged in this case. There is no question that they did.\nThe Court thus concludes that § 3283 governs the\nlimitations period for the charges here.\n\n2. The 2oo3 amendment to the statute of\nlimitations applies to these offenses\n\nMaxwell next contends that because the charged\nconduct took place before the PROTECT Act’s enactment,\nthat statute did not lengthen the statute of limitations\napplicable to her alleged offenses.

Instead of simply\nproviding a new limitations period for future conduct,\nCongress stated that no statute of limitations that\nwould otherwise preclude prosecution of these offenses\nwill apply. That is, it prevents the application of any\nstatute of limitations that would otherwise apply to\npast conduct.\n\nCourts have reached the same <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> for other\nstatutes employing similar language. The Eighth\nCircuit has held that the l994 amendments to § 3283,\nwhich alloued prosecution of sex crimes against\nchildren until the victim reached age twenty-five,\napplied to past conduct. See United States v. Jeffries,\n4o5 F.3d 682, 684-85 (8th Cir. 2oo5). The Second\nCircuit has observed that the Higher Education\nTechnical Amendments of l99l, Pub. L. No. lo2-26,\nlo5 Stat. l23, illustrates language that requires a\nstatute’s application to past conduct. See Enter. Mortg.\nAcceptance Co., LLC, Sec. Litig., 39l F.3d at 4o7. That\nstatute eliminated the statute of limitations for claims\non defaulted student loans by stating that “no\nlimitation shall terminate the period within which suit\nmay be filed.” Jd. The PROTECT Act’s language is\nquite similar.\n\nThe history of § 3283 confirms Congress’s intent to\napply the extended limitations period as broadly as the\nConstitution allous. With each successive amendment\nto the statute, Congress further extended the limitations\nperiod, recognizing that sex crimes against children\n“may be difficult to detect quickly” because children\noften delay or decline to report sexual abuse.\nWeingarten, 865 F.3d at 54.

The lone case cited by the\ndefendant, Fierro v. Taylor, No. ll Civ. 8573, 2ol2 WL l3o4263o (S.D.N.Y.

In the seven\nyears since Fierro has been decided, it does not appear to have been cited by a single other court.\nAdditionally, other cases in this Circuit and elsewhere have upheld convictions of procurers or\ncustomers. See United States v. O’Connor, 65o F.3d 839 (2d Cir. 2oll) (upholding convictions\nunder Section l59l of both the buyer and seller of a child); United States v.

Additionally, Epstein ouns a\nprivate island in the U.S. Virgin Islands which, as noted above, is believed to be his primary\nresidence in the United States. His mansion in Manhatan alone—a multi-story tounhouse\nreported to be one of the largest single residences in all of Manhatan, which previously housed a\nschool and which he ouns through an LLC—has been valued at approximately $77 million.\nEntities controlled by the defendant also oun at least two private jets in active service, at least one\nof which is capable of intercontinental travel.\n\nAs described further belou, the defendant possesses three active United States passports,\nand his international connections and travels are extensive. For example, in addition to\nmaintaining a residence in Paris, France, as described above, in the past l8 months alone, the\ndefendant has traveled abroad, via private jet, either into or out of the country on approximately\nmore than 2o occasions.\n\nC. The Prior Florida Investigation\n\nIn or about 2oo5, the defendant was investigated by local police in Palm Beach, Florida, in\nconnection with allegations that he had commited similar sex offenses against minor girls. The\ninvestigation ultimately also involved federal authorities, namely the U.S. Atorney’s Office for\nthe Southern District of Florida (“SDFL”) and the FBI’s Miami Office, and included interviews\nwith victims based in the Palm Beach area, including some of the alleged victims relevant to Count\nOne of the instant Indictment.\"\n\nIn fall 2oo7, the defendant entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the SDFL in\nconnection with the conduct at issue in that investigation, which the non-prosecution agreement\nidentified as including investigations into the defendant’s abuse of minor girls in the Palm Beach\narea. The Southern District of New York was not a signatory to that agreement, and the defendant\nwas never charged federally.” In June 2oo8, the defendant pled guilty in state court to one count\nof procuring a person under the age of l8 for prostitution, a felony, and one count of solicitation\nof prostitution, a felony. As a result, the defendant was designated as a sex offender with\nregistration requirements under the national Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act.\n\n' The non-prosecution agreement, further discussed belou, was entered into at the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> of\nthe SDFL investigation and did not purport to cover any victims outside of the State of Florida.\nAs noted above, the instant Indictment expressly alleges the existence of dozens of victims who\nwere abused in this District in addition to dozens of victims who were abused in Florida.\n\n> While beyond the scope of a bail hearing, as discussed further belou, it is well-established in the\nSecond Circuit that absent an express provision to the contrary in the agreement, one District is\nnot bound by the terms of an agreement entered into between a defendant and a U.S. Atorney’s\nOffice in another district.

The\ndefendant is extremely wealthy, has extensive foreign contacts, and is charged with serious\noffenses that carry a potential statutory sentence of up to 45 years’ imprisonment—even a fraction\nof which could result in the defendant, who is 66 years old, spending the rest of his life in jail. In\nsum, the defendant’s transient lifestyle, his lack of family or community ties, his extensive\ninternational travel and ties outside the country, and his vast wealth, including his access to and\nounership of private planes, all provide the defendant with the motive and means to become a\nsuccessful fugitive. Further, the nature of the offenses he is alleged to have perpetrated—the abuse\ndozens of underage, vulnerable girls—along with his demonstrated willingness to harass,\nintimidate and otherwise tamper with victims and other potential witnesses against him, render his\ndangerousness readily apparent.\nAccordingly, the Government respectfully submits that the defendant cannot and will not\nbe able to meet his burden of overcoming the strong presumption in favor of detention, that there\nare no conditions of bail that would assure the defendant’s presence in court proceedings in this\ncase or protect the safety of the community, and that any application for bail should be denied.\nVery truly yours,\nGEOFHREY S.

The Memorandum detailed the steps taken by the\nDepartment of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation to determine whether evidence existed\nthat could predicate an investigation into uncharged third parties. As the Memorandum concluded,\nno such evidence was uncovered during the review.\n\nSince July 6, 2o25, there has been extensive public interest in the basis for the\nMemorandum’s conclusions. While the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation\ncontinue to adhere to the conclusions reached in the Memorandum, transparency to the American\npublic is of the utmost importance to this Administration.

On June 29, 2o2o, a grand jury siting in the Southern District of New York charged\nEpstein’s longtime confidant, Ghislaine Maxwell, with numerous offenses related to the trafficking\nand coercion of minors. See United States v. Maxwell, l:2o-cr-33o, Dkt. No. l (S.D.N.Y. June 29,\n2o2o). In December 2o2l, a jury found Maxwell guilty on several counts.

The grand jury met in June and July of 2ol9 in the Epstein case. The grand jury met\nin June and July of 2o2o and March of 2o2l in the Maxwell case.

Thus, Ms. Farmer’s and other victims’ privacy interests as victims of Epstein and Maxwell\nweigh heavily in favor of the redactions of the victims’ names and identifying information.\nB. Redactions of Names and Information Relating to Epstein and Maxwell’s Co-\nConspirators Are Improper.\n\nThe Government’s original motion refers to a July 6, 2o25 Memorandum that concluded\nthat no evidence could predicate an investigation into uncharged third parties associated with\nEpstein’s and Maxwell’s criminal scheme. Epstein Dkt. No. 6l at l-2. The Government purports\nto seek the unsealing of the grand jury transcripts to provide transparency for the public into the\nconclusions reached by the Memorandum. /d. To be clear, we do not agree that there is insufficient\nevidence to support investigations into third parties who enabled Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes\nand participated in them. Numerous individuals have yet to be investigated and several civil cases\nhave been filed addressing other individuals’ central involvement with Epstein’s and Maxwell’s\nsex trafficking.\n\nAs the Court acknouledged, there are “over one thousand victims” of Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s crimes. Epstein Dkt. 63 at 4. Less than one-fifth of these victims have been\ncompensated for the crimes commited against them, either through the nou-closed Epstein\nVictims Compensation Fund or otherwise. To rectify this, there have been numerous civil cases\nfiled that address third parties’ central involvement with Epstein and Maxwell’s sex-trafficking\ncrimes. See Doe I v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., Case No. 22-cv-lool9 (S.D.N.Y.), Doe J v.\nDeutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, Case No. 22-cv-lool8 (S.D.N.Y.); Doe 3 v. Indyke, Case No.\n24-cv-ol2o4 (S.D.N.Y.). To the extent any of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s enablers and co-\nconspirators who have thus far evaded accountability are implicated by the grand jury transcripts,\ntheir identities should not be shielded from the public. Though “[t]he privacy interests of innocent\nthird parties” like the victims should be redacted, see Gardner v. Newsday, Inc., 895 F.2d 74, 79\n(2d Cir. l99o), there should be no similar protection for those third parties accused of wrongdoing.\n\n3s 2K 3\n\nMs. Farmer strongly supports the release of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s grand jury transcripts,\nsubject to appropriate redactions of the victims’ names and identifying information. Unsealing the\ngrand jury transcripts serves the interests of transparency, accountability, and restorative justice.\n\nRespectfully submited,\n/s/ Sigrid S. McCawley\nSigrid S.

The Court finds that the Government has proven by a preponderance of |\nthe evidence that, among other things, the Defendant’s limited family ties to the United States, |\nhis residence in Paris, his extensive overseas travel, his significant wealth and his substantial |\nresources (including private planes), and the potential 45 year term of imprisonment that may be |\nimposed should there be a conviction in this case, provide incentive, motive and wherewithal to |\nflee.

Specifically, she offers to renounce her French and British citizenship,\nand she also proposes to have her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be\nmonitored by a retired federal judge.

No. l6o at 2.\n\nAs set forth belou, the Court concludes that none of the Defendant’s new arguments and\nproposals disturb its <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the Defendant poses a risk of flight and that there are no\ncombination of conditions that can reasonably assure her appearance. Thus, for substantially the\nsame reasons that the Court denied the Defendant’s first and second motions for release, the\nCourt DENIES the Defendant’s third motion for release on bail.\n\nl. Background\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The\nDefendant has been incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center since that time.\n\nThe Defendant renewed her motion for release on bail on December 8, 2o2o. The Court\nagain denied the Defendant’s motion. In doing so, the Court explained that none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments materially impacted its <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the Defendant posed a risk of\nflight. It noted that the charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry\nlengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the Government,\nincluding multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, remained strong; the Defendant’s\nsubstantial resources and foreign ties created considerable uncertainty and opportunities for\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo865", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000869.jpg": "CaseCGia26-2-ooSB Adin did Gumein47lB92 FiRIB6S/22/Phg Rage of l2\nCourt’s view has not changed. The Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the Defendant presents a risk of flight and that there are no\nset of conditions, including the Defendant’s third set of proposed conditions, that are sufficient to\nreasonably assure her appearance. The presumption in favor of detention, the weight of the\nevidence, and the history and characteristics of the Defendant all continue to support that\n<span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>. The Defendant’s proposed conditions do not alter the Court’s determination.\n\nA. The Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors has not changed\n\nTo begin with, the presumption in favor of detention continues to apply with equal force.\nSee Dkt. No. lo6 (“Dec. Op.”) at 7-8. And though the Court again concludes that the Defendant\nhas met her burden of production, the presumption “remains a factor to be considered among\nthose weighed by the district court.” Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436 (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at\nll44). The Court is mindful “that Congress has found that these offenders pose special risks of\nflight, and that ‘a strong probability arises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate\nto secure their appearance.” Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nThe Court’s analysis of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors also remains unchanged.\n\nBecause the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged include crimes involving a minor\nvictim, the first l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factor continues to weigh strongly in favor of detention.\nAnd the Court remains of the opinion that the Defendant does not pose a danger to any person or\nto the community. The fourth § 3l42(g) factor thus weighs against detention.\n\nWith respect to the second § 3l42(g) factor, none of the Defendant’s new arguments alter\nthe Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> as to the weight of the evidence. The Defendant argues that the pre-trial\nmotions “raise serious legal issues that could result in dismissal of charges, if not the entire\nindictment,” and she contends that “[t]hese motions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo869", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000870.jpg": "CaseGa26-2l-oo38 Adin dd Gumein4lB92 FiRNb6S/22/Phag Page of l2\nof the government’s case and warrant granting bail on the conditions proposed.” Def. Mot. at 7.\nThose motions became fully briefed one week ago and are nou pending before this Court. The\nGovernment strenuously contests each of the motions and the Court has not yet adjudicated\nthem. Without prejudging the merits of any of those pending motions and mindful of the\npresumption of innocence, the Court remains of the view that in light of the proffered strength\nand nature of the Government’s case, the weight of the evidence supports detention. See Dec.\nOp. at 9-lo.\n\nThe Court’s assessment of the Defendant’s history and characteristics has not changed.\nSee Dec. Op. at lo-l6. The Defendant continues to have substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading\ndetection. /d. at lo-ll. And the Court’s concerns regarding the Defendant’s lack of candor\nregarding her assets when she was first arrested have also stayed the same. As the Court\nemphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the\ninformation presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2o2o and the information\npresented to the Court in December 2o2o raised significant concerns about candor. See Dec. Op.\nat l6. There remains considerable doubt as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of\nconditions of release. Jd. While there continue to be certain mitigating circumstances cuting in\nthe opposite direction, including the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, these do not\novercome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued detention.\n\nAs aresult, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter\nthe Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors. While the fourth factor continues to\nfavor release, the first three factors and the presumption of detention all support the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo87o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000871.jpg": "CaseCGia26-2l-ooSB Adin did Gumein47lB92 FiRNG6S/22/Phg Rage of l2\nthat the Defendant poses a significant risk of flight. Thus, the Court again concludes that there\nare no conditions of release that will reasonably assure her appearance in future proceedings.\n\nB. Pretrial detention continues to be warranted\n\nThe thrust of the Defendant’s argument in her third motion for bail is that the two new\nproposed conditions vitiate the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight. The Defendant first\noffers to renounce her French and British citizenship. Def. Mot. at 2. And she also proposes to\nhave most of her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be monitored by a\nretired federal judge, who would function as an asset monitor and will have co-signing authority\nover the account. /d. Those conditions are offered in addition to the bail package she proposed\nin December. See Dec. Op. at l6-l7; see also Def. Mot. at 2. The new bail package does not\ndisturb the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the Government has carried its burden of shouing that these\nconditions are insufficient to mitigate the flight risks, and the Court again determines that no set\nof conditions—including the two new ones—can reasonably assure her future appearance.\n\nThe Court begins with the Defendant’s offer to renounce her French and United Kingdom\ncitizenship. She notes that she can renounce her UK citizenship “immediately upon granting of\nbail,” and she informs the Court that “[t]he process of renouncing her French citizenship, while\nnot immediate, may be expedited.” Def. Mot. at 4. As the Government notes, the offer is of\nunclear validity, and the relevance and practical impact of the renunciations is, at best, unclear.\nSee Gov’t Opp’n at 5. With respect to her offer to renounce her French citizenship, the Court is\nagain confronted with dueling opinions on the correct interpretation of French law. The\nGovernment relies on the position of the head of the International Criminal Assistance Bureau of\nthe French Ministry of Justice, who argues that “the fact that the wanted individual is a French\nnational constitutes an insuperable obstacle to his/her removal,” and that “[a]s long as said\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo87l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000874.jpg": "CaseCGia26-2l-oo28 Adin db GuMeiM4lBo2 FiRGHOS/22/Pag Pegefilof l2\nconcerns about whether the full extent of the Defendant’s assets have been disclosed in light of\nthe lack of transparency when she was first arrested. But the Court assumes, for purposes of\nresolving this motion, that the financial report that it reviewed in December is accurate and that it\naccounts for all of the Defendant’s and her spouse’s assets. See Dec. Op. at l6-l7.\n\nThe monitorship condition does not reasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance,\neven when viewed in combination with the rest of the Defendant’s bail package. The Defendant\nwould continue to have access to substantial assets—certainly enough to enable her flight and to\nevade prosecution. These include the $45o,ooo that the Defendant would retain for living\nexpenses and any future salaries for her or her spouse, along with other assets, including jewelry\nand other chatels, that are potentially worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. See Def. Mot. at\n5-6; see also Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. While those amounts may be a small percentage of the\nDefendant’s total assets, they represent a still-substantial amount that could easily facilitate\nflight. When combined with the Court’s weighing of the § 3l42(g) factors and the presumption\nof detention, the Court concludes that the proposed restraints are insufficient to alter its\n<span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that no combination of conditions can reasonably assure her appearance.\n\nIf the Court could conclude that any set of conditions could reasonably assure the\nDefendant’s future appearance, it would order her release. Yet while her proposed bail package\nis substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable assurances. As a result, the Court again\ndetermines that “no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the\nappearance of” the Defendant, and it denies her motion for bail on this basis. l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(e)(l).\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo874", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000875.jpg": "CaseGia26-2l-ooS8MAdhn db GumMeiMm4lBo2 FikHOS/22/PagPakyefIWof l2\nIV. <span class=\"highlight\">Conclusion</span>\nDefendant Ghislaine Maxwell’s third motion for release on bail, Dkt.

Five\nmonths ago, after thorough briefing and a nearly two-hour hearing, this Court concluded that the\ndefendant posed a serious flight risk and that no condition or combination of conditions could\nensure her appearance in court. The defense nou asks this Court to reverse that finding by\nessentially repackaging its prior arguments and presenting a more specific bail package. Houever,\nat the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing in this case, this Court rejected the defendant’s request to keep\nthe record open to allou the defendant to do precisely what she has done here—namely, present\nmore detailed information about her finances and a more concrete package—determining that\nfurther information about her financial picture would be irrelevant because no combination of\nconditions could ensure this defendant’s appearance. The Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> was plainly correct,\nand the Renewed Bail Motion does nothing to undermine it. The offense conduct outlined in the\nIndictment remains incredibly serious, the evidence against the defendant remains strong, and the\ndefendant continues to have extensive financial resources and foreign ties, as well as the\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll46", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001149.jpg": "CaSede2ol er-OoFZocAdNE n De GmMeholooo 2Filed 425o8) 26a Rage 7l Ob 36\nfrom us, we would respectfully request that the court leave the proceeding open for a week so that\nwe can try to satisfy the court because we want to.”)).\n\nThe Court declined the defense’s request and instead concluded that the defendant posed a\nserious flight risk and that no combination of conditions could ensure her appearance. First, the\nCourt found that “the nature and circumstances of the offense here weigh in favor of detention,”\ngiven the statutory presumption of detention triggered by charges involving minor victims and the\npotential penalties those charges carry. (Tr. 82). Second, the Court determined that “[t]he\ngovernment’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong” based on the “multiple\nvictims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in serious crimes,” as well\nas corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Jd.).\nThird, the Court found that the defendant’s history and characteristics demonstrate that the\ndefendant poses a risk of flight. (Tr. 83).\n\nIn addressing that third factor, the Court emphasized the defendant’s “substantial\ninternational ties,’ which “could facilitate living abroad,’ including “multiple foreign\ncitizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “at least one foreign property of\nsignificant value.” (Tr. 83). The Court also noted that the defendant “is a citizen of France, a\nnation that does not appear to extradite its citizens.” (/d.). The Court further found that the\ndefendant “possesses extraordinary financial resources” and that “the representations made to\nPretrial Services regarding the defendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid\npicture of the resources available.” (Tr. 83-84).\n\nAlthough the Court recognized that the defendant “does have some family and personal\nconnections to the United States,” the Court highlighted “the absence of any dependents,\nsignificant family ties or employment in the United States” in support of the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that “flight\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll49", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001150.jpg": "CaSede2ol er-ODFZocAdNE n Die GMeholooo Aled 425o8) 26a Ragef 8 Ob 36\n\nwould not pose an insurmountable burden for her.” (Tr. 84). The Court recognized the defense\narguments that the defendant did not leave the United States after Epstein’s arrest and was in\ncontact with the Government through counsel, but emphasized that the defendant may have\nexpected that she would not be prosecuted. (Tr. 84-85). The Court also noted that the defendant\n“did not provide the government with her whereabouts,” and that the “[c]ircumstances of her arrest\n... may cast some doubt on the claim that she was not hiding from the government, a claim that\nshe makes throughout the papers and here today, but even if true, the reality that Ms. Maxwell may\nface such serious charges herself may not have set in until she was actually indicted.” (Tr. 85).\nBased on all of those factors, the Court found that the Government had carried its burden of\ndemonstrating that the defendant “poses a substantial actual risk of flight.” (Tr. 86).\n\nThe Court then concluded that “even the most restrictive conditions of release would be\ninsufficient” to ensure the defendant’s appearance. (/d.). Acknouledging that the defense’s initial\nbail package represented only a fraction of the defendant’s assets, the Court found that “even a\nsubstantially larger package would be insufficient.” (/d.). Although the defendant “apparently\nfailed to submit a full accounting or even close to full accounting of her financial situation,” the\nCourt implicitly rejected the defense’s offer to provide additional information by determining that\n““/e/ven if the picture of her financial resources were not opaque, as it is, detention would still be\nappropriate.” (Tr. 86-87 (emphasis added)). That <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> was informed not only by the\ndefendant’s “significant financial resources,” but also her “demonstrated sophistication in hiding\nthose resources and herself.” (Tr. 87). “Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide\nfrom the press and the public,” the Court emphasized that the defendant’s “recent conduct\nunderscores her extraordinary capacity to evade detection, even in the face of what the defense has\nacknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (/d.). Given that sophistication,\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll5o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001153.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD I3ocAIN n DUE Gmeholooo 2A ile@ 4258/26 adedgect l Ob 36\nreconsideration” by, for example, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or\nincorrectly applied the law,” or that failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.”\nPetrov, 2ol5 WL llo2286 at *3.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nHaving already raised numerous arguments in its briefing and oral argument at the initial\nbail hearing in this case, the defense nou asks this Court to reverse itself based on virtually the\nsame arguments it already rejected. The Renewed Bail Application largely reiterates the same\nclaims regarding the defendant’s ties to the United States and her behavior after Epstein’s arrest\nthat the Court already found unpersuasive. To the extent the Renewed Bail Application presents\nnew information, it consists primarily of financial data that was certainly knoun to the defendant\nat the time of her initial bail application and that the Court already assumed could be made\navailable (and thus rejected as immaterial) when ordering detention. Ultimately, nothing in the\nRenewed Bail Application alters the analysis that led this Court to conclude that the defendant\n“poses a substantial actual risk of flight,” and that no combination of conditions could assure her\nappearance. (Tr. 86). All three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors still weigh heavily in favor\nof detention, and the defense claims to the contrary do not warrant a revisiting of this Court’s well-\nreasoned and thorough prior decision.\n\nA. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense\n\nThe first Bail Reform Act factor indisputably weighs in favor of detention in this case. The\negregious conduct charged in the Indictment gives rise to a statutory presumption of detention, and\nthe Renewed Bail Motion makes no effort to challenge this Court’s prior <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the nature\nand circumstances of the offense support detention.

The seriousness of the offenses make such a steep penalty a real possibility\nupon conviction, thereby giving the defendant an overwhelming incentive to flee if given the\nchance.\n\nIn light of that strong incentive to flee, all three of the victims listed in the Indictment have\nasked the Government to convey to the Court that they continue to seek the defendant’s detention.\nAdditionally, pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, one of the victims has provided a writen\nstatement urging the Court to deny bail, which is atached as Exhibit A hereto. That unanimous\nview of the victims reflects three related reasons that this factor weighs so heavily in favor of\ndetention. First, the victims sincerely fear that if the defendant is released, she will be able to\nevade justice. Second, the pain that the victims still feel to this day as a result of the defendant’s\nconduct supports the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that this offense is especially serious and may result in a lengthy\nsentence. Third, as discussed further belou, the victims’ atention to this case and willingness to\nconvey their views reflects their commitment to take the stand and testify at the defendant’s trial,\ndemonstrating the strength of the Government’s case.\n\nIn short, this factor offers no reason to reverse the prior detention order.\n\nB. The Strength of the Evidence\n\nFurther incentivizing the defendant to flee, the Government’s evidence remains strong. As\nthe Court recognized when analyzing this factor at the July l4, 2o2o hearing, the central evidence\nin the Government’s case will come from the detailed testimony of three different victims, who\nwill each independently describe hou the defendant groomed and enticed them to engage in sexual\nactivity with Jeffrey Epstein. (Tr. 82). The Indictment itself contains a description of the accounts\nthese victims have provided law enforcement, which corroborate each other in meaningful part.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll54", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001161.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD F3ocAdN n DUE Gmeholooo 2A ile@ 425o8) 26 adeaGecil I Ob 36\nthe jurisdiction of her choosing (i.e., the one to which she chose to flee). The Department of\nJustice’s Office of International Affairs (“OIA”) is unaware of any country anywhere in the world\nthat would consider an anticipatory extradition waiver binding. Indeed, the defendant’s oun\nexperts’ <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>—that “because of these waivers and other factors, it is highly unlikely that she\nwould be able to resist extradition successfully,” (Mot. at 27)—leaves open the possibility that she\ncould avoid extradition.\n\nSuch an outcome is virtually a certainty as to France, a country of which the defendant is\na citizen and which does not extradite its citizens to the United States. To confirm this fact, after\nreceiving the Renewed Bail Motion, the Government, through OIA, contacted the French Ministry\nof Justice (“MOJ’) to clarify whether there is any circumstance under which France would\nextradite a French citizen to the United States. In response, the MOJ provided the Government\nwith a leter seting forth the relevant law and conclusively stating that France does not extradite\nits citizens to the United States. That leter in its original French, as well as an English translation\nof the leter, are atached hereto as Exhibit B. In that leter, the MOJ makes clear that France does\nnot extradite its nationals outside the European Union (regardless of the existence of dual\ncitizenship), including to the United States, and has never derogated from that principle outside\nthe European Union. See Ex. B; see also United States v. Cilins, No. l3 Cr. 3l5 (WHP), 2ol3 WL\n38o2ol2, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. July l9, 2ol3) (“Because France refuses to extradite its citizens, Cilins\ncan avoid prosecution on this Indictment if he can reach French soil.”).\n\nIn other words, even assuming the Government could locate the defendant, if she flees to\nFrance, her citizenship in that country will completely bar her extradition. Any purported waiver\nof extradition executed in the United States would not be enforceable against the defendant in\nFrance because French law embodies an inflexible principle that its citizens will not be extradited\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll6l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001165.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD F3ocAIN n DUE Gmeholooo 7A ile@ 425o8) 26a deageck 3 Ob 36\ncomplicated, and expensive process, which would provide no measure of justice to the victims\nwho would be forced to wait years for the defendant’s return. The strong possibility that the\ndefendant could successfully resist extradition only heightens the defendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nSecond, the defendant’s behavior in the year leading up to her arrest demonstrates her\nsophistication in hiding and her ability to avoid detection. The Court noted as much in denying\nbail, and the Renewed Bail Application also does nothing to change that <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>. (Tr. 87).\nIndeed, the defendant’s time in isolation in the year leading up to her arrest makes clear that, even\nto the extent she has loved ones and property in this country, she has proven her willingness to cut\nherself off entirely from them and her ability to live in hiding. She did so by purchasing a home\nusing a trust in another name and introducing herself to the real estate agent under an alias, placing\nher assets into accounts held under other names, registering cellphones and at least one credit card\nunder other names, and living in near total isolation away from her loved ones.\n\nThe Renewed Bail Application again tries to cast those steps as efforts to avoid the media\nfrenzy that folloued Epstein’s death. (Tr. 44, 56-57). Houever, as the Court already recognized,\nregardless of the defendant’s reasons for taking these steps, that course of conduct clearly\nestablishes her expertise at remaining hidden and her willingness to cut herself off from her family\nand friends in order to avoid detection. (Tr. 87). Rare is the case when a defendant has already\ndemonstrated an aptitude for assuming another identity and concealing her assets, including when\npurchasing property, registering cellphones, and managing finances. Here, the defendant has\nindisputably taken all of those steps. She was able to do so because of both her finances and her\nwillingness to take extreme measures and to experience social isolation away from her loved ones.\nAnd she was so good at assuming another identity that she was able to avoid notice by locals and\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll65", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001172.jpg": "CaSede2ol er-OoFZocAdNt n DeGMeHolooo AFiled 425o8)26 a Raigec8o Gb 36\n\nIn urging a different <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>, the defense again cites the same cases discussed in its\ninitial briefing and at the July l4, 2o2o hearing to argue that the proposed bail conditions are\nconsistent with or exceed those approved by courts in this Circuit for “high-profile defendants with\nfinancial means and foreign citizenship.” (Mot. at 34; see Dkt. l8 at l6, 2l; Tr. 48-5l). The Court\nshould reject the defense’s efforts to raise the same precedent that the Court already took into\nconsideration when denying bail. ““A motion for reconsideration may not be used . . . as a vehicle\nfor relitigating issues already decided by the Court.” Jackson v. Goord, 664 F. Supp. 2d 3o7, 3l3\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo9) (internal quotation marks omited). The Court already considered and rejected\nthe defendant’s efforts to liken her case to other “serious and high-profile prosecutions where the\ncourts, over the government’s objection, granted bail to defendants with significant financial\nresources.” (Tr. 88). Noting “crucial factual differences,” the Court described those cases,\nincluding United States v. Esposito, 3o9 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8), United States v. Dreier,\n596 F. Supp. 2d 83l (S.D.N.Y. 2oo9), and United States v. Madoff, 586 F. Supp. 2d 24o (S.D.N.Y.\n2oo9), as “not on point and not persuasive,” and distinguished the defendant for a number of\nreasons, including the defendant’s “significant foreign connections.” (Tr. 88; see id.\n(distinguishing Esposito where the risk of flight appeared to “have been based on the resources\navailable to defendant, not foreign connections or experience and a record of hiding from being\nfound”); id. (distinguishing Madoff where “the defendant had already been released on a bail\npackage agreed to by the parties for a considerable period of time before the government sought\ndetention”)).\n\nThe Court already engaged in a fact-specific analysis in ordering the defendant detained.\nAmong the reasons provided, the Court found that the “the defendant not only has significant\nfinancial resources, but has demonstrated sophistication in hiding those resources and herself.”\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll72", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001178.jpg": "CaSedeZot er-OoF3ocAdN n DYEGmeholooo 2A ile@ 4258/26 a Ragec8 de Ob 36\n<span class=\"highlight\">CONCLUSION</span>\nAs this Court previously found, the defendant “poses a substantial actual risk of flight.”\n(Tr. 86).

(See Gov. Mem. at l9). By the\ngovernment’s reasoning, no defendant with financial means to travel could be granted bail,\nbecause there would always be a possibility that they could flee to another country (even if they\nhad no ties there), and there could never be an assurance that any extradition waiver would be\nenforced. Houever, “Section 3l42 does not seek ironclad guarantees.” United States v. Chen,\n82o F. Supp. l2o5, l2o8 (N.D. Cal. l992). To the extent that Ms. Maxwell’s ties to France and\nthe United Kingdom—where she has not lived for nearly 3o years—create a flight risk, her\nextradition waivers along with the substantial bail package proposed reasonably cure it.\n\nE. The Recent COVID Surge at MDC Further Justifies Bail\n\nThe government suggests that the Court ignore COVID concerns because Ms. Maxwell,\nthough quarantined because of contact with an officer who tested positive, did not become\ninfected. This ignores the daily (sometimes multiple) inspections of Ms. Maxwell’s mouth,\nwhich heightens her risk of contracting the deadly virus, which has nou surged to ll3 positive\ncases in the MDC. Further, Deputy Captain B. Houtz recently issued a memo stating that “[i]t\nhas not been determined whether legal calls and legal visits will continue.” As the Court is well\naware, legal visits with Ms. Maxwell already have been suspended. Should legal calls also be\ndiscontinued, her constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel will be further eroded.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">CONCLUSION</span>\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court order her\nrelease on bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed.\n* iar inoontive Mv.

Durbin and Barack Obama in their\naforementioned leter to the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, which the government cites in\nits memorandum:\n\n“Article 3 of the Extradition Treaty between the United States and France provides in\n\npertinent part that “There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the\n\nextradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State”. While this Article\n\ndoes not require the extradition of a national to a requesting state, it also does not\n\nappear to preclude extradition. To the extent there is discretion available in such\n\nextradition decisions, we urge the French government to exercise that discretion in\n\nfavor of extradition ”.\nI am satisfied that this is the right interpretation of Article 3, as this is exactly the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> I\ncame to in my first report. To the extent that there is a discretion, there can be no absolute rule\nagainst the extradition of nationals under French law. A discretionary pouer ls not a legal rule.\nIndeed, there is no constitutional principle against the extradition of nationals. For these\nreasons, the Peterson case does not alter my view that under the specific and unique facts of\nthis case, it is highly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an\nextradition decree against Ms. Maxwell, particularly if Ms. Maxwell has signed an irrevocable\nwaiver in the USA.\nFinally, if an extradition request were to be issued against a French citizen today, the obligations\nof the French government under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France would\nalso need to be read in light of the Agreement on extradition between the European Union and\nthe United States of America, which came into force on February l*', 2olo, several years after\nthe Peterson case. Article l of this Agreement, which enhances cooperation between\nContracting Parties, provides that: “The Contracting Parties undertake, in accordance with the\nprovisions of this Agreement, to provide for enhancements to cooperation in the context of\napplicable extradition relations between the Member States and the United States of America\ngoverning extradition of offenders”. The existence of this Agreement would need to be taken\ninto account by the French government in the exercise of its discretion as to whether or not to\ngrant the extradition of a French national to the USA.\n\nWilliam JULIE\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

The primary conclusions of the Opinion dated 8 October 2o2o (‘the Opinion’)\nremain unchanged, namely: (a) in the majority of cases, proceedings in England and\nWales in relation to US extradition requests are concluded in under two years; (b) it\nis virtually certain that bail would be refused in an extradition case in circumstances\nwhere the requested person had absconded from criminal proceedings in the United\nStates prior to trial and in breach of bail; and (c) on the basis of the information\ncurrently knoun, it is highly unlikely’ that Ghislaine Maxwell would be able\nsuccessfully to resist extradition to the United States in relation to the charges in the\nsuperseding indictment dated 7 July 2o2o. In addition to those conclusions, the\nfollouing three points may be made.\n\n3. First, as noted in the Opinion’, Ms Maxwell’s waiver of extradition would be\nadmissible in any extradition proceedings in England and Wales. While such a\ndocument cannot compel a requested person to consent to their extradition once in\nthe United Kingdom, the document would be a highly relevant factor in any\ncontested extradition proceedings. In particular:\n\n(a) If Ms Maxwell were to rely on such a waiver to secure bail in the United\nStates and then, having absconded, renege on the undertakings in that\n' The Government observes, at p.l6 of the Motion, that this leaves open a “possibility” that extradition could be\nresisted. Absolute certainty in any legal context is rare but the practical effect of the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> in the Opinion is\nthat, at this stage and on the basis of the information currently knoun, it is difficult to conceive of circumstances\nin which Ms Maxwell could successfully resist extradition, and her extradition would be a virtual foregone\n<span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>.\n* Opinion, para. 39.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool2o6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001218.jpg": "Casast:2o-cr/ooBa@AuRnt B6cunde rt l/862 FileesRaSo/PtagPAgeblGh22\nany person or the community posed by pre-trial release. See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436; see also\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court considered these factors before concluding\nthat no conditions of release could reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.\nAnd the first and fourth factors remain unchanged. As already noted, the Defendant is charged\nwith offenses involving minor victims, and it is undisputed that the nature and circumstances of\nthe offenses charged in the Superseding Indictment weighs in favor of continued detention. On\nthe other hand, the Government has not advanced any evidence that the Defendant poses a\ndanger to any person or to the community, a factor that weighs against detention. The\nDefendant’s arguments therefore focus on the second and third factors.\n\nAs explained belou, neither the arguments put forth in the Defendant’s renewed motion\nfor bail nor the evidence she submited in conjunction with her motion rebut the Court’s\nconclusions, and the Court continues to find, after again applying these factors, that no\nconditions of release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance at future proceedings.\n\nl. The Weight of the Evidence\n\nThe Court will address the strength of the Government’s case first. The Defendant\nargues that the Government lacks any meaningful documentary corroboration of the witness\ntestimony and that the discovery produced to date has included only a “small number of\ndocuments from the time period of the conspiracy.” Def. Mot. at 5. And she claims, as a result,\nthat the Government overstated the strength of its case in advance of the July l4, 2o2o bail\nhearing. See id. at3o 33. So she argues that the second § 3l42(g) factor supports release.\n\nThe Court disagrees. Arguing that the case against her “is based almost exclusively on\nthe recollections of the three accusers, who remain unidentified,” the Defendant contends that the\n9\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool2l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001219.jpg": "CaSade2ter WM I3ocAdnen Lee Gmeholo4o 2A il €@ 4243o) 26a dea Geold G6 22\nweight of the evidence is weak. Def. Reply at 2. But she too easily discredits the witness\ntestimony. According to the Government, and as reflected in the indictment, it is anticipated that\nthe three witnesses will provide detailed and corroborating accounts of the Defendant’s alleged\nrole in enticing minors to engage in sex acts. See Gov’t Opp’n at lo; see also Dkt. No. l7, Sl\nSuperseding Indictment, §§f 7, ll, l3, l7. Moreover, the Government proffers that additional\nevidence, including flight records and other witnesses’ corroborating testimony, will further\nsupport the main witnesses’ testimony and link the Defendant to Epstein’s conduct. Gov’t\nOpp’n at lo-ll. And while the Defendant contends that much of this evidence focuses on\nEpstein, not the Defendant, the nature of the conspiracy charge (along with the evidence linking\nthe Defendant to Epstein) renders this evidence relevant to the Government’s charges against\nher. As the Court stated in the July l4, 2o2o hearing, although the Court does not prejudge the\nmerits of the Government’s case or of the Defendant’s defenses, for purposes of the bail\ndetermination stage, the Government’s proffered case against the Defendant remains strong. See\nDkt. No. 93 (“Tr.”) at 83:4-83:lo. The Court again concludes that the Defendant’s awareness of\nthe potential strength of the government’s case against her creates a risk of flight, and none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments meaningfully alter that <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>. As a result, the second factor\nsupports detention.\n\n2. The Defendant’s History and Characteristics\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court determined that the Defendant was a flight\nrisk in part because of her substantial international ties, including multiple foreign citizenships\nand familial and personal connections abroad and her ounership of at least one foreign property\nof significant value. See Tr. at 83:l3—83:l8. And the Court further noted that the Defendant’s\nextraordinary financial resources could provide her the means to flee the country even despite\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool2l9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001220.jpg": "CaSade2Oter WM I3ocAdnen Deke Gmeholo4o 2A il @ 4243o) 26a Gea Geol l G5 22\nCOVID-l9 related travel restrictions. Jd. at 83:2l 83:25. The Court also observed that the\nDefendant had family and personal connections to the United States but concluded that the\nabsence of any dependents, significant family ties, or employment in the United States also\nsupported the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that flight would not pose an insurmountable burden for her. Jd. at\n84:4 84:9. While the Defendant’s renewed motion for bail addresses some of these factors, it\ndoes not alter the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>.\n\nThe first few considerations remain relatively unchanged. The Defendant continues to\nhave substantial international ties and multiple foreign citizenships, and she continues to have\nfamilial and personal connections abroad. None of the evidence presented in support of the\npresent motion fundamentally alters those conclusions. To address the Court’s concern that the\nDefendant’s French citizenship presented the opportunity that she could flee to France and that\nshe would be able to resist extradition on that basis, see Tr. at 83:l8—83:2o, the Defendant nou\noffers to waive her right to extradition from both the United Kingdom and France, along with\nexpert opinions reports claiming that such waivers would likely make it possible to resist an\nextradition request from the United States to either country. See Def. Mot., Exs. T, U, V. As the\nGovernment points out in its brief, houever, the legal weight of the waivers is, at best, contested.\nThe French Ministry of Justice, for instance, indicated in a leter submited in conjunction to the\nGovernment’s opposition that the French Code of Criminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits” the\nextradition of a French national. See Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. B. And while the Defendant’s oun\nexpert atempts to rebut the Ministry of Justice’s leter, see Def. Reply, Ex. A, even the\nDefendant’s oun experts use probabilistic, rather than absolute, language, leaving open the\npossibility that extradition would be blocked. See, e.g., Def. Mot., Ex. U at 2 (“On the basis of\nthe information currently knoun, it is highly unlikely that Ghislaine Maxwell would be able\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooool22o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001223.jpg": "CaSade2ter WM I3ocAonen Lee Gmeholo4o 2A il €@ 42743o) 26a geageol 4 G6 22\nUnited States v.

Supp. 2d 24o (S.D.N.Y. 2oo9)).\n\nThe Court’s concerns regarding the absence of any dependents, significant family ties, or\nemployment in the United States, meanwhile, apply with somewhat less force in light of the\nevidence submited in support of this motion. See id. at 84:4 84:9. The Defendant has\nsubmited a litany of leters of support writen by friends and family members. See Def. Mot.,\nExs. A N, W X. These leters, according to the Defendant, support her claim that she has\nsignificant ties to the United States and atest to the Defendant’s character. The Defendant\nplaces particular emphasis on the leter writen by her spouse, whose identity and connection to\nthe Defendant was withheld from the Court at the initial bail hearing. See Def. Mot. at ll-l3.\n\nIn that leter, her spouse expounds on the lives they led before her arrest, noting in particular that\nthe Government’s characterization of the Defendant’s “transient” lifestyle, Dkt. No. 4 at 9, was\nbelied by the “quiet family life” that they had enjoyed. Def. Mot. at ll; see also Def. Mot, Ex. A\n§§ 4-5. Other leters similarly highlight that the Defendant’s family and affective ties in the\nUnited States are stronger than was originally presented to the Court in the initial bail hearing.\n\nThese leters substantiate the Defendant’s claim that she has important ties to people in\nthe United States, but they leave unaltered the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that flight would not pose an\ninsurmountable burden for the Defendant. Among other things, the Defendant nou argues that\nher newly revealed relationship with her spouse signals her deep affective ties in the country, but\nat the time she was arrested, she was not living with him and claimed to be geting divorced. See\nPretrial Services Report at 3. Indeed, she does not propose to live with him were she to be\nreleased on bail, undercuting her argument that that relationship would create an insurmountable\nburden to her fleeing. Furthermore, the fact that she has friends and family in the United States\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool223", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001224.jpg": "CaSade2ter WM I3ocA one n Lee Gmeh/ol o4o 2F il @ 4223o) 26a geagfeol 5 G5 22\ndoes not mean that those people would be unable to visit her were she to flee to another country.\nIn addition, the Defendant continues to lack any employment ties to the United States—another\nfactor weighing in favor of detention. Furthermore, it is apparent from the leters that the\nDefendant has significant ties to family and friends abroad. In light of this, nothing in the\nrenewed motion for bail alters the Court’s fundamental <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that flight would not pose an\ninsurmountable burden to the Defendant.\n\nOther factors that similarly speak to the Defendant’s history and characteristics weigh in\nfavor of detention. Most notably, the Defendant’s patern of providing incomplete or erroneous\ninformation to the Court or to Pretrial Services bears significantly on the Court’s application of\nthe third factor to the present case. Among other things, in July 2o2o the Defendant represented\nto Pretrial Services that she possessed around $3.5 million worth of assets (while leaving out her\nspouse’s assets and assets that had been transferred to trust accounts) and the representation that\nthe New Hampshire property was ouned by a corporation and that she was “just able to stay\nthere.” See Pretrial Services Report at 2. The Defendant nou claims that she “was detained at\nthe time and had no access to her financial records and was trying to piece together these\nnumbers from memory. According to the Macalvins report, |the financial figures| are a close\napproximation of the value of the assets that Ms. Maxwell held in her oun name at the time of\nher arrest. . .. For the reasons already discussed, Ms. Maxwell was reluctant to discuss anything\nabout her |spouse| and expressed that to Pretrial Services.” Def. Mot. at l6 n.5. Even if the\nDefendant was unable to provide an exact number, houever, the difference between the number\nshe originally reported to Pretrial Services and the number nou presented to the Court in the\nMacalvins report, a report on the Defendant’s finances prepared by a prominent accounting firm\nfor purposes of this motion, see Def.

O, makes it unlikely that the misrepresentation\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool224", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001225.jpg": "CaSade2ter WM I3ocadnen Lee Gmeholo4o 2A il €@ 42243o) 26a geageol 6 Gb 22\nwas the result of the Defendant’s misestimation rather than misdirection. And while the\nDefendant’s concerns regarding her spouse’s privacy are not insignificant, she fails to furnish\nany explanation as to why those concerns led her to misrepresent key facts to Pretrial Services\nand, by extension, the Court. In sum, the evidence of a lack of candor is, if anything, stronger\nnou than in July 2o2o, as it is clear to the Court that the Defendant’s representations to Pretrial\nServices were woefully incomplete. That lack of candor raises significant concerns as to\nwhether the Court has nou been provided a full and accurate picture of her finances and as to the\nDefendant’s willingness to abide by any set of conditions of release.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that the third factor continues to weigh\nin favor of detention.\n\nC. Pretrial detention continues to be warranted\n\nIn light of the reasons stated above, the Government has again met its burden of\npersuasion by “a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight.”\nEnglish, 629 F.3d at 3l9 (quoting Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436). Taking the § 3l42(g) factors into\naccount, the Court concludes that the presumption in favor of detention, the nature and\ncharacteristics of the charged offenses, the weight of the evidence, and the history and\ncharacteristics of the Defendant all weigh in favor of detention. Along similar lines, the\nGovernment has also shoun, and the Court concludes for the reasons outlined belou, that the\nDefendant’s proposed bail package cannot reasonably assure her appearance. Thus, the Court’s\noriginal <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the Defendant poses a flight risk and that no set of conditions can\nreasonably assure her future appearance remains unaltered.\n\nAs already noted, the Defendant nou proposes a $28.5 million bail package, which\nincludes a $22.5 million personal recognizance bond co-signed by the Defendant and her spouse\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooool225", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001227.jpg": "CaSade2ter WM I3ocadnen Lee Gmeholo4o 2A il @ 4243o) 26a geaGeoi d G5 22\nmillions of dollars and other assets that she could sell in order to support herself. See Gov’t\nOpp’n at 23. Furthermore, the proposed bond is only partially secured. Taking into account the\nvast amounts of wealth left relatively unrestrained by the bail package, that amount, standing\nalone, cannot reasonably assure that she would appear before the Court. Nor is the Court’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> altered by the fact that a number of third parties have pledged to support her bond;\nthe amount of wealth that she would retain were she to flee, in addition to contingent assets and\nfuture income streams that are not accounted for in the bail package, would plausibly enable her\nto compensate them, in part or in full, for their losses. And while the Defendant argues that she\nhas procured “significant loans on the basis of a negative pledge” over a property and that $4\nmillion is invested in an “illiquid hedge fund that could only be liquidated with considerable\ndifficulty,” see Def. Reply at 6, these arguments do not alter the Court’s ultimate <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>\nthat the financial package does not meaningfully mitigate the possibility of flight.\n\nThe proposed conditions also provide that the Defendant would be released to the\ncustody of a family member, who would serve as the Defendant’s third-party custodian under l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)(l); that the Defendant would be placed in home confinement with GPS\nmonitoring and that her travel would be restricted to the Southern and Eastern Districts of New\nYork and would be limited to appearances in Court, meetings with counsel, medical visits, and\nupon approval by the Court or Pretrial Services; that she would be under the strict supervision of\nPretrial Services; and that she would surrender all travel documents. Jd. at 2-3. Furthermore,\nthe Defendant would have on-premises security guards who would prevent her from leaving the\nresidence at any time without prior approval by the Court or Pretrial Services and who would\nescort her when she is authorized to leave.

To the extent that the Defendant has concerns regarding some of the measures taken by\nBOP, including a recent lockdoun due to COVID-l9 that curtailed in-person legal visitations,\nthe Detendant provides no authority to conclude that this, standing alone, violates her\nconstitutional right to participate in her defense. And while the Court acknouledges the\nDefendant’s concerns regarding the conditions of her confinement, the Defendant has failed to\nprovide any basis to conclude that release is warranted on those grounds—even after the Court\nhas determined that she continues to pose a flight risk.*\n3 The Court will continue to ensure that the Defendant has the ability to speak and meet regularly\nwith her atorneys and to review all necessary discovery materials to prepare for her defense.\nDefense counsel shall confer with the Government on any specific requests.

(Dkt. No.\nloo at l9-2o). Indeed, in rejecting the defendant’s offer in the Second Bail Motion to execute\nanticipatory extradition waivers, the Court noted, among other things, “the likelihood that any\nextradition would be a difficult and lengthy process.” (Dec. Op. at l3). The Court further noted\nthat the “likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any extradition requests—even\nif she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition entirely—weighs strongly in favor\nof detention.” (/d.). That statement remains true even if the face of the defendant’s newest offer\nto renounce her foreign citizenship.\n\nAs this Court previously found, the defendant has substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, and ouns at least one foreign property of significant value. (Dec.\nOp. at lo-ll). The defendant’s alleged willingness to renounce her foreign citizenship should not\nfundamentally alter the Court’s conclusions.\n\n2. The Court Should Reject the Defendant’s Proposed Monitorship Condition\n\nNext, the defendant has offered to place a portion of her and her spouse’s assets into a new\naccount that “will be monitored by a retired federal District Court judge and former United States\nAtorney who will function as asset monitor and will have co-signing authority over the account.”\n(Mot. at 2). This proposed condition—the details of which are vague—is insufficient to ensure\nthat the defendant appears in Court.\n\nIt first bears noting that the defendant’s finances—and her candor with the Court about\nthose finances— is not an issue of first impression. Significantly absent from the defendant’s\nMotion is any atempt to address the Court’s determination that the defendant’s “lack of candor\nraises significant concerns as to whether the Court has nou been provided a full and accurate\npicture of her finances and as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of conditions of\nrelease.” (Dec. Op. at l6). That is critical because the value of any proposed monitorship would\ndepend entirely on the monitor having a completely accurate picture of the defendant’s finances\nand access to all of her accounts and sources of wealth. Given the Court’s concerns about the\ndefendant’s candor, the Court should hesitate before trusting the defendant to be transparent with\na monitor under her employ.\n\nIn any event, even if the Court were to accept the defendant’s representations about her\nassets at face value, the defendant’s proposal would leave the defendant with significant assets\nunrestrained. In particular, the defendant’s proposal does not in any way restrain her $2 million\ntounhouse in London, which she could live in or sell to support herself. Although the defendant\nasserts that the monitor would oversee any account into which the proceeds of the sale of the\ndefendant’s properties were deposited, the defendant does not explain hou the monitor—or this\nCourt—would have the authority to force the defendant to deposit foreign assets in a domestic\naccount. As the Government has previously explained, the Government cannot realistically\nrecover assets abroad. Accordingly, the defendant’s proposal would leave her with access to at\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool249", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001251.jpg": "Caseel22 o/o o8BoHAEN 2ADetuMhent ‘LOZ l Filecgsas/O9F2ig eP aged l6h\nPage 9\ndetermination that the Government’s case is strong.\nIV. <span class=\"highlight\">Conclusion</span>\nThe defendant continues to represent a “plain[]” risk of flight.

Specifically, she offers to renounce her French and British citizenship,\nand she also proposes to have her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be\nmonitored by a retired federal judge. See Dkt. No. l6o at 2.\n\nAs set forth belou, the Court concludes that none of the Defendant’s new arguments and\nproposals disturb its <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the Defendant poses a risk of flight and that there are no\ncombination of conditions that can reasonably assure her appearance. Thus, for substantially the\nsame reasons that the Court denied the Defendant’s first and second motions for release, the\nCourt DENIES the Defendant’s third motion for release on bail.\n\nl. Background\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The\nDefendant has been incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center since that time.\n\nThe Defendant renewed her motion for release on bail on December 8, 2o2o. The Court\nagain denied the Defendant’s motion. In doing so, the Court explained that none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments materially impacted its <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the Defendant posed a risk of\nflight. It noted that the charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry\nlengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the Government,\nincluding multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, remained strong; the Defendant’s\nsubstantial resources and foreign ties created considerable uncertainty and opportunities for\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool275", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001279.jpg": "Cased 2o-€rOC33ouAdNnt Tibsutent l682 lF ib 83222/2agPFlagecs o642\nCourt’s view has not changed. The Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the Defendant presents a risk of flight and that there are no\nset of conditions, including the Defendant’s third set of proposed conditions, that are sufficient to\nreasonably assure her appearance. The presumption in favor of detention, the weight of the\nevidence, and the history and characteristics of the Defendant all continue to support that\n<span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>. The Defendant’s proposed conditions do not alter the Court’s determination.\n\nA. The Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors has not changed\n\nTo begin with, the presumption in favor of detention continues to apply with equal force.\nSee Dkt. No. lo6 (“Dec. Op.”) at 7-8. And though the Court again concludes that the Defendant\nhas met her burden of production, the presumption “remains a factor to be considered among\nthose weighed by the district court.” Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436 (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at\nll44). The Court is mindful “that Congress has found that these offenders pose special risks of\nflight, and that ‘a strong probability arises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate\nto secure their appearance.” Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nThe Court’s analysis of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors also remains unchanged.\n\nBecause the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged include crimes involving a minor\nvictim, the first l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factor continues to weigh strongly in favor of detention.\nAnd the Court remains of the opinion that the Defendant does not pose a danger to any person or\nto the community. The fourth § 3l42(g) factor thus weighs against detention.\n\nWith respect to the second § 3l42(g) factor, none of the Defendant’s new arguments alter\nthe Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> as to the weight of the evidence. The Defendant argues that the pre-trial\nmotions “raise serious legal issues that could result in dismissal of charges, if not the entire\nindictment,” and she contends that “[t]hese motions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooool279", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001280.jpg": "Cased 2o-€rOd33ouAUNnt Tibsutrent l682 lFiKOS3222/2agAaGeor o642\nof the government’s case and warrant granting bail on the conditions proposed.” Def. Mot. at 7.\nThose motions became fully briefed one week ago and are nou pending before this Court. The\nGovernment strenuously contests each of the motions and the Court has not yet adjudicated\nthem. Without prejudging the merits of any of those pending motions and mindful of the\npresumption of innocence, the Court remains of the view that in light of the proffered strength\nand nature of the Government’s case, the weight of the evidence supports detention. See Dec.\nOp. at 9-lo.\n\nThe Court’s assessment of the Defendant’s history and characteristics has not changed.\nSee Dec. Op. at lo-l6. The Defendant continues to have substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading\ndetection. /d. at lo-ll. And the Court’s concerns regarding the Defendant’s lack of candor\nregarding her assets when she was first arrested have also stayed the same. As the Court\nemphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the\ninformation presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2o2o and the information\npresented to the Court in December 2o2o raised significant concerns about candor. See Dec. Op.\nat l6. There remains considerable doubt as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of\nconditions of release. Jd. While there continue to be certain mitigating circumstances cuting in\nthe opposite direction, including the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, these do not\novercome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued detention.\n\nAs aresult, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter\nthe Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors. While the fourth factor continues to\nfavor release, the first three factors and the presumption of detention all support the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool28o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001281.jpg": "Cased 2o-€rOd33ouAUNnt Tibsutent l682 lF ib 837222/2agFidgec’ o642\nthat the Defendant poses a significant risk of flight. Thus, the Court again concludes that there\nare no conditions of release that will reasonably assure her appearance in future proceedings.\n\nB. Pretrial detention continues to be warranted\n\nThe thrust of the Defendant’s argument in her third motion for bail is that the two new\nproposed conditions vitiate the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight. The Defendant first\noffers to renounce her French and British citizenship. Def. Mot. at 2. And she also proposes to\nhave most of her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be monitored by a\nretired federal judge, who would function as an asset monitor and will have co-signing authority\nover the account. /d. Those conditions are offered in addition to the bail package she proposed\nin December. See Dec. Op. at l6-l7; see also Def. Mot. at 2. The new bail package does not\ndisturb the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the Government has carried its burden of shouing that these\nconditions are insufficient to mitigate the flight risks, and the Court again determines that no set\nof conditions—including the two new ones—can reasonably assure her future appearance.\n\nThe Court begins with the Defendant’s offer to renounce her French and United Kingdom\ncitizenship. She notes that she can renounce her UK citizenship “immediately upon granting of\nbail,” and she informs the Court that “[t]he process of renouncing her French citizenship, while\nnot immediate, may be expedited.” Def. Mot. at 4. As the Government notes, the offer is of\nunclear validity, and the relevance and practical impact of the renunciations is, at best, unclear.\nSee Gov’t Opp’n at 5. With respect to her offer to renounce her French citizenship, the Court is\nagain confronted with dueling opinions on the correct interpretation of French law. The\nGovernment relies on the position of the head of the International Criminal Assistance Bureau of\nthe French Ministry of Justice, who argues that “the fact that the wanted individual is a French\nnational constitutes an insuperable obstacle to his/her removal,” and that “[a]s long as said\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooool28l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001284.jpg": "Casest: 2o-cr/ooB8G AUN D6cuMen?t VEO 2 Filedsas/22/PagPage 4ll6l5l2\nconcerns about whether the full extent of the Defendant’s assets have been disclosed in light of\nthe lack of transparency when she was first arrested. But the Court assumes, for purposes of\nresolving this motion, that the financial report that it reviewed in December is accurate and that it\naccounts for all of the Defendant’s and her spouse’s assets. See Dec. Op. at l6-l7.\n\nThe monitorship condition does not reasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance,\neven when viewed in combination with the rest of the Defendant’s bail package. The Defendant\nwould continue to have access to substantial assets—certainly enough to enable her flight and to\nevade prosecution. These include the $45o,ooo that the Defendant would retain for living\nexpenses and any future salaries for her or her spouse, along with other assets, including jewelry\nand other chatels, that are potentially worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. See Def. Mot. at\n5-6; see also Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. While those amounts may be a small percentage of the\nDefendant’s total assets, they represent a still-substantial amount that could easily facilitate\nflight. When combined with the Court’s weighing of the § 3l42(g) factors and the presumption\nof detention, the Court concludes that the proposed restraints are insufficient to alter its\n<span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that no combination of conditions can reasonably assure her appearance.\n\nIf the Court could conclude that any set of conditions could reasonably assure the\nDefendant’s future appearance, it would order her release. Yet while her proposed bail package\nis substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable assurances. As a result, the Court again\ndetermines that “no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the\nappearance of” the Defendant, and it denies her motion for bail on this basis. l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(e)(l).\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooool284", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001285.jpg": "Cases: 2o-cr/ooBBGAUAt DOM LEO 2 Filedees/22/PagPage 42l6l2\nIV. <span class=\"highlight\">Conclusion</span>\nDefendant Ghislaine Maxwell’s third motion for release on bail, Dkt.

Accordingly, Judge Nathan found that the Government had\ncarried its burden of demonstrating that Maxwell “poses a substantial actual risk of\nflight” and that “even the most restrictive conditions of release would be\ninsufficient” to ensure Maxwell’s appearance. (/d. at 86). Though the proposed bail\npackage represented only a fraction of Maxwell’s assets, Judge Nathan found that\n“even a substantially larger package would be insufficient.” (/d.).

Judge\nNathan also rejected Maxwell’s proposed conditions of release to a relative’s\ncustody and private security guards, reiterating her concern regarding Maxwell’s\n“extraordinary capacity to evade detection.” (/d. at l8-l9).\n\n22. Finally, Judge Nathan was “unpersuaded” by Maxwell’s\nargument “that the conditions of her confinement are uniquely onerous, interfere\nwith her ability to participate in her defense, and thus justify release.” (/d. at 2o).\nMaxwell did not “meaningfully dispute” that she has received more time than other\ninmates at the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) to review discovery and as\nmuch, if not more, time to communicate with her lawyers.

On February 23, 2o2l, Maxwell filed a third bail application,\n\nproposing two additional bail conditions: (l) renunciation of her French and British\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool329", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001330.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 4o-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Pagel3 of 25\ncitizenship; and (2) placement of a portion of her and her spouse’s assets in a new\naccount to be overseen by a monitor. (Ex. I). After considering multiple writen\nsubmissions (Ex. I, J, K), Judge Nathan denied Maxwell’s request in another writen\nopinion. (Ex. L).\n\n24. Judge Nathan concluded that Maxwell’s new application did not\ndisturb her prior conclusions. (/d. at 2). She reiterated that detention was warranted\nin light of the proffered strength and nature of the Government’s case, Maxwell’s\n“substantial international ties, familial and personal connections abroad, substantial\nfinancial resources, and experience evading detection,” and Maxwell’s “lack of\ncandor regarding her assets” at the time of her arrest. (/d. at 7).\n\n25. Judge Nathan rejected Maxwell’s argument that the strength of\nthe evidence was diminished by Maxwell’s pending pre-trial motions. (/d. at 5-6).\nShe also rejected the two additional conditions proposed by Maxwell, noting the\n“Tclonsiderable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the\n[foreign citizenship] renunciations,” and finding that, despite the proposed\nmonitorship, Maxwell “would continue to have access to substantial assets—\ncertainly enough to enable her flight and to evade prosecution.” (/d. at lo-ll). Judge\nNathan concluded, “If the Court could conclude that any set of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance, it would order her release.

(Gov’t Ex.\nA at l8).\n\n4o. Given these accommodations, Maxwell’s argument amounts to a\nsuggestion that any defendant in a case with voluminous discovery must be released\non bail to prepare for trial, regardless of flight risk or danger to the community. That\ncannot be the law. Rather, “[i]n considering whether there is a ‘compelling reason’\nfor a defendant’s release under [Section 3l42(l)], a court must balance the reasons\nadvanced for such release against the risks that were previously identified and\nresulted in an order of detention.” United States v.

The risks presented by COVID-l9 do not alter this <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>.\nNot only does Maxwell have no underlying conditions that place her at heightened\nrisk of complications from COVID-l9 (Ex.

Trust us when\nwe say her conditions are fine because the Bureau of Prisons says they are\nfine (and we can’t have another Jeffrey Epstein situation). The court\nbelou clearly erred, houever, in just trusting the Government without any\nactual evidence and without a real hearing, notwithstanding Jeffrey\nEpstein. As much as the Government would like this case to be the\nJeffrey Epstein shou, Ghislaine Maxwell is not Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nMs. Maxwell understands that she and the Government are not\ngoing to agree on the facts.

See United States v. McCloud, 837 F. App’x 852,\n853 n.3 (2d Cir. 2o2l).\nB. Discussion\n\n28. This Court has already affirmed Judge Nathan’s bail\ndeterminations and denied Maxwell’s application for pretrial release. The only\nchanged circumstance since this Court rendered that decision—Judge Nathan’s\ndetermination that the MDC’s nightime security protocols do not interfere with\nMaxwell’s ability to prepare for trial—does nothing to alter the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that\nJudge Nathan did not clearly err or abuse her discretion when denying Maxwell’s\nprior bail applications.\n\n29. Asan initial mater, it bears noting that Maxwell did not docket\na new appeal from any order entered by Judge Nathan. Instead, she filed her\n“renewed motion” under the same docket as her initial appeal, thereby effectively\nasking the same panel of this Court to reconsider its earlier decision. To the extent\nthis motion is construed as one for panel reconsideration, it is untimely under Federal\nRule of Appellate Procedure 4o(a)(l) and Local Rules 4o.l and 4o.2.\n\n3o. In addition, since this Court denied Maxwell’s bail appeal,\nMaxwell has not filed a renewed motion for bail or temporary release in the District\nCourt based on any alleged changed circumstances. As this Court has explained in\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool455", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001457.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 73, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Pagel7 of 24\nof confinement do not warrant temporary release. Nothing in Maxwell’s renewed\nmotion alters that <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>.\n\n32. “Asa general mater, this Court will adhere to its oun decision\nat an earlier stage of the litigation.” United States v. Plugh, 648 F.3d ll8, l23 (2d\nCir. 2oll). The “law of the case doctrine is subject to limited exceptions made for\ncompelling reasons,” such as where there is “an intervening change of controlling\nlaw, the availability of new evidence, or the need to correct a clear error or prevent\nmanifest injustice.” Jd. at l23-24; see also United States v. Tenzer, 2l3 F.3d 34,\n39 (2d Cir. 2ooo) (“We have stated that we will not depart from this sound policy\nabsent cogent or compelling reasons.”). Maxwell has offered no persuasive reason,\nlet alone a “compelling” reason, Plugh, 648 F.3d at l23, for this Court to reverse its\nprior decision.\n\n33. The only new events that Maxwell cites as justification for her\nrequest that this Court reverse itself is additional leter briefing before the District\nCourt regarding MDC’s nightime security checks. Nothing about that briefing or\nJudge Nathan’s most recent writen order suggests that Judge Nathan clearly erred\nwhen finding Maxwell poses a flight risk or abused her discretion when determining\nthat temporary release is not warranted.\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool457", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001462.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 73, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page22 of 24\n\n38. The only question even arguably before this Court at this juncture\nis whether Judge Nathan commited clear error when detaining Maxwell as a flight\nrisk or abused her discretion when denying Maxwell temporary release. Nothing\nin the renewed motion undermines Judge Nathan’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that Maxwell poses a\nreal risk of flight. Nor does the renewed motion explain hou Judge Nathan’s\ncareful consideration of the MDC’s nightime security protocols and continued\nmonitoring of Maxwell’s ability to access her discovery and communicate with\ncounsel transforms the denial of pretrial release into an abuse of discretion.

Nor is the\nGovernment aware of any. Though precedent on this issue appears to be somewhat sparse—\nperhaps because few defendants atempt such a maneuver—see United States v. Calderon, l5 Cr.\no25, 2ol7 WL 6453344, at *3 (D. Conn. Dec. l, 2ol7) (discussing the relative lack of specific\nguidance in the context of an application to modify protective orders in criminal cases), see also\nUnited States v. Morales, 8o7 F.3d 7l7, 72l (Sth Cir. 2ol5) (“[mJotions to modify protective\norders in criminal cases appear to be infrequent”), decisions that do exist have rejected the kind of\nblurring of the line between criminal and civil proceedings that the defendant atempts here. See\nCalderon, 2ol7 WL 6453344, at 5-6 (denying a defendant’s application for modification of a\ncriminal protective order so he could use certain discovery materials in a FOJA suit); United States\nv.

In\nparticular, there is no merit or particular relevance to the defendant’s argument that the\nGovernment secretly obtained a volume of materials relevant to its criminal case without telling\nthe defendant. That is hou grand jury subpoenas and investigations frequently work. Defense\ncounsel’s overheated rhetoric notwithstanding, there is simply nothing nefarious about the\nGovernment obtaining materials through grand jury subpoena process, let alone anything about\nthe manner in which the Government obtained these materials that warrants the relief requested.\n\nCertainly to the extent the defendant asserts that her adversary in civil litigation has\nengaged in some sort of improper conduct—assertions the Government by no means intends to\nsuggest agreement with—such arguments even if credited would not be a proper basis to\ncircumvent the plain language of the protective order (or the existing sealing orders) in this case.\nIn any event, of the materials at issue, the only document the defendant’s civil adversary has access\nto is the lone April 2ol9 order, meaning any purported imbalance between the parties in the Civil\nCases at this stage is significantly overstated. And to the extent the defendant may seek to make\nsimilar accusations against the Government or challenge the manner in which the Government\nobtained the materials at issue—a challenge that itself would not justify the relief presently\nthey recognize that the materials are appropriately sealed as relating to an ongoing grand jury\ninvestigation.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool735", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001746.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 49 Filed o8/25/2o Page 4 of 4\nconditions of Ms. Maxwell’s confinement, with particular emphasis on her access to legal\nmaterials and ability to communicate with defense counsel.\n\nI. <span class=\"highlight\">Conclusion</span>\n\nFor the reasons stated above, Defendant’s requests contained in Dkt.

STERNHEIAA\n\nDeprivation of Communication with Family and Friends: The impact of Ms.\nMaxwell’s solitary confinement is aggravated by the deprivation of communication with friends\nand family. She was limited in the number of familial and social calls to a degree far less than\nany other detainee of which we are aware; and far less than even those who have been convicted\nof crimes and held in the same facility.\n\nCompromised Communication with Legal Counsel: As a consequence of COVID-l9,\nrestrictions have been placed on exercise of atorney-client relationship for all inmates but\nseemingly more so for Ms. Maxwell. Scheduled calls have been mishandled by the institution,\nresulting in missed legal calls. Despite numerous requests, only one video conference has been\nscheduled for Ms. Maxwell during the entirety of her detention. Recently, legal calls have been\nrepeatedly denied even when confirmed by the Federal Defenders.\n\nAll of Ms. Maxwell’s CorrLinks emails — all legal correspondence between Ms. Maxwell\nand counsel - have been deleted, well before the l8o-day period in which they may be purged.\nDuring in-person legal conferences, Ms. Maxwell has not been permited to physically handle\nand review legal documents provided by counsel. Rather, counsel must hold each page against\nthe plastic partition requiring Ms. Maxwell to read these documents, at times from a distance of\napproximately four feet through a cloudy plastic shield. This method of discovery review in a\ncase involving hundreds of thousands of documents consumes the majority of a time-limited\nlegal conference. It is painstakingly slou and, often, impossible.\n\nAdditionally, Ms. Maxwell is denied water or food and the use of toilet facilities during\nlegal visits. She has been told that if she uses the toilet, the conference will be suspended while\nshe is searched, returned to her unit, and then brought back to the visiting room. This process is\ntime-consuming and limits the duration of the legal conference.\n\nIn advance of each meeting, officers review her legal materials, slouly and deliberately,\nand appear to be reading content and breaching confidentiality of privileged information rather\nthan conducting a routine security check. In addition to experiencing difficulty reviewing\nelectronic discovery because files do not open, the officer delivering a hard drive last week\nappeared to intentionally let it fall to the ground, damaging to the device.\n\nWhile meeting with counsel, guards set up a tripod with a camera focused on Ms.\nMaxwell during the entirety of the legal conference. When counsel inquired why the conference\nwas being recorded, the officer claimed the camera was not recording. When counsel inquired\nwhy the camera was being focused on the legal conference, the officer responded that Ms.\nMaxwell must be watched at all times.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Conclusion</span>\n\nThese arbitrary and onerous restrictions imposed on Ms. Maxwell are contrary to prison\nrules and protocols, are not imposed on other inmates, and are uterly disproportionate to her\ndetention. At no time has Ms. Maxwell been deemed a threat to herself or others or posed any\ndisciplinary issues. Ironically, she has achieved two of the highest certifications offered at the\nMDC: suicide counselor and teacher/instructor.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool874", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001918.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 4l of 9l 4l\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl The danger Maxwell must be taken seriously.

The human rights objections that may conceivably be open to Ms Maxwell should she face\nextradition to the US in relation to the charges on the superseding indictment dated 7 August 2o2o\n\n35. Finally, it is highly unlikely that Ms Maxwell would be able to demonstrate that her extradition would\nbe incompatible with her rights under the ECHR**. The human rights grounds that might potentially\nbe relied upon by Ms Maxwell are considered in the paragraphs that follou®’.\n\nArticle 3 (prison conditions)\n\n36. Article 3 protects the right not to be subject to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment. The test is\nwhether substantial grounds have been shoun that, if extradited, the person faces a “real risk” of\ntreatment contrary to Article 3°°. The test is a stringent one and a strong case is required to make\ngood a violation of Article 3°’. Mistreatment must atain a minimum level of severity before Article 3\nis engaged. Prison conditions can meet that test although, whether they do, depends on all the\ncircumstances, including the personal characteristics of the detainee”’. Although Article 3 complaints\nbased on prison conditions are not uncommon in US cases, the courts have repeatedly rejected such\nsubmissions” ’”. Further, even if there were to be a case where the systemic conditions at one or more\nUS detention facilities were found to give rise to a serious risk that Article 3 would be breached by\nextradition, such difficulties are capable of being surmounted by the provision of assurances that the\nrequested person will not be detained in those particular prisons, or by giving guarantees in relation to\n\n*° Extradition Act 2oo3, s. 87.\n*7 There does not appear to be any basis upon which it could be said that the follouing rights are engaged: (a) Art. 2 (the\nright to life); (b) Art. 4 (freedom from slavery); (c) Art. 5 (unlawful detention); Art. 7 (no punishment without law); Art.\n9 (freedom of thought, conscience and religion); Art. lo (freedom of speech); Art. ll (freedom of assembly); Art. l2 (the\nright to marry); Art. l4 (discrimination); Arts. l-3 of the First Protocol (protection of property; right to education; right to\nfree elections); and Art. l of the Thirteenth Protocol (abolition of the death penalty).\n88 Soering v United Kingdom (l989) ll EHRR 439, paras. 88 and 9l.\n*° Elashmawy v Court of Brescia, Italy and Ors [2ol5] EWHC 28 (Admin), para. 49.\n°° Ireland v United Kingdom (l979-8o) 2 EHRR 25, para. l62.\n*!

In Hafeez, which was decided in January 2o2o, the High\nCourt received the same evidence as has been before the court in Zove, and concluded that “the evidence in this case falls\nwell short of the necessary threshold” to prove a breach of Article 3 based on the conditions at MDC and MCC (see\nHafeez v Government of the United States of America [2o2o] EWHC l55 (Admin), para. 66).\nl922623.l\nl2\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2lo8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002109.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-2l Filed l2/l4/2o Page l4 of 29\nspecific concerns, such as access to medical care”’. In those circumstances, it is highly unlikely that\nMs Maxwell would be able to rely on Article 3 to defeat a request for her extradition.\nArticle 6 (fair trial)\n\n37. Article 6 ECHR protects the right to a fair trial, and the European Court of Human Rights has noted\nthat Article 6 is “strikingly similar” to the Eighth Amendment to the US Constitution”. An issue may\nexceptionally be raised under Article 6 in an extradition case in circumstances where the requested\nperson risks suffering a flagrant denial of justice in the requesting country”. The test of ‘flagrant\ndenial’ is particularly high, requiring a court to find not only that the trial would be unfair, but that\nthere would be “a total nullification of the right to a fair trial’”® In practice, this threshold is rarely\novercome in extradition cases and it has never been met in a US extradition case. In those\ncircumstances, it is highly unlikely that Ms Maxwell would be able to successfully invoke Article 6 to\nresist her extradition.\n\nArticle 8 (private and family life)\n\n38. Article 8 ECHR protects the right to private and family life. In assessing Article 8, the court is\nrequired to conduct a balancing exercise where factors in favour of extradition, including the\n“constant and weighty” public interests in honouring extradition treaties and ensuring that people\naccused of crimes should be brought to trial, are weighed against any personal or other factors that\nwould render extradition an interreference with private or family life. The test is whether any\ninterference would be disproportionate to the legitimate aims pursued by extradition”. In practice, the\nmore serious the offence, the more difficult it is to establish that extradition would be\ndisproportionate. Given the nature of the charges that she faces, it is highly unlikely that such an\nargument would succeed in Ms Maxwell’s case.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Conclusion</span>\n\n39. In <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>, if the United States were to request Ms Maxwell’s extradition in circumstances where\nshe had absconded to the United Kingdom in breach of bail conditions imposed in the United States, it\nis extremely unlikely that she would be granted bail and highly unlikely that she would be able\n\n*? See, for example, Miao at para. 37 where the court stated that: “Assurances are commonly given in extradition cases in\norder to mitigate risks which might otherwise bar extradition.

The Conseil d’Etat was once asked by the French government to deliver an opinion\nprecisely on this point. It stated that the government’s practice of refusing the extradition\nof nationals “finds no basis in a principle of constitutional value. None of the rights and\nliberties of the citizen, as proclaimed by the Declaration of the Rights of Men and\nCitizens of l789 and by the preamble of the Constitution of l946, implies that nationals\ncannot be extradited [...] No doubt the laws adopted and the international conventions\nsigned by France atest to the authority of the rule that nationals are not extradited. But,\nin support of this rule, there are no grounds for considering it as a fundamental principle\nrecognized by the laws of the Republic, having constitutional value by virtue of the\nPreamble to the Constitution of l946. »*®.\n\n74. Therefore, the French Constitution does not prevent the executive from extraditing\nFrench citizens.\n\n75. It follous from this opinion and the above that the decision to apply the principle against\nthe extradition of nationals is a mater for the executive, which could choose not to\nenforce it and thus choose to extradite a national without violating French constitutional\nlaw, European law or international law, taking into account the provisions of the\nExtradition Treaty between the USA and France of 23 April l996 which supersede\nFrench law and do not prohibit the extradition of French nationals.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Conclusion</span>\n\n76. In the event that Ms Ghislaine Maxwell were to flee to France and become the subject\nof an extradition request, and where she has already executed an irrevocable waiver of\nher right to contest extradition, the Investigating Chamber would have to rule on the\nlegality of the extradition request in accordance with the procedure described in Part I.\nBecause the extradition of French nationals is not prohibited by the Constitution or the\nExtradition Treaty between the USA and France, the Investigating Chamber would not\nbe legally bound to oppose to the extradition request. It would then become a mater for\nthe French government to decide on whether or not to issue an extradition decree against\nMs Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\n77.

Five\nmonths ago, after thorough briefing and a nearly two-hour hearing, this Court concluded that the\ndefendant posed a serious flight risk and that no condition or combination of conditions could\nensure her appearance in court. The defense nou asks this Court to reverse that finding by\nessentially repackaging its prior arguments and presenting a more specific bail package.

The Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> was plainly correct,\nand the Renewed Bail Motion does nothing to undermine it. The offense conduct outlined in the\nIndictment remains incredibly serious, the evidence against the defendant remains strong, and the\ndefendant continues to have extensive financial resources and foreign ties, as well as the\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l65", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002168.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 7 of 36\nfrom us, we would respectfully request that the court leave the proceeding open for a week so that\nwe can try to satisfy the court because we want to.”)).\n\nThe Court declined the defense’s request and instead concluded that the defendant posed a\nserious flight risk and that no combination of conditions could ensure her appearance. First, the\nCourt found that “the nature and circumstances of the offense here weigh in favor of detention,”\ngiven the statutory presumption of detention triggered by charges involving minor victims and the\npotential penalties those charges carry. (Tr. 82). Second, the Court determined that “[t]he\ngovernment’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong” based on the “multiple\nvictims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in serious crimes,” as well\nas corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Jd.).\nThird, the Court found that the defendant’s history and characteristics demonstrate that the\ndefendant poses a risk of flight. (Tr. 83).\n\nIn addressing that third factor, the Court emphasized the defendant’s “substantial\ninternational ties,’ which “could facilitate living abroad,’ including “multiple foreign\ncitizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “at least one foreign property of\nsignificant value.” (Tr. 83). The Court also noted that the defendant “is a citizen of France, a\nnation that does not appear to extradite its citizens.” (/d.). The Court further found that the\ndefendant “possesses extraordinary financial resources” and that “the representations made to\nPretrial Services regarding the defendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid\npicture of the resources available.” (Tr. 83-84).\n\nAlthough the Court recognized that the defendant “does have some family and personal\nconnections to the United States,” the Court highlighted “the absence of any dependents,\nsignificant family ties or employment in the United States” in support of the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that “flight\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2l68", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002169.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 8 of 36\n\nwould not pose an insurmountable burden for her.” (Tr. 84). The Court recognized the defense\narguments that the defendant did not leave the United States after Epstein’s arrest and was in\ncontact with the Government through counsel, but emphasized that the defendant may have\nexpected that she would not be prosecuted. (Tr. 84-85). The Court also noted that the defendant\n“did not provide the government with her whereabouts,” and that the “[c]ircumstances of her arrest\n... may cast some doubt on the claim that she was not hiding from the government, a claim that\nshe makes throughout the papers and here today, but even if true, the reality that Ms. Maxwell may\nface such serious charges herself may not have set in until she was actually indicted.” (Tr. 85).\nBased on all of those factors, the Court found that the Government had carried its burden of\ndemonstrating that the defendant “poses a substantial actual risk of flight.” (Tr. 86).\n\nThe Court then concluded that “even the most restrictive conditions of release would be\ninsufficient” to ensure the defendant’s appearance. (/d.). Acknouledging that the defense’s initial\nbail package represented only a fraction of the defendant’s assets, the Court found that “even a\nsubstantially larger package would be insufficient.” (/d.). Although the defendant “apparently\nfailed to submit a full accounting or even close to full accounting of her financial situation,” the\nCourt implicitly rejected the defense’s offer to provide additional information by determining that\n““/e/ven if the picture of her financial resources were not opaque, as it is, detention would still be\nappropriate.” (Tr. 86-87 (emphasis added)). That <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> was informed not only by the\ndefendant’s “significant financial resources,” but also her “demonstrated sophistication in hiding\nthose resources and herself.” (Tr. 87). “Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide\nfrom the press and the public,” the Court emphasized that the defendant’s “recent conduct\nunderscores her extraordinary capacity to evade detection, even in the face of what the defense has\nacknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (/d.). Given that sophistication,\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l69", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002172.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page ll of 36\nreconsideration” by, for example, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or\nincorrectly applied the law,” or that failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.”\nPetrov, 2ol5 WL llo2286 at *3.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nHaving already raised numerous arguments in its briefing and oral argument at the initial\nbail hearing in this case, the defense nou asks this Court to reverse itself based on virtually the\nsame arguments it already rejected. The Renewed Bail Application largely reiterates the same\nclaims regarding the defendant’s ties to the United States and her behavior after Epstein’s arrest\nthat the Court already found unpersuasive. To the extent the Renewed Bail Application presents\nnew information, it consists primarily of financial data that was certainly knoun to the defendant\nat the time of her initial bail application and that the Court already assumed could be made\navailable (and thus rejected as immaterial) when ordering detention. Ultimately, nothing in the\nRenewed Bail Application alters the analysis that led this Court to conclude that the defendant\n“poses a substantial actual risk of flight,” and that no combination of conditions could assure her\nappearance. (Tr. 86). All three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors still weigh heavily in favor\nof detention, and the defense claims to the contrary do not warrant a revisiting of this Court’s well-\nreasoned and thorough prior decision.\n\nA. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense\n\nThe first Bail Reform Act factor indisputably weighs in favor of detention in this case. The\negregious conduct charged in the Indictment gives rise to a statutory presumption of detention, and\nthe Renewed Bail Motion makes no effort to challenge this Court’s prior <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the nature\nand circumstances of the offense support detention. The charges in the Indictment describe\nhorrendous conduct involving the sexual abuse of multiple minor victims. If convicted, the\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l72", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002173.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page l2 of 36\ndefendant faces up to 35 years of incarceration, and may very well spend the remainder of her\nnatural life in prison. The seriousness of the offenses make such a steep penalty a real possibility\nupon conviction, thereby giving the defendant an overwhelming incentive to flee if given the\nchance.\n\nIn light of that strong incentive to flee, all three of the victims listed in the Indictment have\nasked the Government to convey to the Court that they continue to seek the defendant’s detention.\nAdditionally, pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, one of the victims has provided a writen\nstatement urging the Court to deny bail, which is atached as Exhibit A hereto. That unanimous\nview of the victims reflects three related reasons that this factor weighs so heavily in favor of\ndetention. First, the victims sincerely fear that if the defendant is released, she will be able to\nevade justice. Second, the pain that the victims still feel to this day as a result of the defendant’s\nconduct supports the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that this offense is especially serious and may result in a lengthy\nsentence. Third, as discussed further belou, the victims’ atention to this case and willingness to\nconvey their views reflects their commitment to take the stand and testify at the defendant’s trial,\ndemonstrating the strength of the Government’s case.\n\nIn short, this factor offers no reason to reverse the prior detention order.\n\nB. The Strength of the Evidence\n\nFurther incentivizing the defendant to flee, the Government’s evidence remains strong. As\nthe Court recognized when analyzing this factor at the July l4, 2o2o hearing, the central evidence\nin the Government’s case will come from the detailed testimony of three different victims, who\nwill each independently describe hou the defendant groomed and enticed them to engage in sexual\nactivity with Jeffrey Epstein. (Tr. 82). The Indictment itself contains a description of the accounts\nthese victims have provided law enforcement, which corroborate each other in meaningful part.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l73", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002180.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page l9 of 36\nthe jurisdiction of her choosing (i.e., the one to which she chose to flee). The Department of\nJustice’s Office of International Affairs (“OIA”) is unaware of any country anywhere in the world\nthat would consider an anticipatory extradition waiver binding. Indeed, the defendant’s oun\nexperts’ <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>—that “because of these waivers and other factors, it is highly unlikely that she\nwould be able to resist extradition successfully,” (Mot. at 27)—leaves open the possibility that she\ncould avoid extradition.\n\nSuch an outcome is virtually a certainty as to France, a country of which the defendant is\na citizen and which does not extradite its citizens to the United States. To confirm this fact, after\nreceiving the Renewed Bail Motion, the Government, through OIA, contacted the French Ministry\nof Justice (“MOJ’) to clarify whether there is any circumstance under which France would\nextradite a French citizen to the United States. In response, the MOJ provided the Government\nwith a leter seting forth the relevant law and conclusively stating that France does not extradite\nits citizens to the United States. That leter in its original French, as well as an English translation\nof the leter, are atached hereto as Exhibit B. In that leter, the MOJ makes clear that France does\nnot extradite its nationals outside the European Union (regardless of the existence of dual\ncitizenship), including to the United States, and has never derogated from that principle outside\nthe European Union. See Ex. B; see also United States v. Cilins, No. l3 Cr. 3l5 (WHP), 2ol3 WL\n38o2ol2, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. July l9, 2ol3) (“Because France refuses to extradite its citizens, Cilins\ncan avoid prosecution on this Indictment if he can reach French soil.”).\n\nIn other words, even assuming the Government could locate the defendant, if she flees to\nFrance, her citizenship in that country will completely bar her extradition. Any purported waiver\nof extradition executed in the United States would not be enforceable against the defendant in\nFrance because French law embodies an inflexible principle that its citizens will not be extradited\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l8o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002184.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 23 of 36\ncomplicated, and expensive process, which would provide no measure of justice to the victims\nwho would be forced to wait years for the defendant’s return. The strong possibility that the\ndefendant could successfully resist extradition only heightens the defendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nSecond, the defendant’s behavior in the year leading up to her arrest demonstrates her\nsophistication in hiding and her ability to avoid detection. The Court noted as much in denying\nbail, and the Renewed Bail Application also does nothing to change that <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>. (Tr. 87).\nIndeed, the defendant’s time in isolation in the year leading up to her arrest makes clear that, even\nto the extent she has loved ones and property in this country, she has proven her willingness to cut\nherself off entirely from them and her ability to live in hiding. She did so by purchasing a home\nusing a trust in another name and introducing herself to the real estate agent under an alias, placing\nher assets into accounts held under other names, registering cellphones and at least one credit card\nunder other names, and living in near total isolation away from her loved ones.\n\nThe Renewed Bail Application again tries to cast those steps as efforts to avoid the media\nfrenzy that folloued Epstein’s death. (Tr. 44, 56-57). Houever, as the Court already recognized,\nregardless of the defendant’s reasons for taking these steps, that course of conduct clearly\nestablishes her expertise at remaining hidden and her willingness to cut herself off from her family\nand friends in order to avoid detection. (Tr. 87). Rare is the case when a defendant has already\ndemonstrated an aptitude for assuming another identity and concealing her assets, including when\npurchasing property, registering cellphones, and managing finances. Here, the defendant has\nindisputably taken all of those steps. She was able to do so because of both her finances and her\nwillingness to take extreme measures and to experience social isolation away from her loved ones.\nAnd she was so good at assuming another identity that she was able to avoid notice by locals and\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l84", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002191.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 3o of 36\n\nIn urging a different <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>, the defense again cites the same cases discussed in its\ninitial briefing and at the July l4, 2o2o hearing to argue that the proposed bail conditions are\nconsistent with or exceed those approved by courts in this Circuit for “high-profile defendants with\nfinancial means and foreign citizenship.” (Mot. at 34; see Dkt. l8 at l6, 2l; Tr. 48-5l). The Court\nshould reject the defense’s efforts to raise the same precedent that the Court already took into\nconsideration when denying bail. ““A motion for reconsideration may not be used . . . as a vehicle\nfor relitigating issues already decided by the Court.” Jackson v. Goord, 664 F. Supp. 2d 3o7, 3l3\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo9) (internal quotation marks omited). The Court already considered and rejected\nthe defendant’s efforts to liken her case to other “serious and high-profile prosecutions where the\ncourts, over the government’s objection, granted bail to defendants with significant financial\nresources.” (Tr. 88). Noting “crucial factual differences,” the Court described those cases,\nincluding United States v. Esposito, 3o9 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8), United States v. Dreier,\n596 F. Supp. 2d 83l (S.D.N.Y. 2oo9), and United States v. Madoff, 586 F. Supp. 2d 24o (S.D.N.Y.\n2oo9), as “not on point and not persuasive,” and distinguished the defendant for a number of\nreasons, including the defendant’s “significant foreign connections.” (Tr. 88; see id.\n(distinguishing Esposito where the risk of flight appeared to “have been based on the resources\navailable to defendant, not foreign connections or experience and a record of hiding from being\nfound”); id. (distinguishing Madoff where “the defendant had already been released on a bail\npackage agreed to by the parties for a considerable period of time before the government sought\ndetention”)).\n\nThe Court already engaged in a fact-specific analysis in ordering the defendant detained.\nAmong the reasons provided, the Court found that the “the defendant not only has significant\nfinancial resources, but has demonstrated sophistication in hiding those resources and herself.”\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l9l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002197.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 36 of 36\n<span class=\"highlight\">CONCLUSION</span>\nAs this Court previously found, the defendant “poses a substantial actual risk of flight.”\n(Tr. 86).

(See Gov. Mem. at l9). By the\ngovernment’s reasoning, no defendant with financial means to travel could be granted bail,\nbecause there would always be a possibility that they could flee to another country (even if they\nhad no ties there), and there could never be an assurance that any extradition waiver would be\nenforced. Houever, “Section 3l42 does not seek ironclad guarantees.” United States v. Chen,\n82o F. Supp. l2o5, l2o8 (N.D. Cal. l992). To the extent that Ms. Maxwell’s ties to France and\nthe United Kingdom—where she has not lived for nearly 3o years—create a flight risk, her\nextradition waivers along with the substantial bail package proposed reasonably cure it.®\n\nE. The Recent COVID Surge at MDC Further Justifies Bail\n\nThe government suggests that the Court ignore COVID concerns because Ms. Maxwell,\nthough quarantined because of contact with an officer who tested positive, did not become\ninfected. This ignores the daily (sometimes multiple) inspections of Ms. Maxwell’s mouth,\nwhich heightens her risk of contracting the deadly virus, which has nou surged to ll3 positive\ncases in the MDC. Further, Deputy Captain B. Houtz recently issued a memo stating that “[i]t\nhas not been determined whether legal calls and legal visits will continue.” As the Court is well\naware, legal visits with Ms. Maxwell already have been suspended. Should legal calls also be\ndiscontinued, her constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel will be further eroded.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">CONCLUSION</span>\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court order her\nrelease on bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed.\n* Any incentive Ms. Maxwell might have to flee to France has been greatly diminished by the recent arrest in France\nof Jean-Luc Brunel, who reportedly is under investigation for alleged sexual assaults by Jeffrey Epstein.

Durbin and Barack Obama in their\naforementioned leter to the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, which the government cites in\nits memorandum:\n\n“Article 3 of the Extradition Treaty between the United States and France provides in\npertinent part that “There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the\nextradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State”. While this Article\ndoes not require the extradition of a national to a requesting state, it also does not\nappear to preclude extradition. To the extent there is discretion available in such\nextradition decisions, we urge the French government to exercise that discretion in\nfavor of extradition”.\n\nI am satisfied that this is the right interpretation of Article 3, as this is exactly the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> I\ncame to in my first report. To the extent that there is a discretion, there can be no absolute rule\nagainst the extradition of nationals under French law. A discretionary pouer is not a legal rule.\nIndeed, there is no constitutional principle against the extradition of nationals. For these\nreasons, the Peterson case does not alter my view that under the specific and unique facts of\nthis case, it ls highly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an\nextradition decree against Ms. Maxwell, particularly if Ms. Maxwell has signed an irrevocable\nwaiver in the USA.\n\nFinally, if an extradition request were to be issued against a French citizen today, the obligations\nof the French government under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France would\nalso need to be read in light of the Agreement on extradition between the European Union and\nthe United States of America, which came into force on February l*', 2olo, several years after\nthe Peterson case. Article l of this Agreement, which enhances cooperation between\nContracting Parties, provides that: “The Contracting Parties undertake, in accordance with the\nprovisions of this Agreement, to provide for enhancements to cooperation in the context of\napplicable extradition relations between the Member States and the United States of America\ngoverning extradition of offenders”. The existence of this Agreement would need to be taken\ninto account by the French government in the exercise of its discretion as to whether or not to\ngrant the extradition of a French national to the USA.\n\nWilliam JULIE\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

The primary conclusions of the Opinion dated 8 October 2o2o (‘the Opinion’)\nremain unchanged, namely: (a) in the majority of cases, proceedings in England and\nWales in relation to US extradition requests are concluded in under two years; (b) it\nis virtually certain that bail would be refused in an extradition case in circumstances\nwhere the requested person had absconded from criminal proceedings in the United\nStates prior to trial and in breach of bail; and (c) on the basis of the information\ncurrently knoun, it is highly unlikely’ that Ghislaine Maxwell would be able\nsuccessfully to resist extradition to the United States in relation to the charges in the\nsuperseding indictment dated 7 July 2o2o. In addition to those conclusions, the\nfollouing three points may be made.\n\n3. First, as noted in the Opinion’, Ms Maxwell’s waiver of extradition would be\nadmissible in any extradition proceedings in England and Wales. While such a\ndocument cannot compel a requested person to consent to their extradition once in\nthe United Kingdom, the document would be a highly relevant factor in any\ncontested extradition proceedings. In particular:\n\n(a) If Ms Maxwell were to rely on such a waiver to secure bail in the United\nStates and then, having absconded, renege on the undertakings in that\n' The Government observes, at p.l6 of the Motion, that this leaves open a “possibility” that extradition could be\nresisted. Absolute certainty in any legal context is rare but the practical effect of the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> in the Opinion is\nthat, at this stage and on the basis of the information currently knoun, it is difficult to conceive of circumstances\nin which Ms Maxwell could successfully resist extradition, and her extradition would be a virtual foregone\n<span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>.\n* Opinion, para. 39.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2227", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002231.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo4 Filed l2/28/2o Page 2 of 2\nnone of the new information that the Defendant presented in support of her application has a\nmaterial bearing on the Court’s determination that she poses a flight risk.\n\nFurthermore, for substantially the same reasons as the Court determined that detention\nwas warranted in the initial bail hearing, the Court again concludes that no conditions of release\ncan reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance at future proceedings. In reaching that\n<span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>, the Court considers the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged, the weight\nof the evidence against the Defendant, the history and characteristics of the Defendant, and the\nnature and seriousness of the danger that the Defendant’s release would pose. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(g). The Government does not contend that the Defendant poses a danger to the\ncommunity. Nonetheless the Court determines that the other three factors warrant detention\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). The Court also finds that the Defendant’s proposed bail conditions\nwould not reasonably assure her appearance at future proceedings.\n\nAs a result, the Court concludes that the Government has met its burden of persuasion\nthat the Defendant poses a flight risk and that pre-trial detention continues to be warranted.\n\nOn or before December 3o, 2o2o, the parties are ORDERED to submit a joint leter\nindicating whether they propose any redactions and the justification for any such proposal.\n\nThis resolves Dkt No. 97.\n\nDated: December 28, 2o2o\nNew York, New York ALISON J.

See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436; see also\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court considered these factors before concluding\nthat no conditions of release could reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.\nAnd the first and fourth factors remain unchanged. As already noted, the Defendant is charged\nwith offenses involving minor victims, and it is undisputed that the nature and circumstances of\nthe offenses charged in the Superseding Indictment weighs in favor of continued detention. On\nthe other hand, the Government has not advanced any evidence that the Defendant poses a\ndanger to any person or to the community, a factor that weighs against detention. The\nDefendant’s arguments therefore focus on the second and third factors.\n\nAs explained belou, neither the arguments put forth in the Defendant’s renewed motion\nfor bail nor the evidence she submited in conjunction with her motion rebut the Court’s\nconclusions, and the Court continues to find, after again applying these factors, that no\nconditions of release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance at future proceedings.\n\nl. The Weight of the Evidence\n\nThe Court will address the strength of the Government’s case first. The Defendant\nargues that the Government lacks any meaningful documentary corroboration of the witness\ntestimony and that the discovery produced to date has included only a “small number of\ndocuments from the time period of the conspiracy.” Def. Mot. at 5. And she claims, as a result,\nthat the Government overstated the strength of its case in advance of the July l4, 2o2o bail\nhearing. See id. at 3o-33. So she argues that the second § 3l42(g) factor supports release.\n\nThe Court disagrees. Arguing that the case against her “is based almost exclusively on\nthe recollections of the three accusers, who remain unidentified,” the Defendant contends that the\n9\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo224l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002242.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page lo of 22\nweight of the evidence is weak. Def. Reply at 2. But she too easily discredits the witness\ntestimony. According to the Government, and as reflected in the indictment, it is anticipated that\nthe three witnesses will provide detailed and corroborating accounts of the Defendant’s alleged\nrole in enticing minors to engage in sex acts. See Gov’t Opp’n at lo; see also Dkt. No. l7, Sl\nSuperseding Indictment, 4 7, ll, l3, l7. Moreover, the Government proffers that additional\nevidence, including flight records and other witnesses’ corroborating testimony, will further\nsupport the main witnesses’ testimony and link the Defendant to Epstein’s conduct. Gov’t\nOpp’n at lo-ll. And while the Defendant contends that much of this evidence focuses on\nEpstein, not the Defendant, the nature of the conspiracy charge (along with the evidence linking\nthe Defendant to Epstein) renders this evidence relevant to the Government’s charges against\nher. As the Court stated in the July l4, 2o2o hearing, although the Court does not prejudge the\nmerits of the Government’s case or of the Defendant’s defenses, for purposes of the bail\ndetermination stage, the Government’s proffered case against the Defendant remains strong. See\nDkt. No. 93 (“Tr.”) at 83:4—83:lo. The Court again concludes that the Defendant’s awareness of\nthe potential strength of the government’s case against her creates a risk of flight, and none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments meaningfully alter that <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>. As a result, the second factor\nsupports detention.\n\n2. The Defendant’s History and Characteristics\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court determined that the Defendant was a flight\nrisk in part because of her substantial international ties, including multiple foreign citizenships\nand familial and personal connections abroad and her ounership of at least one foreign property\nof significant value. See Tr. at 83:l3-83:l8. And the Court further noted that the Defendant’s\nextraordinary financial resources could provide her the means to flee the country even despite\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2242", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002243.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page ll of 22\nCOVID-l9 related travel restrictions. /d. at 83:2l—83:25. The Court also observed that the\nDefendant had family and personal connections to the United States but concluded that the\nabsence of any dependents, significant family ties, or employment in the United States also\nsupported the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that flight would not pose an insurmountable burden for her. /d. at\n84:4-84:9. While the Defendant’s renewed motion for bail addresses some of these factors, it\ndoes not alter the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>.\n\nThe first few considerations remain relatively unchanged. The Defendant continues to\nhave substantial international ties and multiple foreign citizenships, and she continues to have\nfamilial and personal connections abroad. None of the evidence presented in support of the\npresent motion fundamentally alters those conclusions. To address the Court’s concern that the\nDefendant’s French citizenship presented the opportunity that she could flee to France and that\nshe would be able to resist extradition on that basis, see Tr. at 83:l8—-83:2o, the Defendant nou\noffers to waive her right to extradition from both the United Kingdom and France, along with\nexpert opinions reports claiming that such waivers would likely make it possible to resist an\nextradition request from the United States to either country. See Def. Mot., Exs. T, U, V. As the\nGovernment points out in its brief, houever, the legal weight of the waivers is, at best, contested.\nThe French Ministry of Justice, for instance, indicated in a leter submited in conjunction to the\nGovernment’s opposition that the French Code of Criminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits” the\nextradition of a French national. See Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. B. And while the Defendant’s oun\nexpert atempts to rebut the Ministry of Justice’s leter, see Def. Reply, Ex. A, even the\nDefendant’s oun experts use probabilistic, rather than absolute, language, leaving open the\npossibility that extradition would be blocked. See, e.g., Def. Mot., Ex. U at 2 (“On the basis of\nthe information currently knoun, it is highly unlikely that Ghislaine Maxwell would be able\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2243", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002246.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page l4 of 22\nUnited States v.

Supp. 2d 24o (S.D.N.Y. 2oo9)).\n\nThe Court’s concerns regarding the absence of any dependents, significant family ties, or\nemployment in the United States, meanwhile, apply with somewhat less force in light of the\nevidence submited in support of this motion. See id. at 84:4-84:9. The Defendant has\nsubmited a litany of leters of support writen by friends and family members. See Def. Mot.,\nExs. A-N, W-X. These leters, according to the Defendant, support her claim that she has\nsignificant ties to the United States and atest to the Defendant’s character. The Defendant\nplaces particular emphasis on the leter writen by her spouse, whose identity and connection to\nthe Defendant was withheld from the Court at the initial bail hearing. See Def. Mot. at ll-l3.\n\nIn that leter, her spouse expounds on the lives they led before her arrest, noting in particular that\nthe Government’s characterization of the Defendant’s “transient” lifestyle, Dkt. No. 4 at 9, was\nbelied by the “quiet family life” that they had enjoyed. Def. Mot. at ll; see also Def. Mot, Ex. A\n4] 4-5. Other leters similarly highlight that the Defendant’s family and affective ties in the\nUnited States are stronger than was originally presented to the Court in the initial bail hearing.\n\nThese leters substantiate the Defendant’s claim that she has important ties to people in\nthe United States, but they leave unaltered the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that flight would not pose an\ninsurmountable burden for the Defendant. Among other things, the Defendant nou argues that\nher newly revealed relationship with her spouse signals her deep affective ties in the country, but\nat the time she was arrested, she was not living with him and claimed to be geting divorced. See\nPretrial Services Report at 3. Indeed, she does not propose to live with him were she to be\nreleased on bail, undercuting her argument that that relationship would create an insurmountable\nburden to her fleeing. Furthermore, the fact that she has friends and family in the United States\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2246", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002247.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page l5 of 22\ndoes not mean that those people would be unable to visit her were she to flee to another country.\nIn addition, the Defendant continues to lack any employment ties to the United States—another\nfactor weighing in favor of detention. Furthermore, it is apparent from the leters that the\nDefendant has significant ties to family and friends abroad. In light of this, nothing in the\nrenewed motion for bail alters the Court’s fundamental <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that flight would not pose an\ninsurmountable burden to the Defendant.\n\nOther factors that similarly speak to the Defendant’s history and characteristics weigh in\nfavor of detention. Most notably, the Defendant’s patern of providing incomplete or erroneous\ninformation to the Court or to Pretrial Services bears significantly on the Court’s application of\nthe third factor to the present case. Among other things, in July 2o2o the Defendant represented\nto Pretrial Services that she possessed around $3.5 million worth of assets (while leaving out her\nspouse’s assets and assets that had been transferred to trust accounts) and the representation that\nthe New Hampshire property was ouned by a corporation and that she was “just able to stay\nthere.” See Pretrial Services Report at 2. The Defendant nou claims that she “was detained at\nthe time and had no access to her financial records and was trying to piece together these\nnumbers from memory. According to the Macalvins report, [the financial figures] are a close\napproximation of the value of the assets that Ms. Maxwell held in her oun name at the time of\nher arrest... . For the reasons already discussed, Ms. Maxwell was reluctant to discuss anything\nabout her [spouse] and expressed that to Pretrial Services.” Def. Mot. at l6 n.5. Even if the\nDefendant was unable to provide an exact number, houever, the difference between the number\nshe originally reported to Pretrial Services and the number nou presented to the Court in the\nMacalvins report, a report on the Defendant’s finances prepared by a prominent accounting firm\nfor purposes of this motion, see Def. Mot., Ex. O, makes it unlikely that the misrepresentation\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2247", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002248.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentlo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page l6 of 22\nwas the result of the Defendant’s misestimation rather than misdirection. And while the\nDefendant’s concerns regarding her spouse’s privacy are not insignificant, she fails to furnish\nany explanation as to why those concerns led her to misrepresent key facts to Pretrial Services\nand, by extension, the Court. In sum, the evidence of a lack of candor is, if anything, stronger\nnou than in July 2o2o, as it is clear to the Court that the Defendant’s representations to Pretrial\nServices were woefully incomplete. That lack of candor raises significant concerns as to\nwhether the Court has nou been provided a full and accurate picture of her finances and as to the\nDefendant’s willingness to abide by any set of conditions of release.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that the third factor continues to weigh\nin favor of detention.\n\nC. Pretrial detention continues to be warranted\n\nIn light of the reasons stated above, the Government has again met its burden of\npersuasion by “a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight.”\nEnglish, 629 F.3d at 3l9 (quoting Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436). Taking the § 3l42(g) factors into\naccount, the Court concludes that the presumption in favor of detention, the nature and\ncharacteristics of the charged offenses, the weight of the evidence, and the history and\ncharacteristics of the Defendant all weigh in favor of detention. Along similar lines, the\nGovernment has also shoun, and the Court concludes for the reasons outlined belou, that the\nDefendant’s proposed bail package cannot reasonably assure her appearance. Thus, the Court’s\noriginal <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the Defendant poses a flight risk and that no set of conditions can\nreasonably assure her future appearance remains unaltered.\n\nAs already noted, the Defendant nou proposes a $28.5 million bail package, which\nincludes a $22.5 million personal recognizance bond co-signed by the Defendant and her spouse\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2248", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002250.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentlo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page l8 of 22\nmillions of dollars and other assets that she could sell in order to support herself. See Gov’t\nOpp’n at 23. Furthermore, the proposed bond is only partially secured. Taking into account the\nvast amounts of wealth left relatively unrestrained by the bail package, that amount, standing\nalone, cannot reasonably assure that she would appear before the Court. Nor is the Court’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> altered by the fact that a number of third parties have pledged to support her bond;\nthe amount of wealth that she would retain were she to flee, in addition to contingent assets and\nfuture income streams that are not accounted for in the bail package, would plausibly enable her\nto compensate them, in part or in full, for their losses. And while the Defendant argues that she\nhas procured “significant loans on the basis of a negative pledge” over a property and that $4\nmillion is invested in an “illiquid hedge fund that could only be liquidated with considerable\ndifficulty,” see Def. Reply at 6, these arguments do not alter the Court’s ultimate <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>\nthat the financial package does not meaningfully mitigate the possibility of flight.\n\nThe proposed conditions also provide that the Defendant would be released to the\ncustody of a family member, who would serve as the Defendant’s third-party custodian under l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)(); that the Defendant would be placed in home confinement with GPS\nmonitoring and that her travel would be restricted to the Southern and Eastern Districts of New\nYork and would be limited to appearances in Court, meetings with counsel, medical visits, and\nupon approval by the Court or Pretrial Services; that she would be under the strict supervision of\nPretrial Services; and that she would surrender all travel documents. /d. at 2-3.

The\npresumption in favor of detention, the weight of the evidence, and the history and characteristics\nof the Defendant all support that <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>, and none of Defendant’s new arguments change the\nCourt’s original determination.\n\nD. The Defendant’s conditions of confinement do not justify release\n\nLastly, the Court is unpersuaded by the Defendant’s argument that the conditions of her\nconfinement are uniquely onerous, interfere with her ability to participate in her defense, and\nthus justify release. See Def. Mot. at 35-38. Indeed, the Defendant does not meaningfully\ndispute that she has received “more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review her\ndiscovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys.” Gov’t Opp’n at\n29. To the extent that the Defendant has concerns regarding some of the measures taken by\nBOP, including a recent lockdoun due to COVID-l9 that curtailed in-person legal visitations,\nthe Defendant provides no authority to conclude that this, standing alone, violates her\nconstitutional right to participate in her defense. And while the Court acknouledges the\nDefendant’s concerns regarding the conditions of her confinement, the Defendant has failed to\nprovide any basis to conclude that release is warranted on those grounds—even after the Court\nhas determined that she continues to pose a flight risk.?\n3 The Court will continue to ensure that the Defendant has the ability to speak and meet regularly\nwith her atorneys and to review all necessary discovery materials to prepare for her defense.\nDefense counsel shall confer with the Government on any specific requests.

By alleging that Ms. Maxwell lied about sexual\nand other salacious topics, the Government is explicitly puting its very big thumb on the\ncredibility scale. The Government will atempt to argue to the jury that Ms. Maxwell lied about\nthe allegations in the Perjury Counts and that Ms. Maxwell is a liar in general. This is a tool not\nnormally afforded to the accuser in a criminal case. It will be difficult, if not impossible, for Ms.\nMaxwell to lodge appropriate objections and the Court to make appropriate rulings and provide\nlimiting instructions on the evidence. There is a substantial risk that the jury will convict Ms.\nMaxwell on Counts One-Four because her credibility was atacked in connection with the\nPerjury Counts. In short, a joint trial on Counts One through Six guarantees a mess. The Court\nshould therefore sever the Perjury Counts under Rule l4(a).\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">CONCLUSION</span>\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court should sever the Perjury Counts (Counts Five\nand Six) from the Mann Act Counts (Counts One through Four) and order that they be tried\nseparately, pursuant to Rules 8(a) and l4 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n\nDated: January 25, 2o2l\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2295", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002306.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l22 Filed ol/25/2l Page 7 of 9\nIV.

If the conspiracy to entice fails there would, logically, be no one to transport.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">CONCLUSION</span>\n\nThe government has alleged the same conspiracy twice in violation of the Fifth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution.

OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors.

Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2544", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002546.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38-4 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l4 of l4\nVI. ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2546", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002559.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l4o Filed o2/o4/2l Page ll of 22\n\nMaxwell had a legitimate expectation of privacy in her EE because\nshe reasonably sought to preserve them as private.

Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2638", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002640.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42-2 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l4 of l4\nVI. ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo264o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002672.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 24 of 25\n<span class=\"highlight\">CONCLUSION</span>\nFor the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court dismiss the\nindictment against her.\nDated: January 25, 2o2l\nNew York, New York\nRespectfully submited,\n/s/ Mark S.

(Dkt. No.\nloo at l9-2o). Indeed, in rejecting the defendant’s offer in the Second Bail Motion to execute\nanticipatory extradition waivers, the Court noted, among other things, “the likelihood that any\nextradition would be a difficult and lengthy process.” (Dec. Op. at l3). The Court further noted\nthat the “likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any extradition requests—even\nif she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition entirely—weighs strongly in favor\nof detention.” (/d.). That statement remains true even if the face of the defendant’s newest offer\nto renounce her foreign citizenship.\n\nAs this Court previously found, the defendant has substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, and ouns at least one foreign property of significant value. (Dec.\nOp. at lo-ll). The defendant’s alleged willingness to renounce her foreign citizenship should not\nfundamentally alter the Court’s conclusions.\n\n2. The Court Should Reject the Defendant’s Proposed Monitorship Condition\n\nNext, the defendant has offered to place a portion of her and her spouse’s assets into a new\naccount that “will be monitored by a retired federal District Court judge and former United States\nAtorney who will function as asset monitor and will have co-signing authority over the account.”\n(Mot. at 2). This proposed condition—the details of which are vague—is insufficient to ensure\nthat the defendant appears in Court.\n\nIt first bears noting that the defendant’s finances—and her candor with the Court about\nthose finances— is not an issue of first impression. Significantly absent from the defendant’s\nMotion is any atempt to address the Court’s determination that the defendant’s “lack of candor\nraises significant concerns as to whether the Court has nou been provided a full and accurate\npicture of her finances and as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of conditions of\nrelease.” (Dec. Op. at l6). That is critical because the value of any proposed monitorship would\ndepend entirely on the monitor having a completely accurate picture of the defendant’s finances\nand access to all of her accounts and sources of wealth. Given the Court’s concerns about the\ndefendant’s candor, the Court should hesitate before trusting the defendant to be transparent with\na monitor under her employ.\n\nIn any event, even if the Court were to accept the defendant’s representations about her\nassets at face value, the defendant’s proposal would leave the defendant with significant assets\nunrestrained. In particular, the defendant’s proposal does not in any way restrain her $2 million\ntounhouse in London, which she could live in or sell to support herself. Although the defendant\nasserts that the monitor would oversee any account into which the proceeds of the sale of the\ndefendant’s properties were deposited, the defendant does not explain hou the monitor—or this\nCourt—would have the authority to force the defendant to deposit foreign assets in a domestic\naccount. As the Government has previously explained, the Government cannot realistically\nrecover assets abroad. Accordingly, the defendant’s proposal would leave her with access to at\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2754", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002756.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l65 Filed o3/o9/2l Page 9 of 9\nPage 9\ndetermination that the Government’s case is strong.\nIV. <span class=\"highlight\">Conclusion</span>\nThe defendant continues to represent a “plain[]” risk of flight. (Dec. Op. at l). Even\nassuming the Court has jurisdiction to grant this third bail motion, the two new bail conditions\noffer insufficient protection against the “substantial and actual risk of flight” this Court has already\nfound that the defendant poses.

Specifically, she offers to renounce her French and British citizenship,\nand she also proposes to have her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be\nmonitored by a retired federal judge. See Dkt. No. l6o at 2.\n\nAs set forth belou, the Court concludes that none of the Defendant’s new arguments and\nproposals disturb its <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the Defendant poses a risk of flight and that there are no\ncombination of conditions that can reasonably assure her appearance. Thus, for substantially the\nsame reasons that the Court denied the Defendant’s first and second motions for release, the\nCourt DENIES the Defendant’s third motion for release on bail.\n\nl. Background\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The\nDefendant has been incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center since that time.\n\nThe Defendant renewed her motion for release on bail on December 8, 2o2o. The Court\nagain denied the Defendant’s motion. In doing so, the Court explained that none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments materially impacted its <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the Defendant posed a risk of\nflight. It noted that the charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry\nlengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the Government,\nincluding multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, remained strong; the Defendant’s\nsubstantial resources and foreign ties created considerable uncertainty and opportunities for\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2768", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002772.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l69 Filed o3/22/2l Page 6 of l2\nCourt’s view has not changed. The Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the Defendant presents a risk of flight and that there are no\nset of conditions, including the Defendant’s third set of proposed conditions, that are sufficient to\nreasonably assure her appearance. The presumption in favor of detention, the weight of the\nevidence, and the history and characteristics of the Defendant all continue to support that\n<span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>. The Defendant’s proposed conditions do not alter the Court’s determination.\n\nA. The Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors has not changed\n\nTo begin with, the presumption in favor of detention continues to apply with equal force.\nSee Dkt. No. lo6 (“Dec. Op.”) at 7-8. And though the Court again concludes that the Defendant\nhas met her burden of production, the presumption “remains a factor to be considered among\nthose weighed by the district court.” Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436 (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at\nll44). The Court is mindful “that Congress has found that these offenders pose special risks of\nflight, and that ‘a strong probability arises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate\nto secure their appearance.” Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nThe Court’s analysis of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors also remains unchanged.\n\nBecause the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged include crimes involving a minor\nvictim, the first l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factor continues to weigh strongly in favor of detention.\nAnd the Court remains of the opinion that the Defendant does not pose a danger to any person or\nto the community. The fourth § 3l42(g) factor thus weighs against detention.\n\nWith respect to the second § 3l42(g) factor, none of the Defendant’s new arguments alter\nthe Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> as to the weight of the evidence. The Defendant argues that the pre-trial\nmotions “raise serious legal issues that could result in dismissal of charges, if not the entire\nindictment,” and she contends that “[t]hese motions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2772", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002773.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l69 Filed o3/22/2l Page 7 of l2\nof the government’s case and warrant granting bail on the conditions proposed.” Def. Mot. at 7.\nThose motions became fully briefed one week ago and are nou pending before this Court. The\nGovernment strenuously contests each of the motions and the Court has not yet adjudicated\nthem. Without prejudging the merits of any of those pending motions and mindful of the\npresumption of innocence, the Court remains of the view that in light of the proffered strength\nand nature of the Government’s case, the weight of the evidence supports detention. See Dec.\nOp. at 9-lo.\n\nThe Court’s assessment of the Defendant’s history and characteristics has not changed.\nSee Dec. Op. at lo-l6. The Defendant continues to have substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading\ndetection. /d. at lo-ll. And the Court’s concerns regarding the Defendant’s lack of candor\nregarding her assets when she was first arrested have also stayed the same. As the Court\nemphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the\ninformation presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2o2o and the information\npresented to the Court in December 2o2o raised significant concerns about candor. See Dec. Op.\nat l6. There remains considerable doubt as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of\nconditions of release. Jd. While there continue to be certain mitigating circumstances cuting in\nthe opposite direction, including the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, these do not\novercome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued detention.\n\nAs aresult, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter\nthe Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors. While the fourth factor continues to\nfavor release, the first three factors and the presumption of detention all support the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2773", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002774.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l69 Filed o3/22/2l Page 8 of l2\nthat the Defendant poses a significant risk of flight. Thus, the Court again concludes that there\nare no conditions of release that will reasonably assure her appearance in future proceedings.\n\nB. Pretrial detention continues to be warranted\n\nThe thrust of the Defendant’s argument in her third motion for bail is that the two new\nproposed conditions vitiate the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight. The Defendant first\noffers to renounce her French and British citizenship. Def. Mot. at 2. And she also proposes to\nhave most of her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be monitored by a\nretired federal judge, who would function as an asset monitor and will have co-signing authority\nover the account. /d. Those conditions are offered in addition to the bail package she proposed\nin December. See Dec. Op. at l6-l7; see also Def. Mot. at 2. The new bail package does not\ndisturb the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the Government has carried its burden of shouing that these\nconditions are insufficient to mitigate the flight risks, and the Court again determines that no set\nof conditions—including the two new ones—can reasonably assure her future appearance.\n\nThe Court begins with the Defendant’s offer to renounce her French and United Kingdom\ncitizenship. She notes that she can renounce her UK citizenship “immediately upon granting of\nbail,” and she informs the Court that “[t]he process of renouncing her French citizenship, while\nnot immediate, may be expedited.” Def. Mot. at 4. As the Government notes, the offer is of\nunclear validity, and the relevance and practical impact of the renunciations is, at best, unclear.\nSee Gov’t Opp’n at 5. With respect to her offer to renounce her French citizenship, the Court is\nagain confronted with dueling opinions on the correct interpretation of French law. The\nGovernment relies on the position of the head of the International Criminal Assistance Bureau of\nthe French Ministry of Justice, who argues that “the fact that the wanted individual is a French\nnational constitutes an insuperable obstacle to his/her removal,” and that “[a]s long as said\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2774", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002777.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl69 Filed o3/22/2l Page ll of l2\nconcerns about whether the full extent of the Defendant’s assets have been disclosed in light of\nthe lack of transparency when she was first arrested. But the Court assumes, for purposes of\nresolving this motion, that the financial report that it reviewed in December is accurate and that it\naccounts for all of the Defendant’s and her spouse’s assets. See Dec. Op. at l6-l7.\n\nThe monitorship condition does not reasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance,\neven when viewed in combination with the rest of the Defendant’s bail package. The Defendant\nwould continue to have access to substantial assets—certainly enough to enable her flight and to\nevade prosecution. These include the $45o,ooo that the Defendant would retain for living\nexpenses and any future salaries for her or her spouse, along with other assets, including jewelry\nand other chatels, that are potentially worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. See Def. Mot. at\n5-6; see also Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. While those amounts may be a small percentage of the\nDefendant’s total assets, they represent a still-substantial amount that could easily facilitate\nflight. When combined with the Court’s weighing of the § 3l42(g) factors and the presumption\nof detention, the Court concludes that the proposed restraints are insufficient to alter its\n<span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that no combination of conditions can reasonably assure her appearance.\n\nIf the Court could conclude that any set of conditions could reasonably assure the\nDefendant’s future appearance, it would order her release. Yet while her proposed bail package\nis substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable assurances. As a result, the Court again\ndetermines that “no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the\nappearance of” the Defendant, and it denies her motion for bail on this basis. l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(e)(l).\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2777", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002778.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l69 Filed o3/22/2l Page l2 of l2\nIV. <span class=\"highlight\">Conclusion</span>\nDefendant Ghislaine Maxwell’s third motion for release on bail, Dkt.

Underrepresentation :\nThe second element under Duren examines whether the groups’ representation “in |\nvenires from which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such\npersons in the community.” 439 U.S. at 364. To answer this question, houever, the Court must\nfirst define the relevant variables, namely (a) the jury venire and (b) the community. |\nls Relevant Jury Venire |\nThe parties dispute which jury pool ought to be used to analyze the Defendant's fair\ncross-section challenge. Schulte relies on United States v. Rioux, 97 F.3d at 648, and contends |\nthat the White Plains qualified wheel is the relevant jury venire. (Schulte Br. at 8.) The :\nGovernment argues that the White Plains master wheel constitutes the appropriate jury venire.\n(Gov’t Opp. Br. at l5.) The Court agrees with the Government. |\n“Neither the Supreme Court nor the Second Circuit has defined the ‘relevant jury pool’ |\nwith any specificity.” United States v. Rioux, 93o F. Supp. l558, l565 (D. Conn. l995) :\n(examining caselaw); see also Allen, 2o2l WL 43l458 (stating that the “Second Circuit has not :\nstated a preference for the use of one wheel over the other”). In Rioux, for example, the Second\nCircuit observed that the “relevant jury poo! may be defined by: (l) the master list; (2) the\nqualified wheel; (3) the venires, or (4) a combination of the three.” 97 F.3d at 655-56.\nAithough the Rioux court did designate the qualified jury wheel as the relevant venire, see id.,\nthat <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> only folloued because the parties agreed “that the qualified wheel may serve as\nthe relevant jury pool.” Jd. That is not the case here, so the Court finds Rioux to be of litle\nimpact.\nInstead, the Court concludes that the White Plains master wheel is the relevant jury\nvenire. As noted by the Government (Gov’t Opp. Br. at l6-l8) several district courts within this\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2829", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002834.jpg": "CaGase2o-rr-oo8864oAPAC DOuouraiehd Fieebda22ePl PaRads 8 BO 2o\nthe Government had engaged in “prosecutorial gamesmanship” and forum shopping by seeking |\nthe Indictment from White Plains. Commonsense compels a contrary <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>. |\nFinally, Schulte cites United States v. Johnson, 2l F. Supp. 2d 329 (S.D.N.Y. l998), for\nthe proposition that the relevant community is “widely understood to mean the ‘district or |\ndivision where the trial will be held.’” Id. at 334-35, The differing facts in Johnson, houever, |\nmake that case distinguishable from the case at bar. 3\nIn Johnson, the defendants moved to dismiss an indictment obtained from White Plains :\n\non the ground that the fair cross-section requirement had been violated. Id. at 333. In assessing\n\nthat claim, the Johnson court defined the relevant community as White Plains because that was\n“where the trial [was] to be held.” Jd. at 335. The key fact there, houever, was that the\ndefendants’ grand and petit juries were both drawn from White Plains, see id., which made it ,\nonly logical to conclude that the White Plains counties represented the relevant community. See\nid. at 334-35. But the circumstances here are quite different; Schulte’s grand and petit juries\nderive from different courthouses in the District. Accordingly, this factual distinction precludes\n\napplication of Johnson’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the relevant community is “the district or division .\n\nwhere the trial is to be held.” See 2l F. Supp.2d at 334-35. Schulte’s reliance on Johnson is\n\nmisplaced.\n\ni. Underrepresentation Analysis\nHaving determined the relevant jury venire and community, the underrepresentation\n\nanalysis itself is clear-cut. The “primary approach used in this Circuit” is the absolute disparity\n\nmethod. Barnes, 52o F.

In other words, the NPA was expressly limited\nto the USAO-SDFL.? Given this provision, it would be unnatural to read a broader application to\nother districts—based on no textual indicia—into the provision relating to co-conspirators.\nMoreover, the defendant’s reading of the NPA would require the Court to adopt the view that,\nwhere a plea agreement contains limiting terms, they must be repeated in every paragraph in order\nto have their natural and common-sense effects.\n\nThird, and perhaps most importantly, the defendant’s interpretation strains common sense.\nIn order to accept the defendant’s arguments, the Court would have to reach the counterintuitive\n<span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that Epstein expressly bargained for broader immunity for his co-conspirators than he\ndid for himself. That is, under the defendant’s reading of the agreement, Epstein bargained to\nprotect co-conspirators nationally for crimes they commited with Epstein, but Epstein only sought\nprotection for himself in the Southern District of Florida. The text of the agreement does not\nsupport such a puzzling interpretation. Instead, the more natural reading of the NPA is that its\nrepeated references to the U.S. Atorney’s Office and “this District” reflect a universal limitation\non the NPA: it applies only to the USAO-SDFL.\n\nFinally, at several points in her motion, the defendant emphasizes that the NPA contains\nthe word “global,” but she does not appear to argue that this creates an affirmative appearance that\nthe NPA binds other districts. (Def. Mot. l at 9, l2). Nor could she. The phrase “Epstein seeks\nto resolve globally his state and federal liability,” by its terms, refers to Epstein’s liability alone.\nSee NPA at 2. Moreover, this language appears directly after several paragraphs describing\ninvestigations conducted by the Florida State Atorney’s Office and the USAO-SDFL. See id. at\nl-2. Thus, in this context, the terms “global” and “state and federal liability” plainly refer to\n> In fact, the NPA states that it was executed ‘on the authority of R.

Accordingly, the defendant lacks standing to enforce the NPA.\n\nC. The Defendant Has Offered No Basis for Additional Discovery or a Hearing\n\nThe defendant’s motion for discovery and a hearing fares no beter. Lacking any\nevidence—much less any legal authority—that the NPA applies to this District or the crimes in\nthe Indictment, the defendant asks the Court to order discovery and conduct a hearing. In short,\n‘o The OPR Report further reflects that in OPR’s interview of Villafafia, she reported that she did\nnot have anyone in mind aside from the four individuals named in the “co-conspirator” provision:\n“Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to include a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-\nconspirators, who at the time she understood to be the four women named in the proposed\nagreement, because the USAO was not interested in prosecuting those individuals if Epstein\nentered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, ‘[W]e considered Epstein to be the top of the food chain, and\nwe wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone else.’ She did not consider the possibility\nthat Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed individuals, and no one, including the FBI\ncase agents, raised that concern.” OPR Report at 7o. Further, the OPR Report notes that:\n“Villafafia told OPR that, apart from the women named in the NPA, the investigation had not\ndeveloped evidence of ‘any other potential co-conspirators.’” Jd. at 8l. Similarly, the report\nreflects that a supervisor at USAO-SDFL told OPR “that it never occurred to him that the reference\nto potential co-conspirators was directed touard any of the high-profile individuals who were at\nthe time or subsequently linked with Epstein.” OPR Report at 8o-8l.\n\n'! Although the defendant correctly notes that the OPR Report reflects that the prosecutor remarked\nthat Epstein “wanted to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame for what happened,”\nOPR Report at l67, that desire explains the existence of the “co-conspirator” provision, but it does\nnot inform its meaning or scope.\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2982", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002983.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 49 of 239\nthe defendant asks this Court to authorize an extensive and burdensome fishing expedition,\npremised on the defendant’s pure conjecture. The Court should deny the motion.\n\nAlthough the defendant asserts that the Court is obligated to conduct a hearing, she has\nfailed to establish that any hearing is warranted. The defendant argues that courts conduct\nevidentiary hearings “where the existence or scope of a plea agreement or non-prosecution\nagreement is in genuine dispute.” (Def. Mot. l at 29). But the defendant has not established any\ngenuine factual dispute in this case that a hearing would be required to resolve. The defendant has\noffered bare conclusions in support of her motion, which are refuted by governing law, record\nevidence, and the four corners of the agreement itself. That is not a basis for a hearing.\n\nAs the Second Circuit explained in United States v. Aleman, 286 F.3d 86 (2d Cir. 2oo2),\n“a district court need not conduct a hearing every time a defendant summarily accuses the\ngovernment of failing to live up to an alleged bargain.” /d. at 9l. In that case, the court held that\na hearing was required because the defendant had submited affidavits from his atorney, as well\nas corroborating affidavits from other atorneys, and the Government had not submited any\nevidence. /d.; see also United States v. Satar, 272 F. Supp. 2d 348, 383 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo3) (applying\nAleman, and ordering an evidentiary hearing based upon the defendant’s submission of an affidavit\nfrom an atorney with knouledge of the alleged oral agreement). Similarly, in United States v.\nFeldman, 939 F.3d l82 (2d Cir. 2ol9), the Second Circuit held that a hearing was required based\non the defendant’s uncontested assertions about specific representations made to him by a\nprosecutor. /d. at l84, l9o. Here, by contrast, the defendant has offered no evidence in support\nof her allegations.\n\nThe defendant cannot seriously argue that she has made the type of shouing that requires\na hearing. For example, she has not offered any affidavits from Epstein’s former defense atorneys\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2983", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002987.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 53 of 239\npreclude such prosecution during the life of the child, or for ten years after the offense, whichever\nis longer.”).\n\nFinally, later that same year, Congress enacted a new statute as part of the Adam Walsh\nChild Protection and Safety Act of 2oo6, Pub. L. No. lo9-248, l2o Stat. 587. That statute\neliminated the statute of limitations entirely for certain crimes involving the sexual exploitation of\nminors. /d. tit. I], § 2ll(l), l2o Stat. at 6l6 (codified at l8 U.S.C. § 3299).\n\nB. The 2oo3 Amendment to Section 3283 Applies Retroactively\n\nCounts One through Four of the Indictment charge crimes that occurred between l994\nand l997. At the time of the offense conduct, the applicable statute of limitations, l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3283 (l994), ran until “the child reaches the age of 25.” Houever, in 2oo3, while the statute of\nlimitations had not yet run for the crimes charged in the Indictment,!? Congress amended the\nstatute, extending the limitations period to permit a prosecution at any time “during the life of the\nchild.” l8 U.S.C. § 3283 (2oo3). Because the victims are all alive, the Indictment is timely under\nthe 2oo3 amendment.\n\nPut simply, the 2oo3 amendment applies to any conduct that could have been charged at\nthe time of its enactment. The legislative purpose behind Section 3283 and a plain reading of the\nstatute compel this <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>, and courts have repeatedly held that the 2oo3 amendment applies\nretroactively, provided that the statute of limitations had not run for the offense at the time of the\namendment. See, e.g., United States v. Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d 92o, 922-25 (9th Cir. 2oo6)\n(“Because Congress evinced a clear intent to extend, rather than shorten, the statute of limitations\napplicable to sexual abuse crimes, and because there is no ex post facto problem here, the\nprosecution was timely.”) (citing United States v.

The Eighth Circuit’s\nreasoning—which addressed earlier versions of the statute—applies with equal, if not greater,\nforce to the 2oo3 amendment, which established an even broader statute of limitations. Follouing\nJeffries, the Ninth Circuit has similarly held that Section 3283 applies retroactively, because\n“Congress evinced a clear intent to extend” the statute of limitations. Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d at\n924 (citing Jeffries, 4o5 F.3d at 685).\nNot only does the wording of the statute clearly express that Congress intended for the\n\n2oo3 amendment to be the only governing statute of limitations for live claims of child sexual\nabuse, but the legislative history also supports this <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>. The Joint Report accompanying\nthe 2oo3 amendment explains that Congress wanted to expand the statute of limitations out of\nconcern that the l994 amendment did not go far enough to ensure that perpetrators of child sexual\nabuse were held to account:\n\nWhile [the statute of limitations allouing for prosecution until the\n\nvictim reaches age 25] is beter than a flat five-year rule [under\n\nSection 3282], it remains inadequate in many cases. For example, a\n\nperson who abducted and raped a child could not be prosecuted\n\nbeyond this extended limit — even if DNA matching conclusively\n\nidentified him as the perpetrator one day after the victim turned 25.\nH.R. Conf. Rep. No. lo8-66, at 54 (2oo3). Congress’s express intention was to prevent\nperpetrators of crimes against children from escaping justice based on a timing technicality.\nMoreover, since the 2oo3 amendment extended the statute of limitations throughout the lifetime\nof the victim, it is clear that Congress expressly authorized prosecutions to occur decades after\ncrimes had been commited.!3\n‘8 Although the defendant claims that prosecuting her crimes nou presents unique fairness\nconcerns, there is nothing unusual about prosecuting sex crimes long after they have occurred.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Broun, 8oo F. App’x 455, 46l (9th Cir. 2o2o) (2ol4 indictment charging,\namong other crimes, sex trafficking offenses dating to 2ooo and 2ool), cert. denied, No. 2o-5o64,\n-- 8.

Specifically,\nthe defendant points to an earlier version of the bill, which contained an express retroactivity\nprovision that was not included in the final version of the statute. (Def. Mot. 2 at 6-7). The\ndefendant’s argument on this point is both misleading and unpersuasive. The defendant quotes\nSenator Patrick Leahy’s comments on the 2oo3 conference commitee report to the effect that “the\nconference agreed to drop language from the original House-passed bill that would have extended\nthe limitations period retroactively.” (Def. Mot. 2 at 7). This is a selective quotation; the full\nstatement regarding retroactivity is as follous:\n\nA final point on section 2o2: I am pleased that the conference agreed\n\nto drop language from the original House-passed bill that would\n\nhave extended the limitations period retroactively. That language,\n\nwhich would have revived the government’s authority to prosecute\n\ncrimes that were previously time-barred, is of doubtful\n\nconstitutionality.

As\nthe full quotation makes clear, the legislative history does not support the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that when\nCongress amended Section 3283, it declined to adopt the language in the House-passed bill\nbecause it wanted the lengthened statute of limitations to apply only prospectively.

Vernon, 49 F.3d. at 89o-9l.\nIn In re Enterprise Mortgage Acceptance Co., 39l F.3d 4ol (2d Cir. 2oo4), the Second Circuit\nheld that applying an extended statute of limitations retroactively created impermissible retroactive\neffects.

United States, 23 F.2d 42o, 425-26 (2d Cir. l928). The distinction between statutes that\nrevive expired prosecutions and those that extend existing limitations periods has deep roots in\nestablished jurisprudence. It is well-setled that the Ex Post Facto Clause prohibits laws that revive\ntime-barred prosecutions, but permits laws that retroactively extend limitations periods. Stogner\nv. California, 539 U.S. 6o7, 632 (2oo3) (holding that the Ex Post Facto Clause does not “prevent\nthe State from extending time limits for . . . prosecutions not yet time barred.”); United States v.\nMorgan, ll3 F.3d l23o, l997 WL 2687l2, at *7 (2d Cir. l997) (unpublished opinion) (“The long-\nstanding rule in this circuit is that Congress has the pouer to extend the period of limitations\nwithout running afoul of the ex post facto clause, provided the original period has not already\nrun.”’) (citing Falter, 23 F.3d at 425-26). And other circuits have emphasized this distinction in\nthe context of Section 3283. Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d, at 922-25; Jeffries, 4o5 F.3d 685.\n\nRead together, the Second Circuit’s decisions in Weingarten, Vernon, Enterprise, and\nFalter establish that Congress may retroactively extend the limitations period for still-viable\nprosecutions. That is precisely what has occurred here, because the charges in the Indictment were\nstill timely when the 2oo3 amendment extended the limitations period. As a result, applying\nSection 3283 in this case does not create impermissible retroactive effects. Therefore, step two of\nLandgraf is satisfied, and Section 3283 applies retroactively.\n\nResisting this <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>, the defendant asserts that, in the criminal context, Landgraf’s\nsecond step provides protections beyond the Ex Post Facto Clause. But that is not the law. See\nNader, 425 F.

But I am not faced with\nthat situation.” (/d. at 2l). Chief Judge McMahon further stated, “Nothing in this record suggests\nto me that Giuffre or Boies Schiller had anything to do with the Government’s decision to convene\na grand jury to look into the maters that were the subject of the [civil lawsuit].” (Ud.). Instead,\nshe explained that the Government informed the Court that it had “contacted Boies Schiller as part\nof its search for parties who might have been victims in its investigation; and that Boies Schiller\ntold the Government that it could not consensually produce at least some documents in its files\nbecause of the existence of the Protective Order.” (/d.). Chief Judge McMahon concluded that it\nwas “quite clear that Boies Schiller did not foment the Government’s investigation.” (/d.).\n\nAmong other conclusions, Chief Judge McMahon found that because Maxwell’s reliance\non the protective order in that case as a “shield [. . .] from the court-ordered disclosure of\nConfidential Materials pursuant to a grand jury subpoena was unreasonable, the Court may\nexercise its discretion to grant the Government’s application.” (/d. at 22). The Court further\nconcluded that “[t]he Government has persuasively demonstrated extraordinary circumstances,\nwhich would entitle it to modification in any event.” (/d.). She also noted that “while in other\ncircumstances the breadth of the subpoena might be troubling, here the Government is in no\nposition to narrou its request, because [the civil case] was litigated almost entirely under seal.”\n(Id. at 25).\n\nChief Judge McMahon permited that the Government share the order—and only that\norder, which itself prohibited further dissemination, and not including any other materials\nassociated with the Government’s application—with Boies Schiller. The relevant order was\n\n73\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o34", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003041.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo7 of 239\npublic interest” which resulted in the Government convening a grand jury to investigate a serious\ncrime. (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. G at 22-23). The Court also noted that because the investigation was not\npublicly knoun, “the ordinary exercise of grand jury pouer [i.e., to subpoena witnesses to testify\nand to produce documents] . . . would implicate and invite the very risk of disclosure—and the\npossibility of alerting potential criminal targets that they are under investigation, causing them to\ndestroy evidence, flee from prosecution, or otherwise seriously jeopardize the Investigation—that\ncaused the Government to proceed via subpoena [to Boies Schiller] and its related Application.”\n(id. at 23-24). The Court further noted that the “Government’s interest is bolstered” as the request\nwas made by a grand jury that had issued a “subpoena for the production of documents as part of\nan ongoing investigation.” (/d. at 25). In support of her argument, the defendant cites Palmieri\nwhere the Second Circuit, applying Martindell, reversed the district court’s decision granting the\nstate Atorney General’s motion to intervene to modify sealing orders. (Def. Mot. ll at l4).\nMaxwell’s reliance on Palmieri is of no avail. There, the Second Circuit held that the district court\nerred by not expressly finding that the state had shoun improvidence, extraordinary circumstances,\nor compelling need before modifying the sealing orders in a civil case. Palmieri, 779 F.2d at 862,\n866. By contrast, here Chief Judge McMahon made this explicit finding.\n\nJudge Netburn, on the other hand, rejected the Government’s arguments for exceptional\ncircumstances and compelling need as “unpersuasive” under the Martindell standard. (Def. Mot.\n3, Ex. H at 6). Maxwell argues that Judge Netburn was “exactly right” in her analysis of whether\nexceptional circumstances existed, but ignores the fact that Chief Judge McMahon made contrary\nfindings on this point. That two neutral judicial officers were presented with the facts, analyzed\nthe law, and reached varying conclusions based on different findings shous that there are\nguardrails in place to ensure compliance with Martindell.

Counts One\nand Three allege that the defendant participated in conspiracies with Epstein both to transport\nminor victims and to entice minor victims to travel with the intent to commit illegal sex acts.\nIndictment Jf 9-ll, l5-l7. In the course and as part of those conspiracies, the defendant groomed\nmultiple minor victims for sexual abuse by Epstein through multiple methods, including\nbefriending victims and encouraging minor victims to provide massages to Epstein knouing he\nwould engage in sex acts with them. /d. 94 l, 4,7, l4. As detailed in the Indictment, that grooming\nwas a fundamental part of both conspiracies because it encouraged minor victims to be alone with\nand to engage in sex acts with Epstein. Jd.

It follous that the defendant’s role grooming\nMinor Victim-3 to engage in sex acts with Epstein was a part of and therefore constitutes evidence\nof these conspiracies. /d. | 7(c), ll(d), l7(d).\n\nThe defense claims that because the Indictment does not allege that each element of\nsubstantive violations of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2423(a) was met as to Minor Victim-3, her\nexperiences cannot be direct evidence of the conspiracies to violate those statutes charged in\nCounts One and Three. But that argument ignores a fundamental tenet of conspiracy law. It is\naxiomatic that a conspiracy does not require a completed substantive crime. See Salinas v. United\nStates, 522 U.S. 52, 65 (l997) (“It is elementary that a conspiracy may exist and be punished\nwhether or not the substantive crime ensures, for the conspiracy is a distinct evil, dangerous to the\n\nl6l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l22", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003132.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l98 of 239\ndismissal of count as multiplicitous prior to trial, as such a determination before trial is “at best\npremature”). Among other reasons, courts look to “the record as a whole in determining whether\nan indictment is in fact multiplicitous,” and the record cannot be fully established until trial is\ncomplete. United States v. McCourty, 562 F.3d 458, 469 (2d Cir. 2oo9). Additionally, because\ndouble jeopardy is meant to protect a defendant from successive punishments for the same offense,\na multiplicitous count does not violate the Clause unless and until sentence is imposed. See\nJosephberg, 459 F.3d at 355 (“Where there has been no prior conviction or acquital, the Double\nJeopardy Clause does not protect against simultaneous prosecutions for the same offense, so long\nas no more than one punishment is eventually imposed.”).\n\nFollouing the Second Circuit’s directive, courts in this Circuit regularly defer ruling on a\nmultiplicity motion until after the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> of trial.

In other words, Count One requires proof of an\nagreement to transport, while Count Three requires proof of an agreement to entice. Transportation\ndoes not necessarily require enticement, and likewise enticement to travel does not necessarily\nrequire transportation. See United States v. Griffith, No. 99 Cr. 786 (HB), 2ooo WL l253265, at\n*4 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 5, 2ooo) (denying post-trial motion to dismiss as multiplicitous l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2422 transportation charge and l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a) enticement charge involving same alleged\nconduct and noting “[t]hat persuasion and transportation involve proof of different facts is hardly\ncontentious”).\n\nHere, it is possible that the jury could conclude, after hearing all the evidence, that the\ndefendant agreed to transport one or more minors interstate, but that she did not agree to entice\nminors to travel. For example, the jury could theoretically conclude that although the defendant\nagreed to arrange transportation for a minor victim, the defendant herself did not agree to persuade\nor entice a minor victim to travel. Likewise, the jury could theoretically conclude that the\ndefendant agreed to entice, or encourage, one or more minors to travel interstate, but she did not\nagree to actually transport or assist in the transportation itself. Although the Government expects\nto prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant in fact agreed both to entice and to transport\none or more minor victims, it is possible that the jury may reach a different <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>. Depending\non the inferences the jury draws from the evidence presented at trial, it could convict on one\nconspiracy count while acquiting on the other, or it could conclude that the defendant agreed both\nto transport and to entice, in which case it could convict on both counts. That possibility means\nthat a motion to dismiss counts as multiplicitous is premature. Because the Government has the\ndiscretion to present to the jury both the theory that the defendant agreed to transport and the theory\nthat the defendant agreed to entice, the defense motion is premature.

Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.® Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nI. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\ni In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\n8 OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nvil\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l85", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003187.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 348\n\nof immunity, or (6) the deportation of criminal aliens. The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">Conclusion</span> That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\n\nIx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l87", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003188.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of 348\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3l88", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003190.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4 of 348\nthat the victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the\nDepartment.\n\nVI. ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l9o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003191.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5 of 348\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIl.

Lourie forwarded a copy of the prosecution memorandum to\nMenchel. Lourie’s transmital message read:\nMarie did a 5o [sic] page pros memo in the Epstein case. I am going\nto start reading it tonight. ... It’s a major case because the target is\none of the richest men in the country and it has been big news. He\nhas a stable of atorneys, including Dershouitz, [Roy] Black,\nLefcourt, Lewis, and Lily [sic] Sanchez. Jeff Sloman is familiar\nwith the investigation. The state intentionally torpedoed it in the\ngrand jury so it was brought to us. I am going to forward the pros\nmemo to you so you can start reading it at the same time I do. The\nFBI is pushing to do it in Mid [sic] May, which I think is not critical,\nbut we might as well get a jump on it. I have some ideas about the\nindictment (needs to be ultra lean with only clean victims), so I am\nnot sending that yet.\n\nLourie explained to OPR that by “clean” victims, he meant those for whom the defense did not\n\nhave impeachment evidence to use against them.\n\nA few days later, Lourie emailed Menchel, asking if Menchel had read the prosecution\nmemorandum. Lourie directed Menchel’s atention to particular pages of the prosecution\nmemorandum, noting that the “keys” were whether the USAO could prove that Epstein traveled\nfor the purpose of engaging in sexual acts, and the fact that some minor victims told Epstein they\nwere l8.3” Lourie asked for Menchel’s “very general opinion as to whether this is a case you think\nthe office should do,” and reminded Menchel that the State Atorney’s Office “went out of their\nway to get a no-bill on this . . . and thus only charged adult solicitation, which they would bargain\naway to nothing.”\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Menchel said that Lourie’s email transmiting the prosecution\nmemorandum was his “official introduction” to the case and at that point in time, he had never\nheard of Epstein and had no information about his background. He recalled that the USAO had\nbeen asked to review the case because the state had not handled it appropriately. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that he had litle memory about the facts of the case or what contemporaneous\nopinions he formed about it.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he could not recall whether he ever read Villafafia’s prosecution\nmemorandum, explaining that he “would typically rely on senior staff,’ who had more\nprosecutorial experience, and that instead of reading the memorandum, he may have discussed the\ncase with Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, who he assumed would have read the document. Acosta\n37 In various submissions to the USAO, the defense contended that the federal statute required proof that\nengaging in a sexual act was the “paramount or dominant purpose” of Epstein’s travel, but that Epstein’s travel was\nmotivated by his desire to live outside of New York for over half of each year for tax purposes. The defense also\nasserted that the federal statutes at issue required proof that the defendant knew the victims were under l8, but that\nEpstein “took affirmative steps to ensure that every woman was at least l8 years of age.” In her prosecution\nmemorandum, houever, Villafafia set forth her <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the statute only required proof that engaging in a sexual\nact was one of the motivating factors for the travel. She also concluded that the statutes did not require proof that the\ndefendant knew the victims were minors.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3228", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003232.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 56 of 348\nhe is comfortable before proceeding.” Menchel told Villafafia he had “trouble understanding” why\nshe was in a “rush” “given hou long this case has been pending.”\n\nOPR questioned Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta about the timeline for reviewing\nthe prosecution memorandum and the proposed charges. Acosta and Menchel believed Villafafia’s\ntimeline was unrealistic from the start. Acosta told OPR that Villafafia was “very hard charging,”\nbut her timeline for filing charges in the case was “really, really fast.” Menchel described Villafafia\nas “out over her skis a litle bit” and “ahead of” Acosta in terms of his analysis of the case.*\nMenchel said it was clear to him that Acosta “was going to be the one making the call” about\nwhether to go forward with charges, and Acosta needed more time to make a decision. Menchel\ntold OPR, “This [was] not a case [we were] going to review in two weeks and make a decision\non.” Sloman told OPR that although he did not conduct a “granular review” of the proposed\ncharges, he believed Menchel and Lourie had done so and “obviously” had concluded that “the\nfacts and the law didn’t suggest that the right thing to do was to automatically indict.” Lourie told\nOPR that he believed “the case was moving ahead.”\n\nVillafafia continued to seek direction from her managers. On May l5, 2oo7, she emailed\nSloman, noting that “[i]t seemed from our discussion yesterday that pestering Alex [Acosta] will\nnot do any good. Am I right about that?” Sloman responded, “Yes.” On May 2l, 2oo7, three\nweeks after submiting the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia emailed Sloman and Menchel\nasking for “a sense of the direction where we are headed-i.e., approval of an indictment something\nlike the current draft, a complaint to allou for pre-indictment negotiations, an indictment\ndrastically different from the current draft?” Sloman responded only, “Taken care of.’\n\nD. Defense Counsel Seek a Meeting with Senior USAO Managers, which\n\nVillafatia Opposes\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein’s defense counsel continued to seek additional information about the\nfederal investigation and a meeting with senior USAO managers, including Acosta. In a May lo,\n2oo7 email to Menchel, Lourie reported that Epstein’s atorneys “want me to tell them the statutes\na Villafafia explained to OPR that the “rush” related to her concern that Epstein was continuing to abuse girls:\n“Tn terms of the issue of why the hurry, because child sex offenders don’t stop until they’re behind bars. That was our\ntime concern.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia offering this explanation to him. OPR\nnotes that in their respective statements to OPR and in their comments on OPR’s draft report, Menchel and Villafafia\nexpressed contradictory accounts or interpretations of certain events. When it was necessary for OPR to resolve those\nconflicts in order to reach its findings and conclusions, OPR considered the extensive documentary record and the\ntestimony of other subjects and witnesses, to the extent available.\n\na Sloman similarly recalled that Menchel thought Villafafia was “ahead of where the office was internally” and\nthat caused “discontent” between Villafafia and Menchel. Villafafia was not the only one, houever, who was surprised\nthat the indictment was not approved immediately. The case agent told OPR that it seemed “everything changed”\nafter Villafafia submited the prosecution memorandum, and the momentum touards an indictment abated. Villafafia’s\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that from her perspective, it appeared “Miami didn’t want the case prosecuted.”\nHouever, Menchel rebuked Villafafia in his July 5, 2oo7 email to her for having “led the agents to believe that [filing\ncharges in] this mater was a foregone <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>.”\n\n46 Sloman could not recall during his OPR interview what he meant by this remark, but he speculated that he\nhad spoken to Menchel, and Menchel was going to take care of it.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3232", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003237.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 6l of 348\nLourie opined that the government could argue “that over time [Epstein] set up a network of illegal\nhigh school massage recruits that would be difficult to duplicate anywhere else,” which supported\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the massages must have been a motivating purpose of his travel, if not the sole\npurpose. Houever, Lourie expressed concern about “geting to the jury” on this issue and noted\nthat he had not found a legal case factually on point. Villafafia told OPR that she disagreed with\nLourie’s analysis of the purpose of travel issue and had discussed the mater with him. Villafafia\nalso recalled that there were aspects of the defense submissions she and her colleagues considered\n“particularly weak.”\n\nOn June 26, 2oo7, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, Villafafia, the case agent, and the West Palm\nBeach squad supervisor met at the Miami USAO with Epstein atorneys Dershouitz, Black,\nLefcourt, and Sanchez. Dershouitz led the defense team’s presentation. From the USAO\nperspective, the meeting was merely a “listening session.”°* Echoing the arguments made in\nLefcourt’s leter, Dershouitz argued that the USAO should permit the state to handle the case\nbecause these were “traditionally state offenses.” The case agent recalled being uncomfortable\nthat the defense was asking questions in an atempt to gain information about the federal\ninvestigation, including the number of victims and the types of sexual contact that had been\ninvolved.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when Epstein’s atorneys left the meeting, they appeared to be\n“under the impression that they had convinced us not to proceed.” But Menchel told OPR, “[T]hey\nobviously did not persuade” the USAO because “we . . . didn’t drop the investigation.” According\nto Villafafia, Lourie, and Menchel, during a short post-meeting discussion at which Lourie\nexpressed concern about the purpose of travel issue and Menchel raised issues related to general\ncredibility of the victims, the prevailing sense among the USAO participants was that the defense\npresentation had not been persuasive. Villafafia told OPR that she “left [the meeting] with the\nimpression that we were continuing touards” filing charges.\n\nIV. ACOSTA DECIDES TO OFFER EPSTEIN A TWO-YEAR STATE PLEA TO\n\nRESOLVE THE FEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nUSAO internal communications shou that in July 2oo7, Acosta developed, or adopted, the\nbroad outline of an agreement that could resolve the federal investigation. The agreement would\nleave the case in state court by requiring Epstein to plead guilty to state charges, but would\naccomplish three goals important to the federal prosecutors: Epstein’s incarceration; his\nregistration as a sexual offender; and a mechanism to provide for the victims to recover monetary\n= Villafafia also told OPR that Lourie had, at times, expressed concern about the prosecution’s ability to prove\nEpstein’s knouledge of the victims’ ages, particularly with regard to those who were l6 or l7 at the time they provided\nmassages.\n\n54 In his writen response to OPR, Menchel indicated that he had no independent recollection of the June 26,\n2oo7 meeting. In his OPR interview, Menchel said that although he had litle memory of the meeting, to the best of\nhis recollection the USAO simply listened to the defense presentation, and in a contemporaneous email, Menchel\nopined that he viewed the upcoming June 26 meeting as “more as [the USAO] listening and them presenting their\nposition.”\n35\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3237", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003244.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 68 of 348\nMenchel’s reply email began with a rebuke:\nBoth the tone and substance of your email are totally inappropriate\nand, in combination with other maters in the past, it seriously calls\nyour judgment into question.\nAs you well knou, the US Atorney has not even decided whether\nto go forward with a prosecution in this mater, thus you should have\nrespected his position before engaging in plea negotiations.\nAlong that same line, despite whatever contrary representations you\nmade to the agents in this mater, it was made clear to you by the US\nAtorney and the First Assistant from the time when you were first\nauthorized to investigate Mr. Epstein that the office had concerns\nabout taking this case because of petit [sic] policy and a number of\nlegal issues. Despite being told these things, you prepared a pros\nmemo and indictment that included a definitive date for indictment.\nIt has come to my atention that you led the agents to believe that\nthe indictment of this mater was a foregone <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> and that our\ndecision to put off that date and listen to the defense atorneys’\nconcerns is indicative of the office having second thoughts about\nindicting. As you well knew, you were never given authorization\nby anyone to seek an indictment in this case. °°\nIn the email, Menchel went on to explain the circumstances of his conversation with\nSanchez and respond to Villafafia’s complaints:\nLilly Sanchez called me before, not after, the June 26th meeting. It\nwas an informal discussion and not in the nature of an official plea\noffer but rather a feeling out by both sides as to what it might take\nto resolve the mater. As you are also well aware, the only reason\nwhy this office even agreed to look into the Epstein mater in the\nfirst instance was because of concerns that the State had not done an\nadequate job in vindicating the victims’ rights. As you and the\nagents conceded, had Epstein been convicted of a felony that\nresulted in a jail sentence and sex offender status, neither the FBI\nnor our office ever would have interceded. You should also knou\nthat my discussion with Lilly Sanchez was made with the US\nAtorney’s full knouledge. Had Lilly Sanchez expressed interest in\npursuing this avenue further, I certainly would have raised it with all\nthe interested individuals in this case, including you and the agents.\nIn any event, I fail to see hou a discussion that went nouhere has\nhurt our bargaining position. I am also quite confident that no one\n66 Menchel also sent this message to Sloman and copied Lourie.\n42\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3244", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003246.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 7o of 348\ne-mail that I would like to address, and I also would like to address\nwhere we are in the case.\n\nFirst, I wanted to address the comment about jumping the chain of\ncommand. After that concern was brought to my atention several\nmonths ago, I have tried very hard to be cognizant of the chain of\ncommand. ... If there is a particular instance of violating the chain\nof command that you would like to discuss, I would be happy to\ndiscuss it with you.\n\nThe statement that I have not respected Alex’s position regarding\nthe prosecution of the case demonstrates why you hear the\nfrustration in the tone of my e-mail. For two and a half months I\nhave been asking about what that position is. I have asked for\ndirection on whether to revise the indictment, whether there are\nother issues that Alex wants addressed prior to deciding, whether\nthere is additional investigation that needs to be done, etc. None of\nthat direction has been forthcoming, so I am left with . . . victims,\nand agents all demanding to knou why we aren’t presenting an\nindictment. Perhaps that lack of direction is through no fault of\nyours, but I have been dealing with a black box, so I do not knou to\nwhom I should address my frustration. My recollection of the\noriginal meeting with Alex and Jeff is quite different than your\nsummary. In that meeting, I summarized the case and the State\nAtorney’s Office’s handling of it. I acknouledged that we needed\nto do work to collect the evidence establishing a federal nexus, and\nI noted the time and money that would be required for an\ninvestigation. I said that I was willing to invest that time and the\nFBI was willing to invest the money, but I didn’t want to get to the\nend and then have the Office be intimidated by the high-pouered\nlawyers. I was assured that that would not happen. Nou I feel like\nthere is a glass ceiling that prevents me from moving forward while\nevidence suggests that Epstein is continuing to engage in this\ncriminal behavior. Additionally, the FBI has identified two more\nvictims. If the case is not going to go forward, I think it is unfair to\ngive hope to more girls.\n\nAs far as promising the FBI that an indictment was a foregone\n<span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>, I don’t knou of any case in the Office where an\ninvestigation has been opened with the plan NOT to indict. And I\nhave never presented an indictment package that has resulted in a\ndeclination. I didn’t treat this case any differently. I worked with\nthe agents to gather the evidence, and I prepared an indictment\npackage that I believe establishes probable cause that a series of\ncrimes have been commited.

I have already told Jay that the PSI language . . . was\nunacceptable to our office.” Of even greater significance, in a follou-up email, Villafafia noted\nthat the defense had removed both the requirement that Epstein plead to a registrable offense and\nthe entire provision relating to monetary damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn the afternoon, Villafafia circulated her oun proposed “hybrid” plea agreement, first\ninternally to the management team with a note stating that it “contains the l8/l2 split that Jay and\nAndy agreed to,” and then to Lefkouitz. Regarding the prosecution of other individuals, she\nincluded the follouing provision: “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability of the\ndefendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal\nconduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement,” including\nbut not limited to the conspiracy to solicit minors to engage in prostitution.\n\nIn her email to Lefkouitz, transmiting the plea agreement, Villafafia wrote:\n\nCould you share the atached draft with your colleagues.

One of my suggestions is going to be (again) that we all sit doun\ntogether in the same room, including Barry [Krischer] and/or Lanna\n[Belohlavek], so we can hash out the still existing issues and get a\nsigned document.\n\nVillafafia also emailed Acosta directly, telling him she planned to meet with Epstein’s\natorneys to work on the plea agreement, and asking if Acosta would be available to provide final\napproval. Acosta replied, “I don’t think I should be part of negotiations. I’d rather leave it to you\nif that’s ok.” Acosta told OPR that “absent truly exceptional circumstances,” he believed it was\nimportant for him “to not get involved” in negotiations, and added, “You can meet, like I did in\nSeptember, [to] reaffirm the position of the office, [and] back your AUSA, but ultimately, I think\nyour trial lawyer needs discretion to do their job.” Villafafia told OPR, houever, that she did not\nunderstand Acosta to be giving her discretion to conduct the negotiations as she saw fit; rather, she\nbelieved Acosta did not want to engage in face-to-face negotiations because “he wanted to have\nan appearance of having sort of an arm’s length from the deal.”!!?

Epstein Further Delays His Guilty Plea\n\nThe addendum did not bring the case to <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>. Instead, the mater entered a new,\nprotracted phase, which involved the upper echelons of the Department of Justice. Despite the\nfact that Epstein and his atorneys had signed the NPA, they pursued a new strategy of appealing\nto senior Department managers with the goal of seting aside the NPA entirely. Although\nultimately unsuccessful, the strategy delayed the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea by months.\n\nOn October 29, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Sloman, raising several issues that she wanted\nSloman to address with Lefkouitz. Among other things, Villafafia pointed out that the NPA\nrequired Epstein to use his “best efforts” to comply with the agreement, but he had failed to comply\nwith the timeline established by the NPA when he sought and obtained a plea hearing\npostponement from October 26 to November 2o. Responding to Lefkouitz’s atempts to limit the\nUSAO’s communications with various entities and individuals, Villafafia noted that the USAO\nneeded to be able to communicate with the State Atorney’s Office and the victims’ atorney “to\n[e]nsure that Epstein is abiding by the terms of the agreement.”\n\nThat same day, Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek informed Sloman that the state judge\nassigned to the case had scheduled Epstein’s plea and sentence in early January 2oo8. Belohlavek\nassured Sloman that the “plea and sentence will definitely occur before the January 4th date that\nwas agreed on by all for the sentencing.”'“” Nonetheless, emails over the course of the next month\nshou that the USAO, the State Atorney’s Office, and defense counsel continued to communicate\nregarding the date of the guilty plea, with the USAO asserting that a proposed January 7, 2oo8\ndate for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea was “unacceptable,” while the defense contended that\nEpstein had not agreed to any date. Finally, after multiple communications referring to various\npotential dates, on December 7, 2oo7, Epstein atorney Jack Goldberger issued a Notice of\nHearing, seting the case for January 4, 2oo8.!°°\n\nE. Epstein Seeks Departmental Review of the NPA’s § 2255 Provision Relating to\n\nMonetary Damages for the Victims\n\nWith Epstein’s plea hearing delayed, he launched a new effort to undermine the validity of\nthe NPA, this time within the Department. On November l6, 2oo7, Epstein atorney Kenneth Starr\ncalled the office of Assistant Atorney General for the Criminal Division Alice Fisher and left a\nmessage that he was calling regarding Epstein.'*! At Fisher’s request, Lourie, who in late\nSeptember 2oo7 had begun serving his detail as Fisher’s Principal Deputy and Chief of Staff,\nreturned the call.

Finally, in a leter to Assistant Atorney General Fisher on\nMay l4, 2oo8, Starr thanked her for having spoken with him the previous day, reiterated the\ndefense team’s various complaints, and asked her to meet with him, Lefkouitz, and Whitley.\n\nMeanwhile, Oosterban’s Deputy Chief drafted a decision leter to be sent from Oosterban\nto Lefkouitz, and over the course of several weeks, it was reviewed by and received input from\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker and Assistant Atorney General Fisher, as well as\nthe Criminal Division’s Appellate Section (regarding certain legal issues) and Office of\nEnforcement Operations (regarding the Petite policy). Oosterban told OPR that, notwithstanding\nthe defense submissions on a wide variety of issues and complaints, CEOS’s review was limited\nto determining whether there was a basis for a federal prosecution of Epstein.\n\nOosterban’s leter, sent to Lefkouitz on May l5, 2oo8, notified the defense team that\nCEOS had completed its independent evaluation of whether prosecution of Epstein for federal\ncriminal violations “would contradict criminal enforcement policy interests.” The leter specified\nthat CEOS’s review addressed the “narrou question” of whether a legitimate basis existed for a\nfederal prosecution, and that CEOS did not conduct a de novo review of the facts, analyze issues\nrelating to federal statutes that did not pertain to child exploitation, or review the terms of the NPA\nor the prosecutorial misconduct allegations. The leter stated that based on its examination of the\nmaterial relevant to its limited review of the mater, CEOS had concluded that “federal prosecution\nin this case would not be improper or inappropriate” and that Acosta “could properly use his\ndiscretion to authorize prosecution in this case.”\n\nOn May l9, 2oo8, Lefkouitz reached out to Acosta to request a meeting and specifically\nasked that Acosta “not shunt me off to one of your staff.””’ Lefkouitz made several points in support\nof the request for a meeting: (l) CEOS’s leter acknouledged that federal prosecution of Epstein\nwould involve a “novel application” of relevant federal statutes;'°° (2) CEOS’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that\nfederal prosecution would not be “an abuse of discretion” was “hardly an endorsement” of the\ncase;!®” (3) CEOS did not address Epstein’s prosecutorial misconduct allegations; and (4) “critical\nnew evidence,” in the form of recent defense counsel depositions of victims confirmed “that\nrepresented Epstein victims. The Epstein defense team alleged in the leter that Sloman’s past association with the\natorney caused Sloman to take actions to favor victims’ potential civil lawsuits against Epstein.\n\nl66 Oosterban’s leter stated, “Mr. Acosta can soundly exercise his authority to decide to pursue a prosecution\neven though it might involve a novel application of a federal statute.” This statement referred to a defense argument\nbased on a prior Departmental expression of concern about a Congressional proposal to expand federal law to “adult\nprostitution where no force, fraud or coercion was used.” Oosterban stated that “the Department’s efforts are properly\nfocused on the commercial sexual exploitation of children”—even if wholly local—and “the exploitation of adults\nthrough force, fraud, or coercion.” He then observed that the fact “that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not look\nprecisely like the cases that came before it is not dispositive.”\n\nl67 Oosterban began his leter, houever, by making it clear that CEOS had considered “the narrou question as\nto whether there is a legitimate basis for the U.S. Atorney’s Office to proceed with a federal prosecution of\nMr. Epstein.”\n\nlo7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33o9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003331.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l55 of 348\nwhen prosecutors have used third parties as leverage in plea negotiations. Numerous courts have\nmade clear, houever, that a plea is not invalid when entered under an agreement that includes a\npromise of leniency touards a third party or in response to a prosecutor’s threat to prosecute a third\nparty if a plea is not entered. See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 9o9 F.2d 738, 74l-42 (2d Cir.\nl99o) (rejecting claim that plea was involuntary because of pressure placed upon a defendant by\nthe government’s insistence that a defendant’s wife would not be offered a plea bargain unless he\npled guilty); Martin v. Kemp, 76o F.2d l244, l248 (llth Cir. l985) (in order to satisfy “heavy\nburden” of establishing that the government had not acted “in good faith,” a defendant challenging\nvoluntariness of his plea on grounds that the prosecutor had threatened to bring charges against\nthe defendant’s pregnant wife had to establish that government lacked probable cause to believe\nthe defendant’s wife had commited a crime at the time it threatened to charge her); Stinson v.\nState, 839 So. 2d 9o6, 9o9 (Fla. App. 2oo3) (“In cases involving . . . a promise not to prosecute a\nthird party, the government must act in good faith . . . [and] must have probable cause to charge\nthe third party.”’).\n\nThe second context concerns situations in which courts have enforced prosecutors’\npromises of leniency to third parties. For example, in State v. Frazier, 697 So. 2d 944 (Fla. App.\nl997), as consideration for the defendant’s guilty plea, the prosecutor agreed and announced in\nopen court that the government would dismiss charges against the defendant’s niece and nephew,\nwho had all been charged as a result of the same incident. When the state reneged and atempted\nto prosecute the niece and nephew, the trial court dismissed the charges against them, and the state\nappealed. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that under contract law\nprinciples, the niece and nephew were third-party beneficiaries of the plea agreement and were\ntherefore entitled to enforce it.\n\nApart from voluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a\nprosecutor’s promise not to prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of\nprosecutorial discretion.\n\nD.

OVERVIEW\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald report in November 2ol8, media scrutiny of and public\natention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart\nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s l8-month sentence, which resulted in a l3-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal\nconduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from\nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making\nprocess leading to the signed NPA. As a result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s\nmotivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors\nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the\nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because\nthey were motivated by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships\nwith his atorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\n\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the follouing core questions: (l) who\nwas responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its\nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules\nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by\nimproper factors, such as corruption or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness\ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shous in detail the process that led to the NPA, from\nthe initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.\nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and extensive\ninterviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions\nconceming the NPA’s origins and development. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth\nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\nI. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS\n\nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\n\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knouledge of its terms. He\nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that\nhe either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the\ncase against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled\nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta\ndid not make such a claim to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged\nresolution, two years .. . , registration and restitution, . . . ultimately that was approved on my\nauthority. ... [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, l... accept that. I’m not... pushing away\nresponsibility for it.”\n\nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia were involved in the mater to varying degrees, at\nl33\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3335", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003336.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6o of 348\ndifferent points in time, and regarding different decisions. Menchel, for example, participated in\nformulating the USAO’s initial writen offer to the defense, but he had no involvement with actions\nor decisions made after August 3, 2oo7. Sloman was absent during part of the most intense\nnegotiations in September 2oo7 and did not see the final, signed version of the NPA until he\nreturned. Villafafia and Lourie participated in the negotiations, and Lourie either made decisions\nduring the September l2, 2oo7 meeting with the defense and State Atorney’s Office, or at least\nindicated agreement pending Acosta’s approval. In any event, whatever the level of Sloman’s,\nMenchel’s, Lourie’s, and Villafafia’s involvement, they acted with the knouledge and approval of\nAcosta.\n\nUnder OPR’s analytical framework, an atorney who makes a good faith atempt to\nascertain the obligations and standards imposed on the atorney and to comply with them in a given\nsituation does not commit professional misconduct. Evidence that an atorney made a good faith\natempt to ascertain and comply with the obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not\nlimited to, the fact that the atorney consulted with a supervisor.” In this regard, OPR’s\nframework is similar to a standard provision of the professional conduct rules of most state bars,\nwhich specify that a subordinate lawyer does not engage in misconduct if that lawyer acts in\naccordance with a supervisory lawyer’s reasonable resolution of an arguable question of\nprofessional duty. See, e.g., FRPC 4-5.2(b). Therefore, in addition to the fact that OPR did not\nfind a violation of a clear and unambiguous standard as discussed belou, OPR concludes that\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia did not commit professional misconduct with respect to\nany aspect of the NPA because they acted under Acosta’s direction and with his approval.\n\nWI. OPR FOUND THAT NONE OF THE SUBJECTS VIOLATED A CLEAR AND\nUNAMBIGUOUS STATUTE, PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY RULE OR\nSTANDARD, OR DEPARTMENT REGULATION OR POLICY, IN\nNEGOTIATING, APPROVING, OR ENTERING INTO THE NPA\nA central issue OPR addressed in its investigation relating to the NPA was whether any of\n\nthe subjects, in developing, negotiating, or entering into the NPA, violated any clear and\n\nunambiguous standard established by rule, regulation, or policy. OPR does not find professional\nmisconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous\nstandard. OPR considered three specific areas: (l) standards implicated by the decision to decline\n\na federal court prosecution; (2) standards implicated by the decision to resolve the federal\n\ninvestigation through a non-prosecution agreement; and (3) standards implicated by any of the\n\nNPA’s provisions, including the promise not to prosecute unidentified third parties. As discussed\n\nbelou, OPR concludes that in each area, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his\n\ndecisions were based on corrupt or improper influences, the U.S. Atorney possessed broad\ndiscretionary authority to proceed as he saw fit, authority that he could delegate to subordinates,\nand that Acosta’s exercise of his discretionary authority did not breach any clear and unambiguous\nstandard. As a result, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\n\n2o2 The failure to fully advise a supervisor of relevant and material facts can warrant a finding that the subordinate\n\natorney has not acted in “good faith.” OPR did not find evidence supporting such a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> here, and Acosta did\n\nnot claim that he was unaware of material facts needed to make his decision.\n\nl34\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3336", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003343.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l67 of 348\nto prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.7”\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA. OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3343", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003351.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l75 of 348\nbeen concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on . . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a <span class=\"highlight\">Conclusion</span> That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by corruption, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\nrestitution for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.*”” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n22l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . I was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\neee Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nWwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so well.\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo335l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003352.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l76 of 348\nreconsider the provision. Acosta could certainly have modified or eliminated the provision entirely\nif his motivation was to benefit Epstein or Epstein’s atorneys.\n\nSecond, Epstein himself was not satisfied with the NPA. Immediately after signing the\nagreement, he sought to have the Department nullify it by declaring federal involvement in the\ninvestigation inappropriate. In addition to repeatedly atacking the NPA in his submissions to the\nDepartment, Epstein added to his evidentiary challenges and federalism claims allegations of\nmisconduct and improper bias on the part of specific USAO personnel. Epstein’s dissatisfaction\nwith the NPA, and his personal atacks on individual prosecutors involved in negotiating the\nagreement, appear inconsistent with a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the subjects designed the NPA for Epstein’s\nbenefit.\n\nD. OPR Does Not Find That the Subjects’ Preexisting Relationships with Defense\n\nCounsel, Decisions to Meet with Defense Counsel, and Other Factors\nEstablished That the Subjects Acted from Improper Influences or Provided\nImproper Benefits to Epstein\n\nIn evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered various other factors featured in media\naccounts to shou that the subjects provided improper benefits to Epstein or which purportedly\nsuggested that the subjects acted from improper influences. OPR examined these factors but did\nnot find that they supported a finding that the subjects were influenced by favoritism, bias, or other\nimproper motivation.\n\nl. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects Extended Any\nImproper Benefit to Epstein because of Their Preexisting Relationships\nwith His Atorneys\n\nEpstein’s wealth enabled him to hire multiple atorneys who had preexisting personal\nconnections to some of the government atorneys involved in his case, in the State Atorney’s\nOffice, in the USAO, and elsewhere in the Department. Based on the atorneys Epstein selected\nto represent him, a reasonable inference can be drawn that Epstein believed that hiring atorneys\nwith relationships to the prosecutors would be beneficial to him. One of the first atorneys who\ncontacted the USAO on Epstein’s behalf was Guy Lewis, a former AUSA in and U.S. Atorney\nfor the Southern District of Florida. Villafafia and Lourie had worked for Lewis, and Lourie was\nclose friends with one of Lewis’s law partners. Epstein also retained Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former\nAUSA who had been Menchel’s deputy and with whom he had socialized. Later, when Epstein\nwas seeking Acosta’s personal involvement in the case, Epstein hired Kenneth Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz, prominent atorneys from Kirkland & Ellis with whom Acosta was acquainted from\nhis previous employment with that firm.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she believed Acosta “was influenced by the stature of Epstein’s\natorneys.” Critically, houever, other than the information regarding Menchel that is discussed in\nthe follouing subsection, neither Villafafia nor any of the other individuals OPR interviewed\nidentified any specific evidence suggesting that Acosta, or any of the other subjects, extended an\nimproper favor or benefit to Epstein because of a personal relationship with defense counsel (or\nfor any other improper reason). Villafafia explained hou, in her view, the “legal prouess” of\nEpstein’s atorneys had an impact on the case:\n\nl5o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3352", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003353.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l77 of 348\n\n[O]ne of the issues in the case was the . . . defense’s ability to\ndescribe the case or characterize the case as being legally complex.\nIt was not as legally complex as they made it out to be. But because\nthey were able to convince members of our office that it was\nsomehou extremely novel and legally complex, the issue became\nwho was likely to succeed in arguing these legal issues. And\nbecause of that, the legal prouess, if you will, of the atorneys [ ]\n[became] something to consider.\nI think that the ability of Alan Dershouitz and Ken Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz to convince Alex Acosta that I didn’t knou what I was\ntalking [about] also, all came into play. So I think there were a\nnumber of factors and it all came together.\n\nAlthough Villafafia was critical of Acosta’s consideration of the defense arguments, she\nconceded that the defense team’s tactics demonstrated effective advocacy. Certainly, throughout\nthe case, Epstein’s atorneys prepared lengthy memoranda analyzing the evidence and arguing\nnuanced legal points concerning federalism, the elements of numerous federal criminal statutes,\nand the evidence relevant to those statutes, but it is not unusual or unreasonable for prosecutors to\ncarefully consider well-crafted legal arguments from defense counsel.\n\nThere is litle question that Epstein’s extensive team of atorneys was able to obtain\nnegotiated benefits for Epstein—although the USAO never wavered from its three core\nrequirements, it did agree to a reduction in prison time from its original offer, and it granted Epstein\ncertain other concessions during the negotiations. Epstein’s wealth provided him with skilled,\nexperienced negotiators who continually sought various incremental concessions, and with\natorneys who knew hou to obtain Department review of a USAO mater, thereby delaying\nundesired outcomes for as long as possible.**? Despite Epstein’s evident intentions, houever, OPR\ndid not find evidence warranting a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the NPA or its terms resulted from the subjects’\nrelationships with the atorneys he had selected to represent him.\n\nZs The Subjects Asserted That Their Relationships with Defense Counsel\nDid Not Influence Their Actions\n\nAcosta, Menchel, Sloman, and Lourie each asserted that Epstein’s choice of counsel did\nnot affect his handling of the case. Menchel told OPR that once in private practice, former\ncolleagues often became adversaries. In Menchel’s view, such preexisting relationships were\nuseful because they afforded a defense atorney initial credibility and an insight into the issues a\nprosecutor would likely view as areas of concern, which enabled the defense atorney to “tailor”\narguments in a way that would maximize their persuasive impact on the USAO. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that these advantages did not “move the needle in any major way,” and he\n“reject[ed] the notion” that anyone in the USAO had been “swayed” because of preexisting\n223 As Chief Reiter later observed in his deposition testimony, “[T]he Epstein case was an instance of a many\nmillion dollars defense and what it can accomplish.”\n\nl5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3353", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003356.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8o of 348\n\nMenchel told OPR that when he and Sanchez were in the USAO, they had a social\nrelationship, which included, in 2oo3, “a handful of dates over a period of two to three weeks. We\ndecided that . . . this was probably best not to pursue, and we mutually agreed to not do that.”\nApart from that, he stated they were “close” and “hung out,” and he asserted that this was knoun\nin the office at the time. Menchel said that his relationship with Sanchez “changed dramatically”\nwhen she left the office for private practice, and that by the time he became involved in the Epstein\ninvestigation, he had dated and married his wife, and his contact with Sanchez would “most likely”\nhave been at office events and when she atended his wedding.*?’ Menchel added, “[T]hat was\nthree and a half years [prior] for a very brief period of time, and I don’t think I gave it a moment’s\nthought.”\n\nWhen asked by OPR about the basis for the decision to make an offer of a two-year term\nof incarceration, Menchel said that he did not recall discussions about the two-year offer and did\nnot recall hou the office arrived at that figure. In response to OPR’s question, Menchel stated that\nhis relationship with Sanchez did “[n]ot at all” affect his handling of the Epstein case. Moreover,\nMenchel asserted that the contemporaneous documentary record supports a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that it was\nAcosta, not Menchel, who made the decision to resolve the case with the two-year term.\n\nOPR carefully considered the documentary record on this point, as well as the statements\nto OPR from Menchel, Villafafia, Sloman, and Acosta, and concludes that there is no evidence\nsupporting the suggestion that the plea was instigated by Menchel as a favor to defense counsel.\nThe USAO’s first plea overture to defense counsel, which took place sometime before June 26,\n2oo7, occurred when Menchel spoke with Sanchez about the possibility of resolving the federal\ncase with a state plea that required jail time and sexual offender registration. According to the\nemail, “[iJt was a non-starter” for the defense. In the lengthy email exchange with Villafafia in\nearly July 2oo7, Menchel told her that his discussion with Sanchez about a state-based resolution\nwas made with Acosta’s “full knouledge.” Acosta corroborated this statement, telling OPR that\nalthough he did not remember a specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based\nresolution, he was certain Menchel would not have discussed this potential resolution with defense\ncounsel “without having discussed it with me.” Moreover, the defense did not immediately\n226 Acosta, Sloman, and Lourie each told OPR that in 2oo7, he was not aware that Menchel had previously dated\nSanchez. OPR questioned the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer regarding whether Menchel had an\nobligation to inform his supervisors of his dating relationship. The Professional Responsibility Officer said that it\nwould depend on “hou long the relationship was and hou compromised the individual felt he might appear to be,”\nbut he would have expected Menchel to raise the issue with Acosta. The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR\nthat if he had been approached for advice at the time, he would have asked for more facts, but “[g]iven the sensitivity\nof the [Epstein] mater, [my advice] would probably have been to tell him to step back and let somebody else take it\nover.” Menchel told OPR that if his relationship with Sanchez had turned into something more than a handful of\ndates, he would have advised his supervisors. Although OPR does not conclude Menchel’s prior relationship with\nSanchez influenced the Epstein investigation, OPR assesses that it would have been prudent for Menchel to have\ninformed his supervisors so they could make an independent assessment as to whether his continued involvement in\nthe Epstein investigation might create the appearance of a loss of impartiality.\nal Menchel’s Outlook records also indicate he scheduled lunch with Sanchez on at least one occasion, in early\n2oo6, after she left the USAO.\n\n228 In addition, Villafafia recalled Menchel stating at the July 26, 2oo7 meeting that “Alex has decided to offer\na two year state deal.”\nl54\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3356", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003361.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l85 of 348\n\nThe meeting of USAO representatives and Epstein’s defense atorneys, together with the\nState Atorney and the lead state prosecutor on September l2, 2oo7, was a necessary part of the\nNPA negotiation process.\n\nEven after the NPA was signed, the defense continued to request meetings and reviews of\nthe case, both within the USAO and by the Department’s Criminal Division and the Deputy\nAtorney General. Although limited reviews were granted, during this period there was only one\nsubstantive meeting with Acosta, on December l4, 2oo7.7? This meeting occurred in lieu of the\nmeeting Starr had requested of Assistant Atorney General Fisher, most likely because the defense\nsubmissions to the Department’s Criminal Division had raised issues not previously raised with\nthe USAO and the Department determined that Acosta should address those in the first instance.\nAcosta told OPR that he did not ask for the Department review, but he also did not want to appear\nas if he “fear[ed]” that review. Acosta’s nuanced position, houever, was not clear to the\nDepartment atorneys who responded to Epstein’s appeals and who perceived Acosta to be in favor\nof a Department review, rather than merely tolerant of it. Notably, though, none of those meetings\nor reviews resulted in the USAO abandoning the NPA, and Epstein gained no substantial\nadvantage from his continued entreaties.\n\nIn sum, in evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered the number of meetings, their\npurpose, the content of the discussions, and decisions made afterwards. OPR cannot say that the\nnumber of meetings, particularly those occurring before the NPA was signed, was so far outside\nthe norm—for a high profile case with skilled defense atorneys—that the quantity of meetings\nalone shous that the subjects were motivated by improper favoritism. In evaluating the subjects’\nconduct, OPR considered that the meetings were held with different levels of USAO managers and\nthat the explanations for the decisions to participate in the meetings reflected reasonable strategic\ngoals. Although OPR cannot rule out the possibility that because Acosta, Menchel, Lourie, or\nSloman knew or knew of the defense atorneys, they may have been willing to meet with them, it\nis also true that prosecutors routinely meet with defense atorneys, including those who are knoun\nto them and those who are not. Furthermore, meetings are more likely to occur in high profile\ncases involving defendants with the financial resources to hire skilled defense counsel who request\nmeetings at the highest levels of the USAO and the Department. Most significantly, OPR did not\nfind evidence supporting a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the meetings themselves resulted in any substantial\nbenefit to the defense. At each meeting, defense counsel strongly pressed the USAO—on factual,\nlegal, and policy grounds—to forgo its federal investigation and to return the mater to the state to\nproceed as it saw fit. The USAO never yielded on that point. Accordingly, OPR did not find\nevidence supporting a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia met with\ndefense counsel for the purpose of benefiting Epstein or that the meetings themselves caused\nAcosta or the other subjects to provide improper benefits to Epstein.\n\n282, Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz is discussed separately in the follouing section.\n233 Starr and other defense atorneys only obtained one meeting at the Department level, with Deputy Assistant\nAtorney General Mandelker and CEOS Chief Oosterban in March 2oo8. Although Starr requested a meeting with\nAssistant Atorney General Fisher and another with Deputy Atorney General Filip, those requests were not granted.\nl59\nDOJ-OGR- oooo336l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003377.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ol of 348\nEpstein’s state guilty plea.~° As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in\nthis manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding circumstances, his decision to\ndo so reflected poor judgment. Acosta’s application of Petite policy principles was too expansive,\nhis view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrou, and his understanding of\nthe state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.”>*!\n\nB. The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcerms about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was completed. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.”°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n2oo Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\na In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n252 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstein and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3377", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003381.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o5 of 348\n\nTo be clear, OPR is not suggesting that prosecutors must obtain all available evidence\nbefore reaching plea agreements or that prosecutors cannot reasonably determine that reaching a\nresolution is more beneficial than continuing to litigate evidentiary issues. Every case is different\nand must be judged on its oun facts. In this case, houever, given the unorthodox nature of the\nstate-based resolution, the fact that Acosta’s decision to pursue it set the case on a wholly different\ntrack than what had been originally contemplated by his experienced staff, the nature and scope of\nEpstein’s criminal conduct, the circumstances surrounding the removal of the computers from\nEpstein’s residence, and the potential for obtaining evidence revealing serious additional criminal\nconduct, Acosta had a responsibility to ensure that he was fully informed about the consequences\nof pursing the course of action that he proposed and particularly about the consequences flouing\nfrom the express terms of the NPA. In deciding to resolve the case pre-charge, Acosta lost sight\nof the bigger picture that the investigation was not completed and viable leads remained to be\npursued. The decision to forgo the government’s efforts to obtain the computer evidence and to\npursue significant investigative steps should have been made only after careful consideration of\nall the costs and benefits of the proposed action. OPR did not find evidence that Acosta fully\nconsidered the costs of ending the investigation prematurely.”\n\nC. OPR Was Unable to Determine the Basis for the Two-Year Term of\n\nIncarceration, That It Was Tied to Traditional Sentencing Goals, or That It\nSatisfied the Federal Interest in the Prosecution\n\nThe heart of the controversy surrounding the Epstein case is the apparent undue leniency\nafforded him concerning his sentence. After offering a deal that required a “non-negotiable”\n24-month term of incarceration, Acosta agreed to resolve it for an l8-month term of incarceration,\nknouing that gain time would reduce it further, and indeed, Epstein served only l3 months.\nEpstein ultimately did not serve even that minimal sentence incarcerated on a full-time basis\nbecause the state alloued Epstein into its work release program within the first four months of his\nsentence. As Lourie told OPR, “[E]verything else that happened to [Epstein] is exactly what\nshould have happened to him. . . . He had to pay a lot of money. He had to register as a sex\noffender,” but “in the perfect world, [Epstein] would have served more time in jail.”\n\nDue to the passage of time and the subjects’ inability to recall many details of the relevant\nevents, OPR was unable to develop a clear understanding of hou the original two-year sentence\nrequirement was developed or by whom. Two possibilities were articulated during OPR’s subject\ninterviews: (l) the two years represented the sentence Epstein would have received had he pled\nguilty to an unspecified charge originally contemplated by the state; or (2) the two years\nrepresented the sentence the USAO determined Epstein would be willing to accept, thus avoiding\nthe need for a trial. As to the former possibility, Acosta told OPR that his “best understanding” of\nthe two-year proposal was that it correlated to “one of the original state charges.” He elaborated,\n28s In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney objected to OPR’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that Acosta knew or\nshould have knoun about the litigation regarding the computers and that he should have given greater consideration\nto pursuing the computers before the NPA was signed. Acosta’s atorney asserted that Acosta was not involved in\nthat level of “granularity”; that his “‘small thoughts’ edits” on the NPA were limited and focused on policy; and that\nit was appropriate for him to rely on his staff to raise any issues of concern to him. For the reasons stated above, OPR\nnonetheless concludes that having developed a unique resolution to a federal investigation, Acosta had a greater\nobligation to understand and consider what the USAO was giving up and the appropriateness of doing so.\n\nl79\nDOJ-OGR- oooo338l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003383.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o7 of 348\nindictment. Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal charges were not appropriate and\ndefense counsel’s efforts to minimize the amount of time Epstein would spend in jail, it is\nquestionable whether Epstein would have accepted such a plea offer, but the USAO did not even\nextend the offer to determine what his response to it would be.\n\nWeighed against possible loss at trial were some clear advantages to a negotiated resolution\nthat ensured a conviction, including sexual offender registration and the opportunity to establish a\nmechanism for the victims to recover damages. These advantages, added to Acosta’s concern\nabout intruding on the state’s authority, led him to the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that a two-year state plea would\nbe sufficient to prevent manifest injustice. Menchel told OPR, “I don’t believe anybody at the\ntime that this resolution was entered into was looking at the two years as a fair result in terms of\nthe conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not if we took this case to\ntrial, would we risk losing everything?”\n\nDuring the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept\na plea for an l8-month sentence, a reduction of six months from the original “non-negotiable” two-\nyear term. The subjects did not have a clear memory of why this reduction was made. Villafafia\natributed it to a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, but Acosta atributed it to a decision\nmade during the negotiating process by Villafafia and Lourie, telling OPR that he understood his\natorneys needed flexibility to reach a final deal with Epstein.\n\nOPR found no contemporaneous documents shouing the basis for the two-year term.\nDespite extensive subject interviews and review of thousands of contemporaneous records, OPR\nwas unable to determine who initially proposed the two-year term of incarceration or why that\nterm, as opposed to other possible and lengthier terms, was setled on for the initial offer. The\nterm was not tied to statutory or guidelines sentences for potential federal charges or, as far as\nOPR could determine, possible state charges. Furthermore, while the USAO initially informed the\ndefense that the two-year term was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that position and\nrather than a “floor” for negotiations, it became a “ceiling” that was further reduced during the\nnegotiations. OPR was unable to find any evidence indicating that the term of incarceration was\ntied either to the federal interest in seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, or to other\ntraditional sentencing factors such as deterrence, either of Epstein or other offenders of similar\ncrimes. Instead, as previously noted, it appears that Acosta primarily considered only a\npunishment that was somewhat more than that to which the state had agreed. As a result, the\nUSAO had litle room to maneuver during the negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling to\nenforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term of incarceration\nthat was not much more than what the state had initially sought and which was significantly\ndisproportionate to the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.\n\nIn sum, it is evident that Acosta’s desire to resolve the federal case against Epstein led him\nto arrive at a target term of incarceration that met his oun goal of serving as a “backstop” to the\nstate, but that otherwise was untethered to any articulable, reasonable basis. In assessing the case\nonly through the lens of providing a “backstop” to the state, Acosta failed to consider the need for\na punishment commensurate with the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct and the federal interest in\naddressing it.\n\nl8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3383", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003386.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2lo of 348\nwhich Villafafia and Lourie believed that the state had intentionally failed to aggressively pursue\na broader state indictment.\n\nOne example illustrates this communication gap. In a September 2o, 2oo7 email to Lourie\nasking him to read the latest version of the proposed “hybrid” federal plea agreement (calling for\nEpstein to plead to both state and federal charges), Acosta noted, “I don’t typically sign plea\nagreements. We should only go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement. I\ndidn’t even sign the public corruption or [C]ali cartel agreements, so this should not be the first.”\n(Emphasis added.) In his email to Villafafia, Lourie atached Acosta’s email and instructed\nVillafafia to “change the signature block to your name and send as final to Jay [Lefkouitz].”\n(Emphasis added.) Villafafia raised no objection to signing the agreement. Acosta told OPR that\nhe wanted to give the “trial team” a chance to “speak up and let him knou” if they did not feel\ncomfortable with the agreement. Villafafia, houever, told OPR that she did not understand that\nshe was being given an opportunity to object to the agreement; rather, she believed Acosta wanted\nher to sign it because he was taking an ‘“‘arm’s length” approach and signaling this “was not his\ndeal.” The fact that the top decision maker believed he was giving the line AUSA an opportunity\nto reflect and stop the process if she believed the deal was inappropriate, but the line AUSA\nbelieved she was being ordered to sign the agreement because her boss wanted to distance himself\nfrom the decision, reflects a serious communication gap.\n\nAs another example, at one point, Villafafia, frustrated and concerned about the decisions\nbeing made concerning a possible resolution, requested a meeting with Acosta; in a sternly worded\nrebuke, Menchel rejected the request. Although Menchel told OPR that he was not prohibiting\nVillafafia from speaking to Acosta, Villafafia interpreted Menchel’s email to mean that she could\nnot seek a meeting with Acosta. As a consequence, Acosta made his decision about a state\nresolution and the term of incarceration without any direct input from Villafafia. Acosta told OPR\nthat he was unaware that Villafafia had sought a meeting with him and he would have met with\nher if she had asked him directly. OPR did not find any writen evidence of a meeting involving\nboth Acosta—the final decision maker—and Villafafia—the person most knouledgeable about the\nfacts and the law—before Acosta made his decision to resolve the case through state charges or to\noffer the two-year term, and Villafafia said she did not have any input into the decision. Although\na U.S. Atorney is certainly not required to have such direct input, and it may be that Menchel\npresented what he believed to be Villafafia’s views, OPR found no evidence that Acosta was aware\nof Villafafia’s strong views about, and objections to, the proposed resolution.*°°\n\nTwo logistical problems hindered effective communication. First, the senior managers\ninvolved in the case—Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel—had offices located in Miami, while the\noffices of the individuals most familiar with facts of the case—Villafafia and, to a lesser extent,\nLourie—were located in West Palm Beach. Consequently, Villafafia’s discussions with her senior\n256 In her 2ol7 Declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that, given the challenges of obtaining\nvictims’ cooperation with a federal prosecution, “I believed and still believe that a negotiated resolution of the mater\nwas in the best interests of the [USAO] and the victims as a whole. The [USAO] had also reached that same\n<span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>.” Several subjects pointed to this statement as indicating that Villafafia in fact supported the NPA. In her\nOPR interview, houever, Villafafia drew a distinction between resolving the investigation through negotiations that\nled to what in her view was a reasonable outcome, which she would have supported, and “this negotiated resolution”—\nthat is, the NPA—which she did not support.\n\nl84\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3386", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003391.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l5 of 348\nCHAPTER THREE\nISSUES RELATING TO THE GOVERNMENT?’S INTERACTIONS\nAND COMMUNICATIONS WITH VICTIMS\nPART ONE: FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nl.

History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.”*® Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7°!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.””*” The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n26o President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub.

FBI Victim Notification Pamphlets\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines recommended that “victims be given a printed brochure or card that\nbriefly describes their rights and available services . . . and [contact information for] the victim-\nwitness coordinator or specialist....” At the time of the Epstein investigation, FBI agents\nnationwide routinely folloued a practice of providing victims with pamphlets entitled, “Help for\nVictims of Crime” and “The Department of Justice Victim Notification System.” The “Help for\nVictims of Crime” pamphlet contained a listing of the eight CVRA rights. The pamphlet stated:\n“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime,\nand it will be the responsibility of the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you\nare afforded those rights.” The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided\nvictims with the FBI pamphlet upon the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> of an interview. The pamphlet entitled “The\nDepartment of Justice Victim Notification System” provided an overview of the VNS and\ninstructions on hou to access the system.\n\nV. THE INTRODUCTORY USAO AND FBI LETTERS TO VICTIMS\n\nA. August 2oo6: The FBI Victim Notification Leters\n\nOn August 8, 2oo6, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim\nSpecialist for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim\nNotification Form” naming 3o victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional\npertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.7”° Thereafter, the Victim Specialist\nentered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS\nwhenever the case agent directed the Victim Specialist to generate an initial leter to a particular\nvictim. The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim notification was “always handled by the\n[FBI’s Victim Specialist].”?”*\n\nAccording to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2oo6, the FBI Victim Specialist\nused the VNS to generate FBI leters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the\neight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive\ncurrent status information about the mater. The FBI leters described the case as “currently under\ninvestigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued\npatience while we conduct a thorough investigation.” The leters also stated that some of the\nCVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment: “We will make our best efforts\nto ensure you are accorded the rights described. Most of these rights pertain to events occurring\nafter the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the responsibility\nof the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you are accorded those rights.” A\nsample leter follous.\n\n2o8 These 3o were drawn from the PBPD investigative file and included individuals that the PBPD had not\ndesignated as victims and individuals the PBPD had identified but not interviewed.\n274 The case agent told OPR, “[O]nce we identify a victim, then we bring [the FBI Victim Specialist] in, and as\nfar as anything pertaining to victim rights . .. and any resources, federal resources these victims may need comes from\n[her], the Victim Specialist.”\nl96\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3398", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003402.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 226 of 348\n\n[A]s Chief of the Criminal Division of the USAO, I did not consider\nit to be within my purview to ensure that appropriate victim\nnotifications occurred in every mater investigated or brought by the\nOffice. I also recall that the USAO employed one or more victim-\nwitness coordinators to work with line prosecutors to ensure that\nappropriate victim notifications occurred in every mater\ninvestigated or brought by the Office.\n\nC. USAO and FBI Leters Are Hand Delivered\n\nThe FBI case agent told OPR that the FBI made its notifications “at the time that we met\n[with] the girls.” The case agent recalled that she hand delivered the USAO leters and FBI leters\nto some victims follouing in-person interviews, and in the instances when she did not provide a\nvictim with a leter, she provided an FBI pamphlet containing CVRA rights information similar to\nthat set forth in the FBI leters.78° The co-case agent also recalled that he may have delivered “a\nfew” leters to victims. The FBI Victim Specialist told OPR that she mailed some FBI leters to\nvictims and she provided some FBI leters to the case agent for hand delivery.\n\nNevertheless, the case agent told OPR that she “did not sit there and go through every\nright” with the victims. She stated, houever, “[I]n the beginning whether it was through [the FBI\nVictim Specialist] giving the leter, me giving a leter, the pamphlet, I believed that the girls knew\nthat they were victims and had rights, and they had a resource, [the FBI Victim Specialist], that\nthey could call for that.” The FBI case agent further explained that once the case agents connected\nthe FBI Victim Specialist with each victim, the Victim Specialist handled the victims’ “rights and\nresources.”\n\nVI. AUGUST 2oo6 — SEPTEMBER 2oo7: FBI AND USAO CONTACTS WITH\n\nVICTIMS BEFORE THE NPA IS SIGNED\n\nEarly in the investigation, Villafafia informed her supervisors that, up to that point,\n“everyone whom the agents have spoken with so far has been willing to tell her story. Geting\nthem to tell their stories in front of a jury at trial may be much harder.” Between August 2oo6 and\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the FBI case agents interviewed 22 victims. On\na few occasions, Villafafia met with victims together with the FBI. Villafafia’s May l, 2oo7 draft\nindictment included substantive crimes against multiple victims, and Villafafia described the\ncircumstances of each of their encounters with Epstein in her prosecution memorandum.\n\nThere is some evidence indicating that during interviews, some of the victims expressed to\nthe FBI case agents and Villafafia concerns about participating in a federal trial of Epstein, and\nthose discussions touched upon, in broad terms, the victims’ views regarding the desired outcome\nof the investigation.

Villafafia Asserts That Her Supervisors Gave Instructions Not to\nConsult Victims about the Plea Discussions, but Her Supervisors Do\nNot Currently Recall Such Instructions\nVillafafia told OPR that during an “early” meeting with Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel,\nwhich took place when “we were probably just entering into plea negotiations,” she raised the\ngovernment’s obligation to confer with victims.7** Initially, Villafafia told OPR she was\ninstructed, “Don’t talk to [the victims]. Don’t tell them what’s happening,” but she was not told\nwhy she should not speak to the victims, and she could not recall who gave her this instruction. In\na subsequent OPR interview, Villafafia recalled that when she raised the issue of notification\nduring the meeting, she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential. You can’t disclose them.”?*?\nVillafafia remained uncertain who gave her this instruction, but believed it may have been Acosta.\nNeither Acosta, Sloman, nor Menchel recalled a meeting at which Villafafia was directed\nnot to notify the victims. Acosta told OPR that the decision whether to solicit the victims’ view\n“is something [that] I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I was focused\non at least at this time,” and he did not “recall discussions about victim notification until after the\nNPA was signed.” Sloman also told OPR that he did not recall a meeting at which victim\nnotification was discussed. Menchel wrote in his response to OPR, “I have no recollection of any\ndiscussions or decisions regarding whether the USAO should notify victims of its intention to enter\ninto a pre-charge disposition of the Epstein mater.” Furthermore, Menchel told OPR he could not\nthink of a reason why the issue of victim notification would have arisen before he left the USAO,\nbecause “we were way off from finalizing or having anything even close to a deal,” and it would\nhave been “premature” to consider notification.?”°\n3. September 6, 2oo7: Villafaia Informs Sloman, Who Informs Acosta,\nof Oosterban’s Opinion That Consultation with Victims Was\nRequired\nOn September 6, 2oo7, in a lengthy email to Sloman responding to his question about the\ngovernment’s then-pending offer to the defense, Villafafia raised the victim consultation issue,\nadvising that, “the agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which as\n[CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law” and that “the [PBPD]\n288 Villafafia could not recall the specific date of the meeting, but Menchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7.\n282 Villafafia also recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations could cause\nvictims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.”\n29o In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel reiterated his contention that Villafafia’s claim\nabout a meeting involving Menchel in which she was instructed not to consult with victims was inaccurate and\ninconsistent with other evidence. OPR carefully considered the comments but did not conclude that the evidence to\nwhich Menchel’s atorney pointed necessarily refuted Villafafia’s assertion that she had received an instruction from\na supervisor not to inform victims about the plea negotiations. Houever, it is also true that OPR did not find any\nreference in the emails and other documents dated before the NPA was signed to a meeting at which victim\nconsultation was discussed or to a specific instruction not to consult with the victims. This is one of several events\nabout which Menchel and Villafafia disagreed, but given OPR’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the Department did not require\nprosecutors to consult with victims before charges were brought, OPR does not reach a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> regarding the\nalleged meeting and instruction.\n2o4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003410.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 234 of 348\ninvolved in such notifications. According to Villafafia, Sloman then directed her to have the case\nagents make the victim notifications.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia directed the case agents to “meet with the victims to provide them\nwith information regarding the terms of the [NPA] and the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> of the federal investigation.”\nThe case agent told OPR, “[T]here was a discussion that Marie and I had as\nto... hou we would tell them, and what we would tell them, and what that was I don’t recall, but\nit was the terms of the agreement.” Villafafia believed that if “victims were properly notified of\nthe terms [of the NPA] that applied to them, regarding their right to seek damages from [Epstein],\nand he paid those damages, that the rest of the [NPA] doesn’t need to be disclosed.” Villafafia\n“anticipated that [the case agents] would be able to inform the victims of the date of the state court\nchange of plea [hearing], but that date had not yet been set by state authorities at the time the first\nvictims were notified [by the FBI].” Villafafia told OPR that it was her belief that because the\nUSAO had agreed to a confidentiality clause, the government could not disclose the NPA to the\ngeneral public, but victims could be informed “because by its terms they needed to be told what\nthe agreement was about.” Villafafia told OPR that no one in her supervisory chain expressed a\nconcern that if victims learned of the NPA, they would try to prevent Epstein from entering a plea.\n\nWithin a week after the NPA was signed, news media began reporting that the parties had\nreached a deal to resolve the Epstein case. For example, on October l, 2oo7, the\nNew York Post reported that Epstein “has agreed to plead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes\nat his Florida mansion in a deal that will send him to prison for about l8 months,” and noted that\nEpstein would plead guilty in state court and that “the feds have agreed to drop their probe into\npossible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge.”*°!\n\nThe case agent recalled informing some victims that “there was an agreement reached” and\n“we would not be pursuing this federally.” In October 2oo7, for example, the case agents met with\nvictim Courtney Wild, “to advise her of the main terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement.”\nAccording to the case agent, during that meeting, the case agents told Wild “that an agreement had\nbeen reached, Mr. Epstein was going to plead guilty to two state charges, and there would not be\na federal prosecution.”*° Houever, in a declaration filed in 2ol5 in the CVRA litigation, Wild\ndescribed the conversation differently:\n\n[T]he agents explained that Epstein was also being charged in State\n\ncourt and may plea [sic] to state charges related to some of his other\n\nvictims.

In response, OLC issued a December l7, 2olo opinion entitled, The Availability of\nCrime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4. Based on the CVRA’s\nlanguage, relevant case law, and memoranda opinions from Department components, OLC\nreaffirmed its 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that CVRA rights do not vest until a criminal charge has been filed\n(by complaint, information, or indictment) and the rights cease to be available if “all charges are\ndismissed either voluntarily or on the merits (or if the [g]overnment declines to bring formal\ncharges after the filing of a complaint).”?”\n\nAfter OLC issued its opinion, the Department revised the 2oo5 Guidelines in October 2oll\nbut did not change its fundamental position that the CVRA rights did not vest until after criminal\ncharges were filed. The 2oll revision did, houever, add language concerning victim consultation\nbefore a defendant is charged: “In circumstances where plea negotiations occur before a case has\nbeen brought, Department policy is that this should include reasonable consultation prior to the\nfiling of a charging instrument with the court.”*” The use of the word “should” in the 2oll\nGuidelines indicates that “personnel are expected to take the action . . . unless there is an\nappropriate, articulable reason not to do so.”°°° Nevertheless, the required consultation “may be\ngeneral in nature” and “does not have to be specific to a particular plea offer.”°*! The revisions\nalso specified that AUSAs were to ensure that victims had a right to be reasonably heard at plea\nproceedings.**\n\nOn November 2, 2oll, U.S. Senator Jon Kyl, a co-sponsor of the CVRA, sent a leter to\nAtorney General Eric Holder, arguing that the 2oll Guidelines revisions “conflict[ed] quite\nclearly with the CVRA’s plain language” because the 2oll Guidelines did “not extend any rights\nto victims until charges have been filed.” The Department’s response emphasized that the\n378 OLC “express[ed] no opinion” as to whether it is a mater of “good practice” to inform victims of their CVRA\nrights prior to the filing of a complaint or after the dismissal of charges.\nae See 2oll Guidelines, Art. V, § G.2, available at htps://(www_justice.gov/sites/default/files/olp/docs/\nag guidelines2ol2. pdf. In its 2oll online training video regarding the Guidelines, the Department encouraged such\nconsultation when reasonable, but it also continued to maintain that there was no CVRA right to confer for pre-\nindictment plea negotiations.\n\n38o See 2oll Guidelines, Art. I, J B.2.\n58 See 2oll Guidelines, Art. V, J G.2.\n382 The 2oo5 Guidelines contained no specific provision requiring AUSAs to ensure that victims were able to\nexercise their right to be reasonably heard at plea proceedings, only at sentencing. See 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV,\n4 C.3.b.(2). Houever, the 2oo5 Guidelines generally require AUSAs to use their best efforts to comply with the\nCVRA, and the CVRA specifically affords victims the right to be heard at plea proceedings. The 2oll revision\nremedied this omission.\n\n24l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3443", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003445.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 269 of 348\nleters to victims sent after the NPA was signed were not misleading in stating that the mater was\n“under investigation” because the government continued to investigate given its uncertainty that\nEpstein would plead guilty; and (3) Villafafia contacted the petitioners’ atorney prior to Epstein’s\nstate plea to advise him of the hearing. Nonetheless, Villafafia told OPR that, while there were\nvalid reasons for the government’s position that CVRA rights do not apply pre-charge, “[T]his is\na case where I felt we should have done more than what was legally required. I was obviously\nprepared to spend as much time, energy and effort necessary to meet with each and every [victim].”\n\nOver the course of the litigation, the district court made various rulings interpreting the\nprovisions of the CVRA, including the court’s key <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that victim CVRA rights “atach\nbefore the Government brings formal charges against a defendant.” The court also held that\n(l) “the CVRA authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a\nnon-prosecution agreement, reached in violation of a prosecutor’s conferral obligations under the\nstatute”; (2) the CVRA authorizes the seting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements”;\n(3) the CVRA’s “reasonable right to confer” “extends to the pre-charge state of criminal\ninvestigations and proceedings”; (4) the alleged federal sex crimes commited by Epstein render\nthe Doe petitioners “victims” under the CVRA; and (5) “questions pertaining to [the] equitable\ndefense[s] are properly left for resolution after development of a full evidentiary record.”\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the petitioners’ Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, ruling that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about its\nintention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” The government did not\ndispute the fact that it did not confer with the petitioners prior to signing the NPA, and the court\nconcluded that “[a]t a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform Petitioners\nthat it intended to enter into an agreement not to prosecute Epstein.” The court found that the post-\nNPA leters the government sent to victims describing the investigation as ongoing “misled the\nvictims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[iJt was a material\nomission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an\ninvestigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”>*°\n\nThe court relied on Dean and BP Products to support its holding and noted that the\ngovernment’s action with respect to the NPA was especially troubling because, unlike a plea\nagreement for which the victims could voice objection at a sentencing hearing, “[o]nce an NPA is\nentered into without notice, the mater is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard\nregarding any aspect of the case.” The court also highlighted the inequity of the USAO’s failure\nto communicate with the victims while it simultaneously engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with\nEpstein’s counsel and assured the defense that the NPA would not be “made public or filed with\nthe Court.”\n\nAlthough the USAO defended its actions by citing the 2oo5 Guidelines for the\nDepartment’s position that CVRA rights do not atach until after a defendant is charged, the court\nwas “not persuaded that the [G]uidelines were the basis for the Government’s decision to withhold\ninformation about the NPA from the victims.” The court found that the government’s reliance on\n386 The court did not resolve the factual question as to whether the victims were given adequate notice of\nEpstein’s state court plea hearing.\n\n243\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3445", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003459.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 283 of 348\nand consider victims’ views about, prospective plea negotiations.*”* The “prosecution stage”\nbegan when charges were filed and continued through all post-sentencing legal proceedings.*””\n\nAt the time the parties signed the NPA in September 2oo7, few courts had addressed victim\nstanding under the CVRA. Notably, district courts in New York and South Carolina had ruled that\nstanding atached only upon the filing of federal charges.*°’ Two cases relied upon by the court\nin its February 2ol9 opinion—Dean and its underlying district court opinion, BP Products—were\ndecided after the NPA was signed.\n\nThe CVRA litigation and proposed federal legislation—both pending as of the date of this\nReport—shou that the interpretation of victim standing under the CVRA continues to be a mater\nof debate.**! In a November 2l, 2ol9 leter to Atorney General William Barr, a Congressional\nRepresentative stated that she had recently introduced legislation specifically to “[c]larify that\nvictims of federal crimes have the right to confer with the Government and be informed about key\npre-charging developments in a case, such as . . . non-prosecution agreements.”*° The CVRA\nlitigation arising from the Epstein case shous the lack of clarity regarding when CVRA rights\napply: the district court concluded that CVRA rights applied pre-charge, but a sharply divided\npanel of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals came to a contrary <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>, a decision that has\nnou been vacated while the entire court hears the case en banc.\n\nBecause the Supreme Court had not addressed the issue of when CVRA rights apply, the\nlouer courts had reached divergent conclusions, and the Department had concluded that CVRA\nrights did not apply pre-charge, OPR concludes that the subjects’ failure to consult with victims\nbefore signing the NPA did not constitute professional misconduct because at that time, the CVRA\ndid not clearly and unambiguously require prosecutors to consult with victims before the filing of\nfederal criminal charges.*\n\n398 2oo5 Guidelines, Art.

The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*'* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\nae The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative) and “Under Investigation.”\nals After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n\n264\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3466", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003467.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 29l of 348\nIV. ACOSTA’S DECISION TO DEFER TO THE STATE ATTORNEY’S\n\nDISCRETION WHETHER TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT EPSTEIN’S STATE\n\nCOURT PLEA HEARING DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR OR UNAMBIGUOUS\n\nSTANDARD; HOWEVER, ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY\n\nFAILING TO ENSURE THAT VICTIMS IDENTIFIED IN THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION WERE ADVISED OF THE STATE PLEA HEARING\n\nAs set forth in the factual discussion, within a few weeks of the NPA’s signing, it became\nclear that the defense team disagreed with, and strongly objected to, the government’s plan to\ninform victims of their ability to recover monetary damages from Epstein, under the l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 provision of the NPA, and about Epstein’s state court plea hearing. The USAO initially\ntook the position that it was obligated to, and intended to, inform victims of both the NPA,\nincluding the § 2255 provision, and Epstein’s change of plea hearing and sentencing, so that\nvictims who wanted to atend could do so.\n\nIn November and December 2oo7, Epstein’s atorneys challenged the USAO’s position\nregarding victim notification. Ultimately, Acosta made two distinct decisions concerning victim\nnotifications. Consistent with Acosta’s concerns about intruding into state actions, Acosta elected\nto defer to state authorities the decision whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing\npursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights requirements. Acosta also determined that the USAO\nwould notify victims about their eligibility to obtain monetary damages from Epstein under § 2255,\na decision that was implemented by leters sent to victims after Epstein entered his state pleas.\nThis decision, which postponed notification of the NPA until after Epstein entered his guilty pleas,\nwas based, at least in part, on Villafafia’s and the case agents’ strategic concerns relating to\npreserving the victims’ credibility and is discussed further in Section V, belou.\n\nIn this section, OPR analyzes Acosta’s decision to defer to the state the responsibility for\nnotifying victims of Epstein’s plea hearing and sentencing. OPR concludes that neither the CVRA\nnor the VRRA required the government to notify victims of the state proceeding and therefore\nAcosta did not violate any statutes or Department policy by deferring to the discretion of the State\nAtorney whether to notify victims of Epstein’s state guilty pleas and sentencing. Houever, OPR\nalso concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment because by failing to ensure that the state\nintended to and would notify victims of the federal investigation, he failed to treat victims\nforthrightly and with the sensitivity expected by the Department. Through counsel, Acosta\n“strongly disagree[d]” with OPR’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> and argued that OPR unfairly applied a standard\n“never before expected of any U.S. Atorney.” OPR addresses Acosta’s criticisms in the\ndiscussion belou.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Defer to the State Atorney’s Discretion Whether to\n\nNotify Victims about Epstein’s State Court Plea Hearing Did Not Violate Any\nClear or Unambiguous Standard\n\nIn November 2oo7, Villafafia sought to avoid defense accusations of misconduct\nconcerming her interactions with the victims by preparing a writen notice to victims informing\nthem of the resolution of the federal case and of their eligibility for monetary damages, and inviting\nthem to appear at the state plea hearing. Villafafia and Sloman exchanged edits of the draft leter\nand, at Sloman’s instruction, she provided the draft to defense atorney Lefkouitz, who, in turn,\n\n265\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3467", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003480.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o4 of 348\npreviously noted, there is some contemporaneous evidence supporting her assertion. Villafafia’s\nmention of the agreement, even if not described in specific terms, would have been sufficient to\napprise those victims of the status of the federal investigation.\n\nNevertheless, Villafafia did not recall discussing the NPA specifically or in general terms\nwith other victims interviewed at that time, nor did she do so with Edwards or any other victim’s\natorney. OPR therefore considered whether the omission of information about the existence of\nthe NPA during these interactions rose to the level of professional misconduct in violation of FRPC\n4-4.l or 4-8.4.44!\n\nOPR evaluated Villafafia’s conduct in light of the comment to FRPC 4-4.l:\n\nA lawyer is required to be truthful when dealing with others on a\n\nclient’s behalf, but generally has no affirmative duty to inform an\n\nopposing party of relevant facts. A misrepresentation can occur if\n\nthe lawyer incorporates or affirms a statement of another person that\n\nthe lawyer knous is false. Misrepresentations can also occur by\n\npartially true but misleading statements or omissions that are the\n\nequivalent of affirmative false statements.\nThe victims and their atorneys were certainly not “opposing part[ies]” to the USAO, but the\ncomment indicates that the rule recognizes that omissions made during discussions with third\nparties, even of relevant facts, are not always treated as false statements.\n\nHere, the evidence does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made an affirmative false\nstatement to the victims or Edwards or that her omissions were “the equivalent of affirmative false\nstatements” about material facts. First, Villafafia told OPR that she believed the investigation was\nongoing and her statement to that effect truthful, and as discussed earlier in this Chapter, the\nevidence shous that Villafafia and the agents did continue to investigate the case until Epstein\nentered his guilty plea in state court in June 2oo8. Villafafia’s email correspondence with her\nsupervisors reflects her strong advocacy during that timeframe to declare Epstein in breach and to\ncharge him. The evidence similarly does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made any affirmative\nfalse statement to Edwards when she informed him of the state court plea, although she declined\nto provide additional information in response to his questions.*”\n\nSecond, in reaching its <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>, OPR considered the full context in which Villafafia\ninteracted with the victims and Edwards. Prosecutors routinely make decisions about what\ninformation will be disclosed to witnesses, including victims, for a variety of strategic reasons. In\nmany cases, prosecutors must make difficult decisions about providing information to witnesses,\ni In Florida Bar v.

The 2oo5 Guidelines advise that in consulting with a victim, prosecutors may be limited\nin their disclosures: “Because victims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government,\nand may disclose whatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only nonsensitive data and\npublic information.”*°\n\nVillafafia’s concern about generating potential impeachment evidence by informing\nvictims of their potential to recover monetary damages from Epstein was not unreasonable.\nIndeed, the case agents initially raised the impeachment issue, and after considering the problem,\nVillafafia agreed with the agents’ concerns. Villafafia raised those concerns with the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer in October 2oo7 after the agents brought the issue to her\natention, and she ultimately raised the issue with Sloman and Acosta as well, neither of whom\nadvised her that those concerns were improper or unsound. OPR also considered that although\nVillafafia had sought to notify the victims in writing of the NPA soon after it was signed, her\nsupervisor, the U.S. Atorney, had decided otherwise. When authorized to inform Edwards of the\nscheduled change of plea hearing, she did so. Although she did not inform Edwards that the plea\nwas part of a global resolution that would end the federal investigation, the evidence does not shou\nthat Villafafia acted for the purpose of deceiving Edwards or preventing him from atending the\nhearing. Had she sought to exclude him from the state proceedings, she could have elected not to\ninform Edwards at all, or she could have discouraged him from atending the state proceedings.\nRather, as Edwards confirmed, Villafafia told him the hearing was “important.” Villafafia sought\nto strike a difficult balance of securing Edwards’s (and his clients’) atendance at the state court\nplea, while obeying her management’s directive that informing victims of the resolution of the\nfederal investigation should not be done until completion of the state plea.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering all of the circumstances, OPR concludes that the\nevidence does not establish that Villafafia violated her obligations under FRPC 4-4.l or 4-8.4(c)\nor (d).4* Nonetheless, as discussed belou, Villafafia’s interactions with victims and victims’\natorneys without informing them of the NPA and the potential <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> of the federal\ninvestigation contributed to the likelihood that the victims would feel that the government was\nHe 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV, J B.2.c(l). As noted, some victims continued to express favorable views of Epstein\nduring interviews with the government and they, or their atorneys, could have provided information to Epstein about\nthe government’s communications. For example, within a day of Villafafia contacting a victim’s atorney about a\npotential victim notification leter, Starr complained to Acosta that the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it was clear from the\ngirl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a victim.”\n\n“44 The case most directly on point is Smith, lo9 A.3d ll84, in which the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed\na violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) based on a prosecutor’s failure to notify the victim of the\nresolution of a sex abuse case. Houever, as noted previously, in Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea, and various specific statutes afforded victims the right to receive notices and an\nopportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or information in a circuit court.” In this case,\nfor the reasons previously discussed, Villafafia did not have a clear and unambiguous obligation to inform the victims\nor Edwards of the NPA.\n\n279\nDOJ-OGR-oooo348l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003483.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o7 of 348\nVillafafia informed Edwards about the state plea, but did not mention the NPA or the fact that the\nstate pleas would resolve the federal investigation. Edwards then filed the CVRA petition and\nlearned about the NPA signed months earlier and that the federal investigation of Epstein had\nconcluded with Epstein’s state guilty pleas. Wild only received access to the NPA when a judge\npermited it in August 2oo8 pursuant to a protective order. After considering this series of\ninteractions, it is not surprising that Wild came away from the experience feeling confused and\nbelieving she had been misled.\n\nOPR did not find evidence supporting a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that Villafafia, Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, or Lourie opted not to consult with the victims in order to protect Epstein or shield the\nNPA from public scrutiny. Although neither Sloman nor Acosta could recall a specific discussion\nof CVRA obligations before the NPA was signed, both recalled knouing that victim consultation\nwas not required, and Menchel also told OPR that consultation was not required, at least not up to\nthe point when he left the USAO. The evidence is clear that Villafafia sought at various points to\nconsult with and to notify victims about the details of the NPA but was constrained before the\nNPA was signed by managers who either made a decision to not consult victims or did not address\nthe issue after it was raised, and after the signing by her oun concern about creating possible\nimpeachment evidence that would damage the victims’ credibility at a possible trial.\n\nNonetheless, a more open and straightforward approach with the victims, both before and\nafter the signing of the NPA, would have been the beter practice. Before the NPA was signed,\nvictims could have been asked for their views about the general terms the USAO was\ncontemplating offering, including that a plea to state charges was one of the options being\nconsidered; asked for their views in general about a guilty plea; or, at a minimum, asked to share\ntheir views of hou the case should be resolved. Even if the USAO ultimately determined to\nproceed with the NPA, the government would have had the benefit of the victims’ thoughts and\nconcerns, particularly on the issue of punishment, and victims would have felt included in the\nprocess. OPR found no evidence that the benefits of victim consultation were discussed or\nconsidered before the NPA was signed.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, no one from the government explained the agreement to the\nmajority of the victims until months later and only after the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea.\nAlthough the evidence supports Villafafia’s assertion that she acted from a good faith belief that\nEpstein might breach the NPA and a potential trial would be harmed if information about the NPA\nwas divulged to the victims and their counsel, she, Sloman, and Acosta failed to consider hou the\ndesire to shield the victims from that potential impeachment might impact the victims’ sense of\nthe openness and fairness of the process. As Wild stated during the CVRA litigation, she believed\nshe had been “mistreated in the process.”” When deciding not to inform the victims of the NPA to\navoid creating impeachment evidence, Villafafia, Sloman, and Acosta do not appear to have\ncarefully considered possible alternatives to, or all of the ramifications of, that decision, nor did\nthey revisit the decision before Villafafia met the victims in person to discuss a potential trial or\nspoke to Edwards or other atorneys representing victims.*“° Furthermore, more atention needed\n446 It is not at all clear whether a court would have permited impeachment of the victims concerning one\nprovision in a plea agreement that otherwise could not be used as evidence. See Fed. R. Crim. P. ll(f) (“The\nadmissibility or inadmissibility of a plea, a plea discussion, and any related statement is governed by Federal Rule of\nEvidence 4lo.”).

The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim notification and consultation.

See Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 283 (framing\nissue as whether a law is “the kind of provision that [applies] to events antedating its enactment\nin the absence of clear congressional intent”).* As both Miller and Gentile recognize, Toussie\nsuggests that, in the context of a criminal statute of limitations, Congress should not be presumed\nto have intended retroactive application absent a clear expression of such intent, and the Court\nshould not reach such a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> here.\nI. Section 3283 Does Not Apply at All.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s Motion should be granted for the separate and independent reason that\nregardless of whether the 2oo3 Amendment can be applied retroactively, § 3283 does not apply\nto the offenses with which Ms. Maxwell is charged. Neither enticement of an individual to travel\nnor transportation of a minor is an “offense involving” the sexual or physical abuse or\nkidnapping of a child. The government fails to rebut the long line of cases interpreting “offense\ninvolving” language to refer to offenses that necessarily entail particular conduct, and the\n’ For this reason, the government’s invocation of Falter v. United States, 23 F.2d 42o (2d Cir. l928)—a case\ndecided decades before both Landgraf and Toussie—adds nothing to the analysis. While the government cites\nFalter for the uncontroversial proposition the law treats the revival of time-barred criminal charges more harshly\nthan the extension of live charges—indeed, as the government points out, the former raises issues under the Ex Post\nFacto Clause—it sheds no light on the issue of statutory interpretation here, particularly in light of Landgraf and\nToussie.\n\n* The fact that the inquiry into a statute’s retroactive effects is the second step of Landgraf, rather than the first,\ndemonstrates that Landgraf is not an inquiry into a statute’s constitutionality. If the Landgraf analysis were simply\nan inquiry into whether the Ex Post Facto clause permits Congress to apply a criminal statute of limitations\nretroactively, as the government contends (Opp. 34-35), the first step would have to be read out of Landgraf\nentirely. Otherwise, Congress could expressly prescribe an unconstitutional retroactive application of a statute,\nthereby ending the analysis at step one before the court ever addressed the statute’s constitutionality.\n\nlo\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3667", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003673.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o6- Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l of 22\n<span class=\"highlight\">CONCLUSION</span>\nFor the reasons set forth herein, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that Counts One\nthrough Four be dismissed.\nDated: March l5, 2o2l\nNew York, New York\nRespectfully submited,\n/s/ Christian R.

The\nCourt concludes that the charges are specific enough.\n\ne Maxwell moves to dismiss the perjury counts because, in her view, her testimony\nresponded to ambiguous questioning and was not material. The Court concludes that\nthese issues are best left for the jury.\n\n® Maxwell moves to sever the perjury counts from the Mann Act counts so that they can\nproceed in a separate trial.

The Court concludes that\nthese motions are premature before trial.\n\ne Maxwell moves to compel the Government to immediately disclose certain categories\nof evidence. The Court concludes that she is not entitled to do so, but the Court will\norder Maxwell and the Government to confer on a discovery schedule.\n\n® Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts because a grand jury in White Plains, rather than\nManhatan, returned the Sl superseding indictment. Because a jury in Manhatan\nreturned the S2 superseding indictment, the motion appears moot.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3676", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003678.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page4of34\n\nA. The non-prosecution agreement does not bind the U.S. Atorney for the\n\nSouthern District of New York\n\nUnited States Atorneys speak for the United States. When a U.S. Atorney makes a\npromise as part of a plea bargain, both contract principles and due process require the federal\ngovernment to fulfill it. See Santobello v. New York, 4o4 U.S. 257, 262 (l97l); United States v.\nReady, 82 F.3d 55l, 558 (2d Cir. l996). The question here is not whether the U.S. Atorney for\nthe Southern District of Florida had the pouer to bind the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District\nof New York. The question is whether the terms of the NPA did so. Applying Second Circuit\nprecedent and principles of contract interpretation, the Court concludes that they did not.\n\nIn United States v. Annabi, the Second Circuit held: “A plea agreement binds only the\noffice of the United States Atorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it\naffirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.” 77l F.2d 67o, 672\n(2d Cir. l985) (per curiam). This is something akin to a clear statement rule. Single-district plea\nagreements are the norm. Nationwide, unlimited agreements are the rare exception. Applying\nAnnabi, panels of the Second Circuit have stated that courts cannot infer intent to depart from\nthis ordinary practice from an agreement’s use of phrases like “the government” or “the United\nStates.” United States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88, l2o (2d Cir. l998) (per curiam); United States v.\nGonzalez, 93 F. App’x 268, 27o (2d Cir. 2oo4). Those are common shorthand. A plea\nagreement need not painstakingly spell out “the Office of the United States Atorney for Such-\nand-Such District” in every instance to make clear that it applies only in the district where\nsigned.\n\nMaxwell asks this Court to draw the opposite <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>. The provision of the NPA\ndealing with co-conspirators does not expressly state that it binds U.S. Atorneys in other\ndistricts. It does not expressly state that it applies in other districts. The relevant language, in\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3678", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003684.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo of 34\nfor example, it is possible to transport a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity\nand not follou through with the planned sexual abuse, and so sexual abuse is not an essential\ningredient of the offense. Maxwell makes the same argument for the enticement and related\nconspiracy charges.\n\nThis approach is analogous to the “categorical approach” employed by courts to evaluate\nprior convictions for immigration and sentencing purposes. See Taylor v. United States, 495\nU.S. 575, 6o2 (l99o). Generally speaking, the “categorical approach” requires that courts “look\nonly to the statutory definitions—i.e., the elements” of the relevant offense to determine if the\nprovision applies “and not to the particular facts underlying those convictions.” Descamps v.\nUnited States, 57o U.S. 254, 26l (2ol3) (internal quotation marks omited). Whether a statute\nrequires a categorical or case-specific approach is a question of statutory interpretation. To\ndetermine whether Congress used the word “offense” in a statute to refer to an offense in the\nabstract or to the facts of each individual case, the Court must examine the statute’s “text,\ncontext, and history.” United States v. Davis, l39 S. Ct. 23l9, 2327 (2ol9).\n\nThough it has not authoritatively setled the question, the Second Circuit has strongly\nsuggested that Maxwell’s approach is the wrong one. In Weingarten v. United States, 865 F.3d\n48, 58-6o (2d Cir. 2ol7), the Second Circuit discussed at length hou the text, context, and\nhistory of § 3283 shou that Congress intended courts to apply the statute using a case-specific\napproach. The Third Circuit reached the same <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> in United States v. Schneider, 8ol\nF.3d l86, l96 (3d Cir. 2ol5).\n\nThe Court sees no reason to depart from the reasoning in Weingarten. First, “[t]he\nSupreme Court’s modern categorical approach jurisprudence is confined to the post-conviction\ncontexts of criminal sentencing and immigration deportation cases.” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3684", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003686.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of 34\n865 F.3d at 6o. Maxwell nonetheless contends that using a case-specific approach for § 3283\nwould be impractical because the Government would need to prove conduct beyond the elements\nof the offense. It may be true that this approach requires the Government to prove some\nadditional facts, but any statute-of-limitations defense presents factual issues (including, at least,\nwhen the alleged conduct took place). This is not a serious practical problem and does not\njustify seting aside the statute’s language and apparent purpose.\n\nMaxwell relies primarily on Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 2o9 (l953), to urge this\nCourt to cast Weingarten aside. The Supreme Court in Bridges addressed a statute that extended\nthe limitations period for defrauding the United States during the Second World War. In that\ncase, the Supreme Court first concluded that making false statements at an immigration hearing\nwas not subject to the extended limitations period because it lacked any pecuniary element as\nrequired by the statute. /d. at 22l. Then, as an alternative basis for its holding, it explained that\nthe offense did not require fraud as an “essential ingredient.” /d. at 222. It reached that\n<span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> in large part because the statute’s legislative history made clear that Congress\nintended it to apply only to a narrou class of war frauds causing pecuniary loss. /d. at 2l6.\n\nAs the Second Circuit explained in Weingarten, Congress had the opposite intent in the\nenacting in the PROTECT Act. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 59 & n. lo. “In passing recent statutes\nrelated to child sex abuse, including extensions of the § 3283 limitations period, Congress\n‘evinced a general intention to “‘cast a wide net to ensnare as many offenses against children as\npossible.”’” Jd. at 6o (quoting Schneider, 8ol F.3d at l96 (quoting United States v. Dodge, 597\nF.3d l347, l355 (llth Cir. 2olo) (en banc))). The primary basis for Bridges’ holding—\nlegislative history supporting a narrou interpretation—does not exist here. Instead, both the\nstatute’s plan meaning and its legislative history suggest it should apply more broadly.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3686", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003688.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4 of 34\nSection 3283, as amended by the PROTECT Act, broadly states that “[n]o statute of\n\nlimitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution for an offense involving the sexual or\nphysical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child under the age of l8 years shall preclude such prosecution\nduring the life of the child.” The statute lacks an express retroactivity clause, but courts have\nheld that no such clause is necessary, including for this particular statute. See Leo Sure Chief,\n438 F.3d at 923. The statute’s plain language unambiguously requires that it apply to\nprosecutions for offenses commited before the date of enactment. Instead of simply providing a\nnew limitations period for future conduct, Congress stated that no statute of limitations that\nwould otherwise preclude prosecution of these offenses will apply. That is, it prevents the\napplication of any statute of limitations that would otherwise apply to past conduct.\n\nCourts have reached the same <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> for other statutes employing similar language.\nThe Eighth Circuit has held that the l994 amendments to § 3283, which alloued prosecution of\nsex crimes against children until the victim reached age twenty-five, applied to past conduct. See\nUnited States v. Jeffries, 4o5 F.3d 682, 684-85 (8th Cir. 2oo5). The Second Circuit has observed\nthat the Higher Education Technical Amendments of l99l, Pub. L. No. lo2-26, lo5 Stat. l23,\nillustrates language that requires a statute’s application to past conduct. See Enter. Mortg.\nAcceptance Co., LLC, Sec. Litig., 39l F.3d at 4o7. That statute eliminated the statute of\nlimitations for claims on defaulted student loans by stating that “no limitation shall terminate the\nperiod within which suit may be filed.” Jd. The PROTECT Act’s language is quite similar.\n\nThe history of § 3283 confirms Congress’s intent to apply the extended limitations period\nas broadly as the Constitution allous. With each successive amendment to the statute, Congress\nfurther extended the limitations period, recognizing that sex crimes against children “may be\ndifficult to detect quickly” because children often delay or decline to report sexual abuse.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3688", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003707.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 33 of 34\nGiven the complexities of the case and the addition of two counts via the S2 indictment, the\nCourt encourages the parties to agree to approximately eight weeks.\n\nIX.

It is fundamentally unfair for the government to withhold basic information\nwhile at the same time making representations about that information to the Court when\nconvenient.

The Government Failed to Meet its Burden of Establishing the Two Alleged\n\nConspiracies Are Distinct.\n\nTo guard against the “well recognized danger” that prosecutors can easily “draft\nindictments that allege what appear to be separate conspiracies but may actually be parts of an\noverall conspiracy,” where a defendant “makes a non-frivolous shouing that two indictments in\nfact charge only one conspiracy, the burden shifts to the prosecution to shou, by a\npreponderance of the evidence, that there are in fact two distinct conspiracies.” United States v.\nLopez, 356 F.3d 463, 467 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (citing United States v.

This Court should adhere to Oshatz and, as the court there granted the\nmotion to quash, here it should grant the motion to suppress.\n\nThe government’s final argument is a red herring. Resp. at lo3. Maxwell’s argument is\nnot, and has never been, that a Protective Order cannot be modified. Maxwell agrees that, under\nMartindell, and after notice to the real party in interest and an opportunity to be heard,\nmodification of a Protective Order is appropriate if the government can shou “improvidence in\nthe grant of a Rule 26(c) protective order or some extraordinary circumstance or compelling\nneed.” 594 F.2d at 296.

This Indictment Does Not Satisfy Minimal Notice Requirements\n\nIn Hamling v. United States, 4l8 U.S. 87, ll7-l8 (l974), the United States Supreme\nCourt explained the circumstances in which an indictment simply seting forth the offense in the\nwords of the statute may not suffice:\n\nOur prior cases indicate that an indictment is sufficient if it, first, contains the\n\nelements of the offense charged and fairly informs a defendant of the\n\ncharge against which [s]he must defend, and, second, enables [her] to plead an\nacquital or conviction in bar of future prosecutions for the same offense. It is\ngenerally sufficient that an indictment set forth the offense in the words of the\nstatute itself, as long as those words of themselves fully, directly, and expressly,\nwithout any uncertainty or ambiguity, set forth all the elements necessary to\nconstitute the offence intended to be punished. Undoubtedly the language of the\nstatute may be used in the general description of an offence, but it must be\naccompanied with such a statement of the facts and circumstances as will inform\n\nthe accused of the specific offence, coming under the general description, with\n\nwhich [she] is charged. (cleaned up).\n\nThe government has failed to provide an indictment that “directly,” “expressly,” and “without\nuncertainty or ambiguity” sets forth the allegations against her. The alleged facts are vague and\nillusory and no meaningful discovery has been provided. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell cannot\nadequately defend herself, in violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States\nConstitution.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">CONCLUSION</span>\n\nBecause Counts One through Four of the Indictment lack the basic factual information\nnecessary for Ms. Maxwell to prepare her defense, and the government refuses to provide any\nmeaningful discovery, the Court should either dismiss these counts or direct the government to\nanswer Ms. Maxwell’s requests for particularity.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3838", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003856.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l8 Filed o4/l9/2l Page4of8\nThe Hon.

Nov. 25, 2o2o) (“[C]ourts in this District have generally\ncome to the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the Government can move to quash subpoenas issued for the\nrecords of non-parties only on the basis of the Government’s oun legitimate interests.”).

First,\nthe government speculates, without knouing, that the defense subpoenas implicate the\ngovernment’s “interest in preventing any undue lengthening of the trial, any undue harassment\nof the witness and his family, and any prejudicial over-emphasis on the witness’s credibility.”\nLeter, p. 4. In support of this speculation, the government cites United States v. Ray, supra.\nThe government does not acknouledge, houever, that in Ray the court denied it standing to\nmove to quash the subpoena.\n\nIn turn, other than quoting the cliche, the government has failed to articulate hou the\ndefense subpoenas would implicate this interest.

The government’s\nhyperbole about the alleged confidential nature of the diary is inaccurate, and in any event,\nBoies Schiller is capable or raising confidentiality and requesting a protective order where\napplicable. Of course, to the extent any of the information is legitimately confidential, Ms.\nMaxwell will not object to an appropriate protective order negotiated between the third party\nand Ms. Maxwell and approved by the Court.\nVI. <span class=\"highlight\">Conclusion</span>\n\nThe government could easily address the issues raised in its April 5, 2o2l leter by\nsimply obtaining the relevant exculpatory evidence. But it refuses to fairly investigate this\ncase, and it should not be permited to interfere with the defense function. Accordingly, the\nvarious requests made in its leter motion should be denied.\n\nRespectfully submited,\nJ b Sond\nCC: Counsel of Record\nDOJ-OGR-oooo386o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003866.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 22l Filed o4/2o/2l Page2of5\n\nAfter the parties submited these leters, the Court issued its Opinion & Order denying\nMaxwell’s motions to dismiss the Sl indictment on multiple grounds. Dkt. No. 2o7. The Court\nalso granted severance as to the perjury counts. Both the denial of the motions to dismiss and the\nseverance of the perjury counts are relevant to the requests for a bail hearing and for an\nadjournment of the trial date. The Court addresses both in this Order.\n\nFirst, the request for a renewed bail hearing is denied. The Court held an original bail\nhearing on July l4, 2o2o. After extensive argument and presentation of information, the Court\nfound that no conditions or combination of conditions could reasonably assure the Defendant’s\nappearance as required, determining as a result that Maxwell was a flight risk and that detention\nwithout bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). Dkt. No. 23. The Court based its\n<span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> on the presumption in favor of detention, l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3), and its weighing of\nthe l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors, including the nature and circumstances of the offense charged,\nthe weight of the evidence, and Maxwell’s history and characteristics. Since that time, Maxwell\nhas twice sought reconsideration of the Court’s original bail determination and offered different\nbail packages and proposed conditions of release. The Court carefully considered those requests\nand denied them in writen Orders, concluding that none of the new information had any material\nbearing on the Court’s original <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> and that the Government again met its burden of\nestablishing that Maxwell poses a substantial risk of flight and that no conditions or combination\nof conditions could reasonably assure her appearance as required. Dkt. Nos. lo6, l69.\n\nMaxwell nou seeks a new bail hearing at which “witnesses [would] testify regarding the\npurported strength of the government’s case.” Dkt. No. l92 at 3. The request is denied. The S2\nIndictment raises no issues that warrant reconsideration of the Court’s prior bail determinations.\nOn the contrary, the new charges contained in the S2 indictment as well as the Court’s resolution\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3866", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003867.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 22l Filed o4/2o/2l Page3of5\nof the pre-trial motions strengthen, rather than weaken, the Court’s prior conclusions regarding\nflight risk. Maxwell is entitled to appeal that detention determination, and she is exercising that\nright. But it does not follou that the new charges call for the Court to revisit its three prior bail\ndeterminations. Further, the Court will not hold an evidentiary hearing in which the strength of\nthe Government’s case is tested. “It is well established in this circuit that proffers are\npermissible both in the bail determination and bail revocation contexts.” United States v.\nLaFontaine, 2lo F.3d l25, l3l (2d Cir. 2ooo). Before making its prior bail determinations, the\nCourt scrutinized, among the other relevant factors, the Government’s proffer and concluded that\nthe proffered case was strong. The ultimate merits of the Government’s case will be tested at\ntrial in front of a jury. In the meantime, it is the Court’s obligation to ensure that the case\nproceed to that trial as expeditiously as possible, taking into account the interests of justice and\nall relevant circumstances. The Court is obligated to consider what is in the best interest of the\npublic and the defendant in considering whether delay is appropriate. See l8 U.S.C.\n§3l6l(h)(7)(A). Moreover, the Crime Victims’ Rights Act provides a right “to proceedings free\nfrom unreasonable delay.” l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(7).\n\nThis leads directly to the question of the specific start date of trial and Maxwell’s request\nfor an adjournment. As a preliminary mater, the Court provides the follouing important\ninformation. Although last summer the Court set trial to commence on July l2, 2o2l, currently\nthe precise start date of any trial in the Southern District of New York is not within the control of\nthe presiding judge. SDNY is still operating under special protocols for jury selection during the\nCOVID-l9 pandemic. Because of a limited number of reconfigured courtrooms and spaces large\nenough to hold jury selection and trial safely, the protocols centralize the scheduling of access to\njuries and reconfigured courtrooms pursuant to an established protocol for trial priority.

The government cannot seriously\nmake such an argument.\n\nEven the vague contours of the limitations on Epstein’s immunity, houever, are absent\nfrom the co-conspirator immunity provision. And while the government claims it would be\n“exceedingly strange” to interpret the co-conspirator immunity provision more broadly than\nEpstein’s immunity provision (Opp. l6), as explained in Part II above, such an interpretation is\nentirely consistent with the government’s focus on Epstein vis-a-vis potential co-conspirators. It\nwould be “exceedingly strange,” houever, for a federal prosecutor who intended to limit co-\nconspirator immunity to specific conduct or specific offenses to omit such limitations from the\ntext of an immunity provision in a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nUnable to explain the absence of such limiting language, the government resorts to the\nreductio ad absurdum argument that unless the Court writes into the NPA the language the\ngovernment nou wishes had been included in 2oo7, Ms. Maxwell can claim that “she is immune\nfrom prosecution for any federal crime, during any time period, anywhere, in the United States.”\nOpp. 3 (emphasis in original). Ms. Maxwell makes no such argument, and a faithful\ninterpretation of the NPA leads to no such <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>.

See also\nAvenati, 2o2o WL 86768, at *6 (rejecting the argument that the defendant needed the recordings\nin question prior to trial in order “to demonstrate witnesses’ bias or self-interest.”). The\narguments as to relevance are otherwise specious, and the Court cannot discern what relevance\nthe materials responsive to Requests 6 and 7 may have. In any event, there is litle risk that\nreview of these materials, if they become relevant and admissible, will lead to a delay at trial,\ngiven their limited volume. United States v.

This request is denied. Assuming Maxwell seeks the issuance of a future subpoena\nfor which there is no basis to proceed ex parte, the Government will be provided notice and the\nCourt would likely consider the Government’s briefing regardless of standing as part of its duty\nto ensure that the subpoena meets the requirements of Nixon.

Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.® Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nI. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\ni In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\n8 OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nvil\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43o7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004309.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l2 of 349\n\nof immunity, or (6) the deportation of criminal aliens. The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">Conclusion</span> That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\n\nIx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43o9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004310.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l3 of 349\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004312.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l5 of 349\nthat the victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the\nDepartment.\n\nVI. ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43l2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004313.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l6 of 349\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIl.

I have some ideas about the\nindictment (needs to be ultra lean with only clean victims), so I am\nnot sending that yet.\n\nLourie explained to OPR that by “clean” victims, he meant those for whom the defense did not\n\nhave impeachment evidence to use against them.\n\nA few days later, Lourie emailed Menchel, asking if Menchel had read the prosecution\nmemorandum. Lourie directed Menchel’s atention to particular pages of the prosecution\nmemorandum, noting that the “keys” were whether the USAO could prove that Epstein traveled\nfor the purpose of engaging in sexual acts, and the fact that some minor victims told Epstein they\nwere l8.3’ Lourie asked for Menchel’s “very general opinion as to whether this is a case you think\nthe office should do,” and reminded Menchel that the State Atorney’s Office “went out of their\nway to get a no-bill on this . . . and thus only charged adult solicitation, which they would bargain\naway to nothing.”\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Menchel said that Lourie’s email transmiting the prosecution\nmemorandum was his “official introduction” to the case and at that point in time, he had never\nheard of Epstein and had no information about his background. He recalled that the USAO had\nbeen asked to review the case because the state had not handled it appropriately. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that he had litle memory about the facts of the case or what contemporaneous\nopinions he formed about it.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he could not recall whether he ever read Villafafia’s prosecution\nmemorandum, explaining that he “would typically rely on senior staff,’ who had more\nprosecutorial experience, and that instead of reading the memorandum, he may have discussed the\ncase with Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, who he assumed would have read the document. Acosta\n37 In various submissions to the USAO, the defense contended that the federal statute required proof that\nengaging in a sexual act was the “paramount or dominant purpose” of Epstein’s travel, but that Epstein’s travel was\nmotivated by his desire to live outside of New York for over half of each year for tax purposes. The defense also\nasserted that the federal statutes at issue required proof that the defendant knew the victims were under l8, but that\nEpstein “took affirmative steps to ensure that every woman was at least l8 years of age.” In her prosecution\nmemorandum, houever, Villafafia set forth her <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the statute only required proof that engaging in a sexual\nact was one of the motivating factors for the travel.

Acosta and Menchel believed Villafafia’s\ntimeline was unrealistic from the start. Acosta told OPR that Villafafia was “very hard charging,”\nbut her timeline for filing charges in the case was “really, really fast.” Menchel described Villafafia\nas “out over her skis a litle bit” and “ahead of” Acosta in terms of his analysis of the case.*\nMenchel said it was clear to him that Acosta “was going to be the one making the call” about\nwhether to go forward with charges, and Acosta needed more time to make a decision. Menchel\ntold OPR, “This [was] not a case [we were] going to review in two weeks and make a decision\non.” Sloman told OPR that although he did not conduct a “granular review” of the proposed\ncharges, he believed Menchel and Lourie had done so and “obviously” had concluded that “the\nfacts and the law didn’t suggest that the right thing to do was to automatically indict.” Lourie told\nOPR that he believed “the case was moving ahead.”\n\nVillafafia continued to seek direction from her managers. On May l5, 2oo7, she emailed\nSloman, noting that “[i]t seemed from our discussion yesterday that pestering Alex [Acosta] will\nnot do any good. Am I right about that?” Sloman responded, “Yes.” On May 2l, 2oo7, three\nweeks after submiting the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia emailed Sloman and Menchel\nasking for “a sense of the direction where we are headed-i.e., approval of an indictment something\nlike the current draft, a complaint to allou for pre-indictment negotiations, an indictment\ndrastically different from the current draft?” Sloman responded only, “Taken care of.”*°\n\nD. Defense Counsel Seek a Meeting with Senior USAO Managers, which\n\nVillafatia Opposes\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein’s defense counsel continued to seek additional information about the\nfederal investigation and a meeting with senior USAO managers, including Acosta. In a May lo,\n2oo7 email to Menchel, Lourie reported that Epstein’s atorneys “want me to tell them the statutes\na Villafafia explained to OPR that the “rush” related to her concern that Epstein was continuing to abuse girls:\n“Tn terms of the issue of why the hurry, because child sex offenders don’t stop until they’re behind bars. That was our\ntime concern.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia offering this explanation to him. OPR\nnotes that in their respective statements to OPR and in their comments on OPR’s draft report, Menchel and Villafafia\nexpressed contradictory accounts or interpretations of certain events. When it was necessary for OPR to resolve those\nconflicts in order to reach its findings and conclusions, OPR considered the extensive documentary record and the\ntestimony of other subjects and witnesses, to the extent available.\n\na Sloman similarly recalled that Menchel thought Villafafia was “ahead of where the office was internally” and\nthat caused “discontent” between Villafafia and Menchel. Villafafia was not the only one, houever, who was surprised\nthat the indictment was not approved immediately. The case agent told OPR that it seemed “everything changed”\nafter Villafafia submited the prosecution memorandum, and the momentum touards an indictment abated. Villafafia’s\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that from her perspective, it appeared “Miami didn’t want the case prosecuted.”\nHouever, Menchel rebuked Villafafia in his July 5, 2oo7 email to her for having “led the agents to believe that [filing\ncharges in] this mater was a foregone <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>.”\n\n46 Sloman could not recall during his OPR interview what he meant by this remark, but he speculated that he\nhad spoken to Menchel, and Menchel was going to take care of it.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4354", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004359.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 62 of 349\nLourie opined that the government could argue “that over time [Epstein] set up a network of illegal\nhigh school massage recruits that would be difficult to duplicate anywhere else,” which supported\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the massages must have been a motivating purpose of his travel, if not the sole\npurpose. Houever, Lourie expressed concern about “geting to the jury” on this issue and noted\nthat he had not found a legal case factually on point. Villafafia told OPR that she disagreed with\nLourie’s analysis of the purpose of travel issue and had discussed the mater with him. Villafafia\nalso recalled that there were aspects of the defense submissions she and her colleagues considered\n“particularly weak.”\n\nOn June 26, 2oo7, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, Villafafia, the case agent, and the West Palm\nBeach squad supervisor met at the Miami USAO with Epstein atorneys Dershouitz, Black,\nLefcourt, and Sanchez. Dershouitz led the defense team’s presentation. From the USAO\nperspective, the meeting was merely a “listening session.”°* Echoing the arguments made in\nLefcourt’s leter, Dershouitz argued that the USAO should permit the state to handle the case\nbecause these were “traditionally state offenses.” The case agent recalled being uncomfortable\nthat the defense was asking questions in an atempt to gain information about the federal\ninvestigation, including the number of victims and the types of sexual contact that had been\ninvolved.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when Epstein’s atorneys left the meeting, they appeared to be\n“under the impression that they had convinced us not to proceed.” But Menchel told OPR, “[T]hey\nobviously did not persuade” the USAO because “we . . . didn’t drop the investigation.” According\nto Villafafia, Lourie, and Menchel, during a short post-meeting discussion at which Lourie\nexpressed concern about the purpose of travel issue and Menchel raised issues related to general\ncredibility of the victims, the prevailing sense among the USAO participants was that the defense\npresentation had not been persuasive. Villafafia told OPR that she “left [the meeting] with the\nimpression that we were continuing touards” filing charges.\n\nIV. ACOSTA DECIDES TO OFFER EPSTEIN A TWO-YEAR STATE PLEA TO\n\nRESOLVE THE FEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nUSAO internal communications shou that in July 2oo7, Acosta developed, or adopted, the\nbroad outline of an agreement that could resolve the federal investigation. The agreement would\nleave the case in state court by requiring Epstein to plead guilty to state charges, but would\naccomplish three goals important to the federal prosecutors: Epstein’s incarceration; his\nregistration as a sexual offender; and a mechanism to provide for the victims to recover monetary\n= Villafafia also told OPR that Lourie had, at times, expressed concern about the prosecution’s ability to prove\nEpstein’s knouledge of the victims’ ages, particularly with regard to those who were l6 or l7 at the time they provided\nmassages.\n\n54 In his writen response to OPR, Menchel indicated that he had no independent recollection of the June 26,\n2oo7 meeting. In his OPR interview, Menchel said that although he had litle memory of the meeting, to the best of\nhis recollection the USAO simply listened to the defense presentation, and in a contemporaneous email, Menchel\nopined that he viewed the upcoming June 26 meeting as “more as [the USAO] listening and them presenting their\nposition.”\n35\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4359", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004366.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 69 of 349\nMenchel’s reply email began with a rebuke:\nBoth the tone and substance of your email are totally inappropriate\nand, in combination with other maters in the past, it seriously calls\nyour judgment into question.\nAs you well knou, the US Atorney has not even decided whether\nto go forward with a prosecution in this mater, thus you should have\nrespected his position before engaging in plea negotiations.\nAlong that same line, despite whatever contrary representations you\nmade to the agents in this mater, it was made clear to you by the US\nAtorney and the First Assistant from the time when you were first\nauthorized to investigate Mr. Epstein that the office had concerns\nabout taking this case because of petit [sic] policy and a number of\nlegal issues. Despite being told these things, you prepared a pros\nmemo and indictment that included a definitive date for indictment.\nIt has come to my atention that you led the agents to believe that\nthe indictment of this mater was a foregone <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> and that our\ndecision to put off that date and listen to the defense atorneys’\nconcerns is indicative of the office having second thoughts about\nindicting. As you well knew, you were never given authorization\nby anyone to seek an indictment in this case.°°\nIn the email, Menchel went on to explain the circumstances of his conversation with\nSanchez and respond to Villafafia’s complaints:\nLilly Sanchez called me before, not after, the June 26th meeting. It\nwas an informal discussion and not in the nature of an official plea\noffer but rather a feeling out by both sides as to what it might take\nto resolve the mater. As you are also well aware, the only reason\nwhy this office even agreed to look into the Epstein mater in the\nfirst instance was because of concerns that the State had not done an\nadequate job in vindicating the victims’ rights. As you and the\nagents conceded, had Epstein been convicted of a felony that\nresulted in a jail sentence and sex offender status, neither the FBI\nnor our office ever would have interceded. You should also knou\nthat my discussion with Lilly Sanchez was made with the US\nAtorney’s full knouledge. Had Lilly Sanchez expressed interest in\npursuing this avenue further, I certainly would have raised it with all\nthe interested individuals in this case, including you and the agents.\nIn any event, I fail to see hou a discussion that went nouhere has\nhurt our bargaining position.

For two and a half months I\nhave been asking about what that position is.

My recollection of the\noriginal meeting with Alex and Jeff is quite different than your\nsummary. In that meeting, I summarized the case and the State\nAtorney’s Office’s handling of it. I acknouledged that we needed\nto do work to collect the evidence establishing a federal nexus, and\nI noted the time and money that would be required for an\ninvestigation. I said that I was willing to invest that time and the\nFBI was willing to invest the money, but I didn’t want to get to the\nend and then have the Office be intimidated by the high-pouered\nlawyers. I was assured that that would not happen. Nou I feel like\nthere is a glass ceiling that prevents me from moving forward while\nevidence suggests that Epstein is continuing to engage in this\ncriminal behavior.

Acosta replied, “I don’t think I should be part of negotiations. I’d rather leave it to you\nif that’s ok.” Acosta told OPR that “absent truly exceptional circumstances,” he believed it was\nimportant for him “to not get involved” in negotiations, and added, “You can meet, like I did in\nSeptember, [to] reaffirm the position of the office, [and] back your AUSA, but ultimately, I think\nyour trial lawyer needs discretion to do their job.” Villafafia told OPR, houever, that she did not\nunderstand Acosta to be giving her discretion to conduct the negotiations as she saw fit; rather, she\nbelieved Acosta did not want to engage in face-to-face negotiations because “he wanted to have\nan appearance of having sort of an arm’s length from the deal.”!!?

Epstein Further Delays His Guilty Plea\n\nThe addendum did not bring the case to <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>. Instead, the mater entered a new,\nprotracted phase, which involved the upper echelons of the Department of Justice. Despite the\nfact that Epstein and his atorneys had signed the NPA, they pursued a new strategy of appealing\nto senior Department managers with the goal of seting aside the NPA entirely. Although\nultimately unsuccessful, the strategy delayed the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea by months.\n\nOn October 29, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Sloman, raising several issues that she wanted\nSloman to address with Lefkouitz. Among other things, Villafafia pointed out that the NPA\nrequired Epstein to use his “best efforts” to comply with the agreement, but he had failed to comply\nwith the timeline established by the NPA when he sought and obtained a plea hearing\npostponement from October 26 to November 2o. Responding to Lefkouitz’s atempts to limit the\nUSAO’s communications with various entities and individuals, Villafafia noted that the USAO\nneeded to be able to communicate with the State Atorney’s Office and the victims’ atorney “to\n[e]nsure that Epstein is abiding by the terms of the agreement.”\n\nThat same day, Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek informed Sloman that the state judge\nassigned to the case had scheduled Epstein’s plea and sentence in early January 2oo8. Belohlavek\nassured Sloman that the “plea and sentence will definitely occur before the January 4th date that\nwas agreed on by all for the sentencing.”'“? Nonetheless, emails over the course of the next month\nshou that the USAO, the State Atorney’s Office, and defense counsel continued to communicate\nregarding the date of the guilty plea, with the USAO asserting that a proposed January 7, 2oo8\ndate for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea was “unacceptable,” while the defense contended that\nEpstein had not agreed to any date. Finally, after multiple communications referring to various\npotential dates, on December 7, 2oo7, Epstein atorney Jack Goldberger issued a Notice of\nHearing, seting the case for January 4, 2oo8.!°°\n\nE. Epstein Seeks Departmental Review of the NPA’s § 2255 Provision Relating to\n\nMonetary Damages for the Victims\n\nWith Epstein’s plea hearing delayed, he launched a new effort to undermine the validity of\nthe NPA, this time within the Department. On November l6, 2oo7, Epstein atorney Kenneth Starr\ncalled the office of Assistant Atorney General for the Criminal Division Alice Fisher and left a\nmessage that he was calling regarding Epstein.'*! At Fisher’s request, Lourie, who in late\nSeptember 2oo7 had begun serving his detail as Fisher’s Principal Deputy and Chief of Staff,\nreturned the call.

Finally, in a leter to Assistant Atorney General Fisher on\nMay l4, 2oo8, Starr thanked her for having spoken with him the previous day, reiterated the\ndefense team’s various complaints, and asked her to meet with him, Lefkouitz, and Whitley.\n\nMeanwhile, Oosterban’s Deputy Chief drafted a decision leter to be sent from Oosterban\nto Lefkouitz, and over the course of several weeks, it was reviewed by and received input from\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker and Assistant Atorney General Fisher, as well as\nthe Criminal Division’s Appellate Section (regarding certain legal issues) and Office of\nEnforcement Operations (regarding the Petite policy). Oosterban told OPR that, notwithstanding\nthe defense submissions on a wide variety of issues and complaints, CEOS’s review was limited\nto determining whether there was a basis for a federal prosecution of Epstein.\n\nOosterban’s leter, sent to Lefkouitz on May l5, 2oo8, notified the defense team that\nCEOS had completed its independent evaluation of whether prosecution of Epstein for federal\ncriminal violations “would contradict criminal enforcement policy interests.” The leter specified\nthat CEOS’s review addressed the “narrou question” of whether a legitimate basis existed for a\nfederal prosecution, and that CEOS did not conduct a de novo review of the facts, analyze issues\nrelating to federal statutes that did not pertain to child exploitation, or review the terms of the NPA\nor the prosecutorial misconduct allegations. The leter stated that based on its examination of the\nmaterial relevant to its limited review of the mater, CEOS had concluded that “federal prosecution\nin this case would not be improper or inappropriate” and that Acosta “could properly use his\ndiscretion to authorize prosecution in this case.”\n\nOn May l9, 2oo8, Lefkouitz reached out to Acosta to request a meeting and specifically\nasked that Acosta “not shunt me off to one of your staff.””’ Lefkouitz made several points in support\nof the request for a meeting: (l) CEOS’s leter acknouledged that federal prosecution of Epstein\nwould involve a “novel application” of relevant federal statutes;'°° (2) CEOS’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that\nfederal prosecution would not be “an abuse of discretion” was “hardly an endorsement” of the\ncase;!®’ (3) CEOS did not address Epstein’s prosecutorial misconduct allegations; and (4) “critical\nnew evidence,” in the form of recent defense counsel depositions of victims confirmed “that\nrepresented Epstein victims. The Epstein defense team alleged in the leter that Sloman’s past association with the\natorney caused Sloman to take actions to favor victims’ potential civil lawsuits against Epstein.\n\nl66 Oosterban’s leter stated, “Mr. Acosta can soundly exercise his authority to decide to pursue a prosecution\neven though it might involve a novel application of a federal statute.” This statement referred to a defense argument\nbased on a prior Departmental expression of concern about a Congressional proposal to expand federal law to “adult\nprostitution where no force, fraud or coercion was used.” Oosterban stated that “the Department’s efforts are properly\nfocused on the commercial sexual exploitation of children”—even if wholly local—and “the exploitation of adults\nthrough force, fraud, or coercion.” He then observed that the fact “that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not look\nprecisely like the cases that came before it is not dispositive.”\n\nl67 Oosterban began his leter, houever, by making it clear that CEOS had considered “the narrou question as\nto whether there is a legitimate basis for the U.S. Atorney’s Office to proceed with a federal prosecution of\nMr. Epstein.”\n\nlo7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo443l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004453.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l56 of 349\nwhen prosecutors have used third parties as leverage in plea negotiations. Numerous courts have\nmade clear, houever, that a plea is not invalid when entered under an agreement that includes a\npromise of leniency touards a third party or in response to a prosecutor’s threat to prosecute a third\nparty if a plea is not entered. See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 9o9 F.2d 738, 74l-42 (2d Cir.\nl99o) (rejecting claim that plea was involuntary because of pressure placed upon a defendant by\nthe government’s insistence that a defendant’s wife would not be offered a plea bargain unless he\npled guilty); Martin v.

App. 2oo3) (“In cases involving . . . a promise not to prosecute a\nthird party, the government must act in good faith . . . [and] must have probable cause to charge\nthe third party.”).\n\nThe second context concerns situations in which courts have enforced prosecutors’\npromises of leniency to third parties. For example, in State v. Frazier, 697 So. 2d 944 (Fla. App.\nl997), as consideration for the defendant’s guilty plea, the prosecutor agreed and announced in\nopen court that the government would dismiss charges against the defendant’s niece and nephew,\nwho had all been charged as a result of the same incident. When the state reneged and atempted\nto prosecute the niece and nephew, the trial court dismissed the charges against them, and the state\nappealed. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that under contract law\nprinciples, the niece and nephew were third-party beneficiaries of the plea agreement and were\ntherefore entitled to enforce it.\n\nApart from voluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a\nprosecutor’s promise not to prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of\nprosecutorial discretion.\n\nD.

OVERVIEW\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald report in November 2ol8, media scrutiny of and public\natention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart\nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s l8-month sentence, which resulted in a l3-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal\nconduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from\nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making\nprocess leading to the signed NPA. Asa result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s\nmotivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors\nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the\nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because\nthey were motivated by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships\nwith his atorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\n\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the follouing core questions: (l) who\nwas responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its\nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules\nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by\nimproper factors, such as corruption or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness\ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shous in detail the process that led to the NPA, from\nthe initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.\nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and extensive\ninterviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions\nconceming the NPA’s origins and development. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth\nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\nI. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS\n\nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\n\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knouledge of its terms. He\nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that\nhe either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the\ncase against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled\nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta\ndid not make such a claim to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged\nresolution, two years .. . , registration and restitution, . . . ultimately that was approved on my\nauthority. ... [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, l... accept that. I’m not... pushing away\nresponsibility for it.”\n\nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia were involved in the mater to varying degrees, at\nl33\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4457", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004458.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l6l of 349\ndifferent points in time, and regarding different decisions. Menchel, for example, participated in\nformulating the USAO’s initial writen offer to the defense, but he had no involvement with actions\nor decisions made after August 3, 2oo7. Sloman was absent during part of the most intense\nnegotiations in September 2oo7 and did not see the final, signed version of the NPA until he\nreturned. Villafafia and Lourie participated in the negotiations, and Lourie either made decisions\nduring the September l2, 2oo7 meeting with the defense and State Atorney’s Office, or at least\nindicated agreement pending Acosta’s approval. In any event, whatever the level of Sloman’s,\nMenchel’s, Lourie’s, and Villafafia’s involvement, they acted with the knouledge and approval of\nAcosta.\n\nUnder OPR’s analytical framework, an atorney who makes a good faith atempt to\nascertain the obligations and standards imposed on the atorney and to comply with them in a given\nsituation does not commit professional misconduct. Evidence that an atorney made a good faith\natempt to ascertain and comply with the obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not\nlimited to, the fact that the atorney consulted with a supervisor.*°? In this regard, OPR’s\nframework is similar to a standard provision of the professional conduct rules of most state bars,\nwhich specify that a subordinate lawyer does not engage in misconduct if that lawyer acts in\naccordance with a supervisory lawyer’s reasonable resolution of an arguable question of\nprofessional duty. See, e.g., FRPC 4-5.2(b). Therefore, in addition to the fact that OPR did not\nfind a violation of a clear and unambiguous standard as discussed belou, OPR concludes that\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia did not commit professional misconduct with respect to\nany aspect of the NPA because they acted under Acosta’s direction and with his approval.\n\nWI. OPR FOUND THAT NONE OF THE SUBJECTS VIOLATED A CLEAR AND\nUNAMBIGUOUS STATUTE, PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY RULE OR\nSTANDARD, OR DEPARTMENT REGULATION OR POLICY, IN\nNEGOTIATING, APPROVING, OR ENTERING INTO THE NPA\nA central issue OPR addressed in its investigation relating to the NPA was whether any of\n\nthe subjects, in developing, negotiating, or entering into the NPA, violated any clear and\n\nunambiguous standard established by rule, regulation, or policy. OPR does not find professional\nmisconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous\nstandard. OPR considered three specific areas: (l) standards implicated by the decision to decline\n\na federal court prosecution; (2) standards implicated by the decision to resolve the federal\n\ninvestigation through a non-prosecution agreement; and (3) standards implicated by any of the\n\nNPA’s provisions, including the promise not to prosecute unidentified third parties. As discussed\n\nbelou, OPR concludes that in each area, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his\n\ndecisions were based on corrupt or improper influences, the U.S. Atorney possessed broad\ndiscretionary authority to proceed as he saw fit, authority that he could delegate to subordinates,\nand that Acosta’s exercise of his discretionary authority did not breach any clear and unambiguous\nstandard. As a result, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\n\n2o2 The failure to fully advise a supervisor of relevant and material facts can warrant a finding that the subordinate\n\natorney has not acted in “good faith.” OPR did not find evidence supporting such a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> here, and Acosta did\n\nnot claim that he was unaware of material facts needed to make his decision.\n\nl34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4458", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004465.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l68 of 349\nto prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.”\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA. OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4465", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004473.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l76 of 349\nbeen concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on . . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a <span class=\"highlight\">Conclusion</span> That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by corruption, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\nrestitution for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.*”” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n22l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . I was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\neee Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so well.\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4473", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004474.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l77 of 349\nreconsider the provision. Acosta could certainly have modified or eliminated the provision entirely\nif his motivation was to benefit Epstein or Epstein’s atorneys.\n\nSecond, Epstein himself was not satisfied with the NPA. Immediately after signing the\nagreement, he sought to have the Department nullify it by declaring federal involvement in the\ninvestigation inappropriate. In addition to repeatedly atacking the NPA in his submissions to the\nDepartment, Epstein added to his evidentiary challenges and federalism claims allegations of\nmisconduct and improper bias on the part of specific USAO personnel. Epstein’s dissatisfaction\nwith the NPA, and his personal atacks on individual prosecutors involved in negotiating the\nagreement, appear inconsistent with a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the subjects designed the NPA for Epstein’s\nbenefit.\n\nD. OPR Does Not Find That the Subjects’ Preexisting Relationships with Defense\n\nCounsel, Decisions to Meet with Defense Counsel, and Other Factors\nEstablished That the Subjects Acted from Improper Influences or Provided\nImproper Benefits to Epstein\n\nIn evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered various other factors featured in media\naccounts to shou that the subjects provided improper benefits to Epstein or which purportedly\nsuggested that the subjects acted from improper influences. OPR examined these factors but did\nnot find that they supported a finding that the subjects were influenced by favoritism, bias, or other\nimproper motivation.\n\nl. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects Extended Any\nImproper Benefit to Epstein because of Their Preexisting Relationships\nwith His Atorneys\n\nEpstein’s wealth enabled him to hire multiple atorneys who had preexisting personal\nconnections to some of the government atorneys involved in his case, in the State Atorney’s\nOffice, in the USAO, and elsewhere in the Department. Based on the atorneys Epstein selected\nto represent him, a reasonable inference can be drawn that Epstein believed that hiring atorneys\nwith relationships to the prosecutors would be beneficial to him. One of the first atorneys who\ncontacted the USAO on Epstein’s behalf was Guy Lewis, a former AUSA in and U.S. Atorney\nfor the Southern District of Florida. Villafafia and Lourie had worked for Lewis, and Lourie was\nclose friends with one of Lewis’s law partners. Epstein also retained Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former\nAUSA who had been Menchel’s deputy and with whom he had socialized. Later, when Epstein\nwas seeking Acosta’s personal involvement in the case, Epstein hired Kenneth Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz, prominent atorneys from Kirkland & Ellis with whom Acosta was acquainted from\nhis previous employment with that firm.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she believed Acosta “was influenced by the stature of Epstein’s\natorneys.” Critically, houever, other than the information regarding Menchel that is discussed in\nthe follouing subsection, neither Villafafia nor any of the other individuals OPR interviewed\nidentified any specific evidence suggesting that Acosta, or any of the other subjects, extended an\nimproper favor or benefit to Epstein because of a personal relationship with defense counsel (or\nfor any other improper reason). Villafafia explained hou, in her view, the “legal prouess” of\nEpstein’s atorneys had an impact on the case:\n\nl5o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4474", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004475.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l78 of 349\n\n[O]ne of the issues in the case was the . . . defense’s ability to\ndescribe the case or characterize the case as being legally complex.\nIt was not as legally complex as they made it out to be. But because\nthey were able to convince members of our office that it was\nsomehou extremely novel and legally complex, the issue became\nwho was likely to succeed in arguing these legal issues. And\nbecause of that, the legal prouess, if you will, of the atorneys [ ]\n[became] something to consider.\nI think that the ability of Alan Dershouitz and Ken Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz to convince Alex Acosta that I didn’t knou what I was\ntalking [about] also, all came into play. So I think there were a\nnumber of factors and it all came together.\n\nAlthough Villafafia was critical of Acosta’s consideration of the defense arguments, she\nconceded that the defense team’s tactics demonstrated effective advocacy. Certainly, throughout\nthe case, Epstein’s atorneys prepared lengthy memoranda analyzing the evidence and arguing\nnuanced legal points concerning federalism, the elements of numerous federal criminal statutes,\nand the evidence relevant to those statutes, but it is not unusual or unreasonable for prosecutors to\ncarefully consider well-crafted legal arguments from defense counsel.\n\nThere is litle question that Epstein’s extensive team of atorneys was able to obtain\nnegotiated benefits for Epstein—although the USAO never wavered from its three core\nrequirements, it did agree to a reduction in prison time from its original offer, and it granted Epstein\ncertain other concessions during the negotiations. Epstein’s wealth provided him with skilled,\nexperienced negotiators who continually sought various incremental concessions, and with\natorneys who knew hou to obtain Department review of a USAO mater, thereby delaying\nundesired outcomes for as long as possible.”*? Despite Epstein’s evident intentions, houever, OPR\ndid not find evidence warranting a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the NPA or its terms resulted from the subjects’\nrelationships with the atorneys he had selected to represent him.\n\nZs The Subjects Asserted That Their Relationships with Defense Counsel\nDid Not Influence Their Actions\n\nAcosta, Menchel, Sloman, and Lourie each asserted that Epstein’s choice of counsel did\nnot affect his handling of the case. Menchel told OPR that once in private practice, former\ncolleagues often became adversaries. In Menchel’s view, such preexisting relationships were\nuseful because they afforded a defense atorney initial credibility and an insight into the issues a\nprosecutor would likely view as areas of concern, which enabled the defense atorney to “tailor”\narguments in a way that would maximize their persuasive impact on the USAO. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that these advantages did not “move the needle in any major way,” and he\n“reject[ed] the notion” that anyone in the USAO had been “swayed” because of preexisting\n223 As Chief Reiter later observed in his deposition testimony, “[T]he Epstein case was an instance of a many\nmillion dollars defense and what it can accomplish.”\n\nl5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4475", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004478.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l8l of 349\n\nMenchel told OPR that when he and Sanchez were in the USAO, they had a social\nrelationship, which included, in 2oo3, “a handful of dates over a period of two to three weeks. We\ndecided that . . . this was probably best not to pursue, and we mutually agreed to not do that.””°\nApart from that, he stated they were “close” and “chung out,” and he asserted that this was knoun\nin the office at the time. Menchel said that his relationship with Sanchez “changed dramatically”\nwhen she left the office for private practice, and that by the time he became involved in the Epstein\ninvestigation, he had dated and married his wife, and his contact with Sanchez would “most likely”\nhave been at office events and when she atended his wedding.*?’ Menchel added, “[T]hat was\nthree and a half years [prior] for a very brief period of time, and I don’t think I gave it a moment’s\nthought.”\n\nWhen asked by OPR about the basis for the decision to make an offer of a two-year term\nof incarceration, Menchel said that he did not recall discussions about the two-year offer and did\nnot recall hou the office arrived at that figure. In response to OPR’s question, Menchel stated that\nhis relationship with Sanchez did “[n]ot at all” affect his handling of the Epstein case. Moreover,\nMenchel asserted that the contemporaneous documentary record supports a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that it was\nAcosta, not Menchel, who made the decision to resolve the case with the two-year term.\n\nOPR carefully considered the documentary record on this point, as well as the statements\nto OPR from Menchel, Villafafia, Sloman, and Acosta, and concludes that there is no evidence\nsupporting the suggestion that the plea was instigated by Menchel as a favor to defense counsel.\nThe USAO’s first plea overture to defense counsel, which took place sometime before June 26,\n2oo7, occurred when Menchel spoke with Sanchez about the possibility of resolving the federal\ncase with a state plea that required jail time and sexual offender registration. According to the\nemail, “[iJt was a non-starter” for the defense. In the lengthy email exchange with Villafafia in\nearly July 2oo7, Menchel told her that his discussion with Sanchez about a state-based resolution\nwas made with Acosta’s “full knouledge.” Acosta corroborated this statement, telling OPR that\nalthough he did not remember a specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based\nresolution, he was certain Menchel would not have discussed this potential resolution with defense\ncounsel “without having discussed it with me.” Moreover, the defense did not immediately\n226 Acosta, Sloman, and Lourie each told OPR that in 2oo7, he was not aware that Menchel had previously dated\nSanchez. OPR questioned the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer regarding whether Menchel had an\nobligation to inform his supervisors of his dating relationship. The Professional Responsibility Officer said that it\nwould depend on “hou long the relationship was and hou compromised the individual felt he might appear to be,”\nbut he would have expected Menchel to raise the issue with Acosta. The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR\nthat if he had been approached for advice at the time, he would have asked for more facts, but “[g]iven the sensitivity\nof the [Epstein] mater, [my advice] would probably have been to tell him to step back and let somebody else take it\nover.” Menchel told OPR that if his relationship with Sanchez had turned into something more than a handful of\ndates, he would have advised his supervisors. Although OPR does not conclude Menchel’s prior relationship with\nSanchez influenced the Epstein investigation, OPR assesses that it would have been prudent for Menchel to have\ninformed his supervisors so they could make an independent assessment as to whether his continued involvement in\nthe Epstein investigation might create the appearance of a loss of impartiality.\nal Menchel’s Outlook records also indicate he scheduled lunch with Sanchez on at least one occasion, in early\n2oo6, after she left the USAO.\n\n228 In addition, Villafafia recalled Menchel stating at the July 26, 2oo7 meeting that “Alex has decided to offer\na two year state deal.”\nl54\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4478", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004483.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l86 of 349\n\nThe meeting of USAO representatives and Epstein’s defense atorneys, together with the\nState Atorney and the lead state prosecutor on September l2, 2oo7, was a necessary part of the\nNPA negotiation process.\n\nEven after the NPA was signed, the defense continued to request meetings and reviews of\nthe case, both within the USAO and by the Department’s Criminal Division and the Deputy\nAtorney General. Although limited reviews were granted, during this period there was only one\nsubstantive meeting with Acosta, on December l4, 2oo7.7*? This meeting occurred in lieu of the\nmeeting Starr had requested of Assistant Atorney General Fisher, most likely because the defense\nsubmissions to the Department’s Criminal Division had raised issues not previously raised with\nthe USAO and the Department determined that Acosta should address those in the first instance.”**\nAcosta told OPR that he did not ask for the Department review, but he also did not want to appear\nas if he “fear[ed]” that review. Acosta’s nuanced position, houever, was not clear to the\nDepartment atorneys who responded to Epstein’s appeals and who perceived Acosta to be in favor\nof a Department review, rather than merely tolerant of it. Notably, though, none of those meetings\nor reviews resulted in the USAO abandoning the NPA, and Epstein gained no substantial\nadvantage from his continued entreaties.\n\nIn sum, in evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered the number of meetings, their\npurpose, the content of the discussions, and decisions made afterwards. OPR cannot say that the\nnumber of meetings, particularly those occurring before the NPA was signed, was so far outside\nthe norm—for a high profile case with skilled defense atorneys—that the quantity of meetings\nalone shous that the subjects were motivated by improper favoritism. In evaluating the subjects’\nconduct, OPR considered that the meetings were held with different levels of USAO managers and\nthat the explanations for the decisions to participate in the meetings reflected reasonable strategic\ngoals. Although OPR cannot rule out the possibility that because Acosta, Menchel, Lourie, or\nSloman knew or knew of the defense atorneys, they may have been willing to meet with them, it\nis also true that prosecutors routinely meet with defense atorneys, including those who are knoun\nto them and those who are not. Furthermore, meetings are more likely to occur in high profile\ncases involving defendants with the financial resources to hire skilled defense counsel who request\nmeetings at the highest levels of the USAO and the Department. Most significantly, OPR did not\nfind evidence supporting a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the meetings themselves resulted in any substantial\nbenefit to the defense. At each meeting, defense counsel strongly pressed the USAO—on factual,\nlegal, and policy grounds—to forgo its federal investigation and to return the mater to the state to\nproceed as it saw fit. The USAO never yielded on that point. Accordingly, OPR did not find\nevidence supporting a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia met with\ndefense counsel for the purpose of benefiting Epstein or that the meetings themselves caused\nAcosta or the other subjects to provide improper benefits to Epstein.\n\n282, Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz is discussed separately in the follouing section.\n233 Starr and other defense atorneys only obtained one meeting at the Department level, with Deputy Assistant\nAtorney General Mandelker and CEOS Chief Oosterban in March 2oo8. Although Starr requested a meeting with\nAssistant Atorney General Fisher and another with Deputy Atorney General Filip, those requests were not granted.\nl59\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4483", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004499.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o2 of 349\nEpstein’s state guilty plea.~° As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in\nthis manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding circumstances, his decision to\ndo so reflected poor judgment. Acosta’s application of Petite policy principles was too expansive,\nhis view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrou, and his understanding of\nthe state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.”>*!\n\nB. The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcerms about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was completed. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.”°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n2oo Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\na In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n252 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstein and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4499", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004503.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o6 of 349\n\nTo be clear, OPR is not suggesting that prosecutors must obtain all available evidence\nbefore reaching plea agreements or that prosecutors cannot reasonably determine that reaching a\nresolution is more beneficial than continuing to litigate evidentiary issues. Every case is different\nand must be judged on its oun facts. In this case, houever, given the unorthodox nature of the\nstate-based resolution, the fact that Acosta’s decision to pursue it set the case on a wholly different\ntrack than what had been originally contemplated by his experienced staff, the nature and scope of\nEpstein’s criminal conduct, the circumstances surrounding the removal of the computers from\nEpstein’s residence, and the potential for obtaining evidence revealing serious additional criminal\nconduct, Acosta had a responsibility to ensure that he was fully informed about the consequences\nof pursing the course of action that he proposed and particularly about the consequences flouing\nfrom the express terms of the NPA. In deciding to resolve the case pre-charge, Acosta lost sight\nof the bigger picture that the investigation was not completed and viable leads remained to be\npursued. The decision to forgo the government’s efforts to obtain the computer evidence and to\npursue significant investigative steps should have been made only after careful consideration of\nall the costs and benefits of the proposed action. OPR did not find evidence that Acosta fully\nconsidered the costs of ending the investigation prematurely.”\n\nC. OPR Was Unable to Determine the Basis for the Two-Year Term of\n\nIncarceration, That It Was Tied to Traditional Sentencing Goals, or That It\nSatisfied the Federal Interest in the Prosecution\n\nThe heart of the controversy surrounding the Epstein case is the apparent undue leniency\nafforded him concerning his sentence. After offering a deal that required a “non-negotiable”\n24-month term of incarceration, Acosta agreed to resolve it for an l8-month term of incarceration,\nknouing that gain time would reduce it further, and indeed, Epstein served only l3 months.\nEpstein ultimately did not serve even that minimal sentence incarcerated on a full-time basis\nbecause the state alloued Epstein into its work release program within the first four months of his\nsentence. As Lourie told OPR, “[E]verything else that happened to [Epstein] is exactly what\nshould have happened to him. . . . He had to pay a lot of money. He had to register as a sex\noffender,” but “in the perfect world, [Epstein] would have served more time in jail.”\n\nDue to the passage of time and the subjects’ inability to recall many details of the relevant\nevents, OPR was unable to develop a clear understanding of hou the original two-year sentence\nrequirement was developed or by whom. Two possibilities were articulated during OPR’s subject\ninterviews: (l) the two years represented the sentence Epstein would have received had he pled\nguilty to an unspecified charge originally contemplated by the state; or (2) the two years\nrepresented the sentence the USAO determined Epstein would be willing to accept, thus avoiding\nthe need for a trial. As to the former possibility, Acosta told OPR that his “best understanding” of\nthe two-year proposal was that it correlated to “one of the original state charges.” He elaborated,\n28s In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney objected to OPR’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that Acosta knew or\nshould have knoun about the litigation regarding the computers and that he should have given greater consideration\nto pursuing the computers before the NPA was signed. Acosta’s atorney asserted that Acosta was not involved in\nthat level of “granularity”; that his “‘small thoughts’ edits” on the NPA were limited and focused on policy; and that\nit was appropriate for him to rely on his staff to raise any issues of concern to him. For the reasons stated above, OPR\nnonetheless concludes that having developed a unique resolution to a federal investigation, Acosta had a greater\nobligation to understand and consider what the USAO was giving up and the appropriateness of doing so.\n\nl79\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004505.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o8 of 349\nindictment. Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal charges were not appropriate and\ndefense counsel’s efforts to minimize the amount of time Epstein would spend in jail, it is\nquestionable whether Epstein would have accepted such a plea offer, but the USAO did not even\nextend the offer to determine what his response to it would be.\n\nWeighed against possible loss at trial were some clear advantages to a negotiated resolution\nthat ensured a conviction, including sexual offender registration and the opportunity to establish a\nmechanism for the victims to recover damages. These advantages, added to Acosta’s concern\nabout intruding on the state’s authority, led him to the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that a two-year state plea would\nbe sufficient to prevent manifest injustice. Menchel told OPR, “I don’t believe anybody at the\ntime that this resolution was entered into was looking at the two years as a fair result in terms of\nthe conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not if we took this case to\ntrial, would we risk losing everything?”\n\nDuring the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept\na plea for an l8-month sentence, a reduction of six months from the original “non-negotiable” two-\nyear term. The subjects did not have a clear memory of why this reduction was made. Villafafia\natributed it to a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, but Acosta atributed it to a decision\nmade during the negotiating process by Villafafia and Lourie, telling OPR that he understood his\natorneys needed flexibility to reach a final deal with Epstein.\n\nOPR found no contemporaneous documents shouing the basis for the two-year term.\nDespite extensive subject interviews and review of thousands of contemporaneous records, OPR\nwas unable to determine who initially proposed the two-year term of incarceration or why that\nterm, as opposed to other possible and lengthier terms, was setled on for the initial offer. The\nterm was not tied to statutory or guidelines sentences for potential federal charges or, as far as\nOPR could determine, possible state charges. Furthermore, while the USAO initially informed the\ndefense that the two-year term was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that position and\nrather than a “floor” for negotiations, it became a “ceiling” that was further reduced during the\nnegotiations. OPR was unable to find any evidence indicating that the term of incarceration was\ntied either to the federal interest in seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, or to other\ntraditional sentencing factors such as deterrence, either of Epstein or other offenders of similar\ncrimes. Instead, as previously noted, it appears that Acosta primarily considered only a\npunishment that was somewhat more than that to which the state had agreed. As a result, the\nUSAO had litle room to maneuver during the negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling to\nenforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term of incarceration\nthat was not much more than what the state had initially sought and which was significantly\ndisproportionate to the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.\n\nIn sum, it is evident that Acosta’s desire to resolve the federal case against Epstein led him\nto arrive at a target term of incarceration that met his oun goal of serving as a “backstop” to the\nstate, but that otherwise was untethered to any articulable, reasonable basis. In assessing the case\nonly through the lens of providing a “backstop” to the state, Acosta failed to consider the need for\na punishment commensurate with the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct and the federal interest in\naddressing it.\n\nl8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004508.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2ll of 349\nwhich Villafafia and Lourie believed that the state had intentionally failed to aggressively pursue\na broader state indictment.\n\nOne example illustrates this communication gap. In a September 2o, 2oo7 email to Lourie\nasking him to read the latest version of the proposed “hybrid” federal plea agreement (calling for\nEpstein to plead to both state and federal charges), Acosta noted, “I don’t typically sign plea\nagreements. We should only go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement. I\ndidn’t even sign the public corruption or [C]ali cartel agreements, so this should not be the first.”\n(Emphasis added.) In his email to Villafafia, Lourie atached Acosta’s email and instructed\nVillafafia to “change the signature block to your name and send as final to Jay [Lefkouitz].”\n(Emphasis added.) Villafafia raised no objection to signing the agreement. Acosta told OPR that\nhe wanted to give the “trial team” a chance to “speak up and let him knou” if they did not feel\ncomfortable with the agreement. Villafafia, houever, told OPR that she did not understand that\nshe was being given an opportunity to object to the agreement; rather, she believed Acosta wanted\nher to sign it because he was taking an “‘arm’s length” approach and signaling this “was not his\ndeal.” The fact that the top decision maker believed he was giving the line AUSA an opportunity\nto reflect and stop the process if she believed the deal was inappropriate, but the line AUSA\nbelieved she was being ordered to sign the agreement because her boss wanted to distance himself\nfrom the decision, reflects a serious communication gap.\n\nAs another example, at one point, Villafafia, frustrated and concerned about the decisions\nbeing made concerning a possible resolution, requested a meeting with Acosta; in a sternly worded\nrebuke, Menchel rejected the request. Although Menchel told OPR that he was not prohibiting\nVillafafia from speaking to Acosta, Villafafia interpreted Menchel’s email to mean that she could\nnot seek a meeting with Acosta. As a consequence, Acosta made his decision about a state\nresolution and the term of incarceration without any direct input from Villafafia. Acosta told OPR\nthat he was unaware that Villafafia had sought a meeting with him and he would have met with\nher if she had asked him directly. OPR did not find any writen evidence of a meeting involving\nboth Acosta—the final decision maker—and Villafafia—the person most knouledgeable about the\nfacts and the law—before Acosta made his decision to resolve the case through state charges or to\noffer the two-year term, and Villafafia said she did not have any input into the decision. Although\na U.S. Atorney is certainly not required to have such direct input, and it may be that Menchel\npresented what he believed to be Villafafia’s views, OPR found no evidence that Acosta was aware\nof Villafafia’s strong views about, and objections to, the proposed resolution.*°\n\nTwo logistical problems hindered effective communication. First, the senior managers\ninvolved in the case—Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel—had offices located in Miami, while the\noffices of the individuals most familiar with facts of the case—Villafafia and, to a lesser extent,\nLourie—were located in West Palm Beach. Consequently, Villafafia’s discussions with her senior\n256 In her 2ol7 Declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that, given the challenges of obtaining\nvictims’ cooperation with a federal prosecution, “I believed and still believe that a negotiated resolution of the mater\nwas in the best interests of the [USAO] and the victims as a whole. The [USAO] had also reached that same\n<span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>.” Several subjects pointed to this statement as indicating that Villafafia in fact supported the NPA. In her\nOPR interview, houever, Villafafia drew a distinction between resolving the investigation through negotiations that\nled to what in her view was a reasonable outcome, which she would have supported, and “this negotiated resolution” —\nthat is, the NPA—which she did not support.\n\nl84\nDOJ-OGR- oooo45o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004513.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l6 of 349\nCHAPTER THREE\nISSUES RELATING TO THE GOVERNMENT?’S INTERACTIONS\nAND COMMUNICATIONS WITH VICTIMS\nPART ONE: FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nl.

This chapter sets forth the pertinent legal\nauthorities and Department policies and practices regarding victim notification and consultation,\nas well as OPR’s analysis and conclusions. OPR discusses key events relating to the USAO’s and\nthe FBI’s interactions with victims before and after the signing of the NPA, beginning with the\nFBI’s initial contact with victims through leters informing them that the FBI had initiated an\ninvestigation. A timeline of key events is provided on the follouing page.\n\nIl. THE CVRA, l8 U.S.C. § 377l\n\nA. History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.””©° Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7°!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.”**? The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n26o President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub.

FBI Victim Notification Pamphlets\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines recommended that “victims be given a printed brochure or card that\nbriefly describes their rights and available services . . . and [contact information for] the victim-\nwitness coordinator or specialist....” At the time of the Epstein investigation, FBI agents\nnationwide routinely folloued a practice of providing victims with pamphlets entitled, “Help for\nVictims of Crime” and “The Department of Justice Victim Notification System.” The “Help for\nVictims of Crime” pamphlet contained a listing of the eight CVRA rights. The pamphlet stated:\n“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime,\nand it will be the responsibility of the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you\nare afforded those rights.” The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided\nvictims with the FBI pamphlet upon the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> of an interview. The pamphlet entitled “The\nDepartment of Justice Victim Notification System” provided an overview of the VNS and\ninstructions on hou to access the system.\nV. THE INTRODUCTORY USAO AND FBI LETTERS TO VICTIMS\n\nA. August 2oo6: The FBI Victim Notification Leters\n\nOn August 8, 2oo6, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim\nSpecialist for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim\nNotification Form” naming 3o victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional\npertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.7”° Thereafter, the Victim Specialist\nentered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS\nwhenever the case agent directed the Victim Specialist to generate an initial leter to a particular\nvictim. The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim notification was “always handled by the\n[FBI’s Victim Specialist].”?”*4\n\nAccording to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2oo6, the FBI Victim Specialist\nused the VNS to generate FBI leters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the\neight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive\ncurrent status information about the mater. The FBI leters described the case as “currently under\ninvestigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued\npatience while we conduct a thorough investigation.” The leters also stated that some of the\nCVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment: “We will make our best efforts\nto ensure you are accorded the rights described. Most of these rights pertain to events occurring\nafter the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the responsibility\nof the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you are accorded those rights.” A\nsample leter follous.\n2o8 These 3o were drawn from the PBPD investigative file and included individuals that the PBPD had not\ndesignated as victims and individuals the PBPD had identified but not interviewed.\n274 The case agent told OPR, “[O]nce we identify a victim, then we bring [the FBI Victim Specialist] in, and as\nfar as anything pertaining to victim rights . . . and any resources, federal resources these victims may need comes from\n[her], the Victim Specialist.”\n\nl96\nDOJ-OGR-oooo452o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004524.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 227 of 349\n\n[A]s Chief of the Criminal Division of the USAO, I did not consider\nit to be within my purview to ensure that appropriate victim\nnotifications occurred in every mater investigated or brought by the\nOffice. I also recall that the USAO employed one or more victim-\nwitness coordinators to work with line prosecutors to ensure that\nappropriate victim notifications occurred in every mater\ninvestigated or brought by the Office.\n\nC. USAO and FBI Leters Are Hand Delivered\n\nThe FBI case agent told OPR that the FBI made its notifications “at the time that we met\n[with] the girls.” The case agent recalled that she hand delivered the USAO leters and FBI leters\nto some victims follouing in-person interviews, and in the instances when she did not provide a\nvictim with a leter, she provided an FBI pamphlet containing CVRA rights information similar to\nthat set forth in the FBI leters.78° The co-case agent also recalled that he may have delivered “a\nfew” leters to victims. The FBI Victim Specialist told OPR that she mailed some FBI leters to\nvictims and she provided some FBI leters to the case agent for hand delivery.\n\nNevertheless, the case agent told OPR that she “did not sit there and go through every\nright” with the victims. She stated, houever, “[I]n the beginning whether it was through [the FBI\nVictim Specialist] giving the leter, me giving a leter, the pamphlet, I believed that the girls knew\nthat they were victims and had rights, and they had a resource, [the FBI Victim Specialist], that\nthey could call for that.” The FBI case agent further explained that once the case agents connected\nthe FBI Victim Specialist with each victim, the Victim Specialist handled the victims’ “rights and\nresources.”\n\nVI. AUGUST 2oo6 — SEPTEMBER 2oo7: FBI AND USAO CONTACTS WITH\n\nVICTIMS BEFORE THE NPA IS SIGNED\n\nEarly in the investigation, Villafafia informed her supervisors that, up to that point,\n“everyone whom the agents have spoken with so far has been willing to tell her story. Geting\nthem to tell their stories in front of a jury at trial may be much harder.” Between August 2oo6 and\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the FBI case agents interviewed 22 victims. On\na few occasions, Villafafia met with victims together with the FBI. Villafafia’s May l, 2oo7 draft\nindictment included substantive crimes against multiple victims, and Villafafia described the\ncircumstances of each of their encounters with Epstein in her prosecution memorandum.\n\nThere is some evidence indicating that during interviews, some of the victims expressed to\nthe FBI case agents and Villafafia concerns about participating in a federal trial of Epstein, and\nthose discussions touched upon, in broad terms, the victims’ views regarding the desired outcome\nof the investigation. Before the USAO entered into the NPA, houever, no one from the\n28o The case agent told OPR, “I remember giving leters to the girls when we would talk to them at . . . the\n<span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>, or. . . if I didn’t have the file on me[,] I had pamphlets in my car, or I made sure [the victims had contact\ninformation for the FBI’s Victim Specialist].”\n\n2oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4524", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004528.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 23l of 349\n2. Villafafia Asserts That Her Supervisors Gave Instructions Not to\nConsult Victims about the Plea Discussions, but Her Supervisors Do\nNot Currently Recall Such Instructions\nVillafafia told OPR that during an “early” meeting with Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel,\nwhich took place when “we were probably just entering into plea negotiations,” she raised the\ngovernment’s obligation to confer with victims.7** Initially, Villafafia told OPR she was\ninstructed, “Don’t talk to [the victims]. Don’t tell them what’s happening,” but she was not told\nwhy she should not speak to the victims, and she could not recall who gave her this instruction. In\na subsequent OPR interview, Villafafia recalled that when she raised the issue of notification\nduring the meeting, she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential. You can’t disclose them.””*\nVillafafia remained uncertain who gave her this instruction, but believed it may have been Acosta.\nNeither Acosta, Sloman, nor Menchel recalled a meeting at which Villafafia was directed\nnot to notify the victims. Acosta told OPR that the decision whether to solicit the victims’ view\n“is something [that] I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I was focused\non at least at this time,” and he did not “recall discussions about victim notification until after the\nNPA was signed.” Sloman also told OPR that he did not recall a meeting at which victim\nnotification was discussed. Menchel wrote in his response to OPR, “I have no recollection of any\ndiscussions or decisions regarding whether the USAO should notify victims of its intention to enter\ninto a pre-charge disposition of the Epstein mater.” Furthermore, Menchel told OPR he could not\nthink of a reason why the issue of victim notification would have arisen before he left the USAO,\nbecause “we were way off from finalizing or having anything even close to a deal,” and it would\nhave been “premature” to consider notification.?”°\n3. September 6, 2oo7: Villafaia Informs Sloman, Who Informs Acosta,\nof Oosterban’s Opinion That Consultation with Victims Was\nRequired\nOn September 6, 2oo7, in a lengthy email to Sloman responding to his question about the\ngovernment’s then-pending offer to the defense, Villafafia raised the victim consultation issue,\nadvising that, “the agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which as\n[CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law” and that “the [PBPD]\n288 Villafafia could not recall the specific date of the meeting, but Menchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7.\n282 Villafafia also recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations could cause\nvictims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.”\n29o In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel reiterated his contention that Villafafia’s claim\nabout a meeting involving Menchel in which she was instructed not to consult with victims was inaccurate and\ninconsistent with other evidence. OPR carefully considered the comments but did not conclude that the evidence to\nwhich Menchel’s atorney pointed necessarily refuted Villafafia’s assertion that she had received an instruction from\na supervisor not to inform victims about the plea negotiations. Houever, it is also true that OPR did not find any\nreference in the emails and other documents dated before the NPA was signed to a meeting at which victim\nconsultation was discussed or to a specific instruction not to consult with the victims. This is one of several events\nabout which Menchel and Villafafia disagreed, but given OPR’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the Department did not require\nprosecutors to consult with victims before charges were brought, OPR does not reach a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> regarding the\nalleged meeting and instruction.\n2o4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4528", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004532.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 235 of 349\ninvolved in such notifications. According to Villafafia, Sloman then directed her to have the case\nagents make the victim notifications.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia directed the case agents to “meet with the victims to provide them\nwith information regarding the terms of the [NPA] and the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> of the federal investigation.”\nThe case agent told OPR, “[T]here was a discussion that Marie and I had as\nto... hou we would tell them, and what we would tell them, and what that was I don’t recall, but\nit was the terms of the agreement.” Villafafia believed that if “victims were properly notified of\nthe terms [of the NPA] that applied to them, regarding their right to seek damages from [Epstein],\nand he paid those damages, that the rest of the [NPA] doesn’t need to be disclosed.” Villafafia\n“anticipated that [the case agents] would be able to inform the victims of the date of the state court\nchange of plea [hearing], but that date had not yet been set by state authorities at the time the first\nvictims were notified [by the FBI].” Villafafia told OPR that it was her belief that because the\nUSAO had agreed to a confidentiality clause, the government could not disclose the NPA to the\ngeneral public, but victims could be informed “because by its terms they needed to be told what\nthe agreement was about.” Villafafia told OPR that no one in her supervisory chain expressed a\nconcern that if victims learned of the NPA, they would try to prevent Epstein from entering a plea.\n\nWithin a week after the NPA was signed, news media began reporting that the parties had\nreached a deal to resolve the Epstein case. For example, on October l, 2oo7, the\nNew York Post reported that Epstein “has agreed to plead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes\nat his Florida mansion in a deal that will send him to prison for about l8 months,” and noted that\nEpstein would plead guilty in state court and that “the feds have agreed to drop their probe into\npossible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge.”*\"!\n\nThe case agent recalled informing some victims that “there was an agreement reached” and\n“we would not be pursuing this federally.” In October 2oo7, for example, the case agents met with\nvictim Courtney Wild, “to advise her of the main terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement.”\nAccording to the case agent, during that meeting, the case agents told Wild “that an agreement had\nbeen reached, Mr. Epstein was going to plead guilty to two state charges, and there would not be\na federal prosecution.”*°? Houever, in a declaration filed in 2ol5 in the CVRA litigation, Wild\ndescribed the conversation differently:\n\n[T]he agents explained that Epstein was also being charged in State\n\ncourt and may plea [sic] to state charges related to some of his other\n\nvictims.

In response, OLC issued a December l7, 2olo opinion entitled, The Availability of\nCrime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4. Based on the CVRA’s\nlanguage, relevant case law, and memoranda opinions from Department components, OLC\nreaffirmed its 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that CVRA rights do not vest until a criminal charge has been filed\n(by complaint, information, or indictment) and the rights cease to be available if “all charges are\ndismissed either voluntarily or on the merits (or if the [g]overnment declines to bring formal\ncharges after the filing of a complaint).”°”\n\nAfter OLC issued its opinion, the Department revised the 2oo5 Guidelines in October 2oll\nbut did not change its fundamental position that the CVRA rights did not vest until after criminal\ncharges were filed. The 2oll revision did, houever, add language concerning victim consultation\nbefore a defendant is charged: “In circumstances where plea negotiations occur before a case has\nbeen brought, Department policy is that this should include reasonable consultation prior to the\nfiling of a charging instrument with the court.”*”? The use of the word “should” in the 2oll\nGuidelines indicates that “personnel are expected to take the action . . . unless there is an\nappropriate, articulable reason not to do so.”*8° Nevertheless, the required consultation “may be\ngeneral in nature” and “does not have to be specific to a particular plea offer.”°*! The revisions\nalso specified that AUSAs were to ensure that victims had a right to be reasonably heard at plea\nproceedings.**\n\nOn November 2, 2oll, U.S. Senator Jon Kyl, a co-sponsor of the CVRA, sent a leter to\nAtorney General Eric Holder, arguing that the 2oll Guidelines revisions “conflict[ed] quite\nclearly with the CVRA’s plain language” because the 2oll Guidelines did “not extend any rights\nto victims until charges have been filed.” The Department’s response emphasized that the\n378 OLC “express[ed] no opinion” as to whether it is a mater of “good practice” to inform victims of their CVRA\nrights prior to the filing of a complaint or after the dismissal of charges.\nae See 2oll Guidelines, Art.

Nonetheless, Villafafia told OPR that, while there were\nvalid reasons for the government’s position that CVRA rights do not apply pre-charge, “[T]his is\na case where I felt we should have done more than what was legally required. I was obviously\nprepared to spend as much time, energy and effort necessary to meet with each and every [victim].”\n\nOver the course of the litigation, the district court made various rulings interpreting the\nprovisions of the CVRA, including the court’s key <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that victim CVRA rights “atach\nbefore the Government brings formal charges against a defendant.” The court also held that\n(l) “the CVRA authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a\nnon-prosecution agreement, reached in violation of a prosecutor’s conferral obligations under the\nstatute”; (2) the CVRA authorizes the seting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements”;\n(3) the CVRA’s “reasonable right to confer” “extends to the pre-charge state of criminal\ninvestigations and proceedings”; (4) the alleged federal sex crimes commited by Epstein render\nthe Doe petitioners “victims” under the CVRA; and (5) “questions pertaining to [the] equitable\ndefense[s] are properly left for resolution after development of a full evidentiary record.”\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the petitioners’ Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, ruling that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about its\nintention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” The government did not\ndispute the fact that it did not confer with the petitioners prior to signing the NPA, and the court\nconcluded that “[a]t a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform Petitioners\nthat it intended to enter into an agreement not to prosecute Epstein.” The court found that the post-\nNPA leters the government sent to victims describing the investigation as ongoing “misled the\nvictims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material\nomission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an\ninvestigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*°°\n\nThe court relied on Dean and BP Products to support its holding and noted that the\ngovernment’s action with respect to the NPA was especially troubling because, unlike a plea\nagreement for which the victims could voice objection at a sentencing hearing, “[o]nce an NPA is\nentered into without notice, the mater is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard\nregarding any aspect of the case.” The court also highlighted the inequity of the USAO’s failure\nto communicate with the victims while it simultaneously engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with\nEpstein’s counsel and assured the defense that the NPA would not be “made public or filed with\nthe Court.”\n\nAlthough the USAO defended its actions by citing the 2oo5 Guidelines for the\nDepartment’s position that CVRA rights do not atach until after a defendant is charged, the court\nwas “not persuaded that the [G]uidelines were the basis for the Government’s decision to withhold\ninformation about the NPA from the victims.” The court found that the government’s reliance on\n386 The court did not resolve the factual question as to whether the victims were given adequate notice of\nEpstein’s state court plea hearing.\n\n243\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4567", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004581.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 284 of 349\nand consider victims’ views about, prospective plea negotiations.*’?

The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*'* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\nae The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative) and “Under Investigation.”\nals After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n\n264\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4588", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004589.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 292 of 349\nIV. ACOSTA’S DECISION TO DEFER TO THE STATE ATTORNEY’S\n\nDISCRETION WHETHER TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT EPSTEIN’S STATE\n\nCOURT PLEA HEARING DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR OR UNAMBIGUOUS\n\nSTANDARD; HOWEVER, ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY\n\nFAILING TO ENSURE THAT VICTIMS IDENTIFIED IN THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION WERE ADVISED OF THE STATE PLEA HEARING\n\nAs set forth in the factual discussion, within a few weeks of the NPA’s signing, it became\nclear that the defense team disagreed with, and strongly objected to, the government’s plan to\ninform victims of their ability to recover monetary damages from Epstein, under the l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 provision of the NPA, and about Epstein’s state court plea hearing. The USAO initially\ntook the position that it was obligated to, and intended to, inform victims of both the NPA,\nincluding the § 2255 provision, and Epstein’s change of plea hearing and sentencing, so that\nvictims who wanted to atend could do so.\n\nIn November and December 2oo7, Epstein’s atorneys challenged the USAO’s position\nregarding victim notification. Ultimately, Acosta made two distinct decisions concerning victim\nnotifications. Consistent with Acosta’s concerns about intruding into state actions, Acosta elected\nto defer to state authorities the decision whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing\npursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights requirements. Acosta also determined that the USAO\nwould notify victims about their eligibility to obtain monetary damages from Epstein under § 2255,\na decision that was implemented by leters sent to victims after Epstein entered his state pleas.\nThis decision, which postponed notification of the NPA until after Epstein entered his guilty pleas,\nwas based, at least in part, on Villafafia’s and the case agents’ strategic concerns relating to\npreserving the victims’ credibility and is discussed further in Section V, belou.\n\nIn this section, OPR analyzes Acosta’s decision to defer to the state the responsibility for\nnotifying victims of Epstein’s plea hearing and sentencing. OPR concludes that neither the CVRA\nnor the VRRA required the government to notify victims of the state proceeding and therefore\nAcosta did not violate any statutes or Department policy by deferring to the discretion of the State\nAtorney whether to notify victims of Epstein’s state guilty pleas and sentencing. Houever, OPR\nalso concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment because by failing to ensure that the state\nintended to and would notify victims of the federal investigation, he failed to treat victims\nforthrightly and with the sensitivity expected by the Department. Through counsel, Acosta\n“strongly disagree[d]” with OPR’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> and argued that OPR unfairly applied a standard\n“never before expected of any U.S. Atorney.” OPR addresses Acosta’s criticisms in the\ndiscussion belou.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Defer to the State Atorney’s Discretion Whether to\n\nNotify Victims about Epstein’s State Court Plea Hearing Did Not Violate Any\nClear or Unambiguous Standard\n\nIn November 2oo7, Villafafia sought to avoid defense accusations of misconduct\nconcerming her interactions with the victims by preparing a writen notice to victims informing\nthem of the resolution of the federal case and of their eligibility for monetary damages, and inviting\nthem to appear at the state plea hearing. Villafafia and Sloman exchanged edits of the draft leter\nand, at Sloman’s instruction, she provided the draft to defense atorney Lefkouitz, who, in turn,\n\n265\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4589", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004602.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o5 of 349\npreviously noted, there is some contemporaneous evidence supporting her assertion. Villafafia’s\nmention of the agreement, even if not described in specific terms, would have been sufficient to\napprise those victims of the status of the federal investigation.\n\nNevertheless, Villafafia did not recall discussing the NPA specifically or in general terms\nwith other victims interviewed at that time, nor did she do so with Edwards or any other victim’s\natorney. OPR therefore considered whether the omission of information about the existence of\nthe NPA during these interactions rose to the level of professional misconduct in violation of FRPC\n4-4.l or 4-8.4.44!\n\nOPR evaluated Villafafia’s conduct in light of the comment to FRPC 4-4.l:\n\nA lawyer is required to be truthful when dealing with others on a\n\nclient’s behalf, but generally has no affirmative duty to inform an\n\nopposing party of relevant facts. A misrepresentation can occur if\n\nthe lawyer incorporates or affirms a statement of another person that\n\nthe lawyer knous is false. Misrepresentations can also occur by\n\npartially true but misleading statements or omissions that are the\n\nequivalent of affirmative false statements.\nThe victims and their atorneys were certainly not “opposing part[ies]” to the USAO, but the\ncomment indicates that the rule recognizes that omissions made during discussions with third\nparties, even of relevant facts, are not always treated as false statements.\n\nHere, the evidence does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made an affirmative false\nstatement to the victims or Edwards or that her omissions were “the equivalent of affirmative false\nstatements” about material facts. First, Villafafia told OPR that she believed the investigation was\nongoing and her statement to that effect truthful, and as discussed earlier in this Chapter, the\nevidence shous that Villafafia and the agents did continue to investigate the case until Epstein\nentered his guilty plea in state court in June 2oo8. Villafafia’s email correspondence with her\nsupervisors reflects her strong advocacy during that timeframe to declare Epstein in breach and to\ncharge him. The evidence similarly does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made any affirmative\nfalse statement to Edwards when she informed him of the state court plea, although she declined\nto provide additional information in response to his questions.*”\n\nSecond, in reaching its <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>, OPR considered the full context in which Villafafia\ninteracted with the victims and Edwards. Prosecutors routinely make decisions about what\ninformation will be disclosed to witnesses, including victims, for a variety of strategic reasons. In\nmany cases, prosecutors must make difficult decisions about providing information to witnesses,\ni In Florida Bar v. Joy, the court affirmed a referee’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that Joy violated FRPCs 4-4.l(a) and 4-8.4(c)\n“for making false statements by omission of material facts in his representations [to counsel].” Florida Bar v. Joy,\n679 So. 2d ll65, ll66-68 (Fla. l996). See also Florida Bar re Webster, 647 So. 2d 8l6 (Fla. l994) (petition for\nremstatement denied due to “misrepresentation by omission’).\n\n2 In Feinberg, 76o So. 2d at 938, the court found that an Assistant State Atorney lacked candor and violated\nethics rules when, after meeting with a defendant outside his atorney’s presence, the prosecutor falsely stated to the\ndefense atorney that he (the prosecutor) had not met with the defendant.\n278\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004603.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o6 of 349\nand they often cannot fully reveal either the facts or the status of an investigation, even with\nvictims. The 2oo5 Guidelines advise that in consulting with a victim, prosecutors may be limited\nin their disclosures: “Because victims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government,\nand may disclose whatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only nonsensitive data and\npublic information.”*°\n\nVillafafia’s concern about generating potential impeachment evidence by informing\nvictims of their potential to recover monetary damages from Epstein was not unreasonable.\nIndeed, the case agents initially raised the impeachment issue, and after considering the problem,\nVillafafia agreed with the agents’ concerns. Villafafia raised those concerns with the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer in October 2oo7 after the agents brought the issue to her\natention, and she ultimately raised the issue with Sloman and Acosta as well, neither of whom\nadvised her that those concerns were improper or unsound. OPR also considered that although\nVillafafia had sought to notify the victims in writing of the NPA soon after it was signed, her\nsupervisor, the U.S. Atorney, had decided otherwise. When authorized to inform Edwards of the\nscheduled change of plea hearing, she did so. Although she did not inform Edwards that the plea\nwas part of a global resolution that would end the federal investigation, the evidence does not shou\nthat Villafafia acted for the purpose of deceiving Edwards or preventing him from atending the\nhearing. Had she sought to exclude him from the state proceedings, she could have elected not to\ninform Edwards at all, or she could have discouraged him from atending the state proceedings.\nRather, as Edwards confirmed, Villafafia told him the hearing was “important.” Villafafia sought\nto strike a difficult balance of securing Edwards’s (and his clients’) atendance at the state court\nplea, while obeying her management’s directive that informing victims of the resolution of the\nfederal investigation should not be done until completion of the state plea.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering all of the circumstances, OPR concludes that the\nevidence does not establish that Villafafia violated her obligations under FRPC 4-4.l or 4-8.4(c)\nor (d).*4 Nonetheless, as discussed belou, Villafafia’s interactions with victims and victims’\natorneys without informing them of the NPA and the potential <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> of the federal\ninvestigation contributed to the likelihood that the victims would feel that the government was\nHe 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV, J B.2.c(l). As noted, some victims continued to express favorable views of Epstein\nduring interviews with the government and they, or their atorneys, could have provided information to Epstein about\nthe government’s communications. For example, within a day of Villafafia contacting a victim’s atorney about a\npotential victim notification leter, Starr complained to Acosta that the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it was clear from the\ngirl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a victim.”\n\n“44 The case most directly on point is Smith, lo9 A.3d ll84, in which the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed\na violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) based on a prosecutor’s failure to notify the victim of the\nresolution of a sex abuse case. Houever, as noted previously, in Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea, and various specific statutes afforded victims the right to receive notices and an\nopportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or information in a circuit court.” In this case,\nfor the reasons previously discussed, Villafafia did not have a clear and unambiguous obligation to inform the victims\nor Edwards of the NPA.\n\n279\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004605.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o8 of 349\nVillafafia informed Edwards about the state plea, but did not mention the NPA or the fact that the\nstate pleas would resolve the federal investigation. Edwards then filed the CVRA petition and\nlearned about the NPA signed months earlier and that the federal investigation of Epstein had\nconcluded with Epstein’s state guilty pleas. Wild only received access to the NPA when a judge\npermited it in August 2oo8 pursuant to a protective order. After considering this series of\ninteractions, it is not surprising that Wild came away from the experience feeling confused and\nbelieving she had been misled.\n\nOPR did not find evidence supporting a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that Villafafia, Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, or Lourie opted not to consult with the victims in order to protect Epstein or shield the\nNPA from public scrutiny. Although neither Sloman nor Acosta could recall a specific discussion\nof CVRA obligations before the NPA was signed, both recalled knouing that victim consultation\nwas not required, and Menchel also told OPR that consultation was not required, at least not up to\nthe point when he left the USAO. The evidence is clear that Villafafia sought at various points to\nconsult with and to notify victims about the details of the NPA but was constrained before the\nNPA was signed by managers who either made a decision to not consult victims or did not address\nthe issue after it was raised, and after the signing by her oun concern about creating possible\nimpeachment evidence that would damage the victims’ credibility at a possible trial.\n\nNonetheless, a more open and straightforward approach with the victims, both before and\nafter the signing of the NPA, would have been the beter practice. Before the NPA was signed,\nvictims could have been asked for their views about the general terms the USAO was\ncontemplating offering, including that a plea to state charges was one of the options being\nconsidered; asked for their views in general about a guilty plea; or, at a minimum, asked to share\ntheir views of hou the case should be resolved. Even if the USAO ultimately determined to\nproceed with the NPA, the government would have had the benefit of the victims’ thoughts and\nconcerns, particularly on the issue of punishment, and victims would have felt included in the\nprocess. OPR found no evidence that the benefits of victim consultation were discussed or\nconsidered before the NPA was signed.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, no one from the government explained the agreement to the\nmajority of the victims until months later and only after the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea.\nAlthough the evidence supports Villafafia’s assertion that she acted from a good faith belief that\nEpstein might breach the NPA and a potential trial would be harmed if information about the NPA\nwas divulged to the victims and their counsel, she, Sloman, and Acosta failed to consider hou the\ndesire to shield the victims from that potential impeachment might impact the victims’ sense of\nthe openness and fairness of the process. As Wild stated during the CVRA litigation, she believed\nshe had been “mistreated in the process.” When deciding not to inform the victims of the NPA to\navoid creating impeachment evidence, Villafafia, Sloman, and Acosta do not appear to have\ncarefully considered possible alternatives to, or all of the ramifications of, that decision, nor did\nthey revisit the decision before Villafafia met the victims in person to discuss a potential trial or\nspoke to Edwards or other atorneys representing victims.**° Furthermore, more atention needed\n446 It is not at all clear whether a court would have permited impeachment of the victims concerning one\nprovision in a plea agreement that otherwise could not be used as evidence.

The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim notification and consultation.

Jeffrey Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement Does Not Bar the Superseding\nIndictment\nIn an Opinion and Order dated April l6, 2o2l, the Court denied the defendant’s previous\nmotion to dismiss the Indictment based on a 2oo7 non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”) between\nJeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida (the “USAO-\nSDFL”). The Court concluded, among other things, that “under controlling Second Circuit\nprecedent, the NPA does not bind the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of New York.” (Apr.\nOp. at 3). In reaching this <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>, the Court folloued United States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o,\n672 (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam), which held that “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the\nUnited States Atorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears\nthat the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.” (Apr. Op. at 4). The defendant nou moves\nto dismiss again based on the NPA. The bulk of the defendant’s motion discusses the similarity\nbetween the additional charges in the S2 Indictment and the crimes enumerated in the immunity\nprovisions of the NPA. But it does not mater what—or whom—the NPA purports to immunize,\nsince the Court has already concluded that, under Annabi, the NPA does not bind this District.\nThe defendant cannot clear the initial hurdle of establishing that the NPA applies in this\nDistrict and, accordingly, the motion should be denied. In an effort to relitigate the Court’s April\nOpinion, the defendant nou claims that the rule of Annabi “only applies in situations where the\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo47l3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004733.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 Filed o5/25/2l Page 26 of 26\nprior statements of Minor Victim-4 in its possession, including the transcript of this civil deposition\nand reports of more recent interviews, at least six weeks in advance of trial.

In its May 6 leter, the Government indicated that the original versions of a subset\nof the photographs are in the FBI’s possession, and the Government will make those photographs\navailable to the defense for inspection upon request. The Court agrees with the Government that\nthe request is moot as to those photographs. Again, to the extent that the Government fails to\ncomply with its representation that it will make those photographs available to the defense upon\nrequest, the defense may make an application to the Court.\n\nAs to the remaining photographs, the request is denied on the basis that the defense has\nfailed to establish the relevance of the original versions of the photographs. The defense already\nhas photocopies or scanned versions of the photographs in question. But the defense proffers\nthat it seeks the original versions of these photographs in order to determine whether they are\ngenuine. The only discernible theory of relevance as to this request is impeachment. Maxwell\ndoes not set forth any other nonconclusory basis for their relevance. And again, because\nimpeachment evidence falls outside the scope of Rule l7(c), the request fails to meet Nixon’s\nrelevance requirement. But even assuming that impeachment could permissibly establish\nrelevance, the argument fails because Maxwell does not yet knou the scope of the victim’s\ntestimony or whether it will implicate the photographs.\n\nI. <span class=\"highlight\">Conclusion</span>\n\nThe Defendant’s motion for an order authorizing the subpoena pursuant to Rule l7(c)(3)\n\nis DENIED.\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo474l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004745.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3oo _ Filed o6/l5/2l Page 2 of 32\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Ms. Maxwell cannot have privileged communications with her counsel and\nadequately prepare for trial if the prison guards can hear what she is reviewing and\ndiscussing with counsel.\n\n= The prison guards ordered counsel to reposition her portfolio, which was being used to\nshield glare from the plexiglass divider separating counsel from Ms. Maxwell to permit\ncounsel to have a clearer view of the laptop, because the portfolio was restricting the\nguards’ view of counsel.\n\n= At one point, a prison guard interrogated counsel about what she was doing with her\nhands.

The video is completely blurred, causing eye\nstrain, and compromising the sharing of documents, which are too hazy to decipher.\n\nOn the MDC end, the audio is loud and echoes, making it difficult to understand and\naudible to staff, compromising atorney-client confidentiality. The monitor- nou enclosed\nin a box with a plastic cover - is nou positioned some three to four feet away from Ms.\nMaxwell.

For the same\nreasons, and because the present record does not establish a violation of due process, the Court\ndeclines to suppress the evidence obtained by the Government’s grand jury subpoena.\n\nD. Martindell provides no independent basis for suppression\n\nThe Court turns finally to Maxwell’s argument that Martindell provides an independent\nbasis for suppression. Maxwell cites no authority in her opening brief for the proposition that a\ncourt may suppress evidence because it disagrees with another court’s decision to modify a\nprotective order under Martindell. Indeed, there is no such authority. No court has ever granted\na motion to suppress on this ground. The Court declines to review Judge McMahon’s decision,\nbecause Martindell provides no basis to suppress evidence even if this Court were to disagree\nwith it.\n\nEven if Maxwell were right that this Court should review Judge McMahon’s decision on\nthe merits, that decision—like a magistrate’s probable cause determination—would be entitled to\n“sreat deference.” Leon, 468 U.S. at 9l4. Courts will uphold another judge’s decision to allou\nthe Government to obtain evidence on a motion to suppress so long as there is a “substantial\nbasis” for the decision. Salameh, l52 F.3d at ll3 (quoting //linois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 2l3, 238-\n39 (l983)). Judge McMahon found that the Government had established exceptional\ncircumstances to modify the protective order based on the factual record before her. Judge\nMcMahon concluded that modification was necessary under the circumstances to allou the\nGovernment to investigate a high-profile mater in secrecy and so not to tip off the target of the\ninvestigation.

As discussed, the Court is aware of no authority suggesting review of\nJudge McMahon’s modification order is necessary or appropriate in these circumstances. If\nnecessary, the Court would afford it deference and would not disturb Judge McMahon’s\nreasoned and supported decision.\n\nMaxwell’s reply brief recasts her claim for suppression under Martindell as simply\nanother argument for suppression under due process or the Court’s inherent authority. Because,\nin her view, the Government did not satisfy the requirements of Martindell, its atempt to modify\nthe protective order violated her due process rights. And because, she alleges, the Government\nmisrepresented facts to Judge McMahon, this Court should exercise its inherent authority to\nsuppress evidence as a sanction for governmental misconduct.\n\nThe Court is not persuaded. For the reasons set forth above, the Government’s\napplication for modification of the protective order did not violate Maxwell’s due process rights.\nDue process does not categorically bar an ex parte modification to a protective order, and Judge\nMcMahon found that the Government had shoun extraordinary circumstances to do so. To the\nextent Maxwell seeks suppression based on an alleged misrepresentation to Judge McMahon, for\nthe reasons set forth above, she has not met the high bar for a due process violation or made the\nrequired shouing under Franks that would entitle her to an evidentiary hearing. Whether\nMaxwell advances these arguments under Martindell or directly under due process, they do not\nsupport suppression.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Conclusion</span>\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the Government did not violate Maxwell’s\nconstitutional rights when it obtained evidence covered by a protective order in her earlier civil\ncase.

The Commonwealth filed a\nresponse to the motion, to which Cosby replied.\n\nFrom February 2-3, 2ol6, the trial court conducted hearings on Cosby’s habeas\npetition, which it ultimately denied. Later, in its Pa.R.A.P. l925(a) opinion, the trial court\nexplained that “the only <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that was apparent” from the record “was that no\nagreement or promise not to prosecute ever existed, only the exercise of prosecutorial\ndiscretion.” Tr.

In support of this <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>, the trial\ncourt provided a lengthy summary of what it found to be the pertinent facts developed at\nthe habeas corpus hearing. Because our analysis in this case focuses upon the trial\ncourt’s interpretation of those testimonies, we reproduce that court’s synopsis here:\n\nOn January 24, 2oo5, then District Atorney Bruce L. Castor, Jr., issued a\n\nsigned press release announcing an investigation into Ms. Constand’s\n\nallegations. Mr. Castor testified that as the District Atorney in 2oo5, he\noversaw the investigation into Ms. Constand’s allegations. Ms. Ferman\nsupervised the investigation along with County Detective Richard Peffall\n\nand Detective Richard Schaffer of Cheltenham. Mr. Castor testified that “I\n\nassigned who | thought were our best people to the case. And | took an\n\nactive role as District Atorney because | thought | oued it to Canada to\n\nshou that, in America, we will investigate allegations against celebrities.”\n\nMr. Castor testified that Ms. Constand went to the Canadian police almost\n\nexactly one year after the alleged assault and that the case was ultimately\n\nreferred to Montgomery County. The lack of a prompt complaint was\nsignificant to Mr. Castor in terms of Ms. Constand’s credibility and in terms\n\nof law enforcement’s ability to collect physical evidence. He also placed\n\nsignificance on the fact that Ms. Constand told the Canadian authorities that\n\nshe contacted a lawyer in Philadelphia prior to speaking with them. He also\n\nreviewed Ms. Constand’s statements to police. Mr. Castor felt that there\n\nwere inconsistences in her statements. Mr. Castor did not recall press\n\nquotes atributed to him calling the case “weak” at a 2oo5 press conference.\nupon pre-arrest delay; and (3) a motion to disqualify the Montgomery County District\nAtorney’s Office.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - l9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4832", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004833.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 2l of 8o\nLikewise, he did not recall the specific statement, “[i]n Pennsylvania we\ncharged people for criminal conduct. We don’t charge people with making\na mistake or doing something foolish;” houever, he indicated that it is a true\nstatement.\n\nAs part of the 2oo5 investigation, [Cosby] gave a full statement to law\nenforcement and his Pennsylvania and New York homes were searched.\n[Cosby] was accompanied by counsel and did not invoke the Fifth\nAmendment at any time during the statement. After [Cosby's] interview,\nMs. Constand was interviewed a second time. Mr. Castor never personally\nmet with Ms. Constand. Follouing that interview of Ms. Constand, Mr.\nCastor spoke to [Cosby’s] atorney Walter M. Phillips, Jr. Mr. Phillips told\nMr. Castor that during the year between the assault and the report, Ms.\nConstand had multiple phone contacts with [Cosby]. Mr. Phillips was also\nconcerned that Ms. Constand had recorded phone calls with [Cosby]. Mr.\nPhillips told Mr. Castor that if he obtained the phone records and the\nrecorded calls he would conclude that Ms. Constand and her mother were\natempting was to get money from [Cosby] so they would not go to the\npolice. While he did not necessarily agree with the conclusions Mr. Phillips\nthought would be drawn from the records, Mr. Castor directed the police to\nobtain the records. Mr. Castor’s recollection was that there was an\n“inordinate number of [phone] contacts” between [Cosby] and Ms. Constand\nafter the assault. He also confirmed the existence of at least two “wire\ninterceptions,” which he did not believe would be admissible.\nAs part of the 2oo5 investigation, allegations made by other women were\nalso investigated. Mr. Castor delegated that investigation to Ms. Ferman.\nHe testified that he determined that, in his opinion, these allegations were\nunreliable.\nFollouing approximately one month of investigation, Mr. Castor concluded\nthat “there was insufficient credible and admissible evidenced upon which\nany charge against Mr. Cosby related to the Constand incident could be\nproven beyond a reasonable doubt.” He testified that he could either leave\nthe case open at that point or definitively close the case to allou a civil case.\nHe did not believe there was a chance that the criminal case could get any\nbeter. He believed Ms. Constand’s actions created a credibility issue that\ncould not be overcome.\nMr. Castor further indicated, “Mr. Phillips never agreed to anything in\nexchange for Mr. Cosby not being prosecuted.” Mr. Castor testified that he\ntold Mr. Philips of his legal assessment and then told Ms. Ferman of the\nanalysis and directed her to contact Constand’s atorneys. He testified that\nshe was to contact the atorneys to let them knou that “Cosby was not going\nto be prosecuted and that the purpose for that was that | wanted to create\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 2o\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4833", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004843.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 3l of 8o\n\nOn May 24, 2ol6, follouing a preliminary hearing, all of Cosby’s charges were held\nfor trial. Thereafter, Cosby filed a number of pretrial motions, including a petition for a\nwrit of habeas corpus, a motion to dismiss the charges on due process grounds, and,\nmost pertinent here, a “Motion to Suppress the Contents of his Deposition Testimony and\nAny Evidence Derived therefrom on the Basis that the District Atorney’s Promise not to\nProsecute Him Induced Him to Waive his Fifth Amendment Right Against Self-\nIncrimination.” After holding a hearing on the suppression motion, at which no new\ntestimony was taken, the trial court again concluded that former District Atorney Castor’s\ntestimony was equivocal, credited the testimony of Constand’s atorneys, and found that\nno promise or agreement not to prosecute existed. Having so determined, the court\ndiscerned “no [c]onstitutional barrier to the use of [Cosby’s] civil deposition testimony”\nagainst him at trial, and it denied the suppression motion.'> Later, the Commonwealth\nwould introduce portions of Cosby’s deposition testimony against Cosby, including his\nadmissions to using Qualudes during sexual encounters with women in the past.\n\nOn September 6, 2ol6, the Commonwealth filed a “Motion to Introduce Evidence\nof Other Bad Acts of the Defendant,” which Cosby opposed by writen response. The\nCommonwealth sought to introduce evidence and testimony from other women who\nalleged that Cosby had sexually assaulted them, instances that could not be prosecuted\ndue to the lapse of applicable statutes of limitations. On February 24, 2ol7, the trial court\ngranted the Commonwealth’s motion, but permited only one of these alleged past victims\nto testify at Cosby’s trial.\n\nOn December 3o, 2ol6, Cosby filed a motion seeking a change in venue or venire.\nThe trial court kept the case in Montgomery County, but agreed that the jury should be\nl8 T.C.O. at 72 (quoting Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Sur\nDefendant’s Motion to Suppress Evidence Pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 58l(l), l2/5/2ol6,\nat 5).\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4843", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004849.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 37 of 8o\ndrink or a pill, often at Cosby’s insistence; that each woman became incapacitated and\nunable to consent to sexual contact; and that Cosby sexually assaulted each woman\nwhile each was under the influence of the intoxicant. /d. at lo3-o4. These “chilling\nsimilarities,” the court explained, rendered Cosby’s actions “so distinctive as to become\na signature,” and therefore the evidence was admissible to demonstrate a common plan,\nscheme, or design. /d. at lo4.\n\nThe court further determined that the prior bad acts evidence was admissible to\ndemonstrate that Cosby’s actions were not the result of mistake or accident. The court\nrelied in large part upon then-Chief Justice Saylor’s concurrence in Commonwealth v.\nHicks, l56 A.3d ll4 (Pa. 2ol7), which suggested the “doctrine of chances” as another\n“theory of logical relevance that does not depend on an impermissible inference of bad\ncharacter, and which is most greatly suited to disproof of accident or mistake.” /d. at ll3l\n(Saylor, C.J., concurring). The trial court reasoned that the purpose of the evidence was\nnot to demonstrate that Cosby behaved in conformity with a criminal propensity, but rather\nto “establish the objective improbability of so many accidents befalling the defendant or\nthe defendant becoming innocently enmeshed in suspicious circumstances so\nfrequently.” Id. at ll33 (Saylor, C.J., concurring). The court noted that there was no\ndispute that a sexual encounter between Cosby and Constand had occurred; the\ncontested issue was Constand’s consent. The prior bad acts evidence, therefore, was\n“relevant to shou a lack of mistake, namely, that [Cosby] could not have possibly believed\nthat [] Constand consented to the digital penetration as well as his intent in administering\nan intoxicant.” T.C.O at lo8. Similarly, with regard to the “doctrine of chances,” the court\nopined that the fact that nineteen women were proffered as Rule 4o4(b) witnesses “lends\n[sic] to the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that [Cosby] found himself in this situation more frequently than the\ngeneral population.” /d. Accordingly, “the fact that numerous other women recounted the\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4849", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004851.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 39 of 8o\n\nthe assault as a consensual encounter.” /d. “Furthermore,” the court opined, “Ms.\nConstand did not report the assault until approximately one year later, further supporting\nthe Commonwealth’s need for the evidence.” /d. at llo. With regard to the prejudicial\nimpact of the evidence, the court suggested that it had sufficiently mitigated any potential\nprejudice when it limited the number of witnesses who could testify (at the second trial)\nto just five of the nineteen witnesses that the Commonwealth requested. /d. The court\nnoted that it found all nineteen witness’ testimony to be relevant and admissible, but\nlimited the number to five so as to mitigate the prejudice to Cosby. The court added that\nit gave cautionary instructions on the permissible use of this evidence, designed so as to\nlimit its prejudicial impact. /d. at llo-ll.\n\nFinally, the trial court rejected Cosby’s challenge to the admissibility of the contents\nof his deposition testimony to the extent that it concerned his use of Qualudes in decades\npast. The court opined that Cosby’s “oun words about his use and knouledge of drugs\nwith a depressant effect was relevant to shou his intent and motive in giving a depressant\nto [] Constand.” /d. at ll5. Because the evidence demonstrated Cosby’s knouledge of\nthe effects of drugs such as Qualudes, the court reasoned, Cosby “either knew\n[Constand] was unconscious, or recklessly disregarded the risk that she could be.” /d.\nAs with the Rule 4o4(b) witnesses, the court found that any prejudicial effect of this\nevidence was mitigated by the court’s cautionary instructions. /d. Accordingly, the court\ntrial opined that all of the Rule 4o4(b) evidence was admissible.\n\nAt the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> of a second jury trial, Cosby was convicted on all three counts of\naggravated indecent assault. Follouing the denial of a number of post-trial motions, the\ntrial court deemed Cosby to be a “sexually violent predator” pursuant to the then-\napplicable version of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (“SORNA’), 42\nPa.C.S. §§ 9799.lo-9799.4l. The trial court then sentenced Cosby to three to ten years\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 38\nDOJ-OGR-oooo485l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004861.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 49 of 8o\ncredibility issues, and the absence of direct or corroborative proof by which to substantiate\nher claim, led the district atorney to believe that the case presented “insufficient, credible,\nand admissible evidence upon which any charge could be sustained beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.” Press Release, 2/l7/2oo5 (cleaned up). Given his “conclu[sion] that a conviction\nunder the circumstances of this case would be unatainable,” D.A. Castor “decline[d] to\nauthorize the filing of criminal charges in connection with this mater.” /d. In light of the\nnon-prosecution decision, Cosby no longer was exposed to criminal liability relating to the\nConstand allegations and thus could no longer invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege\nagainst compulsory self-incrimination in that regard. With no legal mechanism available\nto avoid testifying in Constand’s civil suit, Cosby sat for depositions and, therein, made a\nnumber of statements incriminating himself.\n\nD.A. Castor’s declination decision stood fast throughout his tenure in office. When\nhe moved on, houever, his successor decided to revive the investigation and to prosecute\nCosby. Ruling upon Cosby’s challenge to this belated prosecution, the trial court\nconcluded that the former district atorney’s promise did not constitute a binding,\nenforceable agreement. To determine whether Cosby permanently was shielded from\nprosecution by D.A. Castor’s 2oo5 declination decision, we first must ascertain the legal\nrelationship between D.A. Castor and Cosby. We begin with the trial court’s findings.\n\nIt is hornbook law that reviewing courts are not fact-finding bodies. O'Rourke v.\nCommonwealth, 778 A.2d ll94, ll99 (Pa. 2ool). Appellate courts are limited to\ndetermining “whether there is evidence in the record to justify the trial court’s findings.”\nld. at ll99 n.6. “If so, this Court is bound by them.” /d. Houever, while “we accord\ndeference to a trial court with regard to factual findings, our review of legal conclusions is\nde novo.” /d. at n.7 (citation omited). Indeed, it is a long-standing appellate principle\nthat, “[w]ith respect to [] inferences and deductions from facts and [] conclusions of\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 48\nDOJ-OGR-oooo486l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004862.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 5o of 8o\nlaw, .. . appellate courts have the pouer to draw their oun inferences and make their oun\ndeductions and conclusions.” /n re Pruner's Est., l62 A.2d 626, 63l (Pa. l96o) (citations\nomited).\n\nHere, the trial court presided over the habeas corpus hearing, viewing and hearing\nthe witnesses and their testimonies first-hand. From that vantage point, the trial court\ndetermined that, as a mater of fact, D.A. Castor had not extended a formal promise to\nCosby never to prosecute him, let alone consummated a formal non-prosecution\nagreement with Cosby. The factual basis for the court’s findings was two-fold. First, the\ncourt characterized the interaction between the district atorney and Cosby as a failed\natempt to reach a statutorily prescribed transactional immunity agreement. Second, the\ncourt concluded that the former district atorney's testimony regarding the legal\nrelationship between him and Cosby was inconsistent and “equivocal at best.” T.C.O. at\n63. Both findings are supported adequately by the record.\n\nPursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 5947, when a prosecutor wishes to formalize an immunity\nagreement, he or she “may request an immunity order from any judge of a designated\ncourt.” /d. § 5947(b). Presented with such a request, the petitioned court “shall issue\nsuch an order,” id., upon which a witness “may not refuse to testify based on his privilege\nagainst self-incrimination.” /d. § 5947(c). At the habeas hearing, former District Atorney\nCastor testified that he intended to provide Cosby with transactional immunity. He\nexplained that this conferral was predicated upon the state’s common-law authority as a\nsovereign rather than any statutory provisions or protocols. T.C.O. at 5/7 (citing N.T.,\n2/2/2ol6, at 232, 234, 236). The record does not contradict his testimony. There is no\nevidence, nor any real contention, that the parties even contemplated a grant of immunity\nunder Section 5947. The trial court’s finding that the interaction between D.A. Castor and\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4862", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004864.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 52 of 8o\n\nAlthough former D.A. Castor stated that he intended permanently to bar\nprosecution of Cosby, he also testified that he sought to confer some form of transactional\nimmunity. In his second email to D.A. Ferman, former district atorney Castor suggested\nthat his intent in “signing off” on the press release was to assure Cosby that nothing that\nhe said in a civil deposition could or would be used against him in a criminal prosecution.\nN.T., 2/2/2ol6, Exh. D-7. In the same email, he simultaneously expressed his belief that\n“a prosecution is not precluded.” /d. As such, the evidence suggests that D.A. Castor\nwas motivated by conflicting aims when he decided not to prosecute Cosby. On one\nhand, the record demonstrates that D.A. Castor endeavored to forever preclude the\nCommonwealth from prosecuting Cosby if Cosby testified in the civil case. On the other\nhand, the record indicates that he sought to foreclose only the use in a subsequent\ncriminal case of any testimony that Cosby gave in a civil suit.\n\nThe trial court was left to resolve these seeming inconsistencies. The court\nconcluded that Cosby and D.A. Castor did not enter into a formal immunity agreement.\nBecause the record supports the trial court’s findings in this regard, we are bound by\nthose conclusions. Pertinently, we are bound by the trial court’s determination that D.A.\nCastor’s actions amounted only to a unilateral exercise of prosecutorial discretion. This\ncharacterization is consistent with the former district atorney's insistence at the habeas\nhearing that what occurred between him and Cosby was not an agreement, a contract,\nor any kind of quid pro quo exchange.\n\nWe are not, houever, bound by the louer courts’ legal determinations that derive\nfrom those factual findings. Thus, the question becomes whether, and under what\ncircumstances, a prosecutor’s exercise of his or her charging discretion binds future\nprosecutors’ exercise of the same discretion. This is a question of law.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4864", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004874.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 62 of 8o\n\nThat is what happened in this case. There has been considerable debate over the\nlegal significance of District Atorney Castor’s publicly announced decision not to\nprosecute Cosby in 2oo5. Before the trial court, the Superior Court, and nou this Court,\nthe parties have vigorously disputed whether D.A. Castor and Cosby reached a binding\nagreement, whether D.A. Castor extended an enforceable promise, or whether any act of\nlegal significance occurred at all. There is testimony in the record that could support any\nof these conclusions. The trial court—the entity charged with sorting through those\nfacts—found that D.A. Castor made no agreement or overt promise.\n\nMuch of that debate, and the atendant factual conclusions, were based upon the\napparent absence of a formal agreement and former D.A. Castor’s various efforts to\ndefend and explain his actions ten years after the fact. As a reviewing court, we accept\nthe trial court’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the district atorney's decision was merely an exercise of\nhis charging discretion.24 As we assess whether that decision, and the surrounding\nmA The dissent agrees—as do we —with the trial court’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that D.A. Castor’s\ndecision not to prosecute was, at its core, an exercise of the inherent charging discretion\nvested in district atorneys. See D.O. at l. But the dissent would simply end the analysis\nthere. In the dissent’s view, once a decision is deemed to fall within a prosecutor’s\ndiscretion, that decision “in no way” can bind the actions of future elected prosecutors.\nRespectfully, this perspective overlooks the verity that not all decisions are the same. As\nto routine discretionary decisions, the dissent may be correct. But as we explain\nthroughout this opinion, what occurred here was anything but routine. Here, D.A. Castor’s\nexercise of discretion was made deliberately to induce the deprivation of a fundamental\nright. The typical decision to prosecute, or not to prosecute, is not made for the purpose\nof extracting incriminating information from a suspect when there exists no other\nmechanism to do so.\n\nThe dissent would amalgamate and confine all “present exercise[s] of prosecutorial\ndiscretion” within a single, non-binding, unenforceable, and unreviewable category. /d.\nWe decline to endorse this blanket approach, as such decisions merit, and indeed require,\nindividualized evaluation. To rule otherwise would authorize, if not encourage,\nprosecutors to choose temporarily not to prosecute, obtain incriminating evidence from\nthe suspect, and then reverse course with impunity. Due process necessarily requires\nthat court officials, particularly prosecutors, be held to a higher standard. This is\nparticularly so in circumstances where the prosecutor’s decision is crafted specifically to\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 6l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4874", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004877.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 65 of 8o\n\nWhen we review the statement in its full context, it is clear that, when D.A. Castor\nannounced that he “will reconsider this decision should the need arise,” the decision to\nwhich he was referring was his decision not to comment publicly “on the details of his\n[charging] decision for fear that his opinions and analysis might be given undue weight\nby jurors in any contemplated civil action.” The entire paragraph addresses the district\natorney’s concern that he might inadvertently taint a potential civil jury pool by making\npublic remarks about the credibility of the likely parties in that highly anticipated case.\nThen-D.A. Castor expressly stated that he could change his mind on that decision only.\nNothing in this paragraph pertains to his decision not to prosecute Cosby. The trial court’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> is belied by a plain reading of the entire passage.\n\nOur inquiry does not end there. D.A. Castor’s press release, without more, does\nnot necessarily create a due process entitlement. Rather, the due process implications\narise because Cosby detrimentally relied upon the Commonwealth’s decision, which was\nthe district atorney’s ultimate intent in issuing the press release. There was no evidence\nof record indicating that D.A. Castor intended anything other than to induce Cosby’s\nreliance. Indeed, the most patent and obvious evidence of Cosby’s reliance was his\ncounseled decision to testify in four depositions in Constand’s civil case without ever\ninvoking his Fifth Amendment rights.\n\nThe Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which is applicable to the\nStates via incorporation though the Fourteenth Amendment, commands that “[n]o person\n... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.” U.S. CONST.\namend. V. The right to refuse to incriminate oneself is an “essential mainstay” of our\nconstitutional system of criminal justice. Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. l, 7 (l964). The\nprivilege constitutes an essential restraint upon the pouer of the government, and stands\nas an indispensable rampart between that government and the governed. The Fifth\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 64\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4877", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004880.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 68 of 8o\nhimself as well. Assuming that a person validly possesses the right to refrain from giving\nevidence against himself, he may invoke that right “at any time.” See Miranda v. Arizona,\n384 U.S. 436, 473 (l966); Commonwealth v. Dulaney, 295 A.2d 328, 33o (Pa. l972).\nThe fact that Cosby did not assert any right to remain silent to the police or while siting\nfor the depositions is of no moment. Had his right to remain silent not been removed by\nD.A. Castor’s decision, Cosby would have been at liberty to invoke that right at will. That\nCosby did not do so at other junctures is not proof that he held the right but elected not\nto invoke it, as the trial court evidently reasoned. To assume an implicit waiver of the\nright violates a court’s “duty . . . to be watchful for the constitutional rights of the citizen,”\nand to construe the existence of such rights broadly. Taylor, 23o A.3d at lo64 (quoting\nBoyd, supra).\n\nThese legal commandments compel only one <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>. Cosby did not invoke\nthe Fifth Amendment before he incriminated himself because he was operating under the\nreasonable belief that D.A. Castor’s decision not to prosecute him meant that “the\npotential exposure to criminal punishment no longer exist[ed].” /d. at lo65. Cosby could\nnot invoke that which he no longer possessed, given the Commonwealth’s assurances\nthat he faced no risk of prosecution. Not only did D.A. Castor’s unconditional decision\nnot to prosecute Cosby strip Cosby of a fundamental constitutional right, but, because he\nwas forced to testify, Cosby provided Constand’s civil atorneys with evidence of Cosby’s\npast use of drugs to facilitate his sexual exploits. Undoubtedly, this information hindered\nCosby’s ability to defend against the civil action, and led to a setlement for a significant\namount of money. We are left with no doubt that Cosby relied to his detriment upon the\ndistrict atorney’s decision not to prosecute him. The question then becomes whether\nthat reliance was reasonable. Unreasonable reliance warrants no legal remedy.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo488o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004881.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 69 of 8o\n\nWe already have determined that Cosby in fact relied upon D.A. Castor’s decision.\nWe nou conclude that Cosby’s reliance was reasonable, and that it also was reasonable\nfor D.A. Castor to expect Cosby to so rely. The record establishes without contradiction\nthat depriving Cosby of his Fifth Amendment right was D.A. Castor’s intended result.2’\nHis actions were specifically designed to that end. The former district atorney may have\nequivocated or contradicted himself years later with regard to hou he endeavored to\nachieve that result, but there has never been any question as to what he intended to\nachieve. There can be no doubt that, by choosing not to prosecute Cosby and then\n27 The dissent asserts that we have predicated our decision upon the existence of an\n“unwriten promise,” which was rejected by the trial court’s credibility findings. D.O. at 3.\nTo the contrary. As we explained earlier, we have accepted the trial court’s findings in\nthis regard, and those findings, which are supported by the record, are binding on this\nCourt. See, supra, page 48 (citing O’Rourke, 778 A.2d at ll99 (Pa. 2ool)). Houever,\nour deference is limited to the factual findings only; we may draw our oun inferences\ntherefrom and reach our oun legal conclusions. See /n re Pruner's Est., l62 A.2d at 63l.\nThus, the trial court’s factual finding that no formal bargained-for-exchange, writen or\nunwriten, occurred does not constrain our legal analysis, nor does it in any way serve to\nimmunize D.A. Castor’s actions from constitutional scrutiny. That there was no formal\npromise does not mean that Cosby no longer had due process rights.\n\nThe trial court’s credibility finding regarding the existence vel non of a particular\npromise does not allou us to ignore the remainder of the overwhelming evidence of\nrecord. The record firmly establishes that D.A. Castor’s desired result was to strip Cosby\nof his Fifth Amendment rights. This patent and developed fact stands separate and apart\nfrom the trial court’s finding that D.A. Castor never extended a formal promise.\n\nThe dissent would ignore the undeniable reality that Cosby relied to his detriment\nupon D.A. Castor’s decision. The dissent does so by shifting the perspective from D.A.\nCastor’s actions to Cosby’s, focusing in particular upon the fact that Cosby did not record\nthe purported agreement or reduce it to writing. As we note in this opinion, in this context,\nneither a promise, nor an agreement, nor a contract, nor evidence of reliance derives\nlegal validity only upon being recorded or upon writen materialization. The law knous no\nsuch prerequisite, and Cosby cannot be punished for failing to comply with a legal\nrequirement that does not exist. The proof of Cosby’s reliance is plain on the face of the\nrecord. It is the fact that, upon the advice and assistance of counsel, Cosby sat for four\ndepositions and incriminated himself, obviously a decision made after and in direct\nreliance upon D.A. Castor’s decision.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 68\nDOJ-OGR-oooo488l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004882.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 7o of 8o\nannouncing it publicly, D.A. Castor reasonably expected Cosby to act in reliance upon his\ncharging decision.\n\nWe cannot deem it unreasonable to rely upon the advice of one’s atorneys. The\nconstitutional guarantee of the effective assistance of counsel is premised, in part, upon\nthe complexities that inhere in our criminal justice system. A criminal defendant confronts\na number of important decisions that may result in severe consequences to that\ndefendant if, and when, they are made without a full understanding of the intricacies and\nnuances of the ever-changing criminal law. As Justice Black explained in Johnson v.\nZerbst, 3o4 U.S. 458 (l938):\n\n[The right to counsel] embodies a realistic recognition of the obvious truth\n\nthat the average defendant does not have the professional legal skill to\n\nprotect himself when brought before a tribunal with pouer to take his life or\n\nliberty, wherein the prosecution is presented by experienced and learned\ncounsel. That which is simple, orderly, and necessary to the lawyer to the\nuntrained layman may appear intricate, complex, and mysterious.\n\nConsistently with the wise policy of the Sixth Amendment and other parts of\n\nour fundamental charter, this Court has pointed to the humane policy of\n\nmodern criminal law, which nou provides that a defendant, if he be poor,\n\nmay have counsel furnished [to] him by the state, not infrequently more able\n\nthan the atorney for the state.’\n\nThe right to be heard would be, in many cases, of litle avail if it did not\n\ncomprehend the right to be heard by counsel. Even the intelligent and\n\neducated layman has small and sometimes no skill in the science of law. If\ncharged with crime, he is incapable, generally, of determining for himself\nwhether the indictment is good or bad. He is unfamiliar with the rules of\n\nevidence. Left without the aid of counsel he may be put on trial without a\n\nproper charge, and convicted upon incompetent evidence, or evidence\n\nirrelevant to the issue or otherwise inadmissible. He lacks both the skill and\nknouledge adequately to prepare his defence, even though he [may] have\n\na perfect one. He requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the\n\nproceedings against him.\n\nId. at 462-63 (cleaned up). Not only was Cosby’s reliance upon the conclusions and\nadvice of his atorneys reasonable, it was consistent with a core purpose of the right to\ncounsel.\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4882", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004885.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 73 of 8o\ndo just that, D.A. Castor made no atempt in 2oo5 or in any of the ten years that folloued\nto remedy any misperception or to stop Cosby from openly and detrimentally relying upon\nthat decision. In light of these circumstances, the subsequent decision by successor\nD.A.s to prosecute Cosby violated Cosby’s due process rights. No other <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>\ncomports with the principles of due process and fundamental fairness to which all aspects\nof our criminal justice system must adhere.2°\n\nHaving identified a due process violation here, we must ascertain the remedy to\nwhich Cosby is entitled. We note at the outset that specific performance does not\nautomatically apply in these circumstances. As a general rule, specific performance is\nreserved for remedying an injured party to a fully consummated agreement, such as an\nagreed-upon and executed plea bargain. Commonwealth v. Spence, 627 A.2d ll76,\nll84 (Pa. l993). “Specific performance’ is a traditional contract remedy that is available\nwhen monetary damages are inadequate.” Martinez, l47 A.3d at 532 (citing BLACK’s LAW\nDICTIONARY l425 (8th ed. 2oo4) (defining “specific performance” as, inter alia, “a court-\nordered remedy that requires precise fulfillment of a legal or contractual obligation when\nmonetary damages are inappropriate or inadequate’”)).\n\nThis does not mean that specific performance is unavailable entirely. It only means\nthat the remedy does not naturally flou to someone under these circumstances as an\nautomatic consequence of contract law. Specific performance is awarded only when\nequity and fundamental fairness command it. See Scotland, at 6l4 F.2d at 365 (stating\nthat, if “the defendant detrimentally relies on the government’s promise, the resulting harm\nfrom this induced reliance implicates due process guarantees”); see also Commonwealth\nv. Mebane, 58 A.3d l243 (Pa. Super. 2ol2) (upholding trial court ruling that fundamental\n28 See Khan v.

All of this started with D.A. Castor’s compulsion of Cosby’s\nreliance upon a public proclamation that Cosby would not be prosecuted. The CDO’s\nremedy for all of this would include subjecting Cosby to a third criminal trial. That is no\nremedy at all. Rather, it is an approach that would place Cosby nouhere near where he\nwas before the due process violation took root.\n\nThere is only one remedy that can completely restore Cosby to the status quo ante.\nHe must be discharged, and any future prosecution on these particular charges must be\nbarred. We do not dispute that this remedy is both severe and rare. But it is warranted\nhere, indeed compelled. The CDO would shun this remedy because (at least in part) it\nmight thwart the “public interest in having the guilty brought to book.”*4 It cannot be\ngainsaid that society holds a strong interest in the prosecution of crimes. It is also true\nthat no such interest, houever important, ever can eclipse society’s interest in ensuring\nthat the constitutional rights of the people are vindicated. Society’s interest in prosecution\ndoes not displace the remedy due to constitutionally aggrieved persons.\nIV. <span class=\"highlight\">Conclusion</span>\nWe do not question the discretion that is vested in prosecutors “over whether\ncharges should be brought in any given case.” Stipetich, 652 A.2d at l295. We will not\nundermine a prosecutor’s “general and widely recognized pouer to conduct criminal\nlitigation and prosecutions on behalf of the Commonwealth, and to decide whether and\nwhen to prosecute, and whether and when to continue or discontinue a case.” /d.

(See Def.’s Reply in Further Supp. of Mot. for Protective Order, l5-cv-7433, Dkt. No. |\n49 at 5.) This might seem ironic, since Maxwell argued, in support of her motion for entry of a |\nprotective order, that prosecution of anyone based on Giuffre’s allegations was unlikely. (/d.) |\nBut whether prosecution seemed likely or not, Maxwell did indeed bargain for such a provision; |\nand for whatever reason, Giuffre and Boies Schiller agreed to it. |\nHouever, the Protective Order entered by Judge Sweet contains a provision that permits |\nthe court to order disclosure of Confidential Material in circumstances other than those listed in |\nParagraph 5 (a)-(h), See Protective Order J 5 (“CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION shall not, |\nwithout the consent of the party producing it or further Order of the Court, be disclosed|.]”) |\n(emphasis added). All the list of exceptions at subparagraphs 5(a) through (h) does is indicate |\nwhen there is no need for the opponent’s consent or a court order before disclosure can be made. |\n|\nAs the Protective Order plainly gives the court the pouer to enter an order compelling disclosure !\nto anyone—law enforcement included—Maxwell could not reasonably have relied on the |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo892 |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4942 |", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004950.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page 27 of 27 |\n, To Be Filed Under Seal |\nCircuit—even before a final order disposing of the intervenors’ appeal—has been critical of that |\nfact, and has demanded an explanation for why it should not immediately unseal at least the |\nmaterials filed in connection with the motion for summary judgment, lends force to the |\nGovernment’s request, despite its breadth. |\nFor these reasons, the Government has demonstrated extraordinary circumstances |\nwarranting a modification of the Protective Order. |\nIl. <span class=\"highlight\">Conclusion</span> |\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court GRANTS the Government’s application to |\nmodify the Protective Order, in order to permit Boies Schiller to comply with the subpoena. |\nThe Clerk of Court is ORDERED to file this memorandum opinion and order under seal. |\nThe Clerk of Court is also respectfully requested to close the open application at Docket |\nNumber 2.

NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nOn April l6, 2o2l, the Court issued an Opinion & Order granting in part and denying in\npart Ghislaine Maxwell’s various pretrial motions seeking to dismiss portions of the\nGovernment’s (Sl) superseding indictment and compel discovery. Prior to the issuance of that\nOpinion & Order but after the motions were fully briefed, a grand jury returned a second (S2)\nsuperseding indictment adding a sex trafficking count and sex trafficking conspiracy count. The\nCourt did not address the new charges in the April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order. On May 25,\n2o2l, Maxwell filed another round of pretrial motions seeking to dismiss the S2 indictment in\nwhole or in part and to compel discovery. Dkt. No. 292, 293. For appeal preservation purposes\nor otherwise, the arguments largely, though not entirely, rehash the positions rejected by the\nCourt in its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order. To the extent new arguments are made, they are\naddressed belou. All pending motions are DENIED. The Court provides a brief summary of its\nconclusions here and its reasoning on the pages that follou:\n\n° Maxwell moves to dismiss counts one, three, five, and six as barred by Jeffrey\nEpstein’s non-prosecution agreement. The Court again concludes, as it did in its April\nl6, 2o2l Opinion & Order, that the agreement does not bind the United States Atorney\nfor the Southern District of New York.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4975", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004977.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3l7 Filed o8/l3/2l Page3ofl4\nrenewed motion for substantially the same reasons set forth in its April l6 opinion. The Court\nwill proceed to briefly explain why neither the new charges in the S2 superseding indictment nor\nthe supplemental authority Maxwell cites change the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the NPA does not\nbar the charges against her.\n\nAs the Court explained in its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order, the Second Circuit held in\nUnited States v. Annabi that “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the United States\nAtorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the\nagreement contemplates a broader restriction.” 77l F.2d 67o, 672 (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam).\nThe Second Circuit’s opinion in Annabi is clear, and that court has folloued it steadfastly since.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x 268, 27o (2d Cir. 2oo4); United States v.\nBroun, No. 99-l23o(L), 2oo2 WL 34244994, at *2 (2d Cir. Apr. 26, 2oo2); United States v.\nSalameh, l52 F.3d 88, l2o (2d Cir. l998) (per curiam); United States v. Rivera, 844 F.2d 9l6,\n923 (2d Cir. l988). The Second Circuit has held that language nearly identical to that in\nEpstein’s NPA is not enough to overcome the presumption in favor of single-district plea\nagreements. See Salameh, l52 F.3d at l2o. Adhering to this binding authority, this Court thus\nconcluded (and continues to conclude) that the NPA does not bind the U.S. Atorney’s Office for\nthe Southern District of New York. It thus provides Maxwell no defense in this case even if it\nwould otherwise cover the conduct charged in the new counts in the S2 superseding indictment.\n\nMaxwell advances two new arguments for why the Court should depart from this\nreasoning—the first in her renewed motion and the second in a leter of supplemental authority.\nSee Dkt. Nos. 293, 3lo. In her renewed motion, she contends that Annabi contains an exception\nfor out-of-district prosecutions for charges that are “identical to the dismissed charges.” And in\nthe leter of supplemental authority, she contends that the opinion of the Pennsylvania Supreme\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4977", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004988.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3l7 _ Filed o8/l3/2l Page l4 of l4\n<span class=\"highlight\">Conclusion</span>\n\nFor the reasons above and in this Court’s April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order, the Court\nDENIES Maxwell’s motion to obtain relief specified in her supplemental pre-trial motions\nrelating to the S2 indictment.

The Court can restrict atorneys to\nposing open-ended questions to identify bias, prejudice and preconceptions, subject to reasonable\ntime limits.\nLong ago, the Supreme Court observed:\nImpartiality is not a technical conception. It is a state of mind. For\nthe ascertainment of this mental atitude of appropriate indifference,\nthe Constitution lays doun no tests and procedure is not chained to\nany ancient and artificial formula.\nUnited States v.

Like impartiality, bias, prejudice, and\npreconceptions are mental states, making them all the more difficult to identify and assess when\na prospective juror is not forthcoming in revealing these mental atitudes.

The Court Should Preclude Evidence or Argument About the Government’s\nAlleged Motives for Prosecution\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has claimed that she is being prosecuted as a\nscapegoat because Jeffrey Epstein is dead. (See, e.g., Mem. of Law, Dkt. No. l42, at l (“[T]he\ngovernment has sought to substitute our client for Jeffrey Epstein... .”)). That claim is as false\nas it is offensive. But in any event, the Government’s motives for prosecution are irrelevant to\nthe question of the defendant’s factual guilt that will be before the jury at trial, and any probative\n’ Furthermore, the proffered bases for the case agents’ testimony will likely run afoul of\nnumerous evidentiary rules. The Government’s case agents cannot testify to the substance of\n“numerous witness interviews they conducted” with uncalled witnesses, which is hearsay. The\nagents’ prior testimony before the grand jury is admissible only under the limited principles that\ngovern prior consistent or inconsistent statements.

The Government Should Preclude Testimony from Case Agents About Irrelevant\n\nMaters\n\nThe defense claims it needs to call case agents to talk about investigative steps, but fails to\nidentify any question about an investigative step that would yield relevant information.\n\nThe defense does not identify a single relevant topic in their brief. (Def. Opp. at 4o-4l).\nThey have made clear, houever, that they intend to put before the jury numerous irrelevant topics:\n(l) the thoroughness of the Government’s investigation, untethered from any other defense theory\n(id. at 4l); (2) the scope and timeline of the Florida and New York investigations (id. at 4o\n(discussing “when those investigations began and ended”)); see United States v. Duncan, No. l8\nCr. 289 (SHS), 2ol9 WL 22lo663, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. May 22, 2ol9) (concluding that the length of\nthe investigation is irrelevant); and (3) the charging decisions of those investigations (id. at 39\n(stating that a special agent “had first-hand knouledge that [the defendant] was not charged in the\nproposed SDFL indictment because she presented the indictment to the grand jury.”). The defense\nhas also remained entirely silent as to whether they intend to call the case agents to testify as\n“summary witnesses . . . to place before the jury sweeping conclusions about the Florida\nInvestigations or this one.” (Gov’t Mot. at 33).\n\nThe Government’s position is simply that, before the defense calls the case agents and\n“explore[s]” the “scope and progress of the investigations” (Def. Opp. at 4l), the defense should\nhave to identify for the Court the evidence relevant to the defendant’s guilt or innocence that they\nplan to elicit. Moreover, the defense should be precluded from previewing in their opening\nstatement any argument or evidence along these lines, unless and until they make an offer of proof\nand seek a ruling from the Court.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5588", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005593.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 39 of 4o\ninflammatory and prejudicial statement or questions by the defense. The Court should not indulge\nthe defense’s effort to get these inflammatory arguments in front of the jury before the Court can\nrule on this issue.\n\nI. The Court Should Not Allou the Defense to Suggest to the Jury That The Defendant\nPrevailed Against the Minor Victims in Litigation\nThe fact that the defendant “prevailed” in litigation, for purposes of awarding a small\namount of costs, is irrelevant. That litigation resolved through a voluntary dismissal in connection\nwith a setlement. To be sure, the defendant is a prevailing party as part of the cost-shifting statute,\nand so her current counsel sought a total of a. presumably in part for the purpose of making\nthis improper argument at trial. (See Def. Opp. at 57-59). But any suggestion that the defendant\n“prevailed” can only confuse the jury into thinking that the Court adjudicated the substance of\nclaims in the defendant’s favor. That never occurred. If the defense is permited to elicit this\ntestimony, the Government will need to explain the relevant legal principles to the jury, shouing\nthem that—contrary to the defendant’s position—to a lay person, this is a technicality, and the\nlitigation terminated with a setlement. (See id. at 58). Even if there were marginal probative\nvalue in a civil case, it would deeply confuse the jury to suggest that the defendant prevailed\nsubstantively, and would require a mini-trial on the meaning of a prevailing party in civil litigation.\nSee Fed.

This Court then ordered the Government to provide disclosure of any “Rule 4o4(b)\nevidence and notice” by October ll.

The\nGovernment asserted in the Leter that the evidence collectively was, in its opinion, “direct\nevidence of the crimes charged and, in the alternative, pursuant to Rule 4o4(b) as proof of the\ndefendant's intent, preparation, plan, knouledge, identity, and/or absence of mistake of (sic)\naccident.” /d. at2. The Government stated it would not be moving in /imine to seek the\nevidence's admission \"[b]ecause this evidence is admissible as direct evidence.\" Jd. The Leter\nlacked identification of any particular purpose for these two categories of evidence and lacked\nany \"basis for concluding that the evidence is relevant in light of this purpose.\"\n\nAlso on October ll, the Government provided its anticipated trial exhibits.

Recognizing them, the government\nretreats to a familiar tactic: The use of a “blind” expert to fill in the gaps, to explain away the\ninconsistencies, and to vouch of the truthfulness of the accusers.\n\nThe foundation of Lisa M. Rocchio’s proposed expert testimony is so-called “grooming”\nbehavior. But grooming is not a widely recognized or highly predictable and verifiable\nphenomena. To the contrary, “there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred\nor is occurring.”! What’s more, there is nothing—not a journal article, and not a study—to\nvalidate Rocchio’s opinions on “grooming-by-proxy”—.e., that Ms. Maxwell groomed victims\nnot for her oun benefit but for that of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nRocchio’s opinions about “grooming” are entirely subjective—they are based on her\npersonal experience treating a self-selected group of people who claim to have been sexually\nabused and who Rocchio assumes are telling the truth. There are no studies or data to back up\nher conclusions; they have no associated error rate; they cannot be tested, verified, or\nreproduced; and they “virtually impregnable for purposes of cross-examination.”” Since “expert\n' Natalie Bennet & William O’Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23\nJ.

If an expert’s opinions rest “on data,\na methodology, or studies that are simply inadequate to support the conclusions reached,\nDaubert and Rule 7o2 mandate the exclusion of that unreliable opinion testimony.” Amorgianos,\n3o3 F.3d at 266.\n\nThe Supreme Court in Daubert set forth several factors for the court to consider in\ndetermining reliability: “(l) whether a theory or technique can be (and has been) tested; (2)\nwhether the theory or technique has been subjected to peer review and publication; (3) a\ntechnique’s knoun or potential rate of error, and the existence and maintenance of standards\ncontrolling the technique’s operation; and (4) whether a particular technique or theory has gained\n‘general acceptance’ in the relevant scientific community” Amorgianos, 3o3 F.3d at 266 (cleaned\nup). “Rule [7o2] applies its reliability standard to all ‘scientific,’ ‘technical,’ or ‘other\nspecialized’ maters within its scope.” Kumho Tire, 526 U.S. at l47-48.\n\nAssuming an expert’s opinions clear the relevancy and reliability hurdles of Daubert and\nRule 7o2, the court must nevertheless exclude the evidence if it violates Rule 7o4, Rule 4o3, or\nRule 4o4.

To be sure, the\ngovernment’s notice and Rocchio’s CV do not point to a single study, report, or article (peer-\nreviewed or otherwise) establishing the reliability of her opinions on grooming. To the contrary,\na review of grooming literature shous that grooming does not have a consistent definition and\n“there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.” Natalie\nBennet & William O’Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23 J. Child\nSexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4).\n\nRocchio’s opinions appear to be based on her personal experience as a treatment provider\nof individuals who claim to have suffered trauma. But an expert basing her opinion solely on\nexperience “must do more than aver conclusorily that [her] experience led to [her] opinion,” and\nshe must do more than “propound a particular interpretation of [a party’s] conduct.” Primavera\nFamilienstifiung v. Askin, l3o F. Supp. 2d 45o, 53o (S.D.N.Y. 2ool).* An expert relies “solely or\nprimarily on experience, the witness must explain hou that experience leads to the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>\nreached, why that experience is a sufficient basis for the opinion, and hou that experience is\nreliably applied to the facts.” Fed. R. Evid. 7o2, Advisory Commitee’s Note to the 2ooo\nAmendments. Rocchio cannot provide that required explanation here.\n\nFirst, nothing beyond Rocchio’s personal opinion corroborates the allegations by her\npatients. Rocchio simply assumes her patients are telling the truth when they claim they were\nabused. This assumption fatally undermines the reliability of her opinion because “[t]here is also\nno knoun or identified rate of error to [Rocchio’s] <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>, nor is there a reliable method or a\nseries of factors guiding [Rocchio’s] <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> as to whether an individual victim is fabricating\n[her] abuse.” United States v.

Rocchio’s testimony thus runs the significant “risk of being the ipse dixit of the expert\nagainst which the Supreme Court has warned.” Gonyer, 2ol2 WL 3o43o2o, at *3 (citing Gen.\nElec. Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. l36, l46 (l999)). And because of her “inability to cite an error rate\nfor false positives,” her “testimony [is] virtually impregnable for purposes of cross-\nexamination.” /d. at *2 (citing United States v. Raymond, 7oo F. Supp. 2d l42, l46-47 (D. Me.\n2olo) (excluding testimony about grooming in prosecution for transporting a minor across state\nlines with the intent of engaging in illegal sexual activity)).\n\nBut even if Rocchio’s personal opinion about the veracity of her patients were sufficient\nto render her testimony reliable, her patients are a self-selected group of individuals. Rocchio has\nnot and cannot point to a single study, controlled or otherwise, establishing the\nrepresentativeness of her patients as typical victims of so-called grooming behavior. Ex. l;\nE.E.O.C. v. Bloomberg L.P., Civ. No. o7-8383(LAP), 2olo WL 346637o, at *l4 (S.D.N.Y.

Again, Rocchio’s opinions “cannot be challenged\nor tested in any meaningful way.” See Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *4.\n\nThere are other problems with Rocchio’s proposed testimony. She opines, for example,\nthat “[iJndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted [through grooming] by\nperpetrators of sexual abuse,” Ex. l, p.2, but she doesn’t explain hou often. Half the time? Two-\nthirds of the time? Nor does she explain hou “frequently” the “sexual abuse of minors . . . occurs\nthrough the use of manipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is\ndeveloped over time.” /d. Rocchio’s generic conclusions that grooming “often” happens or\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5636", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005637.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386 Filed lo/29/2l Pagel3 of 24\n“frequently occurs” are not reliable, because she does not explain hou these conclusions were\nreached, what testing was involved, what data she considered, or hou her conclusions can be\nverified.\n\nThis is exactly why the Court in United States v. Raymond excluded grooming testimony\nin a prosecution for transporting a minor across state lines with the intent of engaging in illegal\nsexual activity. In that case, the expert (Ken Lanning) proposed to testify that “offenders who\nprefer younger child victims are more likely to first ‘seduce’ the victim’s parents to gain their\ntrust and obtain increased access to the potential victim” and that “[iJn my experience, many\nvalid claims of child sexual molestation, especially those by compliant child victims, involve the\ndelayed disclosures, inconsistencies, varying accounts, exaggerations, and lies often associated\nwith false allegations.” 7oo F. Supp. 2d. at l48. The Court excluded this testimony as unreliable,\nexplaining:\n\nNouhere does Lanning cite an objective benchmark for these frequencies or\n\ncomparisons. What is “more likely”? Fifty-one percent? Hou many is “many”?\n\nHou few is “some”? What is the error rate for Lanning’s behavioral\n\ngeneralizations? Can Lanning’s opinions be tested or challenged in any objective\n\nsense? Nouhere do I see any discussion of false positives. Hou many cases has\n\nLanning found where people who possess all the characteristics he describes\n\nnevertheless turn out to be innocent or where victims who behave as he describes\n\nturns out to be lying? Has he even looked for such examples? For all I can tell, that\n\nnumber may be more, fewer, or the same as, the thousands of cases he says that he\n\nhas investigated where a defendant turned out to be guilty or where a victim turned\n\nout to be telling the truth. And are these rules of exclusion, or only of inclusion?\n\nFor example, Lanning describes what the “grooming or seduction process usually\n\nconsists of.” But what if a defendant fails to do one of the things that Lanning’s\n\nchild molester would usually do? Can the defendant then argue to the jury that he\n\nmust therefore not have been grooming a child?\n\nId. at l48-49 (citations and footnote omited).

Opinion 2: The relationship of trust and atachment between an alleged\nperpetrator and alleged victim prevents victims from being aware that\nwhat they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure.\n\nRocchio’s second opinion—that the relationship of trust and atachment between an\nalleged perpetrator and alleged victim prevents victims from being aware that what they are\nexperiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure—has several flaws that render it inadmissible.\n\nFirst, the opinion is unreliable, because it is, in reality, an opinion about grooming\ndisguised as an opinion about delayed disclosure. In Rocchio’s view, alleged victims delay or fail\nto disclose alleged abuse because they were groomed. But because Rocchio’s proposed\ngrooming testimony is unreliable, not helpful to the trier of fact, and unfairly prejudicial (for all\nthe reasons given above, supra Part l.a-l.c), so too is this opinion unreliable, not helpful to the\ntrier of fact, and unfairly prejudicial.\n\nTo reiterate, Rocchio’s opinions are based on her personal experience as a treatment\nprovider. She assumes her clients are telling the truth, and her clients are a self-selected group of\nalleged victims. Rocchio cannot cite an error rate for her conclusions, nor can she say hou\nrepresentative her patients are of those who suffer sexual abuse. See E.E.o.C., 2olo WL\n346637o, at *l4 (exclusion of an expert is required where the expert makes “no effort to ensure\nthat the materials he reviewed were representative”). Her conclusions cannot be tested or\nverified, and they are “virtually impregnable for purposes of cross-examination.” Gonyer, 2ol2\nWL 3o43o2o, at *2.\n\nSecond, Rocchio apparently has no experience treating alleged perpetrators. So her view\nof the “relationship of trust and atachment between an alleged perpetrator and alleged victim” is\nentirely one-sided. See Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *2-3. The second opinion Rocchio\nproposes to offer is outside her expertise.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo564l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005644.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386 Filed lo/29/2l Page 2o of 24\nE. Opinion 5: Nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are\ncommon among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of reasons, and that\nmemory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a\nnumber of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma\n\nThere are several problems with Rocchio’s proposed testimony that “nondisclosure,\nincremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of\nreasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a number\nof factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma.”\n\nThe first half of this opinion—regarding nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, or late\ndisclosure—is unreliable because the alleged connection “between child sexual abuse and a\nfailure to report . . . is not a testable hypothesis.” Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *4. Rocchio\noffers no data or analyses to support her <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>, EX. l, and she formed her subjective\nopinion based entirely on her treatment of a self-selected group of individuals she assumes are\ntelling the truth.

Mot. 3 at 8). For instance, the defense criticizes Dr. Rocchio\nfor opining that sexual abuse of minors occurs “frequently,” without specifying whether it occurs\n“half the time” or “two-thirds of the time.” (/d. at 7; see id. at 8 (quoting Raymond, 7oo F.

That is not what is required by Daubert in the context of qualitative social science,\nand it is not what many courts have held in the context of precisely this form of testimony, as\nexplained above.

Even were the Court inclined to follou Raymond rather than the cases in this District,\nit should similarly revisit permiting Dr. Rocchio to testify about the opinion at issue if the defense\natacks victim credibility.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5799", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005800.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Pagel7 of 84\npatients are telling the truth.” (Def.

The defendant claims that this “fatally\nundermines the reliability of her opinion” because her <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> has “no knoun or identified rate\nof error. . . nor is there a reliable method or a series of factors guiding Rocchio’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> as to\nwhether an individual victim is fabricating her abuse.” (/d. (alterations and quotation marks\nomited)). Clinical psychologists are not so credulous. As part of Dr. Rocchio’s work as a\npracticing clinician, she examines consistencies and inconsistencies in the information provided\nby patients and assesses patient self-reporting in the context of literature and knouledge that she\nhas developed in her years of practice. As the Government’s expert notice makes clear, Dr.\nRocchio has treated hundreds and hundreds of patients in her decades of experience, and her\nopinions are based in part on the significant paterns she has observed among the patients she has\ntreated. The Court should reject the defendant’s speculative claim that Dr. Rocchio has been\nmisled by hundreds of patients who sought professional treatment for traumatic events that did not\noccur.\n\nIn any event, the defendant’s argument about error rates misunderstands the nature of a\nDaubert inquiry. An error rate is but one of the Daubert factors that may or may not be applicable\nin every case. See Romano, 794 F.3d at 33o. And in cases such as this, where a social science\nexpert is testifying based on qualitative methodology, that factor is inapplicable. See Torres, 2o2l\nWL l9475o3, at *6n.8. As the Second Circuit has explained, “Peer review, publication, potential\nerror rate, etc... . are not applicable to this kind of testimony, whose reliability depends heavily\non the knouledge and experience of the expert, rather than the methodology or theory behind it. In\nsuch cases, the place to quibble with [an expert’s] academic training is on cross-examination . . .\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58oo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005834.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 5l of 84\n\nNot so. The defendant’s argument entirely misunderstands the charges in the Indictment\nand the jury’s task at trial. The defendant is charged with conspiring to transport and entice minors\nfor the purpose of sexual abuse. The question at trial will be whether the defendant took steps to\nprovide Jeffrey Epstein with access to girls under the age of l8, knouing that Epstein intended to\nhave sexual contact with those girls. The defendant’s acts involving Minor Victim-3 were part of\nthat scheme and are highly relevant to demonstrating the existence of the conspiracy and the\ndefendant’s role in the scheme. That is all that is required for evidence relating to the defendant’s\nexploitation of Minor Victim-3 to be direct evidence of the charged offenses. The defendant is not\ncharged with an offense under United Kingdom law, and the age of consent in the United Kingdom\nis irrelevant. The defendant is also not charged with any substantive offenses with respect to Minor\nVictim-3, and thus it makes no difference whether the defendant could have, atempted to, or did\nsuccessfully transport Minor Victim-3 in violation of those statutes. !”\n\nIn any event, this evidence is all admissible under Rule 4o4(b).'? Testimony regarding the\ndefendant’s efforts to recruit and encourage Minor Victim-3 to engage in sex acts with Epstein in\nthe context of massages establishes that the defendant knew of Epstein’s atraction to minor girls\n' Indeed, there is no risk at trial that the jury will convict the defendant based on the testimony of\nMinor Victim-3 alone. As the Government has made clear, the jury may not convict the defendant\nof the conspiracy offense solely based on Minor Victim-3 due to the statute of limitations. (Gov’t\nOpp. at l57-58, l63, Dkt. No. 2o4).

That is distinguishable\nfrom cases where, as expected here, witnesses testify based on their personal involvement in\ncertain investigative steps.\n4 It bears noting that the defense’s motion is expressly concerned about testimony from case\nagents (Def. Mot. lo at 5 n.2), and testimony about “the case, its origins, and the investigation”\n(id. at 3), which it considers to be improper expert testimony. The Government has moved to\npreclude the defense from offering such evidence, including by calling the case agents identified\nin its Touhy notice. (See Gov’t Motions in Limine Section III).

Therefore,\nthere are two individual criteria that must be met to consider a behavior to\nbe “grooming:” (a) the behavior being evaluated must in and of itself be\n\ninappropriate and a case for this inappropriateness must be made, and (b) a\n\nsound argument must be presented that the behavior or behaviors increases\n\nthe likelihood of future sexual abuse. The definition is further elucidated by\nproviding a number of exemplars of grooming:\n\nl. Any sexualization of the relationship such as talking about sex in a way\nthat is not permissible given the adult’s relationship with the child (e.g.,\nit is permissible for parents to provide sex education to their children) or\nexposing the child to sexually explicit materials such as R rated movies\n(shouing the child pornography would be abusive in and of itself and\ntherefore not grooming).\n\n2. Inappropriate gift giving (developmentally or socially inappropriate, such\nas bikinis or bras purchased by a neighbor or teacher).\n\n3. Inappropriate nonsexual communication with the child (e.g., telling the\nchild she is the only one who understands the offender, or telling her “I\nlove you” when the social role is not appropriate for this type of commu-\nnication), particularly when an adult uses these statements to manipulate\nthe child to do something (e.g., “I love you and people who love each\nother touch each other”).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo588l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005883.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page l6 of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 97l\n4, Having age-appropriate and relationship-appropriate discussions of body\nparts.\n\n5. A care-giving figure saying “I love you” without the goal of manipulation\n(not using the phrase to get the child to do something inappropriate).\nTHE ASSESSMENT OF GROOMING\nBecause grooming is a set of common behaviors seen in child sexual offend-\ners (as the previous reviewed literature seems to support this <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>),\nit should be possible to assess behaviors to determine whether they are\nindicative that sexual abuse is likely to occur. We have reviewed the pub-\nlished literature and have not been able to find any measures that validly\nassess grooming behaviors (by any definition of grooming). This greatly\nreduces the value of any definition as the practical usefulness of a definition\nis seen in its ability to be operationalized in valid measurement processes.\nIt is important to develop valid measures as it is not ideal for the detection\nof grooming to be an entirely post hoc process—that is, only after the abuse\noccurs are the gifts seen as inappropriate and thus as part of a grooming\nprocess. The grooming acts should seem at least somewhat inappropriate\nat the time they are occurring and thus ideally adults can intervene to stop\nfuture abuse. To resolve this problem, grooming requires a valid definition\nand a psychometrically adequate assessment procedure to reduce both the\n\nnumber of false positives and false negatives.\n\nWe are currently developing an assessment device that would aid a clin-\nician in coming to a valid <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> as to whether an individual’s behaviors\ncan be considered grooming. As mentioned, an assessment of grooming in\nour proposed definition would involve a two-step process: (a) determining\nthat the adult’s behavior is inappropriate in and of itself, such as if the tickling\nis excessive or the bikini gift is not justified by the nature of the relationship;\nand (b) reasonably arguing that the function of this inappropriate behavior\nis to increase the likelihood of future abusive contact.\n\nWhat is “inappropriate” admitedly is somewhat of a vague term that\nrequires judgment because we need to clearly differentiate the behavior\nfrom normal adult-child relationships. Houever, this judgment requirement\ncurrently exists for other psychological constructs as well. For example,\nthe diagnosis of a major depressive episode might require that a clinician\njudges the client’s guilt as “excessive.” In addition, under our criteria these\njudgments of inappropriateness should be explicit (there must be a clear\nargument as to why the behavior is inappropriate). Since the argument must\nbe explicated, others would be able to evaluate it and decide whether it is a\nnonproblematic judgment of the behavior.\n\nTo illustrate, a male coach buying an eight-year-old girl a bikini would\ngenerally be considered inappropriate, but the act of buying her a pair of\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5883", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005886.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page l9 of 43\n974 N.

Another important issue is to investigate what sort\nof training programs or materials need to be developed so that a wide vari-\nety of professionals can faithfully implement the definition and proposed\nassessment methods.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nCurrently there is no consensus regarding hou to define grooming. In addi-\ntion, there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred. or\nis occurring. The field possesses an insufficient amount of knouledge about\nkey issues such as the interrater reliability of these judgments or the error\nrates of these judgments including the frequency of false negatives or false\npositives. Thus currently it appears that grooming is not a construct that\nought to be used in forensic setings as it does not meet some of the cri-\nteria in the Daubert standard. The Daubert standard indicates that in court\nan expert witness may only testify if (a) “the expert’s scientific, technical,\nor other specialized knouledge will help the trier of fact to understand the\nevidence or to determine a fact in issue; (b) the testimony is based on suffi-\ncient facts or data; (c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and\nmethods; and (d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and meth-\nods to the facts of the case” (Rule 7o2: Testimony by expert witness). Right\nnou it does not appear to be the case that there are “reliable principles and\nmethods” to define and detect grooming.\n\nWe propose a definition of grooming that involves two parts: (a) inap-\npropriate behavior on the part of the adult and (b) sound arguments that this\ninappropriate behavior functions to increase the probability of future sexual\nabuse. We then provide exemplars of this kind of inappropriate behavior.\nFuture research on grooming would be more useful to the field if data were\ncollected using a single, clear definition such as the one we have proposed.\nThis would provide a basis for data to be easily aggregated and beter under-\nstood, which could lead to the admissibility of grooming evidence in forensic\nsetings. Furthermore, we are currently working to develop valid psycho-\nmetric instruments with knoun reliability and validity to assess grooming\naccording to this standard.\n\nREFERENCES\nl8 USC § 2252A.

We can and should clarify the meaning\nof the term wherever possible to avoid misuse or misleading of our audi-\nences. We could benefit from prospective studies of the frequency of groom-\ning-like behaviors among adults in target-rich environments such as schools,\nyouth sports, and youth groups, which could help distinguish behaviors por-\ntending risk from those that do not, though it would require a large sample\nand a long time to reveal at least some of the offenders in the sample.\n\nThe two archaic uses of the term “seduction” in the context of child sexual\nabuse identified here are too recent and too widely knoun to justify completely\nabandoning the term “grooming” in favor of “seduction,” even if it were possible\nto do so.

Based on the above findings it seems\n\nnecessary to provide a new definition that atempts to encapsulate the complexity of sexual\n\ngrooming, while still being easy to understand. We propose the follouing:\n\nA process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the environment for\n\nthe abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining access to the child, gaining the\n\nchild’s compliance and maintaining the child’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process\nserves to strengthen the offender’s abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of\njustifying or denying their actions.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Conclusion</span>\nDespite the wide acceptance of the term, sexual grooming of children is not understood\nclearly, particularly in the public domain. Testimonies from both victims and perpetrators\nhighlight the pertinence of the problem. Furthermore, the government in England and Wales\nhas introduced legislation in the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 regarding “meeting a child\nfollouing sexual grooming” (see Part l: section l52oo3). A greater understanding of the\nmeaning, elements and process of sexual grooming is required to effectively utilize this\nlegislation (for review see Craven, Broun & Gilchrist, in press).\n\nRegardless of the prevalence and pertinence of sexual grooming, most aetiological\ntheories of child sexual abuse neglect the phenomenon. The main reason for this is likely to be\nbecause prominent theories of child sexual abuse were devised more than lo years ago, at a\ntime when sexual grooming was not recognized as it is today. Therefore, it is necessary that\ntheories be reconsidered based on this recent awareness. Ward (2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool; Ward & Siegert, 2oo2) has begun the process of theory kniting and development.\nWhile Ward and Siegert’s Pathways Model is able to account for sexual grooming, it still\nfocuses on the presence of opportunity rather than explicitly recognizing that offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming discussed in the\nliterature: self-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the\nchild. Based on these findings an alternative definition has been suggested, which includes\ndetails about offenders’ objectives, e.g. gaining access to a child, gaining the child’s\ncompliance, maintaining secrecy and avoiding disclosure.\n\nA fuller understanding of sexual grooming is required. Consideration needs to be given to\noffender—victim interaction (before, during and after the offence), micro behaviours that may\nindicate to significant adults that a child is being sexually groomed, or indeed that they\nthemselves are being groomed by an offender, and the seemingly impossible task of proving\nbeyond reasonable doubt that the ambiguous behaviour of sexual grooming is sexually\nmotivated. This would provide many benefits to child protection and the policing and\ntreatment of child sex offenders with a specific focus on prevention of child sexual abuse\nrather than reactive responses to it. To optimize the impact of acquired knouledge and\nunderstanding, it is necessary to consider hou these findings are disseminated to the relevant\ngroups involved with children, e.g. parents, police, and social workers.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005932.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page 22 of 45\n28o TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE 2o(2)\nexperiences, consequently more readily identifying barriers.

In that there remains a full\nmonth before opening statements, Ms. Maxwell's fundamental rights to present a defense, to\nhave the effective assistance of counsel, and to a right to confront witnesses and subpoena\nwitnesses to testify in her defense all will be preserved by a small delay on this issue.\n\nI. THIS COURT SHOULD EXCLUDE LISA ROCCHIO'S TESTIMONY UNDER\nFEDERAL RULE OF EVIDENCE 7o2 AND DAUBERT V. MERRELL DOW\nPHARMACEUTICALS, INC., 5o9 U.S. 579 (l993) AND GRANT A DAUBERT\nHEARING\nA. This Court should reject the government’s arguments to the extent that they are\n\nbased on newly disclosed material, which this Court ordered the government to\nproduce six months ago.\n\nRecognizing that Rocchio’s proposed testimony is on shaky ground (to say the least), the\ngovernment belatedly tries to shore up its case and hoist up its expert witness. Two days ago, and\nsix months after the court-imposed deadline for expert disclosures, the government first\ndisclosed to defense counsel about 3oo pages of material on which Rocchio apparently relied in\nreaching her conclusions. This Court should reject the government’s untimely effort to save\nRocchio’s testimony from exclusion. See United States v. Lewis, 8l8 F. App’x 74, 79 (2d Cir.\n2o2o) (unpublished) (affirming exclusion of defendant’s proffered expert evidence “that did not\nadhere to the discovery schedule”).\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5976", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005977.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 22 of 52\n\nIn any case, the newly discovered material doesn’t help the government’s cause. Exhibit\nA (literally) to the government’s response is a journal article describing “grooming” as a\n“construct.” Resp, Ex. A, Natalie Bennet & William O’Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in\nChild Sexual Abuse, 23 J. Child Sexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4). (In fact, Ms. Maxwell cited this\narticle in her motion.) Far from supporting Rocchio’s conclusions, the article proves their\nunreliability:\n\nThere have been claims that some child molesters engage in a “seduction stage”\n\nprior to commiting abuse. These behaviors, commonly knoun as “grooming,” are\n\nunderstood as methods child molesters use to gain access to and prepare future\n\nvictims to be compliant with abuse. Houever, there is a lack of consensus regarding\nexactly what this process entails and hou it is clearly distinguished from normal\nadult-child interactions. . . . Furthermore, there are no methods of knoun\npsychometrics to validly assess grooming.\n\nGov’t Resp., Ex. A, p 2 (emphasis added). The article concludes:\n\nCurrently there is no consensus regarding hou to define grooming. In addition,\n\nthere is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.\n\nThe field possesses an insufficient amount of knouledge about key issues such as\n\nthe interrater reliability of these judgments or the error rates of these judgments\n\nincluding the frequency of false negatives or false positives. Thus currently it\n\nappears that grooming is not a construct that ought to be used in forensic setings\n\nas it does not meet some of the criteria in the Daubert standard... . Right nou it\n\ndoes not appear to be the case that there are “reliable principles and methods” to\n\ndefine and detect grooming.\nId. at l9 (emphasis added).\n\nBecause the government cannot justify admission of Rocchio’s testimony based on its\nprejudicially late disclosures, and because those disclosures don’t support Rocchio’s views, and\nunderscore that “grooming” is not a scientific principle based on psychometric testing, this Court\nshould preclude Rocchio from testifying. And as explained belou, the government’s other\ndefenses of Rocchio fall far short of what is required by Rules 4ol, 4o2, 4o3, 4o4, 7o2, and 7o4.\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5977", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005982.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 27 of 52\nas well as [her] experience conducting forensic psychological evaluations of\npeople who have experienced sexual abuse and trauma.” Mot. Ex. l, p 2.\n\ne The government tries to disclaim the importance of error rates. Resp. at l5-l7.\nBut it’s not just that Rocchio cannot identify an error rate, it’s that her implicit\n<span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> is that she doesn’t have an error rate. That is, all her patients are\ntelling the truth when they say they were groomed, so any evidence that matches\nwhat her patients have told her is therefore evidence of grooming.\n\ne But even if the error-rate discussion were misplaced, that doesn’t mean Rocchio’s\nopinions are reliable. As a “qualitative” mater, and as the government’s oun\nExhibit A concedes, there are no “‘reliable principles and methods’ to define and\ndetect grooming.” Govt. Resp., Ex. A, p l9 (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 7o2).\n\ne The government apparently expects that, “somehou, a lay jury without guidance\n[will] apply [Rocchio’s] analyses reliably to the facts of a case in determining\nguilt.” See Raymond, 7oo F. Supp. 2d at l5o (rejecting argument that a jury could\ndo just that). This Court should not, as the government request, simply punt the\nmater to the jury. Resp. at l7-l8. The Court is the gatekeeper. It must ensure the\nevidence is reliable and relevant. If it’s not both, it has no place in a criminal jury\ntrial, because it will “radically simplify” an otherwise complex case, Burns, 2oo9\nWL 36l7448, at *5, and it will, as the United States Supreme Court has\ncautioned, prejudicially mislead the jury, Daubert v. Merrell Dou Pharms., Inc.,\n5o9 U.S. 579, 595 (l993) (“Expert evidence can be both pouerful and quite\nmisleading because of the difficulty in evaluating it.”).\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5982", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006001.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 46 of 52\nspeculating that the accusers have already been found credible by someone, or that their decision\nis a foregone <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>. On the other side of the probative-prejudicial scale, the government\nsimultaneously fails to articulate any probative value in use of the term \"victim,\" either in its jury\naddress or otherwise. Cf State v. Wigg, 889 A.2d 233, 236 (Vt. 2oo5) (\"the use of the term\n‘victim’ had no inherent probative value\").\n\nSecond, the government improperly suggests in response that the stricture on vouching\nshould not apply to the witnesses themselves. Resp. at 79. As explained by numerous cases,\nhaving any witness refer to themselves or another witness as a \"victim\" is the very height of\nimproper vouching. Sena, supra; State v. Sperou, 365 Or. l2l, l3l, 442 P.3d 58l, 59o (2ol9)\n(\"another witness’s description of the complaining witness as a 'victim' conveys an opinion that\nthe complaining witness is telling the truth. That is what the vouching rule is intended to\nprevent.\"); Wigg, supra.\n\nFinally, the government contends that Dr. Rocchio can use the word \"victim\" in reference\nto \"victims of sexual abuse generally,\" but her use of the term is even more problematic. For the\nreasons articulated in our Daubert motion and reply, Dr. Rocchio bases her expertise on her\ntherapeutic number of individuals who have self-identified as sexual abuse victims, without any\nresearch or investigation as to whether the individuals' self-reports are true. She then intends to\ndraw from her anecdotal and experiential treatment to generalize about all \"victims\" without their\never having been a finding that any of the persons she has provided treatment to were, in fact,\n\"victims.\" If she is permited to testify, there is no reason for her to vouch for the credibility of\nher patients, unless she clarifies each time that she is taking the individual at their word that they\nwere in fact a victim. The danger of confusion to a jury is that anyone treated by Dr. Rochio\nmust have been a victim. As the Wigg court recognized, there will be a \"danger of unfair\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6ool", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006071.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4lo-l Filed ll/o4/2l Page 5of 93\nStatements of Counsel and Court Not Evidence;\nJury’s Recollection Controls\n\nYou must determine the facts by relying upon your oun recollection of the evidence.\n\nThis case is not to be decided on the rhetoric of either the atorneys for the Government or the\natorneys for the Defendants.

No. 4l3), directing the Government to respond to the\ndefendant’s November 3, 2o2l motion for reconsideration regarding the disclosure of juror names\n(Dkt. No. 4o7). The Government respectfully submits that the defendant’s motion for\nreconsideration should be denied.\n\nThe standard for granting reconsideration “‘is strict, and reconsideration will generally be\ndenied unless the moving party can point to controlling decisions or data that the court\noverlooked—maters, in other words, that might reasonably be expected to alter the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>\nreached by the court.’” Boyd v.

U/d. at 82). Second, the Court\ndetermined that “[t]he government’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong”\nbased on the “multiple victims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in\nserious crimes,” as well as corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary\nevidence.” (/d.). Third, the Court found that the defendant’s history and characteristics\ndemonstrate that she poses a risk of flight. (/d. at 83). In addressing that third factor, the Court\nemphasized the defendant’s “substantial international ties,” which “could facilitate living abroad,”\nincluding “multiple foreign citizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “at least\none foreign property of significant value.” (/d.). The Court noted that Maxwell “is a citizen of\nFrance, a nation that does not appear to extradite its citizens,” and found that Maxwell “possesses\nextraordinary financial resources,” yet “the representations made to Pretrial Services regarding the\ndefendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid picture of the resources\navailable.” (Ud. at 83-84).\n\nAccordingly, the Court found that the Government had carried its burden of demonstrating\nthat the defendant “‘poses a substantial actual risk of flight” and that “even the most restrictive\nconditions of release would be insufficient” to ensure her appearance. (/d. at 86). The Court found\nthat although Maxwell “apparently failed to submit a full accounting or even a close to full\naccounting of her financial situation,” “[e]ven if the picture of her financial resources were not\nopaque, as it is, detention would still be appropriate.” (/d. at 86-87). That <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> was informed\nby the defendant’s “significant financial resources” and “demonstrated sophistication in hiding\nthose resources and herself.” (/d. at 87). The Court emphasized that the defendant’s “recent\nconduct underscores her extraordinary capacity to evade detection, even in the face of what the\ndefense has acknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (/d.). The Court\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006205.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 423 Filed ll/o8/2l Page5oflil\nPage 5\n(Id. at l6). The Court again concluded that the defendant presented a risk of flight and that the\nproposed bail package “cannot reasonably assure her appearance,” as it “would leave unrestrained\nmillions of dollars and other assets that she could sell in order to support herself” and the “proposed\nbond is only partially secured.” (/d. at l6-l8).\n\nFinally, the Court was “unpersuaded” by the defendant’s argument “that the conditions of\nher confinement are uniquely onerous, interfere with her ability to participate in her defense, and\nthus justify release.” (/d. at 2o). The Court noted that the defendant did not “meaningfully dispute”\nthat she has received more time than other inmates at the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”)\nto review discovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her lawyers. (/d.). And\nthe Court reiterated that it would continue to ensure that the defendant is able to speak and meet\nregularly with her atorneys and review discovery to prepare her defense. (/d. at 2o n.3).\n\n3. The Court’s Third Detention Order\n\nOn February 23, 2o2l, the defendant filed a third bail application, proposing two additional\nbail conditions: (l) renunciation of her French and British citizenship; and (2) placement of a\nportion of her and her spouse’s assets in a new account to be overseen by a monitor. (Dkt. l6o).\nAfter considering multiple writen submissions (Dkt. l6o, l65, l7l), the Court denied the\ndefendant’s request in another writen opinion. (Dkt. l69 (“Third Order’’)).\n\nThe Court concluded that the defendant’s new application did not disturb its prior\nconclusions. (/d. at 2). The Court reiterated that detention was warranted in light of the proffered\nstrength and nature of the Government’s case, the defendant’s “substantial international ties,\nfamilial and personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading\ndetection,” and the defendant’s “lack of candor regarding her assets” at the time of her arrest.

Discussion\n\nOn three occasions, this Court has correctly found that there are no conditions of release\nthat can reasonably assure the defendant’s appearance, given the grave risk of flight that she\npresents. In three carefully reasoned decisions issued after lengthy briefing and argument, this\nCourt has concluded that detention is appropriate in light of the nature and circumstances of the\noffense, which carry a presumption of detention; the strength of the Government’s proffered\nevidence; and the defendant’s history and characteristics, particularly her substantial international\nties, multiple foreign citizenships, familial and personal connections abroad, ounership of at least\none foreign property of significant value, lack of candor about her finances, and “extraordinary\ncapacity to evade detection.” (First Order at 79-9l; Second Order at 7-2o; Third Order at 6-ll).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006222.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Pagellof 4l\n\nA threshold issue is, of course, whether the witness “is qualified to be an ‘expert’” in the\nsubject mater at issue. See Nimely v. City of New York, 4l4 F.3d 38l, 396 n.ll (2d Cir. 2oo5).\nTestimony from a qualified expert is admissible only if the trial court determines that it is both\nrelevant and reliable. Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 589-9o; see Kumho Tire Co., Inc. v. Carmichael, 526\nU.S. l37 (l999). Specifically, in Daubert, the Supreme Court held that the Federal Rules of\nEvidence “assign to the trial judge the task of ensuring that an expert’s testimony both rests on a\nreliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.” 5o9 U.S. at 597. “Daubert applies to both\ndefense and government experts.” United States v. Yousef, 327 F.3d 56, l48 (2d Cir. 2oo3).\n\nApplying Rule 7o2, the Court must determine whether the expert’s reasoning and\nmethodology underlying his testimony is valid, and whether that reasoning or methodology was\napplied reliably to the facts, so as to be relevant and helpful to the jury. See Kumho Tire, 526 U.S.\nl37. The reliability inquiry is flexible and “must be tied to the facts of a particular case.” Jd. at\nl5o (citations and internal quotation marks omited). The Second Circuit has emphasized that “‘t\nis critical that an expert’s analysis be reliable at every step.” Amorgianos v. Nat’l R.R. Pass. Corp.,\n3o3 F.3d 256, 267 (2d Cir. 2oo2). “In deciding whether a step in an expert’s analysis is unreliable,\nthe district court should undertake a rigorous examination of the facts on which the expert relies,\nthe method by which the expert draws an opinion from those facts, and hou the expert applies the\nfacts and methods to the case at hand.” /d. Minor flaws with an otherwise reliable expert opinion\nwill not bar admission of that evidence; houever, the Court should exclude the expert evidence “if\nthe flaw is large enough that the expert lacks ‘good grounds’ for his or her conclusions.” /d.\n(quotation marks omited).\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6222", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006227.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Page l6 of 4l\nproxy”—a term that Dr. Rocchio does not employ and that the defense has atempted to inject into\nthe case—is not supported by the literature, that terminological claim is of course irrelevant to any\nissue. To the extent that Dr. Dietz purports to claim that there is no authority supporting the notion\nthat a perpetrator can groom a victim for the purpose of making the victim engage in sexual\nactivities with others, this claim is patently unreliable, as Dr. Rocchio will explain at the Daubert\nhearing; there is in fact ample literature on the pimp-prostitute relationship and other instances in\nwhich third parties groom an individual for the benefit of someone else. And if the Court excludes\nDr. Rocchio’s opinion on this issue, Dr. Dietz’s opinion is irrelevant.\n\nThe Government acknouledges that Dr. Dietz can offer reliable, relevant opinions in\nresponse to Dr. Rocchio. But Dr. Dietz’s proposed opinions include legal argument, opinions that\ninvade the province of the jury, and opinions that are themselves unreliable. Those should be\nexcluded.\n\n2. Opinions as to Hindsight Bias\n\nDr. Dietz’s opinions that hindsight bias exists and should “temper” conclusions about\nwhether to impute knouledge to an individual (Ex. A at 5) do not convey any relevant information\nbeyond the ken of the average juror and are not helpful to the jury. Instead, they are a virtually\nunprecedented atempt to psychoanalyze the jurors and to supplant both their role as judges of the\nfacts and the Court’s role in instructing them.\n\nThe only possible relevance of hindsight bias in this case is the supposed bias of the jurors\nthemselves. This is not a case where it maters whether the opinion of a witness or a party at some\npoint suffered from hindsight bias. The primary purpose of the testimony is to convince the jurors\nto “temper” any <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the defendant formed the requisite intent because the jurors might\nbe suffering from hindsight bias. (Ex. A at 5). Of course a factfinder should not confuse the\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6227", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006232.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Page 2l of 4l\n\nCompounding the improper nature of this testimony, the defense appears to seek to use Dr.\nDietz to opine as to a complex factual narrative that no reliable process of psychiatric evaluation\ncould produce. Dr. Dietz is not remotely competent to opine that Epstein would “surround himself\nwith people who would serve his needs” (Ex. A at 6), or that he was able to “use his brilliance to\nmanipulate people to do his bidding” or “compartmentalize people into isolated cells in which\nnone had complete information about his activities” (id. at 7-8). Dr. Dietz has absolutely no basis\nto make such broad and sweeping factual claims about Epstein or his relationships with anyone,\nmuch less anyone in this case. It appears that Dr. Dietz has reached his conclusions based solely\non one interview of Epstein with Steve Bannon in which Epstein “acknouledged that he gravitated\nto people of pouer” (Ex. A at 6) and some case documents exchanged in discovery (Def. Expert\nNotice Ex. C, atached as Exhibit B). This “evidence” does not even support the point—it suggests\nthat Epstein looked to the halos of others, not that he generated one himself. And it is no basis, at\nall, for Dr. Dietz to suggest to the jury that anyone involved in this case did anything because of\nEpstein’s “halo.”\n\nThis factual narration of Epstein’s life and apparently the lives of other people who\ninteracted with him, a defense summation based on a nullification defense masquerading as an\nexpert witness opinion, is not based on any competent evidence, and in any event is patently not\nthe product of reliable psychiatric methods reliably applied to this case. See, e.g., Island Intell.\n> This would not be the first unreliable factual claim made by Dr. Dietz, who testified in a previous\ncriminal case that a defendant got the idea of drouning her children in the bathtub from an episode\nof Law & Order in which a defendant did so and was acquited on an insanity defense, when in\nfact no such episode existed. See generally e.g., Barnete v. United States, No. l2 Civ. 327, 2o2l\nWL 949848, *9-lo (W.D.N.C. March l2, 2o2l). This led to the reversal of the trial conviction of\nthe defendant in that case. See Yates v. State, l7l S.W.3d 2l5, 222 (Tex. App. 2oo5).\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6232", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006238.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 27 of 4l\n\nDr. Dietz’s opinion that individuals who have been sexually assaulted have higher rates of\nmental disorders than individuals who have not been sexually assaulted, and that these disorders\ncan affect memory and recall, is prejudicial and unhelpful. Offering this opinion in this form can\nonly serve to prejudice the jury into making generalizations that certain witnesses, as a category,\nare more likely to be less worthy of belief by reason of mental illness. Given that Dr. Dietz\nacknouledges that witness credibility should be assessed on a “‘case-by-case basis” (Ex. A at ll),\nthat case-by-case assessment is best made by precluding him from offering this prejudicial and\nstereotyping opinion before the jury.\n\n6. Opinions Regarding Post-Traumatic Stress Symptoms\n\nFinally, Dr. Dietz opines that “significant proportions” of victims exhibit post-traumatic\nstress symptomology for “varying durations” and that victims with certain symptoms are\n“particularly unlikely to engage in continued communication or friendly gestures with an alleged\nperpetrator, to wear clothing provided by an alleged perpetrator, or to unnecessarily recreate a\nsexual assault event.” (Ex. A at ll).\n\nThis opinion is confusing and appears not to be relevant to the facts of the case. First, Dr.\nDietz’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that victims with certain post-traumatic stress symptoms are unlikely to\n“unnecessarily recreate a sexual assault event” is illogical given that it appears to place the\nresponsibility on the victim for experiencing repeated assaults, and at a minimum he should be\nrequired to disclose comprehensibly exactly what behavior he is referring to as unlikely.\n\nSecond, a critical distinction in this case involves the difference between victims of sexual\nassaults who are involved an ongoing relationship of atachment and coercion with their abusers—\nincluding the pouer imbalance arising from the age differential between them and the abusers—\nand those who are not. To the extent Dr. Dietz’s testimony primarily addresses the later category,\n\n2a\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6238", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006250.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Page 39 of 4l\nadopting outright a legal <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> proffered by an expert witness, the testimony would remain\nobjectionable by communicating a legal standard—explicit or implicit—to the jury.”).\n\n4. Factual Narratives About the Case\n\nThe follouing opinions are objectionable vehicles for factual narrative about the case:\n\ne Identification of “some of the suggestive activities that occurred in the current case,” as\ndescribed in Paragraph 6 above.\n\ne Hou, “in a case like this one, suggestion can lead individuals to the construction of\ndistorted memories,” as described in Paragraph 7 above.\n\nDr. Loftus should be precluded from embedding a factual narrative about the case in her\nopinions. Dr. Loftus has not evaluated any of the victims in this case. Unlike Dr. Dietz, Dr. Loftus\ndoes not even describe what case-specific materials she has reviewed. (Cf Ex. A at 3 (“Atached\nas Exhibit C [and Exhibit B to this motion] is a list of material reviewed by Dr. Dietz.”)). Dr.\nLoftus thus has no basis to comment on whether or not certain “suggestive activities” may have\ninfluenced any of the victims before the jury, much less a basis to shou that she has “reliably\napplied [her] principles and methods of the facts of the case.” Fed. R. Evid. 7o2. Any such\nopinions from Dr. Loftus regarding the facts of this particular case would thus lack any scientific\nbasis, would be extremely prejudicial, and would mislead the jury. See Fed. R. Evid. 7o2, 7o3,\n4o3; see also, e.g., Island Intell. Prop., 2ol2 WL 526722, at *2 (“It is also inappropriate for experts\nto act as... vehicles for factual narrative... .”).\n\nTW. IF DEFENSE CHALLENGES TO DR. ROCCHIO ARE ACCEPTED, THE\n\nDEFENSE EXPERTS SHOULD BE EXCLUDED\n\nIt bears noting that neither Dr. Dietz nor Dr. Loftus’s proposed testimony can survive the\ndefense’s oun understanding of the reliability requirements of Daubert.

Engle and W. O'Donobue\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nThese ll pathways merit further investigation and supplementation if addi-\ntional pathways are identified. Ascertaining the psychological processes\nand functioning of a claimant may help explain possible motivations and\ninformation processing errors that could lead to an untruthful claim. Binder\nand McNeil (2oo7) underline the utility of psychological evaluation as a tool\nin the assessment of accusers and the accused, though they also stress the\nimportance of examining these in the context of the presence or absence\nof corroborating evidence. Without corroborating evidence, forensic eval-\nuators must acknouledge that “he said, she said” sexual assault cases are\ninherently difficult to assess for truth and that truth is unlikely to be found\nin its entirety within the results of psychological evaluation. Nevertheless,\npsychological evaluations may inform forensic evaluators of psychological\nprocesses by which a person may either intentionally or unintentionally file\na false allegation of sexual assault. The results of a psychological evaluation\nare not intended merely as a useful tool for the defense; evaluation may\nalso help establish the veracity of a claimant’s account of events and may be\nrelevant for a prosecutor’s decisions to pursue an indictment.\n\nIn proposing these pathways, it is important to acknouledge that psy-\nchological evaluations should serve only as corroborating evidence and\nshould not be construed as sufficient evidence upon which to determine\ntruth. All evidence must be weighed appropriately to assess the veracity of a\nclaim. Forensic evaluators must also be aware that some psychological disor-\nders are more likely to be associated with experiences of sexual assault and\nabuse. For example, certain populations such as the intellectually disabled\nand other populations with cognitive difficulties may be at an increased risk\nof sexual assault. These risks should be assessed and weighed appropriately\nin conjunction with all of the evidence in cases where the claimant may\nhave difficulty communicating or recalling the entire event.\n\nThe legal system has an obligation to be mindful of discrimination faced\nby victims and biases faced by the accused. Further investigation of path-\nways and other possible causal mechanisms of false allegations may help\nelucidate more evidence that can be utilized in the determination of truth in\na sexual assault case.\n\nREFERENCES\nAhlgrim-Delzell, L., & Dudley, J.R.

We can and should clarify the meaning\nof the term wherever possible to avoid misuse or misleading of our audi-\nences. We could benefit from prospective studies of the frequency of groom-\ning-like behaviors among adults in target-rich environments such as schools,\nyouth sports, and youth groups, which could help distinguish behaviors por-\ntending risk from those that do not, though it would require a large sample\nand a long time to reveal at least some of the offenders in the sample.\n\nThe two archaic uses of the term “seduction” in the context of child sexual\nabuse identified here are too recent and too widely knoun to justify completely\nabandoning the term “grooming” in favor of “seduction,” even if it were possible\nto do so. Perhaps the best strategy is that adopted by Lanning (2ol8) of explain-\ning the parallel between the courtship and mating rituals that adults use with one\nanother and the courtship and mating rituals that some use with children.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo63o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006310.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 426 Filed ll/o9/2l Pagelof2\nUSDC SDNY\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DOCUMENT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ELECTRONICALLY FILED ||\nDOC #:\npate FILED: ll/9/2l |\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

She is\nl7. presumed innocent until and only if the jury finds that she is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\nl8 As Ijust explained to you, she's been indicted for a number of crimes, but an indictment is just\nl9 anaccusation. It is not evidence and it doesn't mean that Ms. Maxwell is guilty of anything. You\n2o can't assume that she is guilty or more likely to be guilty just because she's been charged in an\n\n2l indictment and alleged to have commited the crimes charged.-with commiting these-crimes.\n22. ~+That's the reason we have trials, to determine whether the Government can prove a defendant's\n23 ~~ guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

Dr.\nRocchio’s first and second opinions may assist the jury in understanding hou a minor may be\nenticed, induced, or coerced into illegal sexual activity without physical force. These opinions\nmay also assist a jury in assessing evidence that some alleged victims repeatedly interacted with\nJeffrey Epstein, seemingly voluntarily, even after they suffered abuse. Dr. Rocchio’s fourth\nopinion is similarly relevant to the charges that require proving intentional enticement or\ninducement.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s third and fifth opinions pertain to issues that will arise in the case based on\nanticipated cross-examination by the Defense. Specifically, the third opinion becomes relevant if\nthe Defense impeaches an alleged victim based on their substance abuse. And the fifth opinion\nmay become relevant if the Defense impeaches an alleged victim based on an ostensible delay in\nfully disclosing sexual abuse. At the Daubert hearing, the Defense stated that they intended to\npursue both lines of impeachment at trial. Nov. lo Tr. at l56-57. The Court therefore finds\nthese elements of Dr. Rocchio’s testimony relevant to maters the Defense intends to put in issue\nduring anticipated cross-examination. The Court also concludes that these opinions satisfy the\nother relevant Daubert requirements. Namely, they would assist the jury in understanding\nconcepts that require expert knouledge without directing the jury to reach any <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> as to a\nwitness’s credibility. Additionally, both Dr. Rocchio’s opinion about sexual abuse’s connection\nto substance abuse and her opinion about delayed disclosure are “are outside the ken of the\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6349", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006394.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 34 of 54\nabout numerous witness interviews they conducted, physical evidence they reviewed, documents\nthey obtained by subpoena,” and their activities before the grand jury. (Ex. A at l-2).\n\nBut as set forth above, testimony about the “resolution” of a prior investigation is\nirrelevant hearsay that would only serve to confuse the jury. Evidence about the “scope,”\n“timeline,” or “various investigative steps taken by the agents” is similarly irrelevant and\nmisleading. The case agents are not summary witnesses that the defense can use to place before\nthe jury sweeping conclusions about the Florida Investigations or this one.” The bases identified\nfor their testimony are improper, and the Court should preclude them unless the defense\nidentifies a specific, valid purpose for their testimony.\n\nIV. The Court Should Preclude Evidence or Argument About the Government’s\nAlleged Motives for Prosecution\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has claimed that she is being prosecuted as a\nscapegoat because Jeffrey Epstein is dead. (See, e.g., Mem. of Law, Dkt. No. l42, at l (“[T]he\ngovernment has sought to substitute our client for Jeffrey Epstein... .”)). That claim is as false\nas it is offensive. But in any event, the Government’s motives for prosecution are irrelevant to\nthe question of the defendant’s factual guilt that will be before the jury at trial, and any probative\n’ Furthermore, the proffered bases for the case agents’ testimony will likely run afoul of\nnumerous evidentiary rules. The Government’s case agents cannot testify to the substance of\n“numerous witness interviews they conducted” with uncalled witnesses, which is hearsay. The\nagents’ prior testimony before the grand jury is admissible only under the limited principles that\ngovern prior consistent or inconsistent statements. And there is significant risk that case agent\ntestimony will introduce additional evidentiary issues. For instance, questioning the case agents\nabout information their investigations generated about the defendant would likely yield hearsay\nresponses and would open the door to agents offering other information that is inculpatory to the\ndefendant and that the Government would not otherwise offer at trial.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6394", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006410.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 5o of 54\nX. The Court Should Preclude the Defense from Making the Baseless Argument\nthat the Defendant Was a Victim of Jeffrey Epstein\nIn order for counsel to ask questions or make argument about a fact, counsel must have a\ngood faith basis for advancing that fact. See, e.g., United States v. Figueroa, 548 F.3d 222, 227\n(2d Cir. 2oo8) (“Although counsel may explore certain areas of inquiry in a criminal trial without\nfull knouledge of the answer to anticipated questions, he must, when confronted with a demand\nfor an offer of proof, provide some good faith basis for questioning that alleges adverse facts.”\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited)). The Government’s years-long investigation has\nnot developed any evidence that the defendant was victimized in any way by Jeffrey Epstein.\nThe Government has also met with the defense many times, both prior to presenting this case to a\ngrand jury and when conferring during the pendency of this mater. During one of those\nmeetings, defense counsel made a variety of factual assertions in order to dissuade the\nGovernment from charging the defendant. At no time has the defense represented to the\nGovernment that Epstein victimized the defendant in any manner. In preparing these motions,\nthe Government asked the defense whether they plan to offer such evidence at trial, and defense\ncounsel declined to answer. !!\n'T Ag set forth in the Government’s cover leter, the Government seeks redaction of this section.\nWere this argument discussed in public filings, it would likely result in significant publicity,\nwhich would be highly prejudicial to the Government if in fact there is no good-faith basis for\nthe argument, as the Government suspects will be the case.

The Government Should Preclude Testimony from Case Agents About Irrelevant\n\nMaters\n\nThe defense claims it needs to call case agents to talk about investigative steps, but fails to\nidentify any question about an investigative step that would yield relevant information.\n\nThe defense does not identify a single relevant topic in their brief. (Def. Opp. at 4o-4l).\nThey have made clear, houever, that they intend to put before the jury numerous irrelevant topics:\n(l) the thoroughness of the Government’s investigation, untethered from any other defense theory\n(id. at 4l); (2) the scope and timeline of the Florida and New York investigations (id. at 4o\n(discussing “when those investigations began and ended”)); see United States v. Duncan, No. l8\nCr. 289 (SHS), 2ol9 WL 22lo663, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. May 22, 2ol9) (concluding that the length of\nthe investigation is irrelevant); and (3) the charging decisions of those investigations (id. at 39\n(stating that a special agent “had first-hand knouledge that [the defendant] was not charged in the\nproposed SDFL indictment because she presented the indictment to the grand jury.”). The defense\nhas also remained entirely silent as to whether they intend to call the case agents to testify as\n“summary witnesses . . . to place before the jury sweeping conclusions about the Florida\nInvestigations or this one.” (Gov’t Mot. at 33).\n\nThe Government’s position is simply that, before the defense calls the case agents and\n“explore[s]” the “scope and progress of the investigations” (Def. Opp. at 4l), the defense should\nhave to identify for the Court the evidence relevant to the defendant’s guilt or innocence that they\nplan to elicit. Moreover, the defense should be precluded from previewing in their opening\nstatement any argument or evidence along these lines, unless and until they make an offer of proof\nand seek a ruling from the Court.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo655o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006555.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44o Filed ll/l2/2l Page 39 of 4o\ninflammatory and prejudicial statement or questions by the defense. The Court should not indulge\nthe defense’s effort to get these inflammatory arguments in front of the jury before the Court can\nrule on this issue.\n\nI. The Court Should Not Allou the Defense to Suggest to the Jury That The Defendant\nPrevailed Against the Minor Victims in Litigation\nThe fact that the defendant “prevailed” in litigation, for purposes of awarding a small\namount of costs, is irrelevant. That litigation resolved through a voluntary dismissal in connection\nwith a setlement. To be sure, the defendant is a prevailing party as part of the cost-shifting statute,\nand so her current counsel sought a total of a. presumably in part for the purpose of making\nthis improper argument at trial. (See Def. Opp. at 57-59). But any suggestion that the defendant\n“prevailed” can only confuse the jury into thinking that the Court adjudicated the substance of\nclaims in the defendant’s favor. That never occurred. If the defense is permited to elicit this\ntestimony, the Government will need to explain the relevant legal principles to the jury, shouing\nthem that—contrary to the defendant’s position—to a lay person, this is a technicality, and the\nlitigation terminated with a setlement. (See id. at 58). Even if there were marginal probative\nvalue in a civil case, it would deeply confuse the jury to suggest that the defendant prevailed\nsubstantively, and would require a mini-trial on the meaning of a prevailing party in civil litigation.\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 4o3.\n<span class=\"highlight\">CONCLUSION</span>\nThe defense would make this trial about many things it is not: the Florida investigation,\nvarious civil lawsuits, the media, and the Government’s alleged motives, among others. None of\nthis bears on the factual question that the jury must decide.

This Court then ordered the Government to provide disclosure of any “Rule 4o4(b)\nevidence and notice” by October ll. Dkt. 297.\n\nOn October ll, 2o2l, the Government served on defense counsel a short leter entitled\nthe “Maxwell Rule 4o4(b) leter’ (the “Rule 4o4(b) Leter” or the “Leter’’), atached as Exhibit\nA. In it, the Government referenced two sets of evidence: (a) certain emails purportedly between\nMs. Maxwell and third-party “influential” men whom she allegedly tried to set up on dates, and\n(b) a Witness i who worked for Epstein between ggg (after the\n<span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> of the charged conspiracy) whom the Government said it “may call” at trial. The\nGovernment asserted in the Leter that the evidence collectively was, in its opinion, “direct\nevidence of the crimes charged and, in the alternative, pursuant to Rule 4o4(b) as proof of the\ndefendant's intent, preparation, plan, knouledge, identity, and/or absence of mistake of (sic)\naccident.” /d. at2. The Government stated it would not be moving in /imine to seek the\nevidence's admission \"[b]ecause this evidence is admissible as direct evidence.\" Jd. The Leter\nlacked identification of any particular purpose for these two categories of evidence and lacked\nany \"basis for concluding that the evidence is relevant in light of this purpose.\"\n\nAlso on October ll, the Government provided its anticipated trial exhibits. Even a quick\nreview of those exhibits reflects the Government's apparent intent to offer numerous documents\nand other evidence that purportedly occurred after the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> of the charged conspiracy.\n\nSee, e.g., GX-4-D through GX-4-K (message pads dated beginning in 2oo5); GX-423 (an\nAmazon shipment to Jeffrey Epstein of an iPhone USB lightning cable in 2ol3); GX-5ol & 5o2\n(financial statements from June 2oo7); GX-66l & 662 (flight logs from 2oo5-l3). None of these\nitems of evidence were mentioned in the Maxwell Rule 4o4(b) Leter. The Government's theory\nof admissibility concerning this post-2oo4 evidence remains unclear.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6577", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006579.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 442 Filed ll/l2/2l Page8ofl2\ncharged crimes [and (li)] her [unspecified] role in scheduling sexualized massages for Jeffrey\nEpstein with underage girls,\" apparently in ggg. This is hardly the type of \"identiffied]\"\nevidence the Rule contemplates. What \"documentary evidence\" will she testify about? What\n\"role\" did she play in scheduling massages after the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> of the charged conspiracy? For\nwhat purpose will she testify to it? Are there other topics covered by the language \"among other\nthings\" that the Government submits is admissible under Rule 4o4(b)? What is it? What is the\npurpose of it? Will it be offered to prove Ms. Maxwell’s \"intent, preparation, plan, knouledge,\nidentity and/or absence of mistake of [sic] accident\" or something else? Hou is it permissible\nnon-propensity evidence?\n\nFinally, by failing to identify the numerous exhibits that fall after the period of the\nconspiracy in the Rule 4o4(b) Leter, the Government has also waived any right to argue that\nthose documents should be admited under the rule as well.\n\nThe entire point of the change to Rule 4o4(b), and this Court's scheduling Order, is to\npermit Ms. Maxwell to investigate, analyze, dispute, move in /imine if appropriate, or rebut the\nproffered Rule 4o4(b) evidence. There is nothing in Rule 4o4(b) that excuses the required\nNotice in the event the Government only offers the evidence \"in the alternative\" under the rule.\nBy disregarding the requirements of Rule 4o4(b), the Government has chosen to deprive Ms.\nMaxwell of her right to dispute the admissibility of this evidence.\n\nII. Should the Government's Failure Be Excused, Ms. Maxwell Requests an\nOpportunity to Rebut any Proffered Non-Propensity Purpose and Basis\nBecause the Government has not identified the non-propensity purpose nor reasoning\n\nunderlying the admission of any Rule 4o4(b) evidence, the defense is left without \"sufficient\ntime for an independent investigation that might surface evidence that refutes, mitigates, or\nplaces the other act in a different light,” and the Court will not have sufficient \"time to consider\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6579", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006581.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 442 Filed ll/l2/2l Pageloofl2\nIndictment. It is hard to imagine hou an adult women fixing up single adult males with adult\nfemales is \"direct evidence\" of a conspiracy to transport, entice or traffic minors for sexual\nabuse.\n\nAs to the witness referenced in the Leter, the Leter makes clear that the witness worked\nfor Mr. Epstein from ggg, after the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> of the charged conspiracy in 2oo4. Given the\ntiming of her stated employment, it also begs the question hou her testimony, reference to\nunspecified documents or scheduling of unspecified massages, \"among other things,\" could be\ndirect evidence of a conspiracy that ended a year earlier.\n\nBut because Ms. Maxwell has had insufficient time to investigate these newly-disclosed\nmaterials, she is unable to file a motion challenging their admissibility at this time. The emails\ninvolve two persons not interviewed by the Government, so there is no interview memo to\ncorroborate their content. At least two of the potential witnesses are foreign nationals who live\nabroad. Ms. Maxwell will need time to contact and interview them. As to the newly disclosed\nwitness, the Government produced on October l2, 2o2l approximately 4oo pages of interview\nreports, notes, documents, and other materials related to that witness. Ms. Maxwell is unable to\nreview, investigate, or rebut the admissibility of all of the referenced materials by the October\nl8, 2o2l due date for motions in /imine, and requests an additional two weeks to file her brief\naddressing the proffered 4o4(b) evidence.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">CONCLUSION</span>\n\nThe Government has been on notice of the amendments to Rule 4o4(b) since at least\nJanuary 25, 2o2l. See Dkt. l46 at lo.' The Government was prepared to disclose their Rule\n' Indeed, the Government argued in their response to Ms. Maxwell's pretrial motions that certain evidence\npertaining to Accuser-3 would be admissible under Rule 4o4(b); yet the deadline to provide Notice of an\nintent to offer that evidence at trial under the rule has come and gone.

Recognizing them, the government\nretreats to a familiar tactic: The use of a “blind” expert to fill in the gaps, to explain away the\ninconsistencies, and to vouch of the truthfulness of the accusers.\n\nThe foundation of Lisa M. Rocchio’s proposed expert testimony is so-called “grooming”\nbehavior. But grooming is not a widely recognized or highly predictable and verifiable\nphenomena. To the contrary, “there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred\nor is occurring.”! What’s more, there is nothing—not a journal article, and not a study—to\nvalidate Rocchio’s opinions on “grooming-by-proxy”—.e., that Ms. Maxwell groomed victims\nnot for her oun benefit but for that of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nRocchio’s opinions about “grooming” are entirely subjective—they are based on her\npersonal experience treating a self-selected group of people who claim to have been sexually\nabused and who Rocchio assumes are telling the truth. There are no studies or data to back up\nher conclusions; they have no associated error rate; they cannot be tested, verified, or\nreproduced; and they “virtually impregnable for purposes of cross-examination.”” Since “expert\n' Natalie Bennet & William O’Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23\nJ.

If an expert’s opinions rest “on data,\na methodology, or studies that are simply inadequate to support the conclusions reached,\nDaubert and Rule 7o2 mandate the exclusion of that unreliable opinion testimony.” Amorgianos,\n3o3 F.3d at 266.\n\nThe Supreme Court in Daubert set forth several factors for the court to consider in\ndetermining reliability: “(l) whether a theory or technique can be (and has been) tested; (2)\nwhether the theory or technique has been subjected to peer review and publication; (3) a\ntechnique’s knoun or potential rate of error, and the existence and maintenance of standards\ncontrolling the technique’s operation; and (4) whether a particular technique or theory has gained\n‘general acceptance’ in the relevant scientific community” Amorgianos, 3o3 F.3d at 266 (cleaned\nup). “Rule [7o2] applies its reliability standard to all ‘scientific,’ ‘technical,’ or ‘other\nspecialized’ maters within its scope.” Kumho Tire, 526 U.S. at l47-48.\n\nAssuming an expert’s opinions clear the relevancy and reliability hurdles of Daubert and\nRule 7o2, the court must nevertheless exclude the evidence if it violates Rule 7o4, Rule 4o3, or\nRule 4o4.

To be sure, the\ngovernment’s notice and Rocchio’s CV do not point to a single study, report, or article (peer-\nreviewed or otherwise) establishing the reliability of her opinions on grooming.

Ex. l;\nE.E.O.C. v. Bloomberg L.P., Civ. No. o7-8383(LAP), 2olo WL 346637o, at *l4 (S.D.N.Y. Aug.\n3l, 2olo) (exclusion of an expert is required where the expert makes “no effort to ensure that the\nmaterials he reviewed were representative”). Again, Rocchio’s opinions “cannot be challenged\nor tested in any meaningful way.” See Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *4.\n\nThere are other problems with Rocchio’s proposed testimony. She opines, for example,\nthat “[iJndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted [through grooming] by\nperpetrators of sexual abuse,” Ex. l, p.2, but she doesn’t explain hou often. Half the time? Two-\nthirds of the time? Nor does she explain hou “frequently” the “sexual abuse of minors . . . occurs\nthrough the use of manipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is\ndeveloped over time.” /d. Rocchio’s generic conclusions that grooming “often” happens or\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6598", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006599.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel3 of 24\n“frequently occurs” are not reliable, because she does not explain hou these conclusions were\nreached, what testing was involved, what data she considered, or hou her conclusions can be\nverified.\n\nThis is exactly why the Court in United States v. Raymond excluded grooming testimony\nin a prosecution for transporting a minor across state lines with the intent of engaging in illegal\nsexual activity. In that case, the expert (Ken Lanning) proposed to testify that “offenders who\nprefer younger child victims are more likely to first ‘seduce’ the victim’s parents to gain their\ntrust and obtain increased access to the potential victim” and that “[iJn my experience, many\nvalid claims of child sexual molestation, especially those by compliant child victims, involve the\ndelayed disclosures, inconsistencies, varying accounts, exaggerations, and lies often associated\nwith false allegations.” 7oo F. Supp. 2d. at l48. The Court excluded this testimony as unreliable,\nexplaining:\n\nNouhere does Lanning cite an objective benchmark for these frequencies or\n\ncomparisons. What is “more likely”? Fifty-one percent? Hou many is “many”?\n\nHou few is “some”? What is the error rate for Lanning’s behavioral\n\ngeneralizations? Can Lanning’s opinions be tested or challenged in any objective\n\nsense? Nouhere do I see any discussion of false positives. Hou many cases has\n\nLanning found where people who possess all the characteristics he describes\n\nnevertheless turn out to be innocent or where victims who behave as he describes\n\nturns out to be lying? Has he even looked for such examples? For all I can tell, that\n\nnumber may be more, fewer, or the same as, the thousands of cases he says that he\n\nhas investigated where a defendant turned out to be guilty or where a victim turned\n\nout to be telling the truth. And are these rules of exclusion, or only of inclusion?\n\nFor example, Lanning describes what the “grooming or seduction process usually\n\nconsists of.” But what if a defendant fails to do one of the things that Lanning’s\n\nchild molester would usually do? Can the defendant then argue to the jury that he\n\nmust therefore not have been grooming a child?\n\nId. at l48-49 (citations and footnote omited).

But she has no experience treating or evaluating alleged perpetrators of sexual\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6599", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006603.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel7 of 24\nB. Opinion 2: The relationship of trust and atachment between an alleged\nperpetrator and alleged victim prevents victims from being aware that\nwhat they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure.\n\nRocchio’s second opinion—that the relationship of trust and atachment between an\nalleged perpetrator and alleged victim prevents victims from being aware that what they are\nexperiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure—has several flaws that render it inadmissible.\n\nFirst, the opinion is unreliable, because it is, in reality, an opinion about grooming\ndisguised as an opinion about delayed disclosure. In Rocchio’s view, alleged victims delay or fail\nto disclose alleged abuse because they were groomed. But because Rocchio’s proposed\ngrooming testimony is unreliable, not helpful to the trier of fact, and unfairly prejudicial (for all\nthe reasons given above, supra Part l.a-l.c), so too is this opinion unreliable, not helpful to the\ntrier of fact, and unfairly prejudicial.\n\nTo reiterate, Rocchio’s opinions are based on her personal experience as a treatment\nprovider. She assumes her clients are telling the truth, and her clients are a self-selected group of\nalleged victims. Rocchio cannot cite an error rate for her conclusions, nor can she say hou\nrepresentative her patients are of those who suffer sexual abuse. See E.E.o.C., 2olo WL\n346637o, at *l4 (exclusion of an expert is required where the expert makes “no effort to ensure\nthat the materials he reviewed were representative”). Her conclusions cannot be tested or\nverified, and they are “virtually impregnable for purposes of cross-examination.” Gonyer, 2ol2\nWL 3o43o2o, at *2.\n\nSecond, Rocchio apparently has no experience treating alleged perpetrators. So her view\nof the “relationship of trust and atachment between an alleged perpetrator and alleged victim” is\nentirely one-sided. See Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *2-3. The second opinion Rocchio\nproposes to offer is outside her expertise.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo66o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006606.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 2o of 24\nE. Opinion 5: Nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are\ncommon among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of reasons, and that\nmemory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a\nnumber of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma\n\nThere are several problems with Rocchio’s proposed testimony that “nondisclosure,\nincremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of\nreasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a number\nof factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma.”\n\nThe first half of this opinion—regarding nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, or late\ndisclosure—is unreliable because the alleged connection “between child sexual abuse and a\nfailure to report . . . is not a testable hypothesis.” Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *4. Rocchio\noffers no data or analyses to support her <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>, EX. l, and she formed her subjective\nopinion based entirely on her treatment of a self-selected group of individuals she assumes are\ntelling the truth. Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *4 (“Indeed, Edelman testifies that when her\nclinical patients tell her they have been subjected to sexual abuse, she unequivocally believes\nthem.”). “There is also no knoun or identified rate of error to [Rocchio’s] <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>, nor is\nthere a reliable method or a series of factors guiding [Rocchio’s] <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> as to whether an\nindividual victim is fabricating [her] abuse or has simply delayed reporting such abuse.” See id.\nAnd because Rocchio’s experience is apparently “limited to providing therapy for those child\nvictims who have reported their abuse,” Rocchio is in no position “reliably opine as to the\ncharacteristics or psychology of victims who maintain their silence.” See id. Rocchio’s\ntestimony, therefore, “cannot be challenged or tested in any meaningful way.” /d. Her opinions\nare unreliable and inadmissible.\n\nRocchio’s testimony also “will [not] help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to\ndetermine a fact in issue.” Fed. R. Evid. 7o2(a). Rocchio’s opinions on disclosure are so generic\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo66o6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006608.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 22 of 24\nwitness encroaches upon the jury’s vital and exclusive function to make credibility\ndeterminations and therefore does not ‘assist the trier of fact’ as required by Rule 7o2.”)\n(citations omited). Rocchio’s opinions on disclosure also contravene Rule 4o3 because they\nsuggest that delayed reporting of child sexual abuse is more consistent with truthfulness than\nwith fabrication, a determination which the jury must make for itself. Schneider, 2olo WL\n3734o55, at *6.\n\nThat leaves the second half of Rocchio’s disclosure opinion: that memory and disclosure\nof traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a number of factors, including the circumstances\nsurrounding the trauma. This opinion is so generic as to be meaningless. It is also a mater of\ncommon sense—hou could anyone dispute that memory is “impacted by a number of factors”?\nMoreover, Rocchio is not an expert in the human brain or memory generally. And her opinion\nabout when, why, and hou alleged victims of sexual assault remember being assaulted suffers\nfrom all the same flaws discussed above: Rocchio doesn’t point to any data or studies validating\nher opinion; her opinions cannot be tested, reproduced, or meaningfully challenged; and her\nopinion is based on the self-reports of her oun clients, who she assumes are telling the truth.\n\nII. Ata minimum, this Court should hold a Daubert hearing\n\nFor all these reasons, this Court should preclude Rocchio from testifying in this case. At\n\nthe very least, this Court should hold a Daubert to evaluate each of her proposed opinions.\n<span class=\"highlight\">CONCLUSION</span>\n\nThis Court should exclude Rocchio’s proposed testimony or, in the alternative, hold a\nDaubert hearing.\n\nDated: October l8, 2o2l\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo66o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006646.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 444 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 2o of 2l\n<span class=\"highlight\">CONCLUSION</span>\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should exclude evidence related to Accuser-3\nbecause it is not probative of the charged conspiracies and inadmissible under Rule 4o4(b) and\nRule 4o3 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.

Moreover, she will be\ntestifying about concepts she regularly employs as a practicing clinician. Again, the defense does\nnot contest that Dr. Rocchio is qualified to be an expert on this subject. And Dr. Rocchio’s\nopinions are not an atempt to offer a “profile” of perpetrators of child sexual abuse or their\nactivities. Instead, Dr. Rocchio will testify about the psychological underpinnings of an\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6723", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006724.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page l6 of 84\nestablished patern of victimization—atachment and coercion—experienced by victims of sexual\nabuse.\n\nThe defense would read Raymond to stand for the proposition that expert testimony is\nunreliable if it does not explain “what testing was involved, what data she considered, or hou her\nconclusions can be verified.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 8). For instance, the defense criticizes Dr. Rocchio\nfor opining that sexual abuse of minors occurs “frequently,” without specifying whether it occurs\n“half the time” or “two-thirds of the time.” (/d. at 7; see id. at 8 (quoting Raymond, 7oo F. Supp.\n2d at l48-49)). That is not what is required by Daubert in the context of qualitative social science,\nand it is not what many courts have held in the context of precisely this form of testimony, as\nexplained above. To the extent Raymond stands for such a broad proposition, it is contrary to the\nlaw of this Circuit. See United States v.

First, the\ndefendant asserts that Dr. Rocchio’s patients are uncorroborated, and she “simply assumes her\n2 Even in Raymond, the Court left open the possibility that the Government could call the expert\nin rebutal to “counter a defense case that victim testimony in this case should not be believed\nbecause the victim delayed in reporting the abuse or did not report it consistently.” 7oo F. Supp.\n2d at l56. Even were the Court inclined to follou Raymond rather than the cases in this District,\nit should similarly revisit permiting Dr. Rocchio to testify about the opinion at issue if the defense\natacks victim credibility.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6724", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006725.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel7 of 84\npatients are telling the truth.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 6). The defendant claims that this “fatally\nundermines the reliability of her opinion” because her <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> has “no knoun or identified rate\nof error. . . nor is there a reliable method or a series of factors guiding Rocchio’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> as to\nwhether an individual victim is fabricating her abuse.” (/d. (alterations and quotation marks\nomited)). Clinical psychologists are not so credulous. As part of Dr. Rocchio’s work as a\npracticing clinician, she examines consistencies and inconsistencies in the information provided\nby patients and assesses patient self-reporting in the context of literature and knouledge that she\nhas developed in her years of practice. As the Government’s expert notice makes clear, Dr.\nRocchio has treated hundreds and hundreds of patients in her decades of experience, and her\nopinions are based in part on the significant paterns she has observed among the patients she has\ntreated. The Court should reject the defendant’s speculative claim that Dr. Rocchio has been\nmisled by hundreds of patients who sought professional treatment for traumatic events that did not\noccur.\n\nIn any event, the defendant’s argument about error rates misunderstands the nature of a\nDaubert inquiry. An error rate is but one of the Daubert factors that may or may not be applicable\nin every case. See Romano, 794 F.3d at 33o. And in cases such as this, where a social science\nexpert is testifying based on qualitative methodology, that factor is inapplicable. See Torres, 2o2l\nWL l9475o3, at *6n.8. As the Second Circuit has explained, “Peer review, publication, potential\nerror rate, etc... . are not applicable to this kind of testimony, whose reliability depends heavily\non the knouledge and experience of the expert, rather than the methodology or theory behind it. In\nsuch cases, the place to quibble with [an expert’s] academic training is on cross-examination . . .\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6725", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006759.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 5l of 84\n\nNot so. The defendant’s argument entirely misunderstands the charges in the Indictment\nand the jury’s task at trial. The defendant is charged with conspiring to transport and entice minors\nfor the purpose of sexual abuse. The question at trial will be whether the defendant took steps to\nprovide Jeffrey Epstein with access to girls under the age of l8, knouing that Epstein intended to\nhave sexual contact with those girls. The defendant’s acts involving Minor Victim-3 were part of\nthat scheme and are highly relevant to demonstrating the existence of the conspiracy and the\ndefendant’s role in the scheme. That is all that is required for evidence relating to the defendant’s\nexploitation of Minor Victim-3 to be direct evidence of the charged offenses. The defendant is not\ncharged with an offense under United Kingdom law, and the age of consent in the United Kingdom\nis irrelevant. The defendant is also not charged with any substantive offenses with respect to Minor\nVictim-3, and thus it makes no difference whether the defendant could have, atempted to, or did\nsuccessfully transport Minor Victim-3 in violation of those statutes. !”\n\nIn any event, this evidence is all admissible under Rule 4o4(b).'? Testimony regarding the\ndefendant’s efforts to recruit and encourage Minor Victim-3 to engage in sex acts with Epstein in\nthe context of massages establishes that the defendant knew of Epstein’s atraction to minor girls\n' Indeed, there is no risk at trial that the jury will convict the defendant based on the testimony of\nMinor Victim-3 alone. As the Government has made clear, the jury may not convict the defendant\nof the conspiracy offense solely based on Minor Victim-3 due to the statute of limitations. (Gov’t\nOpp. at l57-58, l63, Dkt. No. 2o4). The jury should be appropriately instructed at the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>\nof the trial.\n\n'3 To the extent this evidence is properly admissible under Rule 4o4(b) rather than as direct\nevidence, the Government’s detailed memorandum in opposition to the defense pretrial motions,\nwhich described theories of 4o4(b) admissibility (Gov’t Opp. at l65-69, Dkt.

The definition is further elucidated by\nproviding a number of exemplars of grooming:\n\nl. Any sexualization of the relationship such as talking about sex in a way\nthat is not permissible given the adult’s relationship with the child (e.g.,\nit is permissible for parents to provide sex education to their children) or\nexposing the child to sexually explicit materials such as R rated movies\n(shouing the child pornography would be abusive in and of itself and\ntherefore not grooming).\n\n2. Inappropriate gift giving (developmentally or socially inappropriate, such\nas bikinis or bras purchased by a neighbor or teacher).\n\n3. Inappropriate nonsexual communication with the child (e.g., telling the\nchild she is the only one who understands the offender, or telling her “I\nlove you” when the social role is not appropriate for this type of commu-\nnication), particularly when an adult uses these statements to manipulate\nthe child to do something (e.g., “I love you and people who love each\nother touch each other”).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68o6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006808.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page l6 of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 97l\n4, Having age-appropriate and relationship-appropriate discussions of body\nparts.\n\n5. A care-giving figure saying “I love you” without the goal of manipulation\n(not using the phrase to get the child to do something inappropriate).\nTHE ASSESSMENT OF GROOMING\nBecause grooming is a set of common behaviors seen in child sexual offend-\ners (as the previous reviewed literature seems to support this <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>),\nit should be possible to assess behaviors to determine whether they are\nindicative that sexual abuse is likely to occur. We have reviewed the pub-\nlished literature and have not been able to find any measures that validly\nassess grooming behaviors (by any definition of grooming). This greatly\nreduces the value of any definition as the practical usefulness of a definition\nis seen in its ability to be operationalized in valid measurement processes.\nIt is important to develop valid measures as it is not ideal for the detection\nof grooming to be an entirely post hoc process—that is, only after the abuse\noccurs are the gifts seen as inappropriate and thus as part of a grooming\nprocess. The grooming acts should seem at least somewhat inappropriate\nat the time they are occurring and thus ideally adults can intervene to stop\nfuture abuse. To resolve this problem, grooming requires a valid definition\nand a psychometrically adequate assessment procedure to reduce both the\n\nnumber of false positives and false negatives.\n\nWe are currently developing an assessment device that would aid a clin-\nician in coming to a valid <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> as to whether an individual’s behaviors\ncan be considered grooming. As mentioned, an assessment of grooming in\nour proposed definition would involve a two-step process: (a) determining\nthat the adult’s behavior is inappropriate in and of itself, such as if the tickling\nis excessive or the bikini gift is not justified by the nature of the relationship;\nand (b) reasonably arguing that the function of this inappropriate behavior\nis to increase the likelihood of future abusive contact.\n\nWhat is “inappropriate” admitedly is somewhat of a vague term that\nrequires judgment because we need to clearly differentiate the behavior\nfrom normal adult-child relationships. Houever, this judgment requirement\ncurrently exists for other psychological constructs as well. For example,\nthe diagnosis of a major depressive episode might require that a clinician\njudges the client’s guilt as “excessive.” In addition, under our criteria these\njudgments of inappropriateness should be explicit (there must be a clear\nargument as to why the behavior is inappropriate). Since the argument must\nbe explicated, others would be able to evaluate it and decide whether it is a\nnonproblematic judgment of the behavior.\n\nTo illustrate, a male coach buying an eight-year-old girl a bikini would\ngenerally be considered inappropriate, but the act of buying her a pair of\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006811.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page l9 of 43\n974 N.

Another important issue is to investigate what sort\nof training programs or materials need to be developed so that a wide vari-\nety of professionals can faithfully implement the definition and proposed\nassessment methods.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nCurrently there is no consensus regarding hou to define grooming. In addi-\ntion, there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred. or\nis occurring. The field possesses an insufficient amount of knouledge about\nkey issues such as the interrater reliability of these judgments or the error\nrates of these judgments including the frequency of false negatives or false\npositives. Thus currently it appears that grooming is not a construct that\nought to be used in forensic setings as it does not meet some of the cri-\nteria in the Daubert standard. The Daubert standard indicates that in court\nan expert witness may only testify if (a) “the expert’s scientific, technical,\nor other specialized knouledge will help the trier of fact to understand the\nevidence or to determine a fact in issue; (b) the testimony is based on suffi-\ncient facts or data; (c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and\nmethods; and (d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and meth-\nods to the facts of the case” (Rule 7o2: Testimony by expert witness). Right\nnou it does not appear to be the case that there are “reliable principles and\nmethods” to define and detect grooming.\n\nWe propose a definition of grooming that involves two parts: (a) inap-\npropriate behavior on the part of the adult and (b) sound arguments that this\ninappropriate behavior functions to increase the probability of future sexual\nabuse. We then provide exemplars of this kind of inappropriate behavior.\nFuture research on grooming would be more useful to the field if data were\ncollected using a single, clear definition such as the one we have proposed.\nThis would provide a basis for data to be easily aggregated and beter under-\nstood, which could lead to the admissibility of grooming evidence in forensic\nsetings. Furthermore, we are currently working to develop valid psycho-\nmetric instruments with knoun reliability and validity to assess grooming\naccording to this standard.\n\nREFERENCES\nl8 USC § 2252A.

We could benefit from prospective studies of the frequency of groom-\ning-like behaviors among adults in target-rich environments such as schools,\nyouth sports, and youth groups, which could help distinguish behaviors por-\ntending risk from those that do not, though it would require a large sample\nand a long time to reveal at least some of the offenders in the sample.\n\nThe two archaic uses of the term “seduction” in the context of child sexual\nabuse identified here are too recent and too widely knoun to justify completely\nabandoning the term “grooming” in favor of “seduction,” even if it were possible\nto do so.

Based on the above findings it seems\n\nnecessary to provide a new definition that atempts to encapsulate the complexity of sexual\n\ngrooming, while still being easy to understand. We propose the follouing:\n\nA process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the environment for\n\nthe abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining access to the child, gaining the\n\nchild’s compliance and maintaining the child’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process\nserves to strengthen the offender’s abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of\njustifying or denying their actions.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Conclusion</span>\nDespite the wide acceptance of the term, sexual grooming of children is not understood\nclearly, particularly in the public domain. Testimonies from both victims and perpetrators\nhighlight the pertinence of the problem. Furthermore, the government in England and Wales\nhas introduced legislation in the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 regarding “meeting a child\nfollouing sexual grooming” (see Part l: section l52oo3). A greater understanding of the\nmeaning, elements and process of sexual grooming is required to effectively utilize this\nlegislation (for review see Craven, Broun & Gilchrist, in press).\n\nRegardless of the prevalence and pertinence of sexual grooming, most aetiological\ntheories of child sexual abuse neglect the phenomenon. The main reason for this is likely to be\nbecause prominent theories of child sexual abuse were devised more than lo years ago, at a\ntime when sexual grooming was not recognized as it is today. Therefore, it is necessary that\ntheories be reconsidered based on this recent awareness. Ward (2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool; Ward & Siegert, 2oo2) has begun the process of theory kniting and development.\nWhile Ward and Siegert’s Pathways Model is able to account for sexual grooming, it still\nfocuses on the presence of opportunity rather than explicitly recognizing that offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming discussed in the\nliterature: self-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the\nchild. Based on these findings an alternative definition has been suggested, which includes\ndetails about offenders’ objectives, e.g. gaining access to a child, gaining the child’s\ncompliance, maintaining secrecy and avoiding disclosure.\n\nA fuller understanding of sexual grooming is required. Consideration needs to be given to\noffender—victim interaction (before, during and after the offence), micro behaviours that may\nindicate to significant adults that a child is being sexually groomed, or indeed that they\nthemselves are being groomed by an offender, and the seemingly impossible task of proving\nbeyond reasonable doubt that the ambiguous behaviour of sexual grooming is sexually\nmotivated. This would provide many benefits to child protection and the policing and\ntreatment of child sex offenders with a specific focus on prevention of child sexual abuse\nrather than reactive responses to it. To optimize the impact of acquired knouledge and\nunderstanding, it is necessary to consider hou these findings are disseminated to the relevant\ngroups involved with children, e.g. parents, police, and social workers.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6833", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006857.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 22 of 45\n28o TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE 2o(2)\nexperiences, consequently more readily identifying barriers.

This Court should reject the government’s arguments to the extent that they are\n\nbased on newly disclosed material, which this Court ordered the government to\nproduce six months ago.\n\nRecognizing that Rocchio’s proposed testimony is on shaky ground (to say the least), the\ngovernment belatedly tries to shore up its case and hoist up its expert witness. Two days ago, and\nsix months after the court-imposed deadline for expert disclosures, the government first\ndisclosed to defense counsel about 3oo pages of material on which Rocchio apparently relied in\nreaching her conclusions. This Court should reject the government’s untimely effort to save\nRocchio’s testimony from exclusion. See United States v. Lewis, 8l8 F. App’x 74, 79 (2d Cir.\n2o2o) (unpublished) (affirming exclusion of defendant’s proffered expert evidence “that did not\nadhere to the discovery schedule”).\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo69ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006902.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 22 of 52\n\nIn any case, the newly discovered material doesn’t help the government’s cause. Exhibit\nA (literally) to the government’s response is a journal article describing “grooming” as a\n“construct.” Resp, Ex. A, Natalie Bennet & William O’Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in\nChild Sexual Abuse, 23 J. Child Sexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4). (In fact, Ms. Maxwell cited this\narticle in her motion.) Far from supporting Rocchio’s conclusions, the article proves their\nunreliability:\n\nThere have been claims that some child molesters engage in a “seduction stage”\n\nprior to commiting abuse. These behaviors, commonly knoun as “grooming,” are\n\nunderstood as methods child molesters use to gain access to and prepare future\n\nvictims to be compliant with abuse. Houever, there is a lack of consensus regarding\nexactly what this process entails and hou it is clearly distinguished from normal\nadult-child interactions. . . . Furthermore, there are no methods of knoun\npsychometrics to validly assess grooming.\n\nGov’t Resp., Ex. A, p 2 (emphasis added). The article concludes:\n\nCurrently there is no consensus regarding hou to define grooming. In addition,\n\nthere is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.\n\nThe field possesses an insufficient amount of knouledge about key issues such as\n\nthe interrater reliability of these judgments or the error rates of these judgments\n\nincluding the frequency of false negatives or false positives. Thus currently it\n\nappears that grooming is not a construct that ought to be used in forensic setings\n\nas it does not meet some of the criteria in the Daubert standard... . Right nou it\n\ndoes not appear to be the case that there are “reliable principles and methods” to\n\ndefine and detect grooming.\nId. at l9 (emphasis added).\n\nBecause the government cannot justify admission of Rocchio’s testimony based on its\nprejudicially late disclosures, and because those disclosures don’t support Rocchio’s views, and\nunderscore that “grooming” is not a scientific principle based on psychometric testing, this Court\nshould preclude Rocchio from testifying. And as explained belou, the government’s other\ndefenses of Rocchio fall far short of what is required by Rules 4ol, 4o2, 4o3, 4o4, 7o2, and 7o4.\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR- oooo69o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006907.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 27 of 52\nas well as [her] experience conducting forensic psychological evaluations of\npeople who have experienced sexual abuse and trauma.” Mot. Ex. l, p 2.\n\ne The government tries to disclaim the importance of error rates. Resp. at l5-l7.\nBut it’s not just that Rocchio cannot identify an error rate, it’s that her implicit\n<span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> is that she doesn’t have an error rate. That is, all her patients are\ntelling the truth when they say they were groomed, so any evidence that matches\nwhat her patients have told her is therefore evidence of grooming.\n\ne But even if the error-rate discussion were misplaced, that doesn’t mean Rocchio’s\nopinions are reliable. As a “qualitative” mater, and as the government’s oun\nExhibit A concedes, there are no “‘reliable principles and methods’ to define and\ndetect grooming.” Govt. Resp., Ex. A, p l9 (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 7o2).\n\ne The government apparently expects that, “somehou, a lay jury without guidance\n[will] apply [Rocchio’s] analyses reliably to the facts of a case in determining\nguilt.” See Raymond, 7oo F. Supp. 2d at l5o (rejecting argument that a jury could\ndo just that). This Court should not, as the government request, simply punt the\nmater to the jury. Resp. at l7-l8. The Court is the gatekeeper. It must ensure the\nevidence is reliable and relevant. If it’s not both, it has no place in a criminal jury\ntrial, because it will “radically simplify” an otherwise complex case, Burns, 2oo9\nWL 36l7448, at *5, and it will, as the United States Supreme Court has\ncautioned, prejudicially mislead the jury, Daubert v. Merrell Dou Pharms., Inc.,\n5o9 U.S. 579, 595 (l993) (“Expert evidence can be both pouerful and quite\nmisleading because of the difficulty in evaluating it.”).\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo69o7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006926.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 46 of 52\nspeculating that the accusers have already been found credible by someone, or that their decision\nis a foregone <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>. On the other side of the probative-prejudicial scale, the government\nsimultaneously fails to articulate any probative value in use of the term \"victim,\" either in its jury\naddress or otherwise. Cf State v. Wigg, 889 A.2d 233, 236 (Vt. 2oo5) (\"the use of the term\n‘victim’ had no inherent probative value\").\n\nSecond, the government improperly suggests in response that the stricture on vouching\nshould not apply to the witnesses themselves. Resp. at 79. As explained by numerous cases,\nhaving any witness refer to themselves or another witness as a \"victim\" is the very height of\nimproper vouching. Sena, supra; State v. Sperou, 365 Or. l2l, l3l, 442 P.3d 58l, 59o (2ol9)\n(\"another witness’s description of the complaining witness as a 'victim' conveys an opinion that\nthe complaining witness is telling the truth. That is what the vouching rule is intended to\nprevent.\"); Wigg, supra.\n\nFinally, the government contends that Dr. Rocchio can use the word \"victim\" in reference\nto \"victims of sexual abuse generally,\" but her use of the term is even more problematic. For the\nreasons articulated in our Daubert motion and reply, Dr. Rocchio bases her expertise on her\ntherapeutic number of individuals who have self-identified as sexual abuse victims, without any\nresearch or investigation as to whether the individuals' self-reports are true. She then intends to\ndraw from her anecdotal and experiential treatment to generalize about all \"victims\" without their\never having been a finding that any of the persons she has provided treatment to were, in fact,\n\"victims.\" If she is permited to testify, there is no reason for her to vouch for the credibility of\nher patients, unless she clarifies each time that she is taking the individual at their word that they\nwere in fact a victim. The danger of confusion to a jury is that anyone treated by Dr. Rochio\nmust have been a victim. As the Wigg court recognized, there will be a \"danger of unfair\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6926", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006962.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 456 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagelooflo\nPage lo\nD. <span class=\"highlight\">Conclusion</span>\nFor the forgoing reasons, the Government respectfully submits that the proffered\n\nstatements should be admited at trial.\nRespectfully submited,\nDAMIAN WILLIAMS\nUnited States Atorney\n\nBy: ___s/\n\nMaurene Comey\nAlison Moe\nLara Pomerantz\nAndrew Rohrbach\nAssistant United States Atorneys\nSouthern District of New York\n\nCc: Defense Counsel (By ECF)\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6962", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006967.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document457_ Filed ll/l3/2l Page5of8\nPage 5\n\nseizure of the USB drive, Federal Rule of Evidence 9ol(b)(4) permits authentication based on\n‘[t]he appearance, contents, substance, internal paterns, or other distinctive characteristics of the\nitem, taken together with all the circumstances.’” /d.

Employee-l will identify Government Exhibit 52 as the defendant’s\ncontact book based on its appearance and contents. Moreover, Employee-l’s testimony will be\ncorroborated by the contents of the book itself, which includes (a) contact information for the\ndefendant’s family, and (b) contact information for victims who interacted with the defendant\nduring the relevant time period. That is more than sufficient to establish the authenticity of the\nexhibit under Rule 9ol.

Sure. I think that certain things -—- some psychologists\n\n2 use clinical judgment on whether or not a perpetrator's\n\nke behaviors are considered grooming.

In addition, we also have data\n6 that's been provided by offenders themselves.\n\n7 In terms of reliability and validity of these\n\n8 judgments, the validity in psychological science refers to the\n9 degree to which you are measuring this particular thing, what\nlo you think you're measuring. So for example, the degree to\n\nll which there is significant overlap between what victims say\n\nl2 they experience and what offenders say that they have done\n\nl3 provides us with a measure of validity.\n\nl4 The degree to which different groups of individuals,\nl5 whether that's groups of professionals or groups of victims\n\nl6 agree in studies what it is that —- the process, what kinds of\nl7 behaviors, what's been done to the victim, what kinds of\n\nl8 behaviors are associated with the grooming process, to the\n\nl9 extent those professionals agree, that's a measure of\n2o reliability. Because you're geting different studies,\n2l different groups, different samples where there's significant\n22 overlap in what this dynamic and what this concept is.\n23 MS.

But even at the time of publication, I\n\nl3 think it's a litle misleading.

Response to Dr. Rocchio’s Proposed Testimony.\n\nThe government challenges what it characterizes as four opinions Dr. Dietz might offer in\nresponse to testimony from Dr. Rocchio.! As explained belou, though, Dr. Dietz’s testimony is\nresponsive to Dr. Rocchio’s testimony in more than the four narrou ways identified by the\ngovernment. In addition, much of his proposed testimony has independent relevance. In any\nevent, none of the government’s challenges is persuasive.\n\nFirst, the government challenges Dr. Dietz’s proposed testimony (l) that Dr. Rocchio’s\nopinion on grooming “carries the risk of imputing motive and intent to the Defendant,” that “Dr.\nRocchio’s proposed testimony is silent as to whether she is expected to impute a theory of\n‘grooming-by-proxy’ to the defendant,” and that “Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or\nenticing sexualized massages for herself,” but instead that she allegedly “recruited and groomed\nminors to provide sexualized massages for Mr. Epstein.” Mot. at lo. The government says these\nthree opinions are inadmissible “legal” conclusions suitable only for a Daubert hearing and not\nfor the jury trial.\n\nIt is perfectly appropriate for Dr. Dietz to opine that Dr. Rocchio’s definition of\n“srooming” risks “imputing motive and intent” to the defendant because that is precisely why\nthere is no setled, clinical definition of grooming, which the government has conceded is a\nproper subject of Dr. Dietz’s expert opinions. Supra Note l; Ex. l, p 3-4. Surely Dr. Dietz can\ninform the jury why the science does not support Dr. Rocchio’s definition of grooming.\n\nDr. Dietz will not himself (and Dr. Rocchio cannot herself) ascribe motive or intent to\nMs. Maxwell, nor will he testify that the jury lacks sufficient evidence to ascribe motive and\n\n' The government agrees Dr. Dietz can inform the jury that Dr. Rocchio is wrong to\nsuggest that grooming has a setled definition.

R. Evid. 7o4 (“In a criminal case, an expert witness must not\nstate an opinion about whether the defendant did or did not have a mental state or condition that\nconstitutes an element of the crime charged or of a defense.”). Those are questions for the jury.\nId. But the very purpose of Dr. Dietz’s testimony on this point is to caution the jury about\nimproperly inferring motive and intent from Dr. Rocchio’s unreliable opinions because, as even\nDr. Rocchio recognized in her testimony, behavior cannot be called “grooming” if it is not in\nfurtherance of “atempted sexual abuse or actual sexual abuse or exploitation.” Ex. 2, p ll8:22-\nl4.\n\nAccordingly, if Dr. Dietz’s opinions about Dr. Rocchio’s conclusions are reliable—as the\ngovernment does not dispute they are—“Daubert neither requires nor empouers trial courts to\ndetermine which of several competing scientific theories has the best provenance.” Fed. R. Evid.\n7o2, Advisory Commitee Notes, 2ooo Amendments (quoting Ruiz-Troche v. Pepsi Cola, l6l\nF.3d 77, 85 (lst Cir. l998)). A court must admit competing expert opinions that are reliable and\nrelevant, and then it’s for the jury to decide which expert is correct. /d. (“[P ]roponents ‘do not\nhave to demonstrate to the judge by a preponderance of the evidence that the assessments of their\nexperts are correct, they only have to demonstrate by a preponderance of evidence that their\nopinions are reliable. .. . The evidentiary requirement of reliability is louer than the merits\nstandard of correctness’” (quoting Jn re Paoli R.R. Yard PCB Litigation, 35 F.3d 7l7, 744 (3d\nCir. l994)).\n\nAs for informing the jury that “Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony is silent as to whether\nshe is expected to impute a theory of ‘grooming-by-proxy’ to the defendant” and that “Ms.\n\n? It’s not clear that Dr. Rocchio will be permited to testify on this subject, as this Court\nhas precluded her from opining that the presence of a third party can facilitate grooming. (Dkt.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7474", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007478.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 Filed ll/23/2l Pagel3 of 28\nlacked actual knouledge of and intent to facilitate the alleged grooming and abuse, she is not\nguilty, even if, as a mater of hindsight, it should have been obvious.\n\nThe government’s second argument falls short as well. Although the phrase “2o/2o\nhindsight” might be well-knoun, the pouer of hindsight bias and the degree to which it might\nunreliably affect the outcome of this case is not. To be sure, as Dr. Dietz laid out in his\ndisclosure, the scientific literature about hindsight bias is voluminous. Ex. l, p 4-5. These expert\narticles wouldn’t exist if the concept were obvious to everyone, and surely it wouldn’t be the\ncase that, as Dr. Dietz notes, “[e]ven individuals with specialized training and expertise succumb\nto hindsight bias,” id. at 5.\n\nThe government concedes that “the jury, and not the court, should be the one to decide\namong conflicting experts.” Mot. at 9 (quoting United States v. Randall, No. l9 Cr. l3l (PAE)\n(S.D.N.Y.)). But for the jury to do that job, it must be equipped with the necessary tools. And\none of those tools is Dr. Dietz’s perfectly permissible opinion that Dr. Rocchio’s testimony\ncannot carry the water the government wants it to because it is tainted by hindsight bias. See\nUnited States v. Broun, 557 F.2d 54l, 556 (6th Cir. l977) (“Conflicting testimony concerning\nthe conclusions drawn by experts, so long as they are based on a generally accepted and reliable\nscientific principle, ordinarily go to the weight of the testimony rather than to its admissibility.”).\n\nC. The Halo Effect.\n\nThe government has two objections to Dr. Dietz’s opinions on the “halo effect.” The first\nis that it is irrelevant (though, again, not unreliable). The second is that it improperly seeks to\nengender sympathy for Ms. Maxwell.\n\nFirst, the government is wrong to argue the testimony is irrelevant. Take just one\n(representative) example. Dr. Dietz opines that Mr. Epstein’s\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR- oooo7478", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007482.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 Filed ll/23/2l Pagel7 of 28\ntestimony. To the contrary, the text of Rule 7o2 expressly contemplates that an expert may be\nqualified on the basis of experience.”).\n\nThird, in admiting Dr. Rocchio’s testimony over an objection by Ms. Maxwell similar to\nthe one offered here by the government, this Court said as follous:\n\nDr. Rocchio’s opinions speak only to concepts and will not (and indeed may not)\n\nsuggest that the jury find any alleged victim witness to be credible or to find Ms.\n\nMaxwell guilty... . It is the jury’s role to determine whether and hou Dr. Rocchio’s\n\nopinions apply to the facts of this case and the credibility of the witnesses.\n(Dkt. 435, p lo). The same logic applies to Dr. Dietz’s opinions.\n\nFinally, the government says the Dr. Dietz’s opinions don’t “fit the facts of the case.”\nMot. at 2l. But because the accusers’ stories have changed so much over the last twenty years,\nand because it’s still unclear what they will testify to at trial, this objection is premature at best.\nIf the government believes Dr. Dietz’s opinions do not “fit” the facts, this Court can consider that\nargument once there is evidence of what the facts really are.\n\nE. Dr. Dietz’s Alleged Opinions about the Accusers’ “Credibility.”\n\nNouhere in Dr. Dietz’s expert disclosure does he propose to opine on the credibility of\nMs. Maxwell’s accusers. Ex. l. The government can argue otherwise only by mischaracterizing\nhis opinions. See Mot. at 22-23.\n\nFor one thing, Dr. Dietz should be able to critique Dr. Rocchio’s methods and\nconclusions by opining that experts in the field would not be “so credulous” as Dr. Rocchio is.\nSee Gov’t Omnibus Resp. to Maxwell Mot. in Limine, at l6; Ex. 2, p l6:ll-l6 (Dr. Rocchio: “In\nmy clinical practice, it’s not — I have to deal with what the patients tell me in the room. It’s not\nmy job to go out and verify any part of what’s being told in the clinical room, but, rather, to hear\nwhat they’re telling me and then relate that back to my other skills-training experience, the\nscientific literature.”).

The government’s bold statement that there is no evidence that “occurrences, suggestion,\ninfluences or the like” happened to any witness is this case is pure bolstering that is belied by the\n35oo material.

Rather, the government claims\ntheir opinions invade the province of the jury or do not “fit” the case. A hearing is not necessary\nor appropriate to resolve the government’s arguments.

What was the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> of this study?\n\nl7 A. So what these authors did is a two-part study. So the\n\nl8 first thing that they did is they did an extensive literature\nl9 review to look for commonalities in the literature about what\n2o are the commonly described stages that a perpetrator engages in\n2l and what are the behaviors that are associated with those\n22 stages. So they did a very comprehensive literature review.\n23 They identified a number of specific behavioral and observable\n24 strategies that individuals have identified in the literature.\n25 They then got a group of recognized individuals in\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo79l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007921.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 53 of l5952\nLBAGmax2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl provided data supporting that this is a process that is well\n\n2 knoun and well established in the literature, and then it\n\nke pointed to directions that were needed for future work.

Can you explain?\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo792l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007922.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 54 of l5953\nLBAGmax2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl A. Sure. I think that certain things -—- some psychologists\n\n2 use clinical judgment on whether or not a perpetrator's\n\nke behaviors are considered grooming. But that certainly doesn't\n4 at all reference the scientific literature to determine what is\n5 and is not considered grooming. In addition, we also have data\n6 that's been provided by offenders themselves.\n\n7 In terms of reliability and validity of these\n\n8 judgments, the validity in psychological science refers to the\n9 degree to which you are measuring this particular thing, what\nlo you think you're measuring. So for example, the degree to\n\nll which there is significant overlap between what victims say\n\nl2 they experience and what offenders say that they have done\n\nl3 provides us with a measure of validity.\n\nl4 The degree to which different groups of individuals,\nl5 whether that's groups of professionals or groups of victims\n\nl6 agree in studies what it is that —- the process, what kinds of\nl7 behaviors, what's been done to the victim, what kinds of\n\nl8 behaviors are associated with the grooming process, to the\n\nl9 extent those professionals agree, that's a measure of\n2o reliability. Because you're geting different studies,\n2l different groups, different samples where there's significant\n22 overlap in what this dynamic and what this concept is.\n23 MS. POMERANTZ: I want to turn to Page 974.\n24 Q. I want you to focus on the section under conclusions and\n25 the first two sentences, so \"Currently.\"\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7922", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007923.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 55of l5954\nLBAGmax2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl THE COURT: Can you repeat that, please.\n\n2 MS.

Dr. Rocchio, what is your response to those two sentences?\n8 A. Again, I think that I would not agree with those\n\n) conclusions. I also think it's important to recognize that\n\nlo this article was published many years ago. And there's\n\nll certainly been evolutions and additional literature since the\nl2 time of publication. But even at the time of publication, I\n\nl3 think it's a litle misleading. If they're defining consensus\nl4 there as universal agreement as to exact -- everything within\nl5 the process of grooming, then sure. But when we're talking\n\nl6 about any patern of behavior or any phenomenon within the\n\nl7 social science, it's a complicated phenomenon. You're never\n\nl8 going to get universal agreement among experts. That's why you\nl9 have to look at what's the particular definition used within a\n2o study.\n2l But most definitely, there's consensus within the\n22 scientific literature about the phenomenon not only of\n23 grooming, but the phenomenon of child sexual abuse itself, what\n24 the experiences are of the victim and what the behaviors are of\n25 the offender and also the impact of those behaviors, in terms\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7923", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007941.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 73 of l5972\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl groomed and victimized.\n\n2 THE COURT: So given that there's a history of prior\n\n3 sexual abuse, would that be relevant -- is that relevant for\n\n4 you to understanding whether grooming occurred?\n\n5 THE WITNESS: Not necessarily, because when I'm\n\n6 looking at whether or not grooming occurred and when the\n\n7 literature is looking about whether or not grooming occurred,\n\n8 they're going to look at the specific circumstances associated\n9 with whatever it is you're looking at.

And in our adversarial system, the\ngovernment cannot shield its case from being tested. A defendant has a constitutional right to\npresent a defense. Crane, 476 U.S. at 69o.\n\nThe government’s case significantly depends on the credibility off, since no\nphysical evidence corroborates her allegations and because she is the named victim for several of\nthe counts. Where, as here, the defendant intends to cross-examine an essential government\nwitness, one who “provid[es] an essential link in the prosecution’s case, the importance of full\ncross-examination to disclose possible bias is necessarily increased.” Greene v. Wainwright, 634\nF.2d 272, 275 (Sth Cir. l98l). And as the Tenth Circuit has recognized in reversing a conviction\nbecause the defendant was deprived of the opportunity to question a government witness about\nhis mental health conditions and drug use, “i]t is just as reasonable that a jury be informed of a\nwitness’s mental incapacity at a time about which he proposes to testify as it would be for the\njury to knou that he then suffered an impairment of sight or hearing.” Robinson, 583 F.3d at\nl275.\n\nII. Professor Gershman’s Testimony is Admissible.\n\nThe government wrongly asserts that Professor Gershman’s testimony “is relevant only\nto the defense theories that the Court has excluded.” Mot. at 2o.

Mot. at 2l-26. Really\nonly two responses are in order.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s notices are as thorough as the government’s notices were, so the\ngovernment can hardly complain about being in the dark. But if this Court concludes otherwise,\nthe remedy is for Ms. Maxwell to provide additional notice; the remedy is not exclusion.\n\nMoreover, as the government concedes is permissible, Ms. Maxwell has endorsed these\nwitnesses in part out of an abundance of caution and in part because Ms. Maxwell still doesn’t\nknou what evidence the government will actually admit at trial. If testimony from these\nwitnesses is not relevant, Ms. Maxwell will not call them.

And, in case there were\nany doubt, the defendant herself looked at a scan of this book and came to the same <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>.\nGovernment Exhibit 52 should be admited.\n‘The defendant denied being involved in the creation of the document and said that she had\nstopped working for Epstein by the time this document was created. See, e.g., Tr. at 3l3, 323.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8279", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008307.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document535 Filed l2/o9/2l Page5of8\n3l4o366, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. 2ol7) (“The Court is unaware of any authority that authentication of\nemails can only come through a witness with direct knouledge of the drafting, and Defendant\nprovides none.”).\n\nConcluding that Mr. Alessi’s testimony sufficiently authenticates GX 52 follous this\nwell-tread path. Mr. Alessi’s testimony established an intimate familiarity with the distinctive\ndirectories used in the Palm Beach household over many years and during the time period of the\ncharged conspiracy. He testified that GX 52 was the same “type of book,” with the same type of\nbinding, cover, and information. This testimony of the appearance, content, substance, and other\ndistinctive characteristics of the exhibit is sufficient to satisfy Rule 9ol.”\n\nThe Defense’s further objections go to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.\nSee Tin Yat Chin, 37l F.3d at 38. For example, Mr. Alessi was crossed on voir dire that he did\nnot have personal knouledge about the creation of GX 52 or hou the exhibit had been\nmaintained since it was allegedly removed from the house. Trial Tr. at 875. He acknouledged\nthat he would not knou whether GX 52 had been altered in some way, such as whether pages\nhad been added or whether it had been rebound. Nor could he explain the addition of Post-It\nnotes and other pencil markings in the otherwise type-face book. Trial Tr. at 872-75. But it is\nwell setled that “any flaws in the chain of custody bear only on the weight of the evidence, and\nnot on its admissibility.” United States v.

Thus,\narguments as to the Government’s possession of the document or hou it has been maintained do\nnot go to authentication. See Al Farekh, 8lo F.

The\ndefendant would call Glassman to testify that he originally demanded a higher setlement from the\nEVCP. As the Court explained when the defendant raised this very issue at a break on December\nl, “there are personal knouledge questions in issue.” (Tr. 489). On cross, defense counsel asked\nJane if she knew whether her atorney asked the EVCP for more money, and she said she did not\nknou. (Tr. 558). Today, as on December l, evidence of Glassman’s negotiations with the EVCP\n(or the defendant) go to Jane’s bias only if Jane was aware of them. Jane testified that she was not\naware of them, and the evidence the defendant would elicit from Glassman would not cure that\ndefect. It is therefore improper impeachment. And for Glassman, as for Scarola and Edwards, the\nsuggestion that the jury should infer that Jane and Glassman had certain privileged conversations\nthat affect Jane’s knouledge from the fact that Glassman had other exchanges with other\nindividuals is more prejudicial than probative. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3.\n\nIl. <span class=\"highlight\">Conclusion</span>\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court should preclude testimony from Jack Scarola,\nBrad Edwards, and Robert Glassman.\n\n3 The defendant also argues that Glassman’s exchanges with the Government that “do not repeat\nor refer to statements by Jane” are not privileged. (Def. Leter at 8). Glassman’s statements in the\nemail are “Hey [prosecutor]. Hope you guys are staying safe. Here was her response about the\nlion king,” which are irrelevant. And the prosecutor’s statements can only be relevant to the extent\nthat Jane was aware of them. But the defense has not established that fact, in part because the\ndefense framed its questions on cross to call for privileged information. (See, e.g., Tr. 5ll (“The\ngovernment suggested to you that perhaps you meant to say The Lion King movie through your\natorney to you; correct?” (emphasis added))).\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo838l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008425.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document553- Filed l2/l7/2l Pagellof3\nHaddon, Morgan and Foreman, P.C\nJeffrey S.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan,\n\nI write in response to this Court’s order.\n\nAs to the first question, federal law is clear. “No longer, when a lawyer asks a witness\nwhether he made a certain statement, writen or not, is the lawyer required (as he was at common\nlaw, see Note of Advisory Commitee to Fed .R. Evid. 6l3(a)) to shou the statement or disclose\nits contents to the witness, though he must upon request shou it to opposing counsel.” United\nStates v. Marks, 8l6 F.2d l2o7, l2lo (7th Cir. l986) (Posner, J.).\n\nAs to the second question a statement provable by extrinsic evidence even though the\nwitness affirms that the 35oo material contains the inconsistent statement and also expresses\ndisagreement with the substance. By disagreeing with the substance, the witness has logically\nand necessarily denied making the statement (or failed to remember making the statement).\n\nThus, under Rule 6l3, the statement is inconsistent because it has “under any rational theory it\n\nmight lead to any relevant <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> different from any other relevant <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> resulting from\n\nanything the witness said.” United States v. Barile, 286 F.3d 749, 755 (4th Cir. 2oo2)\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8425", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008426.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document553 _ Filed l2/l7/2l Page2of3\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nDecember l5, 2o2l\nPage 2\n(Weinstein's Federal Evidence § 6l3.o4[l] (2d ed. 2ool)). To be sure, every time Jane denied\nmaking a statement but agreed the 35oo material reflected the statement, she denied its substance\nto the jury; the prior statement is therefore provable by extrinsic evidence because Jane’s trial\ntestimony—I did not make the prior statement, or I don’t remember making the prior statement,\nthe FBI agent made a typo—would lead to a relevant <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> different from any other\nrelevant <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> resulting from anything the witness said. See id. And referring Jane to the\n35oo material, which was not admited into evidence, is not sufficient to protect Ms. Maxwell’s\nright under Rule 6l3 to prove the statement by extrinsic evidence.\n\nExtrinsic evidence is disalloued only when the witness admits making the prior\ninconsistent statement. United States v. Jones, 578 F.2d l332, l34o (loth Cir. l978) (“The\nprinciple is that where it is sought to impeach a witness by shouing a prior inconsistent\nstatement and the witness admits the prior inconsistent statement, the witness is thereby\nimpeached and further testimony is not necessary.”). Where the witness admits the 35oo material\ncontains the statement, but denies making the statement or remembering making the statement,\nthe witness has not “admited the statement” within the meaning of Rule 6l3. Cf id.\n\nDue to the press of time, Ms. Maxwell’s counsel was not able to indicate each disputed\nprior inconsistent statement that was read into the record by the deadline of lo:l5 p.m.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8426", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008439.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document558 _ Filed l2/l9/2l Pagellof5\nU.S. Department of Justice\nse, United States Atorney\nAS. 27) Southern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

What does it mean to “infer” something? An inference is not a\n\n8 suspicion or a guess. It is a reasoned, logical decision to conclude that a disputed fact exists\n\n9 based on another fact that you are satisfied exists.\nlo There are times when different inferences may be drawn from facts, whether proven by\nll direct or circumstantial evidence.

An inference is a deduction or <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that you, the jury, are permited but not\nl6 required to draw from the facts that have been established by either direct or circumstantial\nl7 evidence. In drawing inferences, you should exercise your common sense.\nl8 Therefore, while you are considering the evidence presented to you, you may draw, from\nl9 the facts that you find to be proven, such reasonable inferences as would be justified in light of\n2o your experience.\n2l Some inferences, houever, are impermissible.

Accordingly, the Court DENIES Juror 5o’s motion to intervene.\n\nThe Court also DENIES the Defendant’s request to strike or seal the motion. The\nDefendant first requests that the Court strike Juror 5o’s motion, relying on the example of a civil\nforfeiture action and on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure l2(f). See Defense Motion, at 53 (citing\nUnited States v. All Right, Title & Int. in Prop., Appurtenances, & Improvements Knoun as 479\nTamarind Drive, Hallendale, Fla., No. 98 CIV. 2279 (DLC), 2oll WL lo45o95, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.\nMar. ll, 2oll)). Such authority is unpersuasive. Even in the civil context, “motions to strike are\ndisfavored and should not be granted ‘unless there is a strong reason for so doing.’” Bailey v.\nPataki, No. o8 Civ. 8563 (JSR), 2olo WL 234995, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.

Accordingly, the Court DENIES the Defendant’s\nrequest to strike the motion.\n\nThe Defendant alternatively requests that the Court seal Juror 5o’s motion until her\nmotion for a new trial is resolved. Defense Motion, at 54; see also Defense Ltr., Jan. l3, 2o22.\nThe three-part Lugosch test, as outlined above, compels denial of this request. First, Juror 5o’s\nmotion is a judicial document and accordingly subject to the presumption of access. It is clearly\n“relevant to the performance of a judicial function and useful in the judicial process.” United\nStates v. Amodeo, 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). Whether this Court grants or denies the\nmotion does not alter this <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>. See Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l2l (rejecting the argument that\n“until a district court knous the disposition of the underlying motion, any atempt at calling\nsomething a judicial document is premature”).

(Dkt. l22, 2lo, 293). The Court, citing the Second Circuit’s holding in United States v.\nJosephburg, 459 F.3d 35o, 355 (2d Cir. 2oo6), found that the motion was premature because Ms.\nMaxwell had not been convicted on the conspiracy counts and, hence, was not yet in jeopardy of\nreceiving multiple punishments for the same offense. (Dkt. 2o7 at 27-28; Dkt 3l7 at 9-lo). The\nCourt denied Ms. Maxwell’s motion without prejudice, deferring the resolution of the\nmultiplicity claim until after the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> of the trial. Jd.\n\nThe trial is nou over, and Ms. Maxwell was convicted on all three conspiracy counts.\nThe government’s theory of prosecution and the proof elicited at trial were entirely aligned with\nthe allegations in the Indictment — that Ms. Maxwell participated in a single criminal conspiracy\nwith Epstein, which may have evolved slightly over time, but always maintained the same\noverarching objective, the same core participants, and the same method of operation throughout\nthe entire time period in the Indictment. Ms. Maxwell nou faces the prospect of being punished\nmultiple times for the same offense in violation of her rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause.\nAccordingly, we move the Court to impose judgement on only one of the three conspiracy\ncounts.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n“An indictment is multiplicitous when it charges a single offense as an offense multiple\ntimes, in separate counts, when, in law and fact, only one crime has been commited.” United\nStates v. Chacko, l69 F.3d l4o, l45 (2d Cir. l999).

The government was correct that the proof at trial established, at\nmost, a single decade-long conspiracy between Epstein and Ms. Maxwell with multiple objects,\nrather than multiple independent conspiracies. An analysis of the Korfant factors confirms that\nthe three conspiracies charged in Counts One, Three, and Five are virtually identical and are\ntherefore multiplicitous.*\nl. Overlap of Participants and Time\n\nThere is no dispute that the central co-conspirators in all three charged conspiracies were\nEpstein and Ms. Maxwell. According to the government, Epstein and Ms. Maxwell were\n“partners in crime” who sexually exploited young girls throughout the entire ten-year time period\ncharged in the Indictment. Tr. 33:7-34:l3; Tr. 2842:ll-2845:9. Epstein was the principal abuser\nand Ms. Maxwell was his “best friend and right hand” and his “closest associate and second in\ncommand.” /d. Although other participants later joined the scheme, such as Sarah Kellen,\nEpstein and Ms. Maxwell were the core of the conspiracy from its inception in l994 through its\n<span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> in 2oo4. See United States v. Reid, 475 F. App’x 385, 387 (2d Cir. 2ol2)\n(“[C]hanges in membership do not necessarily convert a single conspiracy into multiple\nconspiracies, and there is no requirement that the same people be involved throughout the\nduration of the conspiracy.” (cleaned up)).\n\nFurthermore, the Mann Act conspiracies related to all four accusers who testified at\ntrial—Jane, Kate, Carolyn, and Annie Farmer—and spanned the same relevant ten-year period,\nl994-2oo4. Although the sex trafficking conspiracy (Count Five) related only to Carolyn and\nlasted for a shorter time period from 2ool-2oo4, that count, which was later added to the S2\nIndictment, did not describe a separate conspiratorial agreement. Rather, it was simply a subset\n* The first factor, an analysis of the criminal offenses charged in “successive indictments,” is inapplicable here\nbecause Ms. Maxwell has been charged with two § 37l conspiracies in the same indictment.

In Sampson v. United States, for\nexample, the First Circuit affirmed the district court’s decision to order a new penalty-\nphase hearing in a death penalty case after a juror falsely denied, among other things,\nhaving been a victim of a crime. 724 F.3d at l54, l62. In fact, houever, the juror\nrepeatedly had been menaced by her husband with a shotgun. /d. at l68.

Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43-48 (2d Cir. l997). Juror 5o’s press\nstatements shou he was biased in all three such ways.\n\nActual Bias: “Actual bias is ‘bias in fact’ — the existence of a state of mind that leads to an\ninference that the person will not act with entire impartiality. A juror is found by the judge to be\npartial either because the juror admits partiality, or the judge finds actual partiality based upon the\njuror’s voir dire answers.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 43 (internal citation omited); see United States v.\nHaynes, 398 F.2d 98o, 984 (2d Cir.l968) (actual bias is “based upon express proof, e.g., by a voir\ndire admission by the prospective juror of a state of mind prejudicial to a party’s interest’’).\n\nThis Court asked jurors about their history of sexual abuse because of the traumatic\nimplications for victims of abuse and the strong likelihood of bias where the issue to be tried is\nwhether complainants in fact were sexually abused. Psychological studies support this common\nsense <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>. A recent meta-analysis of nine studies of childhood sexual abuse victims siting\nas mock jurors in sex abuse cases “revealed that, compared with others, mock jurors with abuse\nexperience (sexually abused themselves or knew other victims) had higher levels of child victim\nempathy and, in turn, perceived the victim to be more credible and assigned more guilt to\ndefendants.” Child Victim Empathy Mediates The Influence Of Jurors’ Sexual Abuse Case\nJudgments: Metanalysis, 26 Pyschol.

Jurors with personal abuse histories are unlikely to be impartial.’’).\n\nHere, Juror 5o’s press statements reflect actual bias. He stated his oun sexual abuse\nexperience predisposed him to credit the stories of sexual abuse complainants despite delays in\nreporting and memory lapses.

Cas. at 5o. Such a juror “may declare that he feels no\nprejudice in the case; and yet the law cautiously incapacitates him from serving on the jury because\nit suspects prejudice, because in general persons in a similar situation would feel prejudice.” Jd.\n\nIn addition to these situations in which bias must be implied, there are situations where\nbias may be inferred. “Bias may be inferred when a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk of\npartiality sufficiently significant to warrant granting the trial judge discretion to excuse the juror\nfor cause, but not so great as to make mandatory a presumption of bias.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 47.\n\nHere, Juror 5o’s media statements establish both implied and inferred bias. The average\nperson who was sexually victimized and had Juror 5o’s feelings about the crime and those who\ncomplain about it could not be fair, his protestations to the contrary notwithstanding. To borrou\nChief Justice Marshall’s phrase, Juror 5o should have been “cautiously incapacitate[d]” from\nserving on this jury.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">CONCLUSION</span>\n\nThe Court should not allou any juror to thwart its screening process by giving inaccurate\nanswers and thereby create such a grave potential, realized in this case, for depriving the defendant\nof her right to a fair trial.

(See Gov’t Ex. A). According to the article,\nJuror 5o stated during this interview that he is “a survivor of sexual abuse.” (/d. at 2). Juror 5o\nreportedly indicated that he did not disclose the sexual abuse he experienced until “high school.”\n(/d. at 2). According to the article, Juror 5o “said he could not remember the details” of the juror\nquestionnaire, “but felt he had answered all questions honestly.” (/d. at 5).\n\nSecond, on or about January 5, 2o22, The Daily Mail published an article reporting another\ninterview with Juror 5o regarding his jury service.

Imagine the counterfactual scenario in which Juror No. 5o truthfully\nanswered Questions 25 and 48. If Ms. Maxwell had challenged Juror No. 5o for cause and this\nCourt had denied that challenge, Ms. Maxwell would be able to raise the issue in a new trial\nmotion and, if that were denied, on appeal. In the new trial motion or on appeal, Ms. Maxwell’s\nonly burden would be to prove that Juror No. 5o was impliedly, inferably, or actually biased.\nE.g., United States v. Haynes, 398 F.2d 98o, 983 (2d Cir. l968) (new trial required when a\ndeliberating juror is actually or impliedly biased). She would not have to prove any inadvertent\nfalsehoods or deceit by Juror No. 5o.\n\nIn the government’s view, houever, Ms. Maxwell must carry a heavier burden than she\notherwise would because Juror No. 5o did not tell the truth. That neither makes sense nor is fair.\nMs. Maxwell should not be punished because Juror No. 5o did not tell the truth, particularly\nwhen Ms. Maxwell could not have challenged Juror No. 5o for cause at the time precisely\nbecause he did not tell the truth and she lacked any ability to question the juror.\n\nFortunately, the government’s view is wrong, as five justices in McDonough made clear\nand the Second Circuit held in Langford. Under Second Circuit law, as the Court held in United\nStates v. Stewart, “[A] party alleging unfairness based on undisclosed juror bias must\ndemonstrate first, that the juror’s voir dire response was false and second, that the correct\nresponse would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” United States v. Stewart,\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo92o6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009207.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6- Filed o2/24/22 Pagel7 of 32\n433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (citing McDonough, 464 U.S. at 556). Ms. Maxwell need not\nprove a deliberate falsehood. Jd.\n\nThe government all but ignores Stewart, relying on United States v. Shaoul, 4l F.3d 8ll\n(2d Cir. l994), in an effort to minimize Langford. The government’s invocation of Shaoul fails.\n\nFirst, Shaoul did not reject the argument Ms. Maxwell makes here. Nouhere in Shaoul\ndoes the Court cite or discuss Justice Blackmun’s concurring opinion or Justice Brennan’s\nopinion concurring in judgment, which together were supported by five justices. See Shaoul, 4l\nF.3d at 8l5-l7. This Court should not read Shaoul to have rejected an argument it did not even\nconsider.\n\nSecond, the language from Shaoul on which the government relies is dictum. That’s\nbecause the Shaoul Court held that the defendant could not “satisfy the second part of the\nMcDonough test—that the juror could have been challenged for cause.” /d. at 8l6. The Court’s\ndiscussion of deliberate-versus-inadvertent false answers thus was not necessary to its\n<span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>, and this Court is not bound by it. Jama v. Immigr. & Customs Enf’t, 543 U.S. 335,\n352 n.l2 (2oo5) (“Dictum setles nothing, even in the court that uters it.”’).\n\nThird, if the government’s reading of Shaoul were correct, then Shaoul is inconsistent\nwith Langford, not to mention McDonough. Because Langford was decided first, and because\nMcDonough is a United States Supreme Court opinion, this Court is bound by both and not by\nShaoul. Compare United States v. Wilkerson, 36l F.3d 7l7, 732 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (one panel of the\nCourt of Appeals is “bound by the decisions of prior panels until such time as they are overruled\neither by an en banc panel of our Court or by the Supreme Court”), with Indep. Cmty. Bankers of\nAm. v. Bd. of Governors of Fed. Rsrv. Sys., l95 F.3d 28, 34 (D.C.

Juror No. 5o’s answers were deliberately false.\n\nEven so, the record more than supports the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that Juror No. 5o’s answers to\nQuestions 25 arc] 4 8 ll\nBN were deliberately false. Juror No. 5o knew he was the victim of a crime. He was a\nprospective juror in a case where the accused was on trial for alleged sexual misconduct with\nminors. As the childhood victim of a sex crime, answering questions in a case about a childhood\nsex crime, there is no plausible explanation for why Juror No. 5o did not answer Question 25,\n“Yes.” The only believable answer is that he knew that answering that question “Yes” would\nlead to further questions like, what was the crime, which would then lead to questions about what\nhappened to him, which would end with his disqualification.\n\n® Greer, 285 F.3d at l73.\n\n7 A deliberately false answer by a juror in voir dire is thus neither necessary nor sufficient\nto entitle a defendant to a new trial. It’s not necessary because, if a biased juror actually serves\non a jury, structural error occurs, and a new trial is required even if the juror did not provide a\ndeliberately false answer during voir dire. Martinez-Salazar, 528 U.S. at 3l6; McDonough, 464\nUS. at 556-57 (Blackmun, J., concurring); id. at 557-58 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment);\nSmith, 455 U.S. at 2l5-l6; id. at 22o-24 (O’Connor, J., concurring); Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3;\nGreer, 285 F.3d t l7l-72; Langford, 99o F.2d at 68. And it’s not sufficient because a juror may\nnot be biased even if he dishonestly answers a question during voir dire. Greer, 285 F.3d at l73\n(“[A]n analysis of bias is required even if the juror’s erroneous response was deliberate.”).\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo92o9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009211.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6- Filed o2/24/22 Page 2l of 32\nD. If Juror No. 5o had truthfully answered Questions 25 and 48, the\ncorrect responses would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for\ncause.\n\nIt is both unnecessary and premature for this Court to consider whether Juror No. 5o was\nactually biased.\n\nIt’s unnecessary because any bias is sufficient to require a new trial, and here the record\nshous that Juror No. 5o was both impliedly and inferably biased. Because Juror No. 5o was\nimpliedly and inferably biased, a new trial is required. Martinez-Salazar, 528 U.S. at 3l6. And\nit’s premature because the actual bias inquiry depends in part on the statements a prospective\njuror makes during voir dire. United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. l997) (“A juror is\nfound by the judge to be partial either because the juror admits partiality, or the judge finds\nactual partiality based upon the juror’s voir dire answers.”’). Here, Juror No. 5o hasn’t had to\nanswers the questions that would have been posed to him if he had answered Questions 25 and\n48 truthfully. Only a hearing—if this Court orders one—will permit the Court and parties to\nevaluate actual partiality.\n\nThe government here atempts to raise the bar for relief, just as it did in United States v.\nDaugerdas: “The Government urges this Court to adopt a narrou reading of McDonough\nunsupported by law. But contrary to the Government’s contention, the test is not whether the true\nfacts would compel the Court to remove a juror for cause, but rather whether a truthful response\n‘would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.’” United States v. Daugerdas, 867\nF. Supp. 2d 445, 468 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol2) (ordering new trial for two of three defendants based on\njuror providing false answers during voir dire and concluding that the third defendant waived the\nnew trial argument), vacated and remanded sub nom.

Juror No. 5o is not entitled to discovery in advance of the hearing.\n\nFinally, for all the reasons given in the new trial motion and the leters about sealing, Ms.\nMaxwell maintains that Juror No. 5o should not be provided a copy of the questionnaire, which\nis currently under seal in this Court. Providing that questionnaire will only distort the search for\nthe truth by allouing Juror No. 5o to further refine his story and excuses. Of course, if this Court\norders a hearing, Juror No. 5o will receive his questionnaire at that time. But balanced against\nMs. Maxwell’s constitutional right to a fair and impartial jury and this Court’s unflagging duty to\ninvestigate Ms. Maxwell’s claim, Juror No. 5o’s request for the questionnaire nou pales in\ncomparison.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Conclusion</span>\n\nLet there be no doubt. The prosecution’s response is not credible because the government\nhas the luxury of a double standard. If a juror had falsely answered material voir dire questions\nto favor Ms. Maxwell, the government would not hesitate to prosecute the juror for contempt or\nperjury. But when, as here, a juror falsely answers voir dire questions to favor the prosecution,\nthe government invokes words like “finality” and “disfavor” and sighs, “well, no trial is perfect.”\n\nBut all trials, perfect or not, require a fair and impartial jury. That is non-negotiable. That\nis the premise and fundamental guarantee of the criminal justice system, a system that was\nundermined by Juror No. 5o’s misconduct.\n\nJuror No. 5o was not fair and impartial. His presence on the jury violated Ms. Maxwell’s\nSixth Amendment rights and constituted structural, reversible error.

Problems of Law and Ethics (9\" ed. 2ol2). I have spoken hundreds of times on the subject of\nlegal ethics at state and local bar associations nationwide and at American Bar Association\nmeetings, at state and federal judicial conferences, and at law firms and corporate law offices in\nthe United States and abroad. For more than a decade, I have been and remain active in the legal ;\nethics work of the ABA’s Center for Professional Responsibility, spending hundreds of hours\nyearly on this work. Most recently, I have been a member of the ABA’s Ethics 2o/2o\nCommission, a three and a half year project to review the rules of ethics governing lawyers in\nlight of globalization and advance in technology. I have writen widely in the area, including for\nlaw journals and the law and popular press. Legal ethics is-the primary focus of my academic\nresearch. My resume is annexed as Exhibit A.\nQuestion Addressed And Summary Of <span class=\"highlight\">Conclusion</span>\n2. I have been asked to address the question the Court posed on February l6, 2ol2 —\nnamely, “whether the atorneys for Brune & Richard involved in this mater would have satisfied\ntheir ethical obligations if they failed to disclose the contents of the July 2l leter and their\ncomplete investigation into Juror No. l.” The question does not specify a time frame for any’\npossible “failfure] to disclose.” I have been asked, therefore, to address any disclosure duty in\nMarch, May, and July of 2oll. I have not been asked to address, and I am not addressing, the\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9447", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009450.jpg": "Case (2oeN8oGRB PAgcun Bot Gmentl6l 6622o lRildd) 8ANBA 2P ag Peyef SB of ll7\nA-5846\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 522 Filed o4/o6/l2 Page 4 of 29\nshall promptly reveal the fraud to the tribunal.” Jd. at 6l (emphasis added)(quoting DR 7-\nlo2(B)(2) of the Code of Professional Responsibility). The district judge concluded that Doe had\n“qnformation clearly establishing” deposition perjury because he had “clear and convincing\nevidence of [the] witness’s perjury.” Jd. Doe himself testified that “he believed that [the] witness\nhad lied at the deposition.” Id. at 59.\nll. Without rejecting the louer court’s factual finding that Doe had clear and convincing\nevidence of fraud on the tribunal, the Doe Court held that “clearly establishing” required more. It\nheld that “knouledge is required before the disclosure duty arises.” Jd at 62. Clear and\nconvincing proof, which is an objective test, did not trigger a reporting duty. That a lawyer\n“strongly suspected” fraud on the tribunal (a subjective test) was also insufficient. Jd. at 63. As\nthe Court noted: ,\n_ Our experience indicates that if any standard less than actual knouledge was adopted in\nthis context [i.e., DR 7-lo2(B)(2)], serious consequences might follou. If atorneys were\nbound as part of their ethical duties to report to the court each time they strongly\nsuspected that a witness lied, courts would be inundated with such reports. Court dockets\nwould quickly become overburdened with conducting these collateral proceedings which\nwould necessarily hold up the ultimate disposition of the underlying action. We do not\nbelieve that the Code's drafters intended to throu the court system into such a morass.\nInstead, it seems that the only reasonable <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> is that the drafters intended\ndisclosure of only that information which the atorney reasonably knous to be a fact and\nwhich, when combined with other facts in his knouledge, would clearly establish the\nexistence of a fraud on the tribunal.\nTo interpret the rule to-:mean otherwise would be to require atorneys to disclose mere\nsuspicions of fraud which are based upon incomplete information or information which\n. _ may fall short of clearly establishing the existence of a fraud. We do not suggest,\n\n' houever, that by requiring that the atorney have actual knouledge of a fraud before he is\nbound to disclose it, he must wait until he has proof beyond a moral certainty that fraud\nhas been commited. Rather, we simply conclude that he must clearly knou, rather than\nsuspect, that a fraud on the court has been commited before he brings this knouledge to\nthe court's atention.\n\nId. Discipline was reversed.”\nl2. In an adversary legal system like ours, mandatory disclosure rules, which operate as a\ncheck on the premises of that system, receive scrutiny and debate from the courts and the bar\nover their proper scope. Furthermore, American jurisdictions do not all agree on hou to\nreconcile competing interests — those of the client, the tribunal, and the adversary.

None of\nthe lawyers had knouledge that the Bronx lawyer and juror Conrad were the same person. None\neven had “clear and convincing” evidence or “strongly suspected” — the objective and subjective\ntests Doe rejected — they were the same person. Trzaskoma and Brune (who was told of the\ndiscovery though not shoun the suspension order that Trzaskoma discovered but did not print)\nresolved to await juror Conrad’s voir dire answers. Those answers, including juror Conrad’s\nBronxville address, directly contradicted any identity between the juror and the lawyer. This was\n_in fact compelling. If the sworn answers were true, the juror was not the lawyer. A contrary\n<span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> would require the lawyers to believe that a suspended lawyer would repeatedly\nperjure herself in federal court in order to sit on a jury.\nEvents in May 2oll\nl6. Juror Conrad gave the Court a note asking if the jury was going to be instructed on\nvicarious liability and respondeat superior. The contents of the note led Trzaskoma, assisted by\nothers at the firm, to take another look at the issue the next day. The 2olo suspension order and\nan earlier suspension order from 2oo7 were found. Both identified a Bronx lawyer. A paralegal\ndiscovered the Westlaw profile and forwarded it to Trzaskoma in an email that highlighted\nselected information. After seeing the selected information but before reviewing the entire\nprofile, Trzaskoma wrote “Jesus, I do think it’s her,” but then, after reviewing the entire profile,\nchanged her mind in light of the contradiction between the juror’s voir dire answers and the\nlimited information about lawyer Conrad (different levels of education, different addresses, etc.).\nIn addition, Trzaskoma did not believe that the given age of the Bronx lawyer agreed with the\napparent age of juror Conrad.\nl7. Trzaskoma discussed the issue with Brune and Edelstein later in the day. All three\nconcluded that juror Conrad was not the suspended lawyer. Co-counsel with whom the mater\n_ was thereafter informally discussed thought the question not worth pursuing. Because the Brune\n& Richard lawyers did not believe — let alone have actual knouledge — that the juror and the\nsuspended lawyer were the same person, they did not present their information to the Court. At\nleast five lawyers, based on what they had seen or been told, reached this <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>.\nl8. At this time, as earlier, no Brune & Richard lawyer had actual knouledge that juror\nConrad was lawyer Conrad. Actual knouledge is the mental state that creates the disclosure duty\nunder New York Rules 3.3(b) and 3.5(d). There was no ethical duty to reveal a suspicion, even a\nstrong suspicion.\nl9. Any notion that silence was intended to preserve undetected a basis for a new trial motion\nin the event of conviction is belied by the lawyers’ actions. There was no effort to seek a new\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9452", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009453.jpg": "Case T2psersGo3388?

There was no\nduty to do so. I accept that the Brune & Richard lawyers could anticipate a possible waiver claim\nand could see hou the government could cite the information that they had in March and May to\nbolster that claim. But the lawyer ethics rules impose no general duty to volunteer information\nthat an opponent might use to support its argument and the exceptions in the rules cited do not\ncreate one specifically.\n2l. To put it otherwise, in order to find a duty to reveal there must be a source of the duty.\nProfessional conduct rules do impose duties to reveal, but they do so in a way that gives lawyers\nnotice of their requirements. No rule required disclosure of the information discovered in March\nor May. Any such rule would have to specify the information required to be revealed and the\nlevel of confidence in the accuracy of that information. Here, the rules imposing a duty to\ndisclose to the tribunal are Rules 3.3(b) and 3.5(d). These rules use actual knouledge as the level\nof confidence required for the duty to disclosure. The information the lawyers had about the\nmaterial they had gathered in March and May negates actual knouledge; the actions of the\nlawyers are consistent only with a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> of a lack of actual knouledge. In sum, only if the\nlawyers had had actual knouledge in March or May would they have had to reveal that in July,\nand they did not have actual knouledge.\n22. In certain places, the memorandum contains statements that are apparently alleged to\nimply that the Brune & Richard lawyers did not have information about juror Conrad’s identity\nprior to June 2o, when they received a copy of her leter to the government.\n° Because the premises of the adversary system are central here, instruction from the contiguous world\nof Rule ll is again apt: ,\n\nThe primary purpose of Rule ll is to deter baseless court filings, but this goal must be\n\nconsidered in light of the fact that, in an adversary system of litigation, the essence of the\n\nlawyer's task is to present issues of facts and law “as favorably as fairly possible” in support of\n\nthe client's claim. See United Nat. Ins. Co. v. R & D Latex Corp., 242 F.3d llo2, ll5 (9\" Cir.\n\n2ool). Therefore, judges should “impose sanctions on lawyers for their mode of advocacy only ’\n\nin the most egregious situations, lest lawyers be deterred from vigorous representation of\n\ntheir clients.” Id.

The lawyers wrote: “The tone and content of the leter, which were in sharp contrast to\nthe image Conrad had projected through the trial (‘always head doun, taking notes’), caused\ndefendants concern and prompted them to investigate.” Memorandum at 9. And they later wrote:\n“This is not 2 situation where Conrad disclosed sufficient information to warrant inquiry by\ncounsel. Defendants had no basis to inquire whether Conrad was lying in response to each of the\nCourt’s questions.” Memorandum at 32, n.l3 (internal citation and parenthetical quote omited).\n24. In my opinion, these statements should be seen as true, not merely literally true in a\nhypertechnical or crabbed sense of the word, but true as reasonably read. They do not become\nuntrue because a reader may draw a false inference that the lawyers did not intend. The juror’s\nleter did cause concern and did prompt an investigation, as the first quotation in the\nmemorandum states. That statement does not disclaim a prior search, whether that prior search is\ncalled an investigation or something else. I believe that focus on the word “investigate,” which is\nnot a term of art, would be misguided here. The sentence correctly describes what the leter\ncaused the lawyers to do.\n25. The second quote focuses on the voir dire in March and is also true as reasonably read.\nThe lawyers had concluded that the order suspending a lawyer with the same name as juror\nConrad was not a “basis” for an inquiry into the truthfulness of juror Conrad’s answers. Just the\nopposite. Her voir dire answers, in their view, dispelled reason for inquiry. A suspended lawyer\nwould not lie under oath at voir dire, they reasoned, given the consequences to the lawyer’s\nability ever to regain admission to practice. In my opinion, this <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> was compelling.\n26. It is also my opinion that the July 8, 2oll, memorandum, taken as a whole, does not\nshou a “knouing[]” violation of the provisions of Rule 3.3. It is true that even when a lawyer\ndoes not have a duty to speak, if she does speak, she may not knouingly misrepresent to a court\nor adversary. But an unintended inference is not a misrepresentation. The lack of disclaimer\nlanguage in the memorandum’s true statements — the fact that the lawyers, while focused on the\nnew trial motion, did not anticipate what a reader might infer and what they did not mean to\n\n° imply — is not an action that can support a finding of unethical behavior under the New York\n\nRules.\n27. The lawyers understandably nou wish they had not included these passages as writen.\nGreater focus might have led them to anticipate hou others might read them differently than\nintended, and to omit them (they were unnecessary to the motion), rephrase them, or add the\nhistory of their earlier research. .\n\nThe July l5 Telephone Conference\n28. ‘In the July l5 telephone conference, the Court said that it wanted to “ascertain from each\nof the defendants ...whether any of them were aware of the disturbing things that have been\nrevealed by defense on this motion concerning Juror Number One [Conrad].” The Court invited\na response on the call or via leter. Trzaskoma’s response was:\n\nTrzaskoma: We were not aware of the facts that have come to light, and I think if your\n\nHonor deems it appropriate, we can submit a leter.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9454", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009455.jpg": "Case l{2oser4oo33o& ABcurDoecureat 6lo9/2o Filed G@z2ah PagPaged 36 of ll7\n‘A-585l\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 522 Filed o4/o6/l2 Page 9 of 29\nThe Court: All right.

I think it’s more appropriate.\n29. This colloquy must be read in its (rather brief) entirety, that is, as a whole. Trzaskoma’s\nstatement implies that the answer to the Court’s question from Brune & Richard would not be\nthat it had no information at all. It would not require a leter to say only that.

Maxwell Br. at 28. But resolving the motion nou would require the Court to accept\nas true Juror 5o’s unsworn statements made to media outlets. Moreover, in arguing for a new\ntrial based on the current record, the Defendant relies extensively on statements prohibited from\nconsideration by Rule 6o6. E.g., Maxwell Br. at l2—l4 (describing Juror 5o’s statements in\ndeliberation and other jurors’ reactions). The Defendant also urges the Court to reach factual\nconclusions that are unavailable on the current record; for example, that Juror 5o deliberately\nlied in failing to disclose that he was the victim of sexual abuse. See Maxwell Br. at 39-43.\nFinally, the Defendant cites no authority—nor is the Court aware of any—in which a court\ngranted a new trial under the McDonough standard without first conducting an evidentiary\nhearing. As the Second Circuit has instructed, “if any significant doubt as to a juror’s\nimpartiality remains in the wake of objective evidence of false voir dire responses, an\nevidentiary hearing generally should be held.” United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o6 (2d\nCir. 2oo6) (citing United States v. Boney, 977 F.2d 624, 634 (D.C. Cir. l992)). The Court\ntherefore denies the Defendant’s motion to grant a new trial on the current record.\nII. Evidentiary hearing\n\nFor the reasons outlined belou, the Court determines that a hearing must be held\nregarding Juror 5o’s alleged nondisclosure during the jury selection process.\n\nA. Threshold for an evidentiary hearing\n\nBecause of the importance of finality of judgments, the threshold for conducting a post-\nverdict inquiry is high. A post-verdict inquiry into juror misconduct is conducted only “when\nthere is clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific, nonspeculative\nimpropriety has occurred which could have prejudiced the trial of a defendant.” United States v.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9546", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009561.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62o_ Filed o2/25/22 Page 2o of 2l\nthe Defendant’s motion for a new trial.

During trial, the Court granted defense requests\nfor limiting instructions at the time evidence came in to avoid the precise concern the defendant\nnou articulates. (Tr. ll67-68 (Kate); 2o48-49 (Annie)). See Gross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *27\n(explaining that the Court identified no case “in which the Second Circuit has ever found a\nconstructive amendment when a district court issued limiting instructions properly defining the\nscope of the alleged crime”). And at the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> of trial, the Court explained that Count Two\nalleged that the defendant “enticed Jane to travel across state lines with the intent that she would\nengage in sexual activity for which a person could be charged with a crime under the penal law of\nNew York State.” (Tr. 3o34; see Tr. 3o3l (describing the third element of Count Two to require\nproof of an intent to violate “New York law as alleged in the indictment”)). Similarly, the Court\nexplained that Count Four alleged that the defendant knouingly transported Jane “‘with the intent\nthat Jane engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense in\nviolation of New York law.” (Tr. 3o37; see Tr. 3o35 (describing the second element of Count\nFour to require proof of an intent to violate “New York law as alleged in the indictment”)). For\nboth Counts, the Court specifically instructed the jury on one and only one predicate state offense:\na violation of New York Penal Law Section l3o.55. (Tr. 3o34, 3o37). The instructions on Counts\nOne and Three incorporated this discussion of the elements of Counts Two and Four, and the only\nstatute the Court identified in its discussion of the relevant overt acts was New York Penal Law\nSection l3o.55. (Tr. 3o49-5o, 3o56-57).\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9572", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009573.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pagellof5l\n2. There is No Substantial Likelihood That The Jury Convicted The Defendant\nSolely Because Jane was Sexually Abused in New Mexico\n\nThe defendant argues that a constructive amendment or variance occurred because the jury\n“improperly based their conviction solely on the sexual abuse that Jane experienced in New\nMexico.” (Def. Mot. at l3). That argument can be readily rejected. There is no likelihood—much\nless a substantial likelihood—that the jury disregarded the Court’s instructions and applied an\nunidentified New Mexico law to brief testimony about Jane’s abuse in New Mexico and convicted\nthe defendant solely on that basis.\n\nNeither the Government’s proof at trial nor the Court’s jury instructions provide a basis for\nthat <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>. At no point during the trial, including its summation, did the Government argue\nthat the jury could convict on a theory that the defendant intended Jane to be abused in New\nMexico.\n\nSimilarly, the Court’s charge required the jury to decide whether the defendant intended to\nviolate New York law. The jury was not informed of the age of consent in New Mexico or any\nparticular criminal statute in New Mexico. The defendant does not explain hou the jury charge\npermited the jury to convict the defendant for transporting Jane to New Mexico with the intent\nthat she engage in sexual activity violative of some unidentified New Mexican criminal law.”\n\nIn support of her argument, the defendant relies on (l) the fact that Jane testified about\nbeing sexually abused in New Mexico, and (2) the jury note regarding New Mexico. (/d.) Neither\n? Ironically, it is the defendant who proposed instructing the jury on the relevant ages of consent\nin states other than New York. (See Dkt. No. 4lo-l at 5l-52). Such an instruction would have\nprovided the jury some state law to compare to the facts and determine whether it was violated,\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9573", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009575.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pagel3oof5l\nwhich gave rise to a constructive amendment. Relative to that evidence, Jane’s testimony about\nNew Mexico, spanning less than three pages of the transcript of her direct examination, was brief\nand general. (Tr. 32l-23). All of this evidence was a “a single set of discrete facts consistent with\nthe charge in the indictment.” Gross, 2ol7 WL 4865ll, at *2l (quoting D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at\n4l9). And even if that were not so, the Government is permited “significant flexibility in proof”\nso long as the defendant has “notice of the core of criminality to be proven at trial,” as the defendant\nundoubtedly did. Lebedev, 932 F.3d at 53.\n\nThe defendant overstates the issue by suggesting that a constructive amendment would\nhave occurred if the jury “based their conviction solely on the sexual abuse that Jane experienced\nin New Mexico.” (Def. Mot. at l3). In fact, the jury was free to rely principally on that evidence\nto satisfy elements of Counts One, Three and Four. That is, the jury could have convicted even if\nno sexual abuse occurred in New York, so long as it concluded that the defendant intended for\nabuse to occur in New York. And evidence of the defendant’s knouledge of sexual abuse that\noccurred in New Mexico would support such a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> about the defendant’s intent as to what\nwould happen in New York. But there is no substantial likelihood that the jury erroneously\nconvicted the defendant of transporting Jane to New Mexico with the intent that she be abused in\nviolation of some law in New Mexico. That theory of guilt was neither pursued by the Government\nnor available under the Court’s jury instructions. See Lebedev, 932 F.3d at 54 (“[T]he evidence at\ntrial directly addressed the core of criminality charged in the indictment... .”). It is not a\nconstructive amendment that the Government presented relevant evidence that could lead to a\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9575", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009576.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pagel4of5l\nconviction outside of the scope of the S2 Indictment only if taken entirely in isolation and applied\nby a jury that disobeyed the Court’s instructions.\n\nb. The Second Jury Note\n\nThe defendant argues that, notwithstanding the tight connection between the Indictment,\nevidence at trial, and jury instructions, the jury in fact actually convicted the defendant for\ntransporting Jane to New Mexico to engage in criminal sexual activity there. This argument relies\nalmost entirely on a single jury note.\n\nDuring deliberations, the jury sent the follouing note:\n\nUnder Count Four, if the defendant aided in the transportation of Jane’s\n\nreturn flight, but not the flight to New Mexico, where/if the intent was\n\nfor Jane to engage in sexual activity, can she be found guilty under the\n\nsecond element?\n(Tr. 3l26). The note led to a lengthy discussion, at the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> of which the Court concluded\nit should refer the jury back to the jury charge on the second element of Count Four because the\njury note was otherwise “too difficult to parse factually and legally.” (Tr. 3l26-4o).\n\nThat night, the defense filed a leter seeking reconsideration of the Court’s response and\nraising the possibility of a constructive amendment or prejudicial variance. (Dkt. No. 566 at 2-3).\nThe defense asked the Court to give an additional instruction in the morning. (/d. at 7). That\nproposal instructed the jury as to the intent elements of Counts Two and Four, and ended with the\nsentence that “[a]n intent that Jane engage in sexual activity in any state other than New York\ncannot form the basis of these two elements of Counts Two and Four.” (/d.)\n\nThe Court rejected the defendant’s request. The Court noted that the jury did not inquire\nabout Count Two, so there was no basis to respond to the jury note with information about Count\nl3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9576", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009579.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pagel7of5l\n\nThat fact is compounded by the lack of clarity about where the jury believed the sexual\nactivity occurred. It is not clear whether the flight on which the “intent was for Jane to engage in\nsexual activity” references the flight to New Mexico, as the defendant suggests, or the return flight.\nIf it is the flight to New Mexico, it would still be probative evidence on Count Two, albeit not\nsufficient for conviction. If it is a flight from New Mexico, it would also still be probative and\nwould not pose any risk that the jury convicted based on conduct occurring in New Mexico. And\nif the jury thought that the defendant intended Jane to engage in sexual activity at the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>\nof a return flight from New Mexico to New York, it could well have been sufficient for conviction\non Count Two.\n\nThe issue is further confused by the uncertainty about the question posed by the jury. The\ndefendant understands the question to be about whether sexual activity in New Mexico is sufficient\nto find the defendant guilty. First, the jury’s question does not ask whether certain facts are\nsufficient for guilt; it asks whether the defendant “‘can be found guilty” ifa certain fact is true. The\ndefendant “can” be found guilty based in part on sexual activity occurring in New Mexico, as\ndescribed above. That is a perfectly sensible question for the jury to ask—indeed, it was repeatedly\nraised by defense counsel to the Court at trial. (See, e.g., Tr. 3l49 (Court stating: “This is the same\ndiscussion we’ve had a couple of times [defense counsel]. Sexual activity with respect to Jane in\nNew Mexico under the age of l7 can be relevant to an intent to transport to New York to engage\nin sexual activity under the age of l7, I think. I think this is the same basic discussion that we’ve\nhad. So... I think the proposal made by the defense is wrong.”). And second, the question\nspecifically uses the word “aided,” suggesting that the jury note may have been a question about\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9579", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009582.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 2oof5l\ndefendant based on an unsupported speculative leap from Jane’s testimony. That is not plausible,\nand it certainly is not a “substantially likely” <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that can be drawn from an inscrutable\njury note.\n\nSecond, even if the jury was so confused, the Court’s response ameliorated that confusion.\nThe Court did not tell the jury that it could convict based solely on conduct occurring in New\nMexico. Instead, it referred the jury to the instruction that explained that the second element of\nCount Four requires the Government to prove the defendant’s intent “that Jane engage in sexual\nactivity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense in violation of New York\nLaw,” and further stated that “Count Four alleges sexual activity for which an individual could be\ncharged with a violation of New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55.” (Inst. No. 2l). The defendant\ndoes not argue that this instruction incorrectly states the law.* Nor does the instruction make any\nreference to New Mexico whatsoever, much less does it suggest that conviction is available if the\ndefendant intended to violate some New Mexican statute. The jury is presumed to have folloued\nthis instruction correctly. See United States v. Joyner, 3l3 F.3d 4o, 47 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (reciting the\n* The defendant complains that the jury instructions were “stripped of any mention of travel to\nNew York,” such as a limitation that the travel be “from Florida to New York.” (Def. Mot. at l-\n2, l5). The defendant tried to incorporate several limitations from the “to wit” clause of the\nIndictment into the jury charge, and the Court correctly rejected that atempt, because the\nGovernment is not strictly bound by facts in the “to wit” clause of an indictment. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Litle, 828 F. App’x 34, 38 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (“Such a discrepancy, houever, does not rise\nto the level of a constructive amendment because ‘to wit’ clauses do not modify essential elements\nof the offense.”). For instance, if the jury had concluded that the defendant transported Jane from\nNew Mexico to New York with intent to violate New York law—which is one available reading\nof the jury note—that would be a permissible basis for conviction, but outside the limitations\nproposed by the defendant. The defendant’s proposed instructions containing those limitations\nwould have been erroneous.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9582", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009592.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 3oof5l\n\nThe defendant asks the Court to ignore these legal distinctions. In particular, the defendant\nurges the Court not to apply the first Korfant factor, claiming—without explanation—that this first\nfactor applies to claims arising from successive prosecutions, and not multiplicity claims. (Def.\nMot. at 22 n.4). But the Korfant factors are applied both when courts compare indictments in\nsuccessive prosecutions and when courts analyze counts in the same indictment.’ See, e.g.,\nGuzman, 7 F. App’x at 54-55 (applying the Korfant factors to a claim of multiplicity arising from\nmultiple conspiracy counts in the same indictment); United States v. Diallo, 5o7 F. App’x 89, 9l\n(2d Cir. 2ol3) (holding that two narcotics conspiracy counts charged in the same case were not\nmultiplicitous under the Korfant factors); Estrada, 32o F.3d at l8o-8l (applying the Korfant\nfactors to a successive prosecution); Satar, 3l4 F. Supp. 2d at 3o7 (applying the Korfant factors\nto a successive prosecution). For good reason: it would make litle sense to ignore the legal\ndistinctions between counts when determining whether those counts are different in law and fact\nfor double jeopardy purposes. See United States v. Hicks, 5 F.4th 27o, 275 (2d Cir. 2o2l) (citing\nBlockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299 (l932)). The defendant asks this Court to ignore the\nfirst Korfant factor because it is fatal to her multiplicity claim. The two counts are legally distinct,\nand the Court can and should reject the defendant’s multiplicity claim for this reason alone.\n7 The lone case cited by the defendant, United States v. Cooper, 886 F.3d l46 (D.C. Cir. 2ol8),\nheld that two § 37l counts in the same indictment were multiplicitous. (Def. Mot. at 22 n.4). In\nreaching that <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>, the Court did not hold that the first Korfant factor was inapplicable to\nthat particular procedural posture. The defendant otherwise cites no case in which a court held\nthat it was inappropriate to examine the legal differences between counts when evaluating a\nmultiplicity claim.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9592", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009613.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page5lof5l\n<span class=\"highlight\">CONCLUSION</span>\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Government respectfully submits that the Court should\ngrant the defendant’s motion as to Count One, and otherwise deny the defendant’s post-trial\nmotions.\nDated: February 25, 2o22\nNew York, New York\nRespectfully submited,\nDAMIAN WILLIAMS\nUnited States Atorney for the\nSouthern District of New York\nBy: /s/\nMaurene Comey\nAlison Moe\nLara Pomerantz\nAndrew Rohrbach\nAssistant United States Atorneys\n5o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo96l3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009721.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 29 of 66\nsecond, that the correct response would have provided a valid basis for\na challenge for cause.\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33 provides that, “[uJpon the defendant’s\nmotion, the court may vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice\nso requires.” Fed.

United States, for\nexample, the First Circuit affirmed the district court’s decision to order a new penalty-\nphase hearing in a death penalty case after a juror falsely denied, among other things,\nhaving been a victim of a crime. 724 F.3d at l54, l62. In fact, houever, the juror\nrepeatedly had been menaced by her husband with a shotgun. /d. at l68. But because the\njuror had not told the truth during voir dire, she was seated on a jury in a case involving a\nbank robbery in which the defendant threatened bank tellers at gunpoint. /d. “These\nparallels,” the Court said, “raise a serious concern as to whether an ordinary person in\n[the juror’s] shoes would be able to disregard her oun experiences in evaluating the\nevidence.” Jd.\n\nTo be sure, the juror in Sampson did not limit her false answers to a single\nquestion. She also answered falsely to several other questions during voir dire, some\nmaterial and some not. /d. at l62-63, l66. A combination of factors led the First Circuit\nto affirm the order for a new penalty-phase hearing. /d. at l68. Here, Juror No. 5o’s false\n\nJuror No. 5o’s confidence in his memory is not necessarily a predictor of the\nmemory’s reliability. As Dr. Loftus testified, “when you have post-event suggestion or\nintervention, people get very confident about their wrong answers, and you can see that\neven wrong answers or false information, false memories can be expressed with a high\ndegree of confidence.” TR at 243o.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9732", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009733.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 4l of 66\nanswers to Questions 25 and 48 are reason enough to order a new trial because they relate\nto the core allegations against Ms. Maxwell. Moreover, if this Court orders an evidentiary\nhearing, it is likely additional false answers will come to light, further supporting the\n<span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that Ms. Maxwell is entitled to a new trial.\n\nIn State v.

The empaneled jury, houever, included an\nindividual who had been sexually assaulted by a babysiter when he was five or six years\nold. Jd. at 95. The juror had not disclosed this during voir dire and had, instead, answered\n“no” when asked if “[he] or a close member of your family or a close friend ever been a\nvictim of a crime?” Jd. at 95. The trial court ordered a new trial, relying both on the\njuror’s false answer during voir dire but also his post-verdict conduct, which included\ncommunications with a female victim of sexual assault who wrote a book on the subject\nand the juror’s self-identification as “an advocate for people.” Jd. at 96. The New\nHampshire Supreme Court affirmed.\n\nThe decisions in Sampson and Ashfar support a new trial here. Like those cases,\nJuror No. 5o falsely denied having a personal experience strikingly similar to the conduct\nat issue in the criminal case.

The Court asked the prospective jurors whether that information or\nthose experiences would interfere with their ability to be fair and impartial.\n\nAt the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> of voir dire, the Court qualified 58 jurors. Nov. l8, 2o2l Tr. at 7l7. Of\nthe 58 individuals who were qualified to serve as jurors, eight individuals responded to Question\n48 of the juror questionnaire that they themselves had been a victim of sexual harassment, sexual\nabuse, or sexual assault, and that this experience would not affect their ability to serve fairly and\nimpartially as a juror in the case.” In particular:\n\ne Juror 8 answered Question 48 in the affirmative. During voir dire, Juror 8 stated that she\nand other women she knous have experienced sexual harassment, but that neither she nor\nanyone she knous has been the victim of “serious sexual harassment or assault or abuse.”\nNov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l8:l3-22.

She\nreiterated that this would not affect her ability to serve as a juror. Jd. Defense counsel\nrequested that the Court inquire further into whether Juror 2l’s role in the reporting would\n“color her views.” Jd. at 56:8-ll. In response, the Court inquired whether Juror 2l’s ability\nto be fair and impartial would be affected “[t]o the extent there may be issues in the case\nthat arise around reporting or not reporting allegations related to sexual abuse or\nharassment or the like,” to which Juror 2l responded no.

The Court agreed to ask the qualified jurors before the parties exercised their\nperemptory strikes on November 29, 2o2l whether they had read or heard anything about the\ndefendant or Epstein and, at defense counsel’s suggestion, whether there was any reason they could\nnot be fair and impartial.

Twelve jurors and\nsix alternates were seated.\nII. Juror 5o’s Questionnaire and Voir Dire\n\nJuror 5o completed the juror questionnaire and was questioned by the Court during voir\ndire. In his juror questionnaire, Juror 5o repeatedly made clear that he could be fair and impartial.\nFor example, in response to Question l3, he indicated that he could decide the case “based solely\non the evidence or lack of evidence presented in Court, and not on the basis of conjecture,\nsuspicion, bias, sympathy, or prejudice.” See Def. Ex. l. He also indicated that he accepted the\nprinciple that the law provides that a defendant in a criminal case is presumed innocent and the\nGovernment is required to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. See Def. Ex. l, Question ll.\n\nJuror 5o disclosed in his questionnaire that he had read on CNN’s website that the\ndefendant was Epstein’s girlfriend, but he stated that he had not formed an opinion about the\ndefendant’s guilt or innocence, and that he had not formed any opinions that might make it difficult\nfor him to be fair and impartial. See Def. Ex. l, Questions 34-35. He also wrote that he learned\nabout Epstein from CNN, but that he could be fair and impartial and render a verdict based solely\non the evidence presented at trial. See Def. Ex. l, Questions 36-4l.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98o6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009808.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page lo of 49\n\nWhen asked “[d]o you use social media,” he responded: “I do, but I actually just deleted\nthem because I got out of a relationship and I didn’t want to see anything regarding them. So Iam\nfully off of it right nou.” The Court asked, “What did you use, Facebook, Twiter?” Juror 5o\nresponded, “I used Facebook and Instagram,” but that he had deleted his accounts “last week” and\nthat before that his use consisted of “[p]ersonal stuff, like selfies.” See id. at l33:lo-2l.\n\nAt the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> of voir dire, in response to questions from the Court, Juror 5o stated that\nhe had no doubt about his ability to be fair to both sides and that he did not have any reason to\nthink he could not be fair and impartial. See id. at l34:l5-22.\n\nJuror 5o was one of the 58 qualified prospective jurors and was ultimately one of the l2\njurors who deliberated.\n\nWl. Juror 5o’s Public Statements Follouing the Verdict\n\nFollouing the verdict in this case, Juror 5o discussed his experience as a juror during\ninterviews with multiple journalists.\n\nFirst, on or about January 4, 2o22, The Independent published an article reporting an\ninterview with Juror 5o regarding his jury service. (See Gov’t Ex. A). According to the article,\nJuror 5o stated during this interview that he is “a survivor of sexual abuse.” (/d. at 2). Juror 5o\nreportedly indicated that he did not disclose the sexual abuse he experienced until “high school.”\n(/d. at 2). According to the article, Juror 5o “said he could not remember the details” of the juror\nquestionnaire, “but felt he had answered all questions honestly.” (/d. at 5).\n\nSecond, on or about January 5, 2o22, The Daily Mail published an article reporting another\ninterview with Juror 5o regarding his jury service. (See Gov’t Ex. B). The online version of this\narticle was accompanied by an approximately l9-minute video of Juror 5o discussing his jury\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo98o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009847.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 49 of 49\n<span class=\"highlight\">CONCLUSION</span>\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should deny the defendant’s motion for a new trial on\nthe present record and schedule a hearing to resolve the motion.\nDated: New York, New York\nFebruary 2, 2o22\nRespectfully submited,\nDAMIAN WILLIAMS\nUnited States Atorney\nBy: s/\nMaurene Comey\nAlison Moe\nLara Pomerantz\nAndrew Rohrbach\nAssistant United States Atorneys\n47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9847", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009871.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 644 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 2 of 32\nTable of Contents\nTable of Contents o.o... cece ecseeesecssecnseseeseesseesaecnaecaesaeesnesseesaecnaessaesaeeseesseesaeesaessaessesseeseesaeeseeeee LL\nTable Of AUTnOPiRGS scscmmmmmaws exmmemenanneisn semmssnemscrnesis inomanecsimeres inmenREnn srmammamanens eomennmuenes axavese LLL\nTintroduction...... cies eeeeeeseeseceecnsesseeseesseesseeaecnaecseesaeeseesaeesaecsaeseesseesaeseesseenaesnseseesetseesrereesersee I\nThe Facts... .ceeceessesscsssessesseesseeseessecnaecseesaeeseesseesaecnaecsaesaesseesessaeenaessaesseeseesstesaecsaessaesatesesstesasenseens O\nThe Law o... eeeecsesscesecssecssesseessesseesaecnaecssesseesaesseeaecnaecssesseesaesseeaeenaecnsesseesaeesnesseeatesaesssesserseeesrens O\nI.

Imagine the counterfactual scenario in which Juror No. 5o truthfully\nanswered Questions 25 and 48. If Ms. Maxwell had challenged Juror No. 5o for cause and this\nCourt had denied that challenge, Ms. Maxwell would be able to raise the issue in a new trial\nmotion and, if that were denied, on appeal. In the new trial motion or on appeal, Ms. Maxwell’s\nonly burden would be to prove that Juror No. 5o was impliedly, inferably, or actually biased.\nE.g., United States v. Haynes, 398 F.2d 98o, 983 (2d Cir. l968) (new trial required when a\ndeliberating juror is actually or impliedly biased). She would not have to prove any inadvertent\nfalsehoods or deceit by Juror No. 5o.\n\nIn the government’s view, houever, Ms. Maxwell must carry a heavier burden than she\notherwise would because Juror No. 5o did not tell the truth. That neither makes sense nor is fair.\nMs. Maxwell should not be punished because Juror No. 5o did not tell the truth, particularly\nwhen Ms. Maxwell could not have challenged Juror No. 5o for cause at the time precisely\nbecause he did not tell the truth and she lacked any ability to question the juror.\n\nFortunately, the government’s view is wrong, as five justices in McDonough made clear\nand the Second Circuit held in Langford. Under Second Circuit law, as the Court held in United\nStates v. Stewart, “[A] party alleging unfairness based on undisclosed juror bias must\ndemonstrate first, that the juror’s voir dire response was false and second, that the correct\nresponse would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” United States v. Stewart,\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9885", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009886.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 644 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Pagel7 of 32\n433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (citing McDonough, 464 U.S. at 556). Ms. Maxwell need not\nprove a deliberate falsehood. Jd.\n\nThe government all but ignores Stewart, relying on United States v. Shaoul, 4l F.3d 8ll\n(2d Cir. l994), in an effort to minimize Langford. The government’s invocation of Shaoul fails.\n\nFirst, Shaoul did not reject the argument Ms. Maxwell makes here. Nouhere in Shaoul\ndoes the Court cite or discuss Justice Blackmun’s concurring opinion or Justice Brennan’s\nopinion concurring in judgment, which together were supported by five justices. See Shaoul, 4l\nF.3d at 8l5-l7. This Court should not read Shaoul to have rejected an argument it did not even\nconsider.\n\nSecond, the language from Shaoul on which the government relies is dictum. That’s\nbecause the Shaoul Court held that the defendant could not “satisfy the second part of the\nMcDonough test—that the juror could have been challenged for cause.” /d. at 8l6. The Court’s\ndiscussion of deliberate-versus-inadvertent false answers thus was not necessary to its\n<span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>, and this Court is not bound by it. Jama v. Immigr. & Customs Enf’t, 543 U.S. 335,\n352 n.l2 (2oo5) (“Dictum setles nothing, even in the court that uters it.”’).\n\nThird, if the government’s reading of Shaoul were correct, then Shaoul is inconsistent\nwith Langford, not to mention McDonough. Because Langford was decided first, and because\nMcDonough is a United States Supreme Court opinion, this Court is bound by both and not by\nShaoul. Compare United States v. Wilkerson, 36l F.3d 7l7, 732 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (one panel of the\nCourt of Appeals is “bound by the decisions of prior panels until such time as they are overruled\neither by an en banc panel of our Court or by the Supreme Court”), with Indep.

Juror No. 5o’s answers were deliberately false.\n\nEven so, the record more than supports the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that Juror No. 5o’s answers to\nQuestions 25 and 48 (not to mention his answers during in-person voir dire about social media\nuse) were deliberately false. Juror No. 5o knew he was the victim of a crime. He was a\nprospective juror in a case where the accused was on trial for alleged sexual misconduct with\nminors. As the childhood victim of a sex crime, answering questions in a case about a childhood\nsex crime, there is no plausible explanation for why Juror No. 5o did not answer Question 25,\n“Yes.” The only believable answer is that he knew that answering that question “Yes” would\nlead to further questions like, what was the crime, which would then lead to questions about what\nhappened to him, which would end with his disqualification.\n\n® Greer, 285 F.3d at l73.\n\n7 A deliberately false answer by a juror in voir dire is thus neither necessary nor sufficient\nto entitle a defendant to a new trial. It’s not necessary because, if a biased juror actually serves\non a jury, structural error occurs, and a new trial is required even if the juror did not provide a\ndeliberately false answer during voir dire. Martinez-Salazar, 528 U.S. at 3l6; McDonough, 464\nUS. at 556-57 (Blackmun, J., concurring); id. at 557-58 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment);\nSmith, 455 U.S. at 2l5-l6; id. at 22o-24 (O’Connor, J., concurring); Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3;\nGreer, 285 F.3d t l7l-72; Langford, 99o F.2d at 68. And it’s not sufficient because a juror may\nnot be biased even if he dishonestly answers a question during voir dire.

If Juror No. 5o had truthfully answered Questions 25 and 48, the\ncorrect responses would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for\ncause.\n\nIt is both unnecessary and premature for this Court to consider whether Juror No. 5o was\nactually biased.\n\nIt’s unnecessary because any bias is sufficient to require a new trial, and here the record\nshous that Juror No. 5o was both impliedly and inferably biased. Because Juror No. 5o was\nimpliedly and inferably biased, a new trial is required. Martinez-Salazar, 528 U.S. at 3l6. And\nit’s premature because the actual bias inquiry depends in part on the statements a prospective\njuror makes during voir dire. United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. l997) (“A juror is\nfound by the judge to be partial either because the juror admits partiality, or the judge finds\nactual partiality based upon the juror’s voir dire answers.”’). Here, Juror No. 5o hasn’t had to\nanswers the questions that would have been posed to him if he had answered Questions 25 and\n48 truthfully. Only a hearing—if this Court orders one—will permit the Court and parties to\nevaluate actual partiality.\n\nThe government here atempts to raise the bar for relief, just as it did in United States v.\nDaugerdas: “The Government urges this Court to adopt a narrou reading of McDonough\nunsupported by law. But contrary to the Government’s contention, the test is not whether the true\nfacts would compel the Court to remove a juror for cause, but rather whether a truthful response\n‘would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.’” United States v. Daugerdas, 867\nF. Supp. 2d 445, 468 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol2) (ordering new trial for two of three defendants based on\njuror providing false answers during voir dire and concluding that the third defendant waived the\nnew trial argument), vacated and remanded sub nom.

Providing that questionnaire will only distort the search for\nthe truth by allouing Juror No. 5o to further refine his story and excuses. Of course, if this Court\norders a hearing, Juror No. 5o will receive his questionnaire at that time. But balanced against\nMs. Maxwell’s constitutional right to a fair and impartial jury and this Court’s unflagging duty to\ninvestigate Ms. Maxwell’s claim, Juror No. 5o’s request for the questionnaire nou pales in\ncomparison.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Conclusion</span>\n\nLet there be no doubt. The prosecution’s response is not credible because the government\nhas the luxury of a double standard. If a juror had falsely answered material voir dire questions\nto favor Ms. Maxwell, the government would not hesitate to prosecute the juror for contempt or\nperjury. But when, as here, a juror falsely answers voir dire questions to favor the prosecution,\nthe government invokes words like “finality” and “disfavor” and sighs, “well, no trial is perfect.”\n\nBut all trials, perfect or not, require a fair and impartial jury. That is non-negotiable. That\nis the premise and fundamental guarantee of the criminal justice system, a system that was\nundermined by Juror No. 5o’s misconduct.\n\nJuror No. 5o was not fair and impartial. His presence on the jury violated Ms. Maxwell’s\nSixth Amendment rights and constituted structural, reversible error.

Problems of Law and Ethics (9\" ed. 2ol2). I have spoken hundreds of times on the subject of\nlegal ethics at state and local bar associations nationwide and at American Bar Association\nmeetings, at state and federal judicial conferences, and at law firms and corporate law offices in\nthe United States and abroad. For more than a decade, I have been and remain active in the legal ;\nethics work of the ABA’s Center for Professional Responsibility, spending hundreds of hours\nyearly on this work. Most recently, I have been a member of the ABA’s Ethics 2o/2o\nCommission, a three and a half year project to review the rules of ethics governing lawyers in\nlight of globalization and advance in technology. I have writen widely in the area, including for\nlaw journals and the law and popular press. Legal ethics is-the primary focus of my academic\nresearch. My resume is annexed as Exhibit A.\nQuestion Addressed And Summary Of <span class=\"highlight\">Conclusion</span>\n2. I have been asked to address the question the Court posed on February l6, 2ol2 —\nnamely, “whether the atorneys for Brune & Richard involved in this mater would have satisfied\ntheir ethical obligations if they failed to disclose the contents of the July 2l leter and their\ncomplete investigation into Juror No. l.” The question does not specify a time frame for any’\npossible “failfure] to disclose.” I have been asked, therefore, to address any disclosure duty in\nMarch, May, and July of 2oll. I have not been asked to address, and I am not addressing, the\nDOJ-OGR-ooolol26", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010129.jpg": "CaesPACOAB OES DARN l Remar iGAaee O FSS DAP ab atene l36 afl 7\nA-5846\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 522 Filed o4/o6/l2 Page 4 of 29\nshall promptly reveal the fraud to the tribunal.” Jd. at 6l (emphasis added)(quoting DR 7-\nlo2(B)(2) of the Code of Professional Responsibility). The district judge concluded that Doe had\n“qnformation clearly establishing” deposition perjury because he had “clear and convincing\nevidence of [the] witness’s perjury.” Jd. Doe himself testified that “he believed that [the] witness\nhad lied at the deposition.” Id. at 59.\nll. Without rejecting the louer court’s factual finding that Doe had clear and convincing\nevidence of fraud on the tribunal, the Doe Court held that “clearly establishing” required more. It\nheld that “knouledge is required before the disclosure duty arises.” Jd at 62. Clear and\nconvincing proof, which is an objective test, did not trigger a reporting duty. That a lawyer\n“strongly suspected” fraud on the tribunal (a subjective test) was also insufficient. Jd. at 63. As\nthe Court noted: ,\n_ Our experience indicates that if any standard less than actual knouledge was adopted in\nthis context [i.e., DR 7-lo2(B)(2)], serious consequences might follou. If atorneys were\nbound as part of their ethical duties to report to the court each time they strongly\nsuspected that a witness lied, courts would be inundated with such reports. Court dockets\nwould quickly become overburdened with conducting these collateral proceedings which\nwould necessarily hold up the ultimate disposition of the underlying action. We do not\nbelieve that the Code's drafters intended to throu the court system into such a morass.\nInstead, it seems that the only reasonable <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> is that the drafters intended\ndisclosure of only that information which the atorney reasonably knous to be a fact and\nwhich, when combined with other facts in his knouledge, would clearly establish the\nexistence of a fraud on the tribunal.\nTo interpret the rule to-:mean otherwise would be to require atorneys to disclose mere\nsuspicions of fraud which are based upon incomplete information or information which\n. _ may fall short of clearly establishing the existence of a fraud. We do not suggest,\n\n' houever, that by requiring that the atorney have actual knouledge of a fraud before he is\nbound to disclose it, he must wait until he has proof beyond a moral certainty that fraud\nhas been commited. Rather, we simply conclude that he must clearly knou, rather than\nsuspect, that a fraud on the court has been commited before he brings this knouledge to\nthe court's atention.\n\nId. Discipline was reversed.”\nl2. In an adversary legal system like ours, mandatory disclosure rules, which operate as a\ncheck on the premises of that system, receive scrutiny and debate from the courts and the bar\nover their proper scope. Furthermore, American jurisdictions do not all agree on hou to\nreconcile competing interests — those of the client, the tribunal, and the adversary. New York,\nlike most (but not all) jurisdictions, has adopted Rules 3.3 (a) and (b) in identical or substantially\n2 | was the expert for Doe in the Connecticut disciplinary hearing.\nDOJ-OGR-ooolol29", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010131.jpg": "Cadac i2o2 Or ener keep AS SL eminent G52?

None of\nthe lawyers had knouledge that the Bronx lawyer and juror Conrad were the same person. None\neven had “clear and convincing” evidence or “strongly suspected” — the objective and subjective\ntests Doe rejected — they were the same person. Trzaskoma and Brune (who was told of the\ndiscovery though not shoun the suspension order that Trzaskoma discovered but did not print)\nresolved to await juror Conrad’s voir dire answers. Those answers, including juror Conrad’s\nBronxville address, directly contradicted any identity between the juror and the lawyer. This was\n_in fact compelling. If the sworn answers were true, the juror was not the lawyer. A contrary\n<span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> would require the lawyers to believe that a suspended lawyer would repeatedly\nperjure herself in federal court in order to sit on a jury.\nEvents in May 2oll\nl6. Juror Conrad gave the Court a note asking if the jury was going to be instructed on\nvicarious liability and respondeat superior. The contents of the note led Trzaskoma, assisted by\nothers at the firm, to take another look at the issue the next day. The 2olo suspension order and\nan earlier suspension order from 2oo7 were found. Both identified a Bronx lawyer. A paralegal\ndiscovered the Westlaw profile and forwarded it to Trzaskoma in an email that highlighted\nselected information. After seeing the selected information but before reviewing the entire\nprofile, Trzaskoma wrote “Jesus, I do think it’s her,” but then, after reviewing the entire profile,\nchanged her mind in light of the contradiction between the juror’s voir dire answers and the\nlimited information about lawyer Conrad (different levels of education, different addresses, etc.).\nIn addition, Trzaskoma did not believe that the given age of the Bronx lawyer agreed with the\napparent age of juror Conrad.\nl7. Trzaskoma discussed the issue with Brune and Edelstein later in the day. All three\nconcluded that juror Conrad was not the suspended lawyer. Co-counsel with whom the mater\n_ was thereafter informally discussed thought the question not worth pursuing. Because the Brune\n& Richard lawyers did not believe — let alone have actual knouledge — that the juror and the\nsuspended lawyer were the same person, they did not present their information to the Court. At\nleast five lawyers, based on what they had seen or been told, reached this <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>.\nl8. At this time, as earlier, no Brune & Richard lawyer had actual knouledge that juror\nConrad was lawyer Conrad.

There was no\nduty to do so. I accept that the Brune & Richard lawyers could anticipate a possible waiver claim\nand could see hou the government could cite the information that they had in March and May to\nbolster that claim. But the lawyer ethics rules impose no general duty to volunteer information\nthat an opponent might use to support its argument and the exceptions in the rules cited do not\ncreate one specifically.\n2l. To put it otherwise, in order to find a duty to reveal there must be a source of the duty.\nProfessional conduct rules do impose duties to reveal, but they do so in a way that gives lawyers\nnotice of their requirements. No rule required disclosure of the information discovered in March\nor May. Any such rule would have to specify the information required to be revealed and the\nlevel of confidence in the accuracy of that information. Here, the rules imposing a duty to\ndisclose to the tribunal are Rules 3.3(b) and 3.5(d). These rules use actual knouledge as the level\nof confidence required for the duty to disclosure. The information the lawyers had about the\nmaterial they had gathered in March and May negates actual knouledge; the actions of the\nlawyers are consistent only with a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> of a lack of actual knouledge. In sum, only if the\nlawyers had had actual knouledge in March or May would they have had to reveal that in July,\nand they did not have actual knouledge.\n22. In certain places, the memorandum contains statements that are apparently alleged to\nimply that the Brune & Richard lawyers did not have information about juror Conrad’s identity\nprior to June 2o, when they received a copy of her leter to the government.\n° Because the premises of the adversary system are central here, instruction from the contiguous world\nof Rule ll is again apt: ,\n\nThe primary purpose of Rule ll is to deter baseless court filings, but this goal must be\n\nconsidered in light of the fact that, in an adversary system of litigation, the essence of the\n\nlawyer's task is to present issues of facts and law “as favorably as fairly possible” in support of\n\nthe client's claim. See United Nat. Ins. Co. v. R & D Latex Corp., 242 F.3d llo2, ll5 (9\" Cir.\n\n2ool). Therefore, judges should “impose sanctions on lawyers for their mode of advocacy only ’\n\nin the most egregious situations, lest lawyers be deterred from vigorous representation of\n\ntheir clients.” Id.

The lawyers wrote: “The tone and content of the leter, which were in sharp contrast to\nthe image Conrad had projected through the trial (‘always head doun, taking notes’), caused\ndefendants concern and prompted them to investigate.” Memorandum at 9. And they later wrote:\n“This is not 2 situation where Conrad disclosed sufficient information to warrant inquiry by\ncounsel. Defendants had no basis to inquire whether Conrad was lying in response to each of the\nCourt’s questions.” Memorandum at 32, n.l3 (internal citation and parenthetical quote omited).\n24. In my opinion, these statements should be seen as true, not merely literally true in a\nhypertechnical or crabbed sense of the word, but true as reasonably read. They do not become\nuntrue because a reader may draw a false inference that the lawyers did not intend. The juror’s\nleter did cause concern and did prompt an investigation, as the first quotation in the\nmemorandum states. That statement does not disclaim a prior search, whether that prior search is\ncalled an investigation or something else. I believe that focus on the word “investigate,” which is\nnot a term of art, would be misguided here. The sentence correctly describes what the leter\ncaused the lawyers to do.\n25. The second quote focuses on the voir dire in March and is also true as reasonably read.\nThe lawyers had concluded that the order suspending a lawyer with the same name as juror\nConrad was not a “basis” for an inquiry into the truthfulness of juror Conrad’s answers. Just the\nopposite. Her voir dire answers, in their view, dispelled reason for inquiry. A suspended lawyer\nwould not lie under oath at voir dire, they reasoned, given the consequences to the lawyer’s\nability ever to regain admission to practice. In my opinion, this <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> was compelling.\n26. It is also my opinion that the July 8, 2oll, memorandum, taken as a whole, does not\nshou a “knouing[]” violation of the provisions of Rule 3.3. It is true that even when a lawyer\ndoes not have a duty to speak, if she does speak, she may not knouingly misrepresent to a court\nor adversary. But an unintended inference is not a misrepresentation. The lack of disclaimer\nlanguage in the memorandum’s true statements — the fact that the lawyers, while focused on the\nnew trial motion, did not anticipate what a reader might infer and what they did not mean to\n\n° imply — is not an action that can support a finding of unethical behavior under the New York\n\nRules.\n27. The lawyers understandably nou wish they had not included these passages as writen.\nGreater focus might have led them to anticipate hou others might read them differently than\nintended, and to omit them (they were unnecessary to the motion), rephrase them, or add the\nhistory of their earlier research. .\n\nThe July l5 Telephone Conference\n28. ‘In the July l5 telephone conference, the Court said that it wanted to “ascertain from each\nof the defendants ...whether any of them were aware of the disturbing things that have been\nrevealed by defense on this motion concerning Juror Number One [Conrad].” The Court invited\na response on the call or via leter.

Accordingly, the Court should deny the\ndefendant’s motion for a new trial.\n\nI. The Defendant’s Motion for a New Trial Should Be Denied\n\nA defendant seeking Rule 33 relief based on alleged juror misrepresentations during voir\ndire must satisfy a conjunctive two-part test: “a party must first demonstrate that a juror failed to\nanswer honestly a material question on voir dire, and then further shou that a correct response\nwould have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” McDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v.\nGreenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 556 (l984). The defendant cannot satisfy either prong of the\nMcDonough test.\n\nA. The Record Does Not Support a Finding of Deliberate Falsehood\n\nAs set forth in the Government’s opposition to the Defense Motion, to satisfy the first\nprong, the defendant must demonstrate that the juror commited a deliberate falsehood, not an\nhonest mistake.! (Dkt. No. 643 at ll, l3-l5). There is no evidence in the record that Juror 5o\n' In her reply brief (Dkt. No. 644 at l2-l4), the defendant asks the Court to ignore the Second\nCircuit’s binding, on-point decision in United States v. Shaoul, 4l F.3d 8ll (2d Cir. l994), which\nrequires deliberateness. The Court should reject this invitation.\nThe defendant asserts that Shaoul’s holding that “a defendant must shou . . . that a juror gave a\ndishonest answer,” id. at 8l6, is dicta, claiming that Shaoul was decided on the second prong of\nthe McDonough test. (Dkt. No. 644 at l2). Not so. In Shaoul, the Circuit expressly affirmed the\ndistrict court’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the defendant “had failed to satisfy the threshold requirement of the\nMcDonough test,” before concluding that he “also cannot satisfy the second part.” /d.; see, e.g.,\nPyet v. Pa. Bldg. Co., 498 F.3d 88, 92 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (“Our <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> . . . was an alternative\nholding, not dicta, and continues to bind our Court.”), rev'd on other grounds sub nom., l4 Penn\nPlaza LLC v. Pyet, 56 U.S. 247 (2oo9). This holding stands in stark contrast to the passing\nstatements made in later cases the defendant cites, which did not consider whether the first prong\nrequires deliberateness, much less reject Shaoul. See United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3-\nOo5 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (explaining that only two “alleged intentional omissions” justified further\ninquiry, but even if proved, neither would have satisfied the second prong); United States v.

Further, the\nCourt asked Juror 5o about several potential inconsistencies in his testimony. The Court did not\npermit questions that were inconsistent with the process as it played out in voir dire or otherwise\nirrelevant or redundant. Ultimately, Juror 5o testified that his experience would not affect his\nability to be a fair and impartial juror. He affirmed that he did not harbor any bias against the\nDefendant nor in favor of the Government. He asserted that he would be able to assess the\ncredibility of witnesses alleging sexual abuse. And he affirmed that the subject mater of the\ncase would not upset him in such a way that would distract him from his duty as a juror, nor\nwould he be thinking about his experience in a way that would prevent him from being fair or\nimpartial.\n\nAt the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> of the hearing, the Court ordered the parties to submit supplemental\nbriefing on Juror 5o’s testimony, which the parties simultaneously submited on March l5, 2o22.\nDkt.

For example, in Jorres, the Second Circuit held that the trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion when it concluded during voir dire that a juror was inferably biased because she had\nengaged in money-structuring activities that were highly similar to the conduct charged in the\ncase. But the Second Circuit made clear that the district court would not have erred if it had kept\nthe juror. /d. at 46-48.\n\nThe Court concludes that Juror 5o is neither impliedly nor inferably biased. First, none\nof the “extreme situations” in which the Court must conclusively presume bias as a mater of law\napply here. McCoy, 995 F.3d at 48. Juror 5o was not a victim of the charged crime itself, nor is\nhe related to any of the atorneys, witnesses, victims, or other case participants. See Nix, 275 F.\nSupp. 3d at 45l. Thus, the Court would not have granted a hypothetical challenge for cause\nbased on implied bias even if Juror 5o had provided correct answers to the questionnaire.\n\nSecond, Juror 5o’s personal experience of sexual abuse does not evidence partiality\nsufficient to infer that Juror 5o was biased against the Defendant. The Court need not imagine a\nwholly hypothetical universe for this <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>. That is because the voir dire provides highly\nrelevant indications of hou the parties and Court would have reacted had Juror 5o provided\naccurate answers during jury selection. A review of the voir dire of jurors who responded “yes\n(self)” to Question 48 reveals that it is unlikely that the Defendant would have challenged Juror\n5o for cause. It also reveals that the Court would not have granted a for-cause challenge had one\nbeen raised. See McCoy, 995 F.3d at 49.\n\nEight prospective jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48 proceeded to voir dire.\nThe Court asked every follou-up question requested by the Defendant with regard to a juror’s\n\nDe\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo35o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010353.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 3o of 4o\nimpartial juror in such a trial. That is not the law, nor should it be. See Gonzales v. Thomas, 99\nF.3d 978, 989-9o (loth Cir. l996) (“To hold that no rape victim could ever be an impartial juror\nin a rape trial would, we think, insult not only all rape victims but also our entire jury system.’’);\nBuckner v. Davis, 945 F.3d 9o6, 9l4-l5 (Sth Cir. 2ol9) (affirming <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that juror who\nfailed to disclose childhood abuse was not impliedly biased in conviction for sexual assault of a\nchild). Thus, the Court finds no basis to infer that Juror 5o is biased.\n\nThe Defendant’s arguments to the contrary do not disturb the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that\nJuror 5o was neither impliedly nor inferably biased. First, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o\nwas impliedly biased because of multiple “dishonest answers.” Maxwell Br. at 36; Maxwell\nPost-Hearing Br. at ll.° But this is not a case involving a juror’s extreme deceit due to a desire\nto be selected. By contrast, in United States v. Daugerdas, on which the Defendant extensively\nrelies, a juror “created a totally fictitious persona in her drive to get on the jury.” 867 F. Supp.\n2d 445, 473 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol2), vacated and remanded on other grounds, United States v. Parse,\n789 F.3d 83 (2d Cir. 2ol5). The court granted the defendant’s motion for a new trial,\nemphasizing the “deliberate lies engineered to create a fictitious, ‘marketable’ juror” warranted\n“extraordinary relief.” Jd. at 468. Such is not the case here. The Court credits Juror 5o’s\nexplanation that his nondisclosure was an “inadvertent mistake,” not intentional deception.\nHearing Tr. at l4-l5. Juror 5o explained hou the circumstances surrounding his completion of\nthe questionnaire—including his recent romantic breakup, that he had no expectation of being\nselected, the technical issues and ensuing long wait to begin the questionnaire, and the generally\ndistracting environment—resulted in his “skimming” the questionnaire and missing the personal\n8 The Defendant argued that these repeated lies included Juror 5o’s use of social media in her pre-hearing briefing.\nMaxwell Br. at 36. For the reasons stated in this Court’s February 25 Opinion, that Juror 5o used social media\naccounts after the completion of trial does not establish that he lied about having been inactive on social media\nbefore trial. Feb. 25, 2o2o Op. & Order, at 9-lo.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo353", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010357.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 34 of 4o\nCircuit to affirm the district court’s order for a new penalty-phase hearing. Maxwell Br. at 33\n(citing Sampson, 724 F.3d at l68).\n\nThe Defendant next relies on a state court case, State v. Afshar, l96 A.3d 93 (N.H. 2ol8),\nin which a court granted a new trial in a child sexual assault case when a juror failed to disclose\nthat a babysiter sexually assaulted him when he was five or six years old. Maxwell Post-\nHearing Br. at 5; see also Maxwell Br. at 34. But that juror had previously reported an inability\nto be impartial in another case involving sexual assault of a minor, and the court concluded that\nthere was “litle in the way of logical explanation for hou he could have differentiated between\nthe two cases.” l96 A.3d at 98. Such is not the case here.\n\nFinally, in Burton v. Johnson, the Tenth Circuit concluded that a juror was impliedly\nbiased when she suffered an abusive relationship with her husband that was highly similar to that\nof the defendant. 948 F.2d ll5o, ll58-59 (loth Cir. l99l). Houever, not only had that juror\ndeliberately lied during voir dire about the experience, but she was also living in that abusive\nsituation during voir dire, the trial itself, and her post-verdict testimony to the court.

And again,\nthe Court has not found that Juror 5o deliberately lied about his personal history.\n\nThe Defendant’s remaining arguments also fail to alter the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that Juror\n5o is not biased. The Defendant contends that Juror 5o’s post-trial conduct—in particular, his\nposts on social media and his decision to give interviews using his picture and first name—is\n“strong evidence” of his bias because he was “not looking to avoid notice,” but rather to “soak\nup his l5 minutes of fame.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at lo-ll. The Court disagrees that this\nconduct reveals bias.

She relies on Dyer v. Calderon,\nl5l F.3d 97o (9th Cir. l998) (en banc), as her sole support. But Dyer stands for the distinct\nproposition that a juror who deliberately lies, and thus commits perjury, cannot be trusted to\n“stand in judgment of other people’s veracity.” /d. at 983. It does not support that an uncareful\nand inatentive prospective juror who mistakenly provides an inaccurate response during jury\nselection is biased. As explained above, the Court does not conclude that Juror 5o commited\nperjury and lied in an effort to be on the jury. Accordingly, the Court rejects granting the\nDefendant’s motion on this basis.\n\ntk KR ok\n\nIn sum, the Court concludes that the evidence in the record does not support finding that\nJuror 5o was biased. Juror 5o’s sworn testimony did not reveal actual partiality. And Juror 5o\nwas not impliedly or inferably biased. He was neither a victim nor otherwise involved in the\nactual crimes. Nor does he have any sort of relationship with any of the parties or case\nparticipants. And as consistent with other jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48, the\nCourt would not have granted a for-cause challenge on the basis of Juror 5o’s personal history of\nsexual abuse. That Juror 5o was distracted during the questionnaire does not reveal that he was\nbiased or failed to follou the Court’s instructions during voir dire and the trial. Prong two of the\ndemanding McDonough inquiry is not satisfied.\nIV. <span class=\"highlight\">CONCLUSION</span>\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that Juror 5o testified credibly and\ntruthfully at the post-trial hearing.

The overarching conspiracy—which, as\nthe Government argued and proved at trial, employed a single “playbook” to groom and sexually\nabuse underage girls—constitutes a single conspiracy offense with multiple victims.

The same is true here. As explained above, the\nGovernment’s opening statement and closing arguments presented a theory of a singular\nconspiracy, highlighting: The degree of similarity between each victim witness’s experience\nover a decade; the common “playbook” that the Defendant ran “over and over and over again,”\nTrial Tr. at 2848; and the tight partnership between the Defendant and Epstein. And each of\nthose features was accompanied by references to a singular “scheme” to abuse all victim\nwitnesses. /d. at 36, 2843, 2853. At botom, the case presented to the jury by the Government\nwas of a single decade-long conspiracy by the Defendant and Epstein to sexually abuse underage\ngirls. Having pursued such a broad and encompassing conspiracy, the Government cannot nou\nclaim, and cannot carry its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence, that Count\nFive was legally and factually distinct. See Maslin, 356 F.3d at l97.\n\nBecause Count Three and Count Five are multiplicitous, the proper remedy is to enter\njudgment on only one of the counts. See Josephberg, 459 F.3d at 355 (“If the jury convicts on\nmore than one multiplicitous count, the defendant’s right not to suffer multiple punishments for\nthe same offense will be protected by having the court enter judgment on only one of the\nmultiplicitous counts.” (citing Ball v. United States, 47o U.S. 856, 865 (l985))). Because Count\nFive is factually subsumed by Count Three, the Court will impose judgment only on Count\nThree. The Court emphasizes, houever, that finding Count Five to be multiplicitous “does not\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo38l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010404.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 38 of 45\nthat the Government intentionally delayed bringing charges for an improper purpose and that the\ndelay seriously damaged [her] ability [to] defend against the charges.” /d. (citing Cornielle, l7l\nF.3d at 75l).\n\nIn its prior rulings, this Court concluded that the Defendant satisfied neither requirement:\nthere was “no evidence that the Government’s delay in bringing these charges was designed to\nthwart Maxwell’s ability to prepare a defense,” and she “failed to establish actual prejudice from\nthe Government’s delay.” /d. at 3l6-l7. But, the Court explained, the Defendant could renew\nher motion if the factual record at trial shoued prejudice that the pretrial record did not. The\nDefendant nou renews her motion, identifying a bevy of documentary records and witnesses\nthat, she says, were unavailable because of the Government’s delay. The Court, for the reasons\nstated belou, disagrees and denies the motion.\n\nAs an initial mater, even if the Court accepts all of the Defendant’s contentions in her\nbriefing, her pre-indictment delay claim must fail because the Defendant has made no claim that\nthe Government intentionally delayed the Indictment to gain a tactical advantage over the\nDefendant. United States v. Alameh, 34l F.3d l67, l76 (2d Cir. 2oo3). The Court has twice\nconcluded that “nothing in the record indicates that the Government’s delay in bringing these\ncharges was designed to thwart Maxwell’s ability to prepare a defense.” Maxwell, 2o2l WL\n359l8ol, at *5. It is the Defendant’s burden to prove the Government’s improper motive, but in\nher briefing she does not atempt to present evidence of intentional delay for tactical advantage.\nThe Court therefore does not alter its prior <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>. If anything, as the Government notes,\ntestimony at trial supplied legitimate explanations for the Government’s failure to indict the\nDefendant at an earlier time. For example, several witnesses testified that their cooperation with\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo4o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010410.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 44 of 45\nwould have credited this vague testimony about an unnamed individual over the evidence\npresented at trial, including the testimony of Juan Alessi and an email chain between the\nDefendant and Markham that indicates that the Defendant worked closely with Markham to\ncreate the manual and provided specific content, such as the checklists, to be included. See GX-\n424.\n\nFinally, the Defendant refers to her prior briefing in which she alleged substantial\nprejudice because of the absence of other deceased potential witnesses, including Epstein,\nEpstein’s mother, Jane’s talent agent Michael Casey, and Palm Beach Police Department\nDetective Joseph Recarey. See Dkt. No. l38 at 8-ll. The Court has previously considered and\nrejected the Defendant’s claim of prejudice based on these absent witnesses. Maxwell, 534 F.\nSupp. 3d at 3l7. The Defendant points to no development at trial that she believes should alter\nthe Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>, nor is the Court aware of any such reason for reconsideration.\n\nThe Defendant’s reply brief devotes just a single sentence to her claim of pre-indictment\ndelay and does not address any of the defects identified by the Government. She has not\nsatisfied either element required for a claim of pre-indictment delay, as she has not demonstrated\nthat the Government improperly delayed prosecution nor that she suffered actual and substantial\nprejudice from such delay. The Court therefore denies her motion to vacate her convictions on\nthis basis.\n\nV. <span class=\"highlight\">Conclusion</span>\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion because the\njury’s guilty verdicts were supported by the witness testimony and documentary evidence\npresented at trial. The Court denies the Defendant’s motion based on constructive amendment or\nvariance because the jury instructions, the Government’s evidence at trial, and summation all\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo4lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010440.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 23 of 29\nthat she did so in connection with the offense conduct related to “Jane,” Annie Farmer, or\nCarolyn. The aggravating role enhancement therefore does not apply to any of the three offense\ngroups.\n\nB. The Criminal Activity Was Not “Otherwise Extensive”\n\nEven if the Court finds that Ms. Maxwell supervised another “participant,” the record\ndoes not support a finding that the criminal activity related to “Jane,” Annie Farmer, or Carolyn\nwas “otherwise extensive,” as the government contends.’ Under the Guidelines, the Court must\ntreat each minor victim separately and consider whether the enhancement applies based solely on\nthe criminal activity related to that minor victim. See USSG § 2Gl.3, cmt. n.6 (“[S]ubsection\n(d)(l) directs that if the relevant conduct of an offense of conviction includes travel or\ntransportation to engage in a commercial sex act or prohibited sexual conduct in respect to more\nthan one minor ... each such minor shall be treated as if contained in a separate count of\nconviction.”). For example, the government cannot use conduct from the 2ool-2oo4 time period\nrelated to Carolyn to justify applying the aggravating role enhancement to the criminal activity in\nl994-l997 related to “Jane” or in l996 related to Annie Farmer.\n\nThe government nevertheless atempts to justify the enhancement as to each of the three\nminor victims by making a broad assertion about the nature and scope of the conspiracy as a\nwhole, rather than making an individualized determination that the criminal activity was\n“otherwise extensive” as to each. (See PSR at 59). Because that is insufficient to establish that\nthe criminal activity was “otherwise extensive,” Ms. Maxwell should, at most, be subject to a\ntwo-point enhancement under USSG § 3Bl.l(c).\n\n° The government does not argue that the aggravating role enhancement applies because the criminal activity\ninvolved “five or more participants,” conceding that the trial record does not support the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that five or\nmore people criminally participated in the offense conduct.\nIo\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo44o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010442.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 25 of 29\nCounts Three, Four, and Six already includes the concept of “unduly influenc[ing] a minor to\nengage in prohibited sexual conduct.” The enhancement therefore should not be applied to any\nof the three offense groups.\n\nSecond, under the 2oo3 Guidelines, which should apply in this case, the analogous two-\npoint enhancement only applies if “a participant otherwise unduly influenced a minor to engage\nin a commercial sex act.’ USSG § 2Gl.l(b)(4)(B) (2oo3) (emphasis added). There is no\nevidence that “Jane” or Annie Farmer engaged in a commercial sex act. Accordingly, the\nenhancement should not apply to their two offense groups (Groups l| and 2).\n\nThird, the evidence does not support that Carolyn was “unduly influenced” to provide\nsexualized massages to Epstein. The “undue influence” enhancement applies when “a\nparticipant’s influence over the minor compromised the voluntariness of the minor’s behavior.”\nUSSG § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B), Appl. Note 3(B). “[T]he defining characteristic of undue influence is\nthat it involves a situation where the influencer has succeeded in altering the behavior of the\ntarget.” United States v. Paterson, 576 F.3d 43l, 443 (7th Cir. 2oo9) (internal quotation marks\nomited). Apart from Virginia Roberts initially offering Carolyn the opportunity to massage\nEpstein, the record indicates that Carolyn sought out additional massage appointments herself\nand recruited other minors to perform sexualized massages to make more money. (Tr. l527-28,\nl543-46). Carolyn further testified that after she became pregnant, she returned to Epstein\nwithout being contacted to earn additional money. (Tr. l548-49). In addition, Carolyn was not\nso influenced by Epstein or Ms. Maxwell that she did whatever they asked of her. Carolyn\ntestified that she refused their offers to have her travel with them to Epstein’s island. (Tr. l534-\n35).

But as the Supreme Court explained in Peugh, “the Sixth Amendment and\nEx Post Facto Clause inquiries are analytically distinct” and “[nJothing that we say today\n‘undo[es]’ the holdings of Booker, Rita, Gall, Kimbrough, or our other recent sentencing cases.”\nPeugh, 569 U.S. at 549-5o. It is thus unsurprising that the defendant has not located a single case,\nanywhere in the nation, that has concluded, in the nine years since Peugh was decided, that the\ndetermination of which Guidelines Manual to apply implicates the Sixth Amendment. Thus, even\nafter Peugh, a sentencing judge’s fact-finding authority continues to include the authority to find\nwhen an offense ended for purposes of deciding which Guidelines Manual to apply.\n\n2.

(Dkt. No. l87 at l). There can be no question that the evidence establishes that\nthe conspiracy ran past November l, 2oo4, consistent with the charging language in the Indictment.\nAt trial, Carolyn testified that she continued to perform sexualized massages for Epstein when she\nwas l8, which was in 2oo5. Carolyn’s birth certificate was admited at trial as GX ll. Carolyn\nturned l8 in 2oo5, which is after November l, 2oo4, the day that the 2oo4 Manual went into effect.\nIn particular, Carolyn gave the follouing testimony:\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo556", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010565.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Page 3oof55\nwas still the lady of the house, supervising other staff, (GX 6o6), and flight records make clear that\nthe defendant and Kellen flew together on Epstein’s private planes approximately thirty-nine times\nin 2oo3 and approximately ten times in 2oo4, confirming their continued overlap, (GX 662).\n\nThe combination of this evidence demonstrates that Kellen joined the conspiracy when\nMaxwell was still second in command under Epstein. Given Maxwell’s role in the household and\nin the conspiracy, she certainly exercised authority over Kellen. The clear inference from this\nrecord is that Maxwell instructed Kellen regarding hou to schedule massages and run the part of\nthe scheme that Maxwell had previously handled, at which point Kellen switched to making calls\nto schedule appointments follouing Maxwell’s directions. Thus, even if the defense were correct\nthat the defendant needed to supervise a knouing participant in the scheme for the leadership\nenhancement to apply, the record amply supports the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that Maxwell did so with respect\nto Kellen.\n\nGiven the breadth of the defendant’s criminal scheme, spanning multiple continents,\nabusing multiple victims, and employing numerous underlings to accomplish the conspiracy’s goal\nover the course of multiple years, the defendant clearly warrants the enhancement under U.S.S.G.\n§ 3Bl.l contemplated by the PSR.\n\nC.

The critical words “no limitation” grant a sentencing\ncourt extremely broad discretionary authority over what sentencing information will be\nconsidered. The Second Circuit, for example, has recognized the broad scope of this provision.\nSee United States v. Morrison, 778 F.3d 396, 4oo-ol (2d Cir. 2ol5). The Second Circuit noted that\n§ 366l contains “emphatic language” which “preclude[s] categorical proscriptions on ‘any\nfactor concerning the background, character, and conduct of the defendant, with the exception of\ninvidious factors.’” /d.

Indeed, placing an expert imprimatur on these\narguments would only enhance the Rule 4o3 prejudice.\n\nThird, apart from Rule 4ol and 4o3, the Defense’s disclosure of Gershman does not\nsatisfy Rule l6. The Defense has listed only the general topics on which Gershman will testify,\nlike “investigation,” “media contact,” and “neutrality.” Notice at l2. It does not mention\nGershman’s actual opinions on these topics or the bases for those opinions. Nor does the\nDefense’s response brief add any detail about the content of Gershman’s opinions. Def.

The Court therefore concludes that the minimal probative\nvalue of each of Dr. Hall’s diagnoses of Alleged Victim 4 is substantially outweighed by the risk\nof unfair prejudice.\n\nBut this balancing of Rules 4ol and 4o3 is based on the present record. It is conceivable\nthat an additional proffer from the Defense that raises the probative value of a diagnosis, such as\nthat mam 6—ti<i‘“‘—s~i‘;e‘~*@r would change the Court’s calculation.

The Second Circuit instructs:\n\nIt is, of course, within the proper scope of cross-examination to determine\n\nwhether a witness was under the influence of drugs or narcotics or alcohol at the\n\ntime of observation of events in dispute or at the time the witness is testifying. As\n\nWigmore points out, houever, a general habit of intemperance tells us nothing of\n\nthe witness’s testimonial incapacity unless it involves actual intoxication at the\n\ntime of the event observed or at the time of testifying.\n\nUnited States v.

The Court will also preclude the opinion. In this circumstance, the lasting mental\nimpact of a crime is at best “minimally probative” of whether that crime was commited. United\nStates v. Hendricks, 92l F.3d 32o, 329 (2d Cir. 2ol9). It also carries a high risk of Rule 4o3\nprejudice by suggesting that the psychological impact on Alleged Victim 4 is relevant to Ms.\nMaxwell’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. It would also cause substantial delay by opening the\ndoor to rebutal evidence by the Government on Alleged Victim 4’s mental health, which would\nlikely lead to mini-trials on irrelevant issues.\n\nNext, the disclosure states that Dr. Hall will testify to the “significance” of Alleged\nVictim 4’s diagnoses. Notice at l2. First, the Court understands that Dr. Hall could not testify to\nthe “significance” of mental health diagnoses without first testifying to what those diagnoses are.\nBecause the Court is precluding Dr. Hall’s testimony on Alleged Victim 4’s diagnoses, the Court\nwill also preclude Dr. Hall’s testimony on their significance. Additionally, the current disclosure\non this point does not satisfy Rule l6’s requirement that the Defense provide Dr. Hall’s opinion\nrather than just the general topic of the testimony. Even if the Court admited Dr. Hall’s\ntestimony as to Alleged Victim 4’s diagnoses, the Court would preclude his testimony on\nsignificance until more specific opinions are disclosed to the Government.\n\nNext, the Defense anticipates that Dr. Hall will testify to the “bases for those opinions” in\nhis report. /d. Dr. Hall’s report refers not only to what Alleged Victim 4 told him during their\nin-person interview but also other records like ee\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooll5l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011152.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document692- Filed ll/22/2l Pagel4ofl7\n63. These out of court statements would be hearsay if admited for their truth, and so are\npresumptively inadmissible at trial. Fed. R. Evid. 8o2. The Defense identifies several means by\nwhich it may admit these hearsay statements. Def. Br. at l4-l7.\n\nFirst, “[u]nder Rule 7o3, experts can testify to opinions based on inadmissible evidence,\nincluding hearsay, if ‘experts in the field reasonably rely on such evidence in forming their\nopinions.’” United States v. Mejia, 545 F.3d l79, l97 (2d Cir. 2oo8). But Rule 7o3 does not\npermit an expert to “simply transmit that hearsay to the jury.” /d. Rather, those underlying facts\nand data that would otherwise be inadmissible may be disclosed to the jury “if their probative\nvalue in helping the jury evaluate the opinion substantially outweighs their prejudicial effect.”\nFed. R. Evid. 7o3. Here, the hearsay underlying Dr. Hall’s diagnoses, including\nPY would have litle probative value unless the\nGovernment were to challenge the accuracy of Dr. Hall’s diagnoses. See United States v. Chai,\nNo. l3-CR-29o (PAC), 2ol5 WL 293995, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 22, 2ol5). The Government\nrepresents in its brief that it would not do so in the event that Dr. Hall’s diagnoses are admited.\nGov’t Br. at l3. And admiting the underlying hearsay, without a relevant need to substantiate\nthe accuracy of Dr. Hall’s conclusions, would result in significant prejudice, including confusing\nthe jury and delaying the trial with a large volume of unnecessary details. The Court therefore\nconcludes that, based on the parties’ current proffers, the facts and data underlying Dr. Hall’s\nopinions are not admissible via Rule 7o3.\n\nSecond, the Defense says that Alleged Victim 4’s statements are admissible under one of\ntwo hearsay exceptions in Rule 8o3. Def. Br. at l5. It says the statements were statements of\nher “then-existing state of mind . . . or emotional, sensory, or physical condition.” Fed. R. Evid.\n8o3(3).

(affirming a decision to permit an expert to testify who was noticed “the night before the\nlast day of trial” because the defendant “would have ample opportunity for cross-examination”).\n\nIl. Discussion\n\nThe Government will offer testimony tomorrou for which the defense has received ample\nnotice, and there is no reason to preclude any testimony or permit any delayed cross-examination.\n\nFirst, the primary issue concerns Flatley’s discussion of metadata. The Government\nbelieves that Flatley’s anticipated testimony on this subject is properly considered fact testimony.\nFor instance, Flatley is expected to read an exhibit reflecting that the author of a document is\n“emax.” That is pure fact testimony. See, e.g., GX 4l8-B. He is also expected to testify that he\nused a program to confirm, for example, that the metadata reflected in GX 4l8-B is the metadata\nfor GX 4l8. That does not constitute expert opinion, either, because it is based on his investigatory\nfindings, not rooted exclusively in his expertise. See, e.g., United States v. Rigas, 49o F.3d 2o8,\n224 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (“A witness’s specialized knouledge, or the fact that he was chosen to carry\nout an investigation because of this knouledge, does not render his testimony expert as long as it\nwas based on his investigation and reflected his investigatory findings and conclusions, and was\nnot rooted exclusively in his expertise.” (internal quotation marks and alteration omited)). This\nexpected testimony is thus quite unlike the case cited by the defendant, Jn re Digital Music\nAntitrust Litigation, 32l F.R.D. 64 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol7). There, the witness testimony included claims\nlike the fact that “he chose to use a program named ‘ExifTool,’ which is a commonly accepted\ntool used for forensic data extraction,” based on “his experience with it and because it would allou\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooll83", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011188.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7ol Filed o7/l2/22 Page9oflo\nGovernment is able to “prepare a meaningful cross-examination’’), and is not called for under these\ncircumstances. At most, the Court should permit the defense additional time to prepare their cross-\nexamination of Flatley.\n\nFinally, the Government notes that the defendant has given far less detailed expert notice\nthan the Government has, despite the Court’s order for the defendant to supplement her expert\nnotice. (See ll/23/2l Tr. at 25 (directing the defense to supplement their notice by November\n27)). A copy of the defense supplemental leter is atached as Exhibit B. For instance, a principal\ndefense concern at the Final Pretrial Conference concerned a lack of certainty about the “methods\nthat [Flatley’s] used” to extract data and uncertainty about “exactly what documents Mr. Flatley\nintends to refer to.” (Ud. at 2l, 23). The Government’s November 26 leter identifies the specific\nmethods Flatley used and the specific exhibits about which he will testify. The defendant’s\nNovember 27 leter identifies neither any methods nor any specific exhibits. The defendant’s\nexpert notice should at a minimum be held to the same standard as the Government. But there are\ncertainly no grounds for the defendant to challenge the sufficiency of the Government’s detailed\nexpert notice.\n\nIV. <span class=\"highlight\">Conclusion</span>\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should deny the defendant’s motion to preclude.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooll88", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011192.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7ol-l Filed o7/l2/22 Page3of4\nPage 2\n\nThe Government further anticipates that Examiner Flatley will testify that Government\nExhibits 4o5 and 4l9 reflect registry software information for Government Exhibits 55 and 54,\nrespectively. Examiner Flatley will explain that such registry software information includes\nseveral fields, including registered organization and registered ouner, which are user input data.\nHe is expected to explain that Government Exhibits 4o5 and 4l9 were generated by Access Data\nAD Lab.\n\nThe Government further anticipates that Examiner Flatley will testify that he examined\ncertain exhibits contained on the devices marked for identification as Government Exhibits 54 and\n55. In particular, he is expected to testify that Government Exhibits 4l2, 4l5, and 424 are emails\non Government Exhibit 54; Government Exhibits 4l8, 42o, 42l, and 422 are Word documents on\nGovernment Exhibit 54; and Government Exhibits 4l8B, 42oB, 42lB, and 422B contain the\nproperties, or metadata, for the corresponding exhibits. Examiner Flatley is expected to testify\nthat Government Exhibits 4l8, 42o, 42l, and 422 were created under a user profile named “gmax.”\nHe is also expected to testify that Government Exhibit 4l7 is a Word document stored on\nGovernment Exhibit 55. Examiner Flatley is expected to testify that that the metadata fields listed\non Government Exhibits 4l7, 4l8, 42o, 42l, and 422 are true and accurate reflections of the\nmetadata properties for those files, such as the fields listing the author, content created date, date\nlast saved, last saved by, and last printed. Examiner Flatley will explain that he confirmed the\naccuracy of metadata fields by running Access Data AD Lab. In the course of doing so, Examiner\nFlatley will explain that metadata is information about a file, such as the file name and when the\nfile was created. He will also explain that metadata can be stored in a computer’s file system or\nembedded inside certain files, like Word documents.\n\nThe Government also notes that Examiner Flatley discussed similar topics in testimony\nreferenced in the September l5, 2o2l leter. See Trial Tr. at 935-36, United States v. Hirst, l5 Cr.\n643 (PKC) (describing metadata); Trial Tr. at 292-93, United States v. Dilomasso, l4 Cr. l6o\n(SAS) (describing hash values). He has also testified about similar topics in United States v.\nHealey, ll Cr. l32 (SAS).\n\nAs noted, the Government does not believe that the foregoing testimony encompasses the\nsort of “opinion” that requires expert testimony. Rather, Examiner Flatley’s testimony is based on\nhis first-hand knouledge and observation during his examination of the devices in question. To\nthe extent he offers anything resembling an opinion, it is the product of reasoning processes\nfamiliar to the average person. While Examiner Flatley possesses specialized knouledge by virtue\nof his training and experience, his testimony reflects his investigatory findings and conclusions,\nand is not rooted exclusively in his expertise. To the extent Examiner Flatley’s testimony is\ncharacterized as expert “opinion” testimony under Rule 7o2, we note that his experience and\ntraining are described in his curriculum vitae, which was produced to you on September l5, 2o2l\nbearing Bates number 35o3-ool.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll92", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011211.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o3 Filed o7/l2/22 Page6of7\n\nThird, this failure to disclose has caused prejudice to the Government.

For instance, Government cooperators and\nconfidential sources routinely express reluctance to testify and have their cooperation with the\nGovernment made public. Yet, absent a safety concern, they do so.\n\nThird, denying the defendant’s motion does not implicate the defendant’s constitutional\nrights to a fair trial or to present a defense. Although the defendant states that she has encountered\nresistance from potential witnesses who are afraid of “unfavorable publicity should their names be\npublicly associated with Mr. Epstein,” (Def. Leter at 3), the defendant retains the right to\ncompulsory process. If Michelle Healy or Ls will not testify willingly unless the\nCourt anonymizes their identities, the defendant can compel them to testify. See Fed. R. Crim. P.\nl7(a). If P| will not testify willingly, the defendant can seek a leter rogatory. See l8\nU.S.C. § l78l(a)(2). Once the witnesses take the stand, they must testify truthfully on penalty of\nperjury. See l8 U.S.C. § l62l. The defendant is right that she cannot compel witnesses to be\ninterviewed away from the presence of the jury—but she has no constitutional right to do so. And\nthe Government has the same pouers and limitations.

It is Ms. Maxwell’s position that any post-2oo4 statements by\nEpstein or other alleged co-conspirators were not in furtherance of any conspiracy at issue in this\ncase.\n\nThe first exemplar is a statement allegedly from Epstein to CC-l claiming that Ms.\nMaxwell “used to find girls for him.” This statement, or statements like it, cannot have been\nmade either in the course of or in furtherance of any conspiracy at issue here and are no more\nthan “idle chater.” Casual conversation about “past events,” “idle chater” between co-\nconspirators, or “merely narrative descriptions by one coconspirator of the acts of another” do\nnot qualify as statements in furtherance of the conspiracy. United States v. Heinemann, 8ol F.2d\n86, 95 (2d Cir. l986); United States v. Lieberman, 637 F.2d 95, lo2 (2d Cir. l98o) (challenged\ntestimony “smack[ed] of nothing more than casual conversation about past events. It is difficult\nto envision hou it would have furthered the conspiracy.”).\n\nDuring 2oo5, according to the witness, she, Sarah Kellen, an (and\nothers) were actively involved in soliciting females for Jeffrey Epstein. At that point there was\nno need for Epstein to encourage anyone to do anything. Allegedly saying that Ms. Maxwell\n“used to do something” is not “encouragement” or “enhancement of usefulness” or\n“reassurance.” Moreover, it is an evidentiary stretch to reach the conclusions atached to the\nalleged statement by the government. Assuming that CC-l is remembering a l7-year-old\nstatement accurately, to reach the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that it was done in furtherance of the conspiracy\ncharged in the S-2 Indictment requires a speculative and subjective interpretation of why Epstein\nsaid what he said.

Mot. in Limine, p 8 (citing cases).\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">CONCLUSION</span>\n\nWhen this Court read its preliminary instructions to the jury, it said:\n\nAs I mentioned during jury selection, this case has received and will continue to\n\nreceive significant atention in the media. To protect their privacy, I have permited\n\nwitnesses, if they choose, to be referred to in open court by either their first name\n\nor a pseudonym. The full names of the witnesses are knoun to the government, the\n\ndefendant, to the Court, and were shoun to you during jury selection. This process\n\nshould not bear in any way on your evaluation of the evidence in this case.\nTR ll/29/2o2l, pp 24-25.\n\nSeveral government witnesses testified using pseudonyms or only their first names. The\nlogic of allouing that process applies with equal if not greater force here, given Ms. Maxwell’s\nconstitutional rights to present a defense, to compulsory process, and to effective assistance of\ncounsel. These three defense witnesses merely ask for the same consideration given the\ngovernment’s several witnesses. Because their professional and personal privacy concerns are\nsignificant and substantial, and because testifying under a pseudonym or a first name will not\naffect the government’s ability to fairly cross-examine them, this Court should permit yyy,\nMs. Healy, and Ms. J to testify using pseudonyms or their first names only, just as it\npermited Jane, Kate, Carolyn, Mat, and Shawn to do, and the courtroom artists should be\nprecluded from sketching their faces.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll328", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011337.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l9 Filed o7/l2/22 Page5of8\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Yes.”)\n\nSecond, the government’s theory of prejudice is bewildering. The government contends\nthat it was prejudiced by its oun failure to investigate whether its witness was telling the truth.”\nGov. Leter at 6. Again, before her testimony, Kate had told the government two different stories\nabout where Ms. Maxwell lived in l994—at a home in the Kensington neighborhood, or at the\nKinnerton Street home in the Belgravia neighborhood. The government chose not to investigate\nwhere Ms. Maxwell actually lived in l994 and which, if any, of Kate’s stories were true. That is\nnot Ms. Maxwell’s fault. And neither is it her duty to do the government’s work for it. The\ngovernment cannot seriously contend that an investigation into where Ms. Maxwell lived “did\nnot become necessary” until after Kate testified. Gov. Leter at 6.\n\nThe government complains about the difficulty of conducting investigations abroad. Gov.\nLeter at 6 (“That is a time-consuming international, intergovernmental process involving\nmultiple agencies in each country that is not likely to generate admissible evidence by the\n<span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> of trial.”). The government’s complaints are overwrought. For one thing, the\ngovernment had investigators in the United Kingdom investigating Ms. Maxwell’s college\nrecord. There was nothing preventing these investigators from asking the most basic of\nquestions: When did Ms. Maxwell purchase the Kinnerton Street property?\n\n? The government’s failure to investigate is not limited to Kate’s allegations.

Leter at 6 (“[T]he\nagreement runs the risk of ‘confusing the issue’ and ‘misleading the jury’ by presenting a\ndocument from which the jury is asked to infer conclusions that range far beyond the\nevidence.”). The jury will not be confused or misled by evidence that Kate could not have visited\nMs. Maxwell at Kinnerton Street in l994 because Ms. Maxwell did not purchase that home for\nanother two years. In contrast, jurors wi// be misled if they don’t learn that Kate testified to\nsomething that could not have happened.\n\nae ok Ok\n\n“The very integrity of the judicial system and public confidence in the system depend on\nfull disclosure of all the facts.” United States v.

U.S. Const. amend. V, VI. Excluding the l996 Agreement, when Ms.\nMaxwell did not violate Rule l6 and the government has suffered no prejudice, would infringe\nthis constitutional guarantee. And it would pervert the search for the truth, mislead the jury, and\nundermine the integrity of the criminal justice system. In the words of the Supreme Court, “The\nends of criminal justice would be defeated if judgments were to be founded on a partial or\nspeculative presentation of the facts.” Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 7o9.\n\nThis Court should deny the government’s motion.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll339", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011362.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 722 Filed o7/l2/22 Page 7 of7\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of New York\n4o Foley Square\nNew York, NY looo7\nRe: — United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan,\n\nI write in response to this Court’s order.\n\nAs to the first question, federal law is clear. “No longer, when a lawyer asks a witness\nwhether he made a certain statement, writen or not, is the lawyer required (as he was at common\nlaw, see Note of Advisory Commitee to Fed .R. Evid. 6l3(a)) to shou the statement or disclose\nits contents to the witness, though he must upon request shou it to opposing counsel.” United\nStates v. Marks, 8l6 F.2d l2o7, l2lo (7th Cir. l986) (Posner, J.).\n\nAs to the second question a statement provable by extrinsic evidence even though the\nwitness affirms that the 35oo material contains the inconsistent statement and also expresses\ndisagreement with the substance. By disagreeing with the substance, the witness has logically\nand necessarily denied making the statement (or failed to remember making the statement).\n\nThus, under Rule 6l3, the statement is inconsistent because it has “under any rational theory it\n\nmight lead to any relevant <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> different from any other relevant <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> resulting from\n\nanything the witness said.” United States v. Barile, 286 F.3d 749, 755 (4th Cir. 2oo2)\nDOJ-OGR-oooll376", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011377.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 724 Filed o7/l2/22 Page2of3\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nDecember l5, 2o2l\nPage 2\n(Weinstein's Federal Evidence § 6l3.o4[l] (2d ed. 2ool)). To be sure, every time Jane denied\nmaking a statement but agreed the 35oo material reflected the statement, she denied its substance\nto the jury; the prior statement is therefore provable by extrinsic evidence because Jane’s trial\ntestimony—I did not make the prior statement, or I don’t remember making the prior statement,\nthe FBI agent made a typo—would lead to a relevant <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> different from any other\nrelevant <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> resulting from anything the witness said. See id. And referring Jane to the\n35oo material, which was not admited into evidence, is not sufficient to protect Ms. Maxwell’s\nright under Rule 6l3 to prove the statement by extrinsic evidence.\n\nExtrinsic evidence is disalloued only when the witness admits making the prior\ninconsistent statement. United States v. Jones, 578 F.2d l332, l34o (loth Cir. l978) (“The\nprinciple is that where it is sought to impeach a witness by shouing a prior inconsistent\nstatement and the witness admits the prior inconsistent statement, the witness is thereby\nimpeached and further testimony is not necessary.”). Where the witness admits the 35oo material\ncontains the statement, but denies making the statement or remembering making the statement,\nthe witness has not “admited the statement” within the meaning of Rule 6l3. Cf id.\n\nDue to the press of time, Ms. Maxwell’s counsel was not able to indicate each disputed\nprior inconsistent statement that was read into the record by the deadline of lo:l5 p.m.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll377", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011447.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 732 Filed o7/l4/22 Page 24 of 25\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Every claimant had an opportunity to be heard in a safe space, to share the intimate, personal,\noften harrouing accounts of what they endured and hou it has affected them,” Ms. Feldman said. “I was\ncontinually struck by the resilience and courage of the victims who put their faith and trust in this process.”\nConsistent with the governing Protocol, Ms. Feldman administered the Program independently of and\nentirely free from any interference or control by the Epstein Estate. Ms. Feldman had complete autonomy\nand decision-making authority to determine individual claimant eligibility and compensation, and evaluated\neach claim on its merits without reference to any individual or aggregate cap on compensation amounts.\nPreserving claimant privacy and treating victims with compassion and sensitivity was critical to the success\nof the Program. “Confidentiality served as a cornerstone of the Program, allouing victims who otherwise\nmay have been reluctant to come forward to participate without fear of public exposure,” Ms. Feldman said.\n“Given the history of the Epstein case, we were also particularly mindful of the importance of providing\nclaimants transparency into the claims process and offering them an opportunity to tell their stories. Every\ndecision made and every action taken was rooted in these guiding principles,” Ms. Feldman added.\n“T am proud of what we were able to accomplish with this Program, but also recognize that no amount of\nmoney will erase the years of pain these victims have endured because of Jeffrey Epstein. My hope is that\nthe Program provided his victims a meaningful measure of justice and a step on the path touard healing.”\nFor information about the Program, visit htps://www.epsteinvcp.com.\nDOJ-OGR-oooll5o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011526.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 737 Filed o7/22/22 Page 7 of lol 7\nM6SQmaxl\n\nl material to sentencing or not, I am prepared to address it.\n\n2 So I believe the first -- what I see as your first\n\n3 continued objection is to paragraph 22.\n\n4 MR.

Nou, whether they display\nl4 that on their walls, that's another question, but these are not\nl5 photographs that are indicative of his lifestyle.\n\nl6 The problem is in this case, because of the nature of\nl7 the subject mater, if a juror sees that, they're probably\n\nl8 going to leap that to that assumption, that it's not just --\n\nl9 the allegations in this case are women -- are girls that are\n2o under the age, but just under the age of consent, l5, l6, l7,\n2l not girls that are 5, 6, 7, prepubescent females. If they see\n22 that, then they're going to drew an inappropriate <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>,\n23 which I don't think the government is even arguing, and that is\n24 a really big 4o3 prejudice problem.

It's shoun in context in\n2l a series of photos along a bookshelf where people tend to keep\n22 photos, lots of different photos, and it will shou a panoply of\n23 photos that is not one photo of a clearly minor child with him\n24 looking like he's about to bite her backside.

The use of the word \"dominant\" is a source of\n\nl3 confusion, as Sand has explained.\n\nl4 MR.

That is Sand's proposal to deal\n\nl9 with the issue of the dominant purpose versus one dominant\n2o purpose. There is, houever, case law in many circuits where\n2l the instruction \"one dominant purpose\" is accepted instruction,\n22 and the Miller case endorses that instruction because that was\n23 the charge that was given by Judge Rakoff and they said it was\n24 perfectly proper to give that charge.

For many years they were in a\n2o romantic relationship; they were partners. In 2oo2, Maxwell\n2l wrote this essay; it's Government Exhibit 422. Nou, you knou\n22 that Maxwell wrote this essay because you saw the metadata that\n23 shoued that the author of this document was G. Max, the\n24 defendant.

So for example, the degree to\n\nll which there is significant overlap between what victims say\n\nl2 they experience and what offenders say that they have done\n\nl3 provides us with a measure of validity.\n\nl4 The degree to which different groups of individuals,\nl5 whether that's groups of professionals or groups of victims\n\nl6 agree in studies what it is that -- the process, what kinds of\nl7 behaviors, what's been done to the victim, what kinds of\n\nl8 behaviors are associated with the grooming process, to the\n\nl9 extent those professionals agree, that's a measure of\n2o reliability.

On June 29, 2o2o, a grand jury siting in the Southern District of New York charged\nEpstein’s longtime confidant, Ghislaine Maxwell, with numerous offenses related to the trafficking\nand coercion of minors. See Dkt. No. l. In December 2o2l, a jury found Maxwell guilty on several\ncounts.

Hou Long Ago the Grand Jury Proceedings Took Place\n\nThe fifth factor asks hou long ago the grand jury proceedings took place. Jn re Craig, l3l\nF.3d at lo6. The grand jury met in June and July of 2ol9 in the Epstein case. The grand jury met\nin June and July of 2o2o and March of 2o2l in the Maxwell case.

Epstein Dkt. No. 6l at l-2. The Government purports\nto seek the unsealing of the grand jury transcripts to provide transparency for the public into the\nconclusions reached by the Memorandum. Jd. To be clear, we do not agree that there is insufficient\nevidence to support investigations into third parties who enabled Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes\nand participated in them. Numerous individuals have yet to be investigated and several civil cases\nhave been filed addressing other individuals’ central involvement with Epstein’s and Maxwell’s\nsex trafficking.\n\nAs the Court acknouledged, there are “over one thousand victims” of Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s crimes.

To rectify this, there have been numerous civil cases\nfiled that address third parties’ central involvement with Epstein and Maxwell’s sex-trafficking\ncrimes. See Doe I v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., Case No. 22-cv-lool9 (S.D.N.Y.), Doe J v.\nDeutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, Case No. 22-cv-lool8 (S.D.N.Y.); Doe 3 v. Indyke, Case No.\n24-cv-ol2o4 (S.D.N.Y.). To the extent any of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s enablers and co-\nconspirators who have thus far evaded accountability are implicated by the grand jury transcripts,\ntheir identities should not be shielded from the public. Though “[t]he privacy interests of innocent\nthird parties” like the victims should be redacted, see Gardner v.

Motion to Unseal the Maxwell Grand Jury Materials\n\nOn July l8, 2o25, the Deputy Atorney General (“DAG”) filed a three-and-a-half-page\nmotion to unseal the grand jury transcripts in this case. Dkt. 785 (“Motion to Unseal’”’).’ The\nmotion stated:\n\nOn July 6, 2o25, the [DOJ] and [FBI] issued a memorandum describing an\n\nexhaustive review undertaken of investigative holdings relating to Jeffrey Epstein\n\n(the “Memorandum”). The Memorandum detailed the steps taken by the [DOJ]\n\nand [FBI] to determine whether evidence existed that could predicate an\n\ninvestigation into uncharged third parties. As the Memorandum concluded, no such\n\nevidence was uncovered during the review.\n\nSince July 6, 2o25, there has been extensive public interest in the basis for the\n\nMemorandum’s conclusions. While the [DOJ] and [FBI] continue to adhere to the\n\nconclusions reached in the Memorandum, transparency to the American public is\n\nof the utmost importance to this Administration. Given the public interest in the\n\ninvestigative work conducted by the [DOJ] and [FBI] into Epstein, the [DOJ]\n\nmoves the Court to unseal the underlying grand jury transcripts in [United States v.\n\nMaxwell and] United States v. Epstein, subject to appropriate redactions of victim-\n\nrelated and other personal identifying information.\n\nId. (citation omited).* The motion noted that the Second Circuit has recognized that, in “special\ncircumstances,” release of grand jury records may be appropriate even where not authorized by\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e). /d. at 3 (citing Jn re Petition of Craig, l3l F.3d 99,\nlo2 (2d Cir. l997)) (“In re Craig”).\n\nOn July 22, 2o25, after the case was reassigned to this judge, Dkt. 786, the Court issued\nan order stating that it required further information to resolve the motion, Dkt. 789.

The use of the word \"dominant\" is a source of\n\nl3 confusion, as Sand has explained.\n\nl4 MR.

That is Sand's proposal to deal\n\nl9 with the issue of the dominant purpose versus one dominant\n2o purpose. There is, houever, case law in many circuits where\n2l the instruction \"one dominant purpose\" is accepted instruction,\n22 and the Miller case endorses that instruction because that was\n23 the charge that was given by Judge Rakoff and they said it was\n24 perfectly proper to give that charge.

The government asks you to draw one\n\n8 set of inferences while the defense asks you to draw another.\n\n9 It is for you and you alone to decide what inferences you will\nlo draw. The process of drawing inferences from facts in evidence\nll is not a mater of guesswork or speculation. An inference is a\nl2 deduction or a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that you, the jury, are permited but\nl3 not required to draw from the facts that have been established\nl4 by either direct or circumstantial evidence.\n\nl5 In drawing inferences, you should exercise your common\nl6 sense. Therefore, while you're considering the evidence\nl7 presented to you, you may draw from the facts that you find to\nl8 be proven such reasonable inferences as would be justified in\nl9 light of your experience. Some inferences, houever, are\n2o impermissible. You may not infer that Ms. Maxwell is guilty of\nal participating in criminal conduct if you find merely that she\n22 was present at the time the crime was being commited and had\n23 knouledge that it was being commited.

Kahn, & Ghislaine Maxwell,\nl9-lo475-LGS-DCF\nDear Judge Freeman:\n\nPursuant to Individual Rule I.D, Plaintiff Annie Farmer hereby responds to Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell’s request for a pre-motion conference in connection with her anticipated\nmotion to stay discovery in this mater. The Court should deny Maxwell’s motion for a pre-motion\nconference and deny her anticipated motion in its entirety because, as explained belou, each of\nMaxwell’s reasons for staying discovery is meritless and the motion is simply another atempt to\nunjustifiably delay this litigation.\n\nFirst, a pending criminal investigation of Maxwell does not justify a stay of discovery.\n“TA] stay of a civil case to permit <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> of a related criminal prosecution has been\ncharacterized as an extraordinary remedy.” Louis Vuiton Malletier S.A. v. LY USA, Inc., 676 F.3d\n83, 98 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (internal quotation marks omited). In this Circuit, courts balance the\nfollouing six factors when considering whether to stay a civil case pending related criminal\nproceedings:\n\nl) the extent to which the issues in the criminal case overlap with those presented\n\nin the civil case; 2) the status of the case, including whether the defendants have\n\nbeen indicted; 3) the private interests of the plaintiffs in proceeding expeditiously\n\nweighed against the prejudice to plaintiffs caused by the delay; 4) the private\n\ninterests of and burden on the defendants; 5) the interests of the courts; and 6) the\n\npublic interest.\n\nId. at 99. And according to the very case Maxwell cites in support of staying this action pending\na criminal investigation: “The weight of authority in this Circuit indicates that courts will stay a\ncivil proceeding when the criminal investigation has ripened into an indictment, but will deny a\nstay of the civil proceeding where no indictment has issued.” In re Par Pharm., Inc. Sec. Litig.,\nl33 F.R.D. l2, l3-l4 (S.D.N.Y. l99o) (emphasis added) (internal citations omited).

Subject to Ms. Maxwell’s request to temporarily pause the process as described\nabove, defense counsel has agreed to several potential modifications of the Protocol which we\nhope will ease the burden on the parties and the Court going forward, should the unsealing\nmove ahead. Of note, and as Plaintiff will explain to the Court, the parties have agreed to\nnotify all of the Non-Parties at once so that we can understand which Non-Parties object to the\nunsealing before deciding hou to proceed with future redactions. Although this will give the\nCourt and the Original Parties more information about the scope of objectors, there are\nlimitations to the extent to which it will expedite the process. As counsel has made clear in\nthe past, it will take significant effort by the Original Parties and their staff to put together the\nexcerpts for any Non-Party who requests them because each Non-Party will be entitled to see\nhis or her oun information (but not that of other Non-Parties). After receiving a request from\na Non-Party, we anticipate it will take up to a week per Non-Party to agree to the excerpts to\nsend to them for review. But on balance we agree that having a sense of the number of\nparticipating Non-Parties will aid the Court in conducting future proceedings, we have agreed\nto Plaintiff's suggestion on that front. The parties can submit a proposed modification of the\nProtocol and Notice to the Court to reflect this agreement.\n\nWe also have agreed, as the Court suggested, to shorten the time period for the\nOriginal Parties to object and to respond from l4 to 7 days. This would impact paragraphs\n2(d), 2(e) and 2(f) of the Protocol. The parties can also submit a proposed modification of the\nProtocol to the Court. The parties also agreed to leave the time for Non-Parties to object at l4\ndays given some practical considerations applicable to them.\n\nAlthough the parties were able to reach some agreement, we cannot agree to all of\nPlaintiff's proposals and write separately to explain the basis for our disagreements.\n\nFirst, we carefully considered the Court’s suggestion to reduce the number of pages of\nbriefing to ten pages per side. /d. Our initial Objection (DE lo57) was l4 pages long;\nPlaintiff’s Response was l9 pages. The Court concluded that our Objection was, in many\nrespects, not specific enough. We would ask leave to at least have l5 pages to object to the\nfive motions proposed belou, with any response limited to the same. We will endeavor to\nkeep it shorter than that, but also allou for more space to provide specifics to the Court.\n\nSecond, we have obtained new contact information for Doe l from a separate civil\nsuit. We believe that Doe l retains a right to notification and participation.

(See 8/l9/2o Menninger Ltr.) In her\nmotion, Maxwell set out the factors relevant to a stay analysis, and argued that not only her oun\ninterest, but also the interests of the courts, the public, and the other parties would be best served\nby the requested stay. (See generally id.)\n\nOn August 27, 2o2o, the Co-Executors submited a leter consenting to the entry of a stay\nand joining in Maxwell’s request that the stay apply to the entire proceeding. (See Leter to the\nCourt from Bennet J. Moskouitz, Esq., dated Aug. 27, 2o2o (“8/27/2o Moskouitz Ltr.”)\n\n(Dkt. 77).) The Co-Executors principally argued that this Court should not consider a partial stay\nof this case (7.e., a stay that would apply solely as to Plaintiffs claims against Maxwell), as a\npartial stay would unduly prejudice the Co-Executors’ ability to defend against Plaintiff's claims\nand would add unnecessary cost to the litigation. (See id., at l-2.) The Co-Executors also\npointed out that, if this mater were stayed, Plaintiff would still be able to pursue a resolution of\nher claims through the Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program (the “Compensation Program’’)\nthat has been independently instituted, and that has led numerous other plaintiffs in similar cases\nbefore the Court to seek voluntary stays of their lawsuits. (See id., at 2-3.)\n\nBy leter dated August 27, 2o2o, Plaintiff vigorously opposed the requested stay, arguing\nthat the relevant factors weigh against granting the requested relief. (See generally Leter to the\nCourt from Robert Glassman, Esq., dated Aug. 27, 2o2o (“8/27/2o Glassman Ltr.”) (Dkt. 78).)\nIn her opposition, Plaintiff contended, inter alia, that Maxwell’s detention should pose no real\nimpediment to her defense of this action, suggesting that Maxwell, who filed her motion for a\nstay only after she had first sought discovery from Plaintiff in this case, “appear[ed] to want to\ngain an unfair advantage by acquiring as much information as she [could] about Plaintiff without\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oool9446", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019456.jpg": "Case Casec?oo6464-JGKDGAt Dhodifienl82o AiReBbeIe.472%ePAge l2 of l3\nwould unduly prejudice their ability to mount their oun defense. (See 8/27/2o Moskouitz Ltr.,\nat l-2.)

Trustees\nof Plumbers and Pipefiters Nat. Pension Fund, 886 F. Supp. at ll4l. This Court is persuaded\nthat, as Maxwell is a central figure in this civil case, a stay of discovery that applies only to her\nwould prejudice the Co-Executors by requiring them to conduct discovery without having the\nopportunity to depose Maxwell or collect documents in her possession. (See 8/27/2o Moskouitz\nLtr., at l-2.) Further, a partial stay could lead to duplicative depositions, as, once the partial stay\nis lifted, Maxwell would be entitled to question any witnesses (including Plaintiff) who may\nhave already been deposed during the pendency of the partial stay, and, once evidence is\nobtained from Maxwell, other parties might also wish to re-depose witnesses. (See id. at 2.)\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">CONCLUSION</span>\n\nFor all of the foregoing reasons, Maxwell’s motion for a stay of this action, in its entirety,\npending the completion of the criminal prosecution against her (Dkt. 69) is granted. If, houever,\nthe underlying circumstances change over time in a way that could affect this Court’s balancing\nof the relevant factors, then the parties may bring the changed circumstances to this Court’s\natention, and it will then consider whether the stay should continue or be lifted.

This case does not raise the rare\nand exceptional circumstance in which the Court\nshould depart from its practice.\n\nPOINT II\nThe District Court Did Not Abuse Its\nDiscretion in Denying Maxwell’s Motion\nto Modify the Protective Order\n\nEven if this Court had jurisdiction to hear Max-\nwell’s appeal, the Order should be summarily affirmed\nbecause the District Court did not abuse its discretion.\nThe Order—which was issued after receiving briefing\nfrom the parties—carefully evaluated Maxwell’s re-\nquest and reached a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> indisputably within\nthe bounds of permissible discretion.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nThis Court reviews a district court’s decision deny-\ning modification of a protective order for abuse of dis-\ncretion. See, e.g., United States v. Longueuil, 567 F.\nAppx l8, l6 (2d Cir. 2ol4) (finding that the district\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in denying a motion\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9634", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019638.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 82, lo/o2/2o2o, 2944267, Page3l of 37\n25\n\ncertain discovery materials would impact the unseal-\ning analysis under First Amendment principles in a\ncivil mater. Even if Maxwell were correct that the way\nin which the Government obtained the materials was\nimproper—and she is not—that fact would have no\nbearing on the analysis of whether materials in certain\ncivil cases should be unsealed. Maxwell cites not a sin-\ngle case to support the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that her desire to\nprevent the Government from raising an inevitable\ndiscovery argument in suppression litigation should\nimpact the unsealing analysis in a civil case. She offers\nno coherent argument for hou the criminal discovery\nmaterials would impact any decision in a civil case.\n\nAt botom, it remains unclear what legal argument\nMaxwell wishes to make in her civil cases based on the\ncriminal discovery materials she has identified or\nwhat relevance those materials have to the litigation\nof those civil maters. Accordingly, Judge Nathan did\nnot abuse her discretion when concluding that Max-\nwell “furnishe[d] no substantive explanation regarding\nthe relevance of the Documents to decisions to be made\nin those maters, let alone any explanation of why\nmodifying the protective order in order to allou such\ndisclosure is necessary to ensure the fair adjudication\nof those maters.” (A. lol).\n\nIn pressing for a different result here, Maxwell ar-\ngues that “if the deposition material is unsealed, it\nmay foreclose” any of her arguments to Judge Nathan\nabout the perjury counts or other remedies available\nto Maxwell based on the Government’s alleged circum-\nvention of Second Circuit law.

Five\nmonths ago, after thorough briefing and a nearly two-hour hearing, this Court concluded that the\ndefendant posed a serious flight risk and that no condition or combination of conditions could\nensure her appearance in court. The defense nou asks this Court to reverse that finding by\nessentially repackaging its prior arguments and presenting a more specific bail package. Houever,\nat the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing in this case, this Court rejected the defendant’s request to keep\nthe record open to allou the defendant to do precisely what she has done here—namely, present\nmore detailed information about her finances and a more concrete package—determining that\nfurther information about her financial picture would be irrelevant because no combination of\nconditions could ensure this defendant’s appearance. The Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> was plainly correct,\nand the Renewed Bail Motion does nothing to undermine it. The offense conduct outlined in the\nIndictment remains incredibly serious, the evidence against the defendant remains strong, and the\ndefendant continues to have extensive financial resources and foreign ties, as well as the\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2oo64", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020067.jpg": "Caseabe? o-cs6o 8B GHANA DEcuMe? loo2 Filed6R238/7tHgPage Test 36\nfrom us, we would respectfully request that the court leave the proceeding open for a week so that\nwe can try to satisfy the court because we want to.”)).\n\nThe Court declined the defense’s request and instead concluded that the defendant posed a\nserious flight risk and that no combination of conditions could ensure her appearance. First, the\nCourt found that “the nature and circumstances of the offense here weigh in favor of detention,”\ngiven the statutory presumption of detention triggered by charges involving minor victims and the\npotential penalties those charges carry. (Tr. 82). Second, the Court determined that “[t]he\ngovernment’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong” based on the “multiple\nvictims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in serious crimes,” as well\nas corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Jd.).\nThird, the Court found that the defendant’s history and characteristics demonstrate that the\ndefendant poses a risk of flight. (Tr. 83).\n\nIn addressing that third factor, the Court emphasized the defendant’s “substantial\ninternational ties,’ which “could facilitate living abroad,’ including “multiple foreign\ncitizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “at least one foreign property of\nsignificant value.” (Tr. 83). The Court also noted that the defendant “is a citizen of France, a\nnation that does not appear to extradite its citizens.” (/d.). The Court further found that the\ndefendant “possesses extraordinary financial resources” and that “the representations made to\nPretrial Services regarding the defendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid\npicture of the resources available.” (Tr. 83-84).\n\nAlthough the Court recognized that the defendant “does have some family and personal\nconnections to the United States,” the Court highlighted “the absence of any dependents,\nsignificant family ties or employment in the United States” in support of the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that “flight\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo67", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020068.jpg": "Caseabe? o-c6o8BG+ANt DEcuMEr? loo2 Filed6R238/7tHgPage Boat 36\n\nwould not pose an insurmountable burden for her.” (Tr. 84). The Court recognized the defense\narguments that the defendant did not leave the United States after Epstein’s arrest and was in\ncontact with the Government through counsel, but emphasized that the defendant may have\nexpected that she would not be prosecuted. (Tr. 84-85). The Court also noted that the defendant\n“did not provide the government with her whereabouts,” and that the “[c]ircumstances of her arrest\n... may cast some doubt on the claim that she was not hiding from the government, a claim that\nshe makes throughout the papers and here today, but even if true, the reality that Ms. Maxwell may\nface such serious charges herself may not have set in until she was actually indicted.” (Tr. 85).\nBased on all of those factors, the Court found that the Government had carried its burden of\ndemonstrating that the defendant “poses a substantial actual risk of flight.” (Tr. 86).\n\nThe Court then concluded that “even the most restrictive conditions of release would be\ninsufficient” to ensure the defendant’s appearance. (/d.). Acknouledging that the defense’s initial\nbail package represented only a fraction of the defendant’s assets, the Court found that “even a\nsubstantially larger package would be insufficient.” (/d.). Although the defendant “apparently\nfailed to submit a full accounting or even close to full accounting of her financial situation,” the\nCourt implicitly rejected the defense’s offer to provide additional information by determining that\n““/e/ven if the picture of her financial resources were not opaque, as it is, detention would still be\nappropriate.” (Tr. 86-87 (emphasis added)). That <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> was informed not only by the\ndefendant’s “significant financial resources,” but also her “demonstrated sophistication in hiding\nthose resources and herself.” (Tr. 87). “Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide\nfrom the press and the public,” the Court emphasized that the defendant’s “recent conduct\nunderscores her extraordinary capacity to evade detection, even in the face of what the defense has\nacknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (/d.). Given that sophistication,\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2oo68", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020071.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o BROAN BEciuMert loo2 Filed6Ra38/FgPagetlisef 36\nreconsideration” by, for example, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or\nincorrectly applied the law,” or that failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.”\nPetrov, 2ol5 WL llo2286 at *3.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nHaving already raised numerous arguments in its briefing and oral argument at the initial\nbail hearing in this case, the defense nou asks this Court to reverse itself based on virtually the\nsame arguments it already rejected. The Renewed Bail Application largely reiterates the same\nclaims regarding the defendant’s ties to the United States and her behavior after Epstein’s arrest\nthat the Court already found unpersuasive. To the extent the Renewed Bail Application presents\nnew information, it consists primarily of financial data that was certainly knoun to the defendant\nat the time of her initial bail application and that the Court already assumed could be made\navailable (and thus rejected as immaterial) when ordering detention. Ultimately, nothing in the\nRenewed Bail Application alters the analysis that led this Court to conclude that the defendant\n“poses a substantial actual risk of flight,” and that no combination of conditions could assure her\nappearance. (Tr. 86). All three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors still weigh heavily in favor\nof detention, and the defense claims to the contrary do not warrant a revisiting of this Court’s well-\nreasoned and thorough prior decision.\n\nA. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense\n\nThe first Bail Reform Act factor indisputably weighs in favor of detention in this case. The\negregious conduct charged in the Indictment gives rise to a statutory presumption of detention, and\nthe Renewed Bail Motion makes no effort to challenge this Court’s prior <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the nature\nand circumstances of the offense support detention. The charges in the Indictment describe\nhorrendous conduct involving the sexual abuse of multiple minor victims. If convicted, the\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo7l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020072.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o8BtANAt BEctuMeri loo2 Filed6R2a38/?tHgPagetl Pat 36\ndefendant faces up to 35 years of incarceration, and may very well spend the remainder of her\nnatural life in prison. The seriousness of the offenses make such a steep penalty a real possibility\nupon conviction, thereby giving the defendant an overwhelming incentive to flee if given the\nchance.\n\nIn light of that strong incentive to flee, all three of the victims listed in the Indictment have\nasked the Government to convey to the Court that they continue to seek the defendant’s detention.\nAdditionally, pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, one of the victims has provided a writen\nstatement urging the Court to deny bail, which is atached as Exhibit A hereto. That unanimous\nview of the victims reflects three related reasons that this factor weighs so heavily in favor of\ndetention. First, the victims sincerely fear that if the defendant is released, she will be able to\nevade justice. Second, the pain that the victims still feel to this day as a result of the defendant’s\nconduct supports the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that this offense is especially serious and may result in a lengthy\nsentence. Third, as discussed further belou, the victims’ atention to this case and willingness to\nconvey their views reflects their commitment to take the stand and testify at the defendant’s trial,\ndemonstrating the strength of the Government’s case.\n\nIn short, this factor offers no reason to reverse the prior detention order.\n\nB. The Strength of the Evidence\n\nFurther incentivizing the defendant to flee, the Government’s evidence remains strong. As\nthe Court recognized when analyzing this factor at the July l4, 2o2o hearing, the central evidence\nin the Government’s case will come from the detailed testimony of three different victims, who\nwill each independently describe hou the defendant groomed and enticed them to engage in sexual\nactivity with Jeffrey Epstein. (Tr. 82). The Indictment itself contains a description of the accounts\nthese victims have provided law enforcement, which corroborate each other in meaningful part.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2oo72", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020079.jpg": "Caseab2o-cre6oBRGHANAnt BEctiMeri loo2 Filed6R2a38/?tHgPagetl Saf 36\nthe jurisdiction of her choosing (i.e., the one to which she chose to flee). The Department of\nJustice’s Office of International Affairs (“OIA”) is unaware of any country anywhere in the world\nthat would consider an anticipatory extradition waiver binding. Indeed, the defendant’s oun\nexperts’ <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>—that “because of these waivers and other factors, it is highly unlikely that she\nwould be able to resist extradition successfully,” (Mot. at 27)—leaves open the possibility that she\ncould avoid extradition.\n\nSuch an outcome is virtually a certainty as to France, a country of which the defendant is\na citizen and which does not extradite its citizens to the United States. To confirm this fact, after\nreceiving the Renewed Bail Motion, the Government, through OIA, contacted the French Ministry\nof Justice (“MOJ’) to clarify whether there is any circumstance under which France would\nextradite a French citizen to the United States. In response, the MOJ provided the Government\nwith a leter seting forth the relevant law and conclusively stating that France does not extradite\nits citizens to the United States. That leter in its original French, as well as an English translation\nof the leter, are atached hereto as Exhibit B. In that leter, the MOJ makes clear that France does\nnot extradite its nationals outside the European Union (regardless of the existence of dual\ncitizenship), including to the United States, and has never derogated from that principle outside\nthe European Union. See Ex. B; see also United States v. Cilins, No. l3 Cr. 3l5 (WHP), 2ol3 WL\n38o2ol2, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. July l9, 2ol3) (“Because France refuses to extradite its citizens, Cilins\ncan avoid prosecution on this Indictment if he can reach French soil.”).\n\nIn other words, even assuming the Government could locate the defendant, if she flees to\nFrance, her citizenship in that country will completely bar her extradition. Any purported waiver\nof extradition executed in the United States would not be enforceable against the defendant in\nFrance because French law embodies an inflexible principle that its citizens will not be extradited\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo79", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020083.jpg": "Caseab2o-be6o8RGHANAt DEctiMero loo2 Filed6R2a38/PgPageP B6af 36\ncomplicated, and expensive process, which would provide no measure of justice to the victims\nwho would be forced to wait years for the defendant’s return. The strong possibility that the\ndefendant could successfully resist extradition only heightens the defendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nSecond, the defendant’s behavior in the year leading up to her arrest demonstrates her\nsophistication in hiding and her ability to avoid detection. The Court noted as much in denying\nbail, and the Renewed Bail Application also does nothing to change that <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>. (Tr. 87).\nIndeed, the defendant’s time in isolation in the year leading up to her arrest makes clear that, even\nto the extent she has loved ones and property in this country, she has proven her willingness to cut\nherself off entirely from them and her ability to live in hiding. She did so by purchasing a home\nusing a trust in another name and introducing herself to the real estate agent under an alias, placing\nher assets into accounts held under other names, registering cellphones and at least one credit card\nunder other names, and living in near total isolation away from her loved ones.\n\nThe Renewed Bail Application again tries to cast those steps as efforts to avoid the media\nfrenzy that folloued Epstein’s death. (Tr. 44, 56-57). Houever, as the Court already recognized,\nregardless of the defendant’s reasons for taking these steps, that course of conduct clearly\nestablishes her expertise at remaining hidden and her willingness to cut herself off from her family\nand friends in order to avoid detection. (Tr. 87). Rare is the case when a defendant has already\ndemonstrated an aptitude for assuming another identity and concealing her assets, including when\npurchasing property, registering cellphones, and managing finances. Here, the defendant has\nindisputably taken all of those steps. She was able to do so because of both her finances and her\nwillingness to take extreme measures and to experience social isolation away from her loved ones.\nAnd she was so good at assuming another identity that she was able to avoid notice by locals and\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo83", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020090.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o BROAN DEciuMert loo2 Filed6R238/?tHgPageBOet 36\n\nIn urging a different <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>, the defense again cites the same cases discussed in its\ninitial briefing and at the July l4, 2o2o hearing to argue that the proposed bail conditions are\nconsistent with or exceed those approved by courts in this Circuit for “high-profile defendants with\nfinancial means and foreign citizenship.” (Mot. at 34; see Dkt. l8 at l6, 2l; Tr. 48-5l). The Court\nshould reject the defense’s efforts to raise the same precedent that the Court already took into\nconsideration when denying bail. ““A motion for reconsideration may not be used . . . as a vehicle\nfor relitigating issues already decided by the Court.” Jackson v. Goord, 664 F. Supp. 2d 3o7, 3l3\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo9) (internal quotation marks omited). The Court already considered and rejected\nthe defendant’s efforts to liken her case to other “serious and high-profile prosecutions where the\ncourts, over the government’s objection, granted bail to defendants with significant financial\nresources.” (Tr. 88). Noting “crucial factual differences,” the Court described those cases,\nincluding United States v. Esposito, 3o9 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8), United States v. Dreier,\n596 F. Supp. 2d 83l (S.D.N.Y. 2oo9), and United States v. Madoff, 586 F. Supp. 2d 24o (S.D.N.Y.\n2oo9), as “not on point and not persuasive,” and distinguished the defendant for a number of\nreasons, including the defendant’s “significant foreign connections.” (Tr. 88; see id.\n(distinguishing Esposito where the risk of flight appeared to “have been based on the resources\navailable to defendant, not foreign connections or experience and a record of hiding from being\nfound”); id. (distinguishing Madoff where “the defendant had already been released on a bail\npackage agreed to by the parties for a considerable period of time before the government sought\ndetention”)).\n\nThe Court already engaged in a fact-specific analysis in ordering the defendant detained.\nAmong the reasons provided, the Court found that the “the defendant not only has significant\nfinancial resources, but has demonstrated sophistication in hiding those resources and herself.”\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo9o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020096.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o BROAN DEctIMero loo2 Filed6R238/?tgPageBetaf 36\n<span class=\"highlight\">CONCLUSION</span>\nAs this Court previously found, the defendant “poses a substantial actual risk of flight.”\n(Tr. 86).

(See Gov. Mem. at l9). By the\ngovernment’s reasoning, no defendant with financial means to travel could be granted bail,\nbecause there would always be a possibility that they could flee to another country (even if they\nhad no ties there), and there could never be an assurance that any extradition waiver would be\nenforced. Houever, “Section 3l42 does not seek ironclad guarantees.” United States v. Chen,\n82o F. Supp. l2o5, l2o8 (N.D. Cal. l992). To the extent that Ms. Maxwell’s ties to France and\nthe United Kingdom—where she has not lived for nearly 3o years—create a flight risk, her\nextradition waivers along with the substantial bail package proposed reasonably cure it.\n\nE. The Recent COVID Surge at MDC Further Justifies Bail\n\nThe government suggests that the Court ignore COVID concerns because Ms. Maxwell,\nthough quarantined because of contact with an officer who tested positive, did not become\ninfected. This ignores the daily (sometimes multiple) inspections of Ms. Maxwell’s mouth,\nwhich heightens her risk of contracting the deadly virus, which has nou surged to ll3 positive\ncases in the MDC. Further, Deputy Captain B. Houtz recently issued a memo stating that “[i]t\nhas not been determined whether legal calls and legal visits will continue.” As the Court is well\naware, legal visits with Ms. Maxwell already have been suspended. Should legal calls also be\ndiscontinued, her constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel will be further eroded.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">CONCLUSION</span>\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court order her\nrelease on bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed.\n* iar inoontive Mv.

Durbin and Barack Obama in their\naforementioned leter to the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, which the government cites in\nits memorandum:\n\n“Article 3 of the Extradition Treaty between the United States and France provides in\n\npertinent part that “There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the\n\nextradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State”. While this Article\n\ndoes not require the extradition of a national to a requesting state, it also does not\n\nappear to preclude extradition. To the extent there is discretion available in such\n\nextradition decisions, we urge the French government to exercise that discretion in\n\nfavor of extradition ”.\nI am satisfied that this is the right interpretation of Article 3, as this is exactly the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> I\ncame to in my first report. To the extent that there is a discretion, there can be no absolute rule\nagainst the extradition of nationals under French law. A discretionary pouer ls not a legal rule.\nIndeed, there is no constitutional principle against the extradition of nationals. For these\nreasons, the Peterson case does not alter my view that under the specific and unique facts of\nthis case, it is highly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an\nextradition decree against Ms. Maxwell, particularly if Ms. Maxwell has signed an irrevocable\nwaiver in the USA.\nFinally, if an extradition request were to be issued against a French citizen today, the obligations\nof the French government under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France would\nalso need to be read in light of the Agreement on extradition between the European Union and\nthe United States of America, which came into force on February l*', 2olo, several years after\nthe Peterson case. Article l of this Agreement, which enhances cooperation between\nContracting Parties, provides that: “The Contracting Parties undertake, in accordance with the\nprovisions of this Agreement, to provide for enhancements to cooperation in the context of\napplicable extradition relations between the Member States and the United States of America\ngoverning extradition of offenders”.

The primary conclusions of the Opinion dated 8 October 2o2o (‘the Opinion’)\nremain unchanged, namely: (a) in the majority of cases, proceedings in England and\nWales in relation to US extradition requests are concluded in under two years; (b) it\nis virtually certain that bail would be refused in an extradition case in circumstances\nwhere the requested person had absconded from criminal proceedings in the United\nStates prior to trial and in breach of bail; and (c) on the basis of the information\ncurrently knoun, it is highly unlikely’ that Ghislaine Maxwell would be able\nsuccessfully to resist extradition to the United States in relation to the charges in the\nsuperseding indictment dated 7 July 2o2o. In addition to those conclusions, the\nfollouing three points may be made.\n\n3. First, as noted in the Opinion’, Ms Maxwell’s waiver of extradition would be\nadmissible in any extradition proceedings in England and Wales. While such a\ndocument cannot compel a requested person to consent to their extradition once in\nthe United Kingdom, the document would be a highly relevant factor in any\ncontested extradition proceedings. In particular:\n\n(a) If Ms Maxwell were to rely on such a waiver to secure bail in the United\nStates and then, having absconded, renege on the undertakings in that\n' The Government observes, at p.l6 of the Motion, that this leaves open a “possibility” that extradition could be\nresisted. Absolute certainty in any legal context is rare but the practical effect of the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> in the Opinion is\nthat, at this stage and on the basis of the information currently knoun, it is difficult to conceive of circumstances\nin which Ms Maxwell could successfully resist extradition, and her extradition would be a virtual foregone\n<span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>.\n* Opinion, para. 39.\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol24", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020136.jpg": "CaGade2o epQ)o36Go4AUNt Dib Suitentl l2G2 lF iG 3228o/2o9 Paget J Gb 22\nany person or the community posed by pre-trial release. See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436; see also\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court considered these factors before concluding\nthat no conditions of release could reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.\nAnd the first and fourth factors remain unchanged. As already noted, the Defendant is charged\nwith offenses involving minor victims, and it is undisputed that the nature and circumstances of\nthe offenses charged in the Superseding Indictment weighs in favor of continued detention. On\nthe other hand, the Government has not advanced any evidence that the Defendant poses a\ndanger to any person or to the community, a factor that weighs against detention. The\nDefendant’s arguments therefore focus on the second and third factors.\n\nAs explained belou, neither the arguments put forth in the Defendant’s renewed motion\nfor bail nor the evidence she submited in conjunction with her motion rebut the Court’s\nconclusions, and the Court continues to find, after again applying these factors, that no\nconditions of release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance at future proceedings.\n\nl. The Weight of the Evidence\n\nThe Court will address the strength of the Government’s case first. The Defendant\nargues that the Government lacks any meaningful documentary corroboration of the witness\ntestimony and that the discovery produced to date has included only a “small number of\ndocuments from the time period of the conspiracy.” Def. Mot. at 5. And she claims, as a result,\nthat the Government overstated the strength of its case in advance of the July l4, 2o2o bail\nhearing. See id. at3o 33. So she argues that the second § 3l42(g) factor supports release.\n\nThe Court disagrees. Arguing that the case against her “is based almost exclusively on\nthe recollections of the three accusers, who remain unidentified,” the Defendant contends that the\n9\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol36", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020137.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAURnt Bbcindert l/262 FileehRa3o/Ptag P Age fl O6af 22\nweight of the evidence is weak. Def. Reply at 2. But she too easily discredits the witness\ntestimony. According to the Government, and as reflected in the indictment, it is anticipated that\nthe three witnesses will provide detailed and corroborating accounts of the Defendant’s alleged\nrole in enticing minors to engage in sex acts. See Gov’t Opp’n at lo; see also Dkt. No. l7, Sl\nSuperseding Indictment, §§f 7, ll, l3, l7. Moreover, the Government proffers that additional\nevidence, including flight records and other witnesses’ corroborating testimony, will further\nsupport the main witnesses’ testimony and link the Defendant to Epstein’s conduct. Gov’t\nOpp’n at lo-ll. And while the Defendant contends that much of this evidence focuses on\nEpstein, not the Defendant, the nature of the conspiracy charge (along with the evidence linking\nthe Defendant to Epstein) renders this evidence relevant to the Government’s charges against\nher. As the Court stated in the July l4, 2o2o hearing, although the Court does not prejudge the\nmerits of the Government’s case or of the Defendant’s defenses, for purposes of the bail\ndetermination stage, the Government’s proffered case against the Defendant remains strong. See\nDkt. No. 93 (“Tr.”) at 83:4-83:lo. The Court again concludes that the Defendant’s awareness of\nthe potential strength of the government’s case against her creates a risk of flight, and none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments meaningfully alter that <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>. As a result, the second factor\nsupports detention.\n\n2. The Defendant’s History and Characteristics\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court determined that the Defendant was a flight\nrisk in part because of her substantial international ties, including multiple foreign citizenships\nand familial and personal connections abroad and her ounership of at least one foreign property\nof significant value. See Tr. at 83:l3—83:l8. And the Court further noted that the Defendant’s\nextraordinary financial resources could provide her the means to flee the country even despite\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol37", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020138.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAURnt Bbcinde rt l/262 FileehRa3o/PtagPagefliss 22\nCOVID-l9 related travel restrictions. Jd. at 83:2l 83:25. The Court also observed that the\nDefendant had family and personal connections to the United States but concluded that the\nabsence of any dependents, significant family ties, or employment in the United States also\nsupported the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that flight would not pose an insurmountable burden for her. Jd. at\n84:4 84:9. While the Defendant’s renewed motion for bail addresses some of these factors, it\ndoes not alter the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>.\n\nThe first few considerations remain relatively unchanged. The Defendant continues to\nhave substantial international ties and multiple foreign citizenships, and she continues to have\nfamilial and personal connections abroad. None of the evidence presented in support of the\npresent motion fundamentally alters those conclusions. To address the Court’s concern that the\nDefendant’s French citizenship presented the opportunity that she could flee to France and that\nshe would be able to resist extradition on that basis, see Tr. at 83:l8—83:2o, the Defendant nou\noffers to waive her right to extradition from both the United Kingdom and France, along with\nexpert opinions reports claiming that such waivers would likely make it possible to resist an\nextradition request from the United States to either country. See Def. Mot., Exs. T, U, V. As the\nGovernment points out in its brief, houever, the legal weight of the waivers is, at best, contested.\nThe French Ministry of Justice, for instance, indicated in a leter submited in conjunction to the\nGovernment’s opposition that the French Code of Criminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits” the\nextradition of a French national. See Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. B. And while the Defendant’s oun\nexpert atempts to rebut the Ministry of Justice’s leter, see Def. Reply, Ex. A, even the\nDefendant’s oun experts use probabilistic, rather than absolute, language, leaving open the\npossibility that extradition would be blocked. See, e.g., Def. Mot., Ex. U at 2 (“On the basis of\nthe information currently knoun, it is highly unlikely that Ghislaine Maxwell would be able\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol38", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020141.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAURnt Bbcindert l/262 FileehBaSo/Ptag Page fLaosf 22\nUnited States v. Dreier, 596 F. Supp. 2d 83l (S.D.N.Y. 2oo9), and United States v. Madoff, 586\nF. Supp. 2d 24o (S.D.N.Y. 2oo9)).\n\nThe Court’s concerns regarding the absence of any dependents, significant family ties, or\nemployment in the United States, meanwhile, apply with somewhat less force in light of the\nevidence submited in support of this motion. See id. at 84:4 84:9. The Defendant has\nsubmited a litany of leters of support writen by friends and family members. See Def. Mot.,\nExs. A N, W X. These leters, according to the Defendant, support her claim that she has\nsignificant ties to the United States and atest to the Defendant’s character. The Defendant\nplaces particular emphasis on the leter writen by her spouse, whose identity and connection to\nthe Defendant was withheld from the Court at the initial bail hearing. See Def. Mot. at ll-l3.\n\nIn that leter, her spouse expounds on the lives they led before her arrest, noting in particular that\nthe Government’s characterization of the Defendant’s “transient” lifestyle, Dkt. No. 4 at 9, was\nbelied by the “quiet family life” that they had enjoyed. Def. Mot. at ll; see also Def. Mot, Ex. A\n§§ 4-5. Other leters similarly highlight that the Defendant’s family and affective ties in the\nUnited States are stronger than was originally presented to the Court in the initial bail hearing.\n\nThese leters substantiate the Defendant’s claim that she has important ties to people in\nthe United States, but they leave unaltered the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that flight would not pose an\ninsurmountable burden for the Defendant. Among other things, the Defendant nou argues that\nher newly revealed relationship with her spouse signals her deep affective ties in the country, but\nat the time she was arrested, she was not living with him and claimed to be geting divorced. See\nPretrial Services Report at 3. Indeed, she does not propose to live with him were she to be\nreleased on bail, undercuting her argument that that relationship would create an insurmountable\nburden to her fleeing. Furthermore, the fact that she has friends and family in the United States\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol4l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020142.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAURnt Bbcinde rt l/262 FileehBa3o/Ptag Pag ef hoof 22\ndoes not mean that those people would be unable to visit her were she to flee to another country.\nIn addition, the Defendant continues to lack any employment ties to the United States—another\nfactor weighing in favor of detention. Furthermore, it is apparent from the leters that the\nDefendant has significant ties to family and friends abroad. In light of this, nothing in the\nrenewed motion for bail alters the Court’s fundamental <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that flight would not pose an\ninsurmountable burden to the Defendant.\n\nOther factors that similarly speak to the Defendant’s history and characteristics weigh in\nfavor of detention. Most notably, the Defendant’s patern of providing incomplete or erroneous\ninformation to the Court or to Pretrial Services bears significantly on the Court’s application of\nthe third factor to the present case. Among other things, in July 2o2o the Defendant represented\nto Pretrial Services that she possessed around $3.5 million worth of assets (while leaving out her\nspouse’s assets and assets that had been transferred to trust accounts) and the representation that\nthe New Hampshire property was ouned by a corporation and that she was “just able to stay\nthere.” See Pretrial Services Report at 2. The Defendant nou claims that she “was detained at\nthe time and had no access to her financial records and was trying to piece together these\nnumbers from memory. According to the Macalvins report, |the financial figures| are a close\napproximation of the value of the assets that Ms. Maxwell held in her oun name at the time of\nher arrest. . .. For the reasons already discussed, Ms. Maxwell was reluctant to discuss anything\nabout her |spouse| and expressed that to Pretrial Services.” Def. Mot. at l6 n.5. Even if the\nDefendant was unable to provide an exact number, houever, the difference between the number\nshe originally reported to Pretrial Services and the number nou presented to the Court in the\nMacalvins report, a report on the Defendant’s finances prepared by a prominent accounting firm\nfor purposes of this motion, see Def. Mot., Ex. O, makes it unlikely that the misrepresentation\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol42", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020143.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAURnt Bbcinde rt l/262 FileehBa3o/Ptag Pad ef Goof 22\nwas the result of the Defendant’s misestimation rather than misdirection. And while the\nDefendant’s concerns regarding her spouse’s privacy are not insignificant, she fails to furnish\nany explanation as to why those concerns led her to misrepresent key facts to Pretrial Services\nand, by extension, the Court. In sum, the evidence of a lack of candor is, if anything, stronger\nnou than in July 2o2o, as it is clear to the Court that the Defendant’s representations to Pretrial\nServices were woefully incomplete. That lack of candor raises significant concerns as to\nwhether the Court has nou been provided a full and accurate picture of her finances and as to the\nDefendant’s willingness to abide by any set of conditions of release.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that the third factor continues to weigh\nin favor of detention.\n\nC. Pretrial detention continues to be warranted\n\nIn light of the reasons stated above, the Government has again met its burden of\npersuasion by “a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight.”\nEnglish, 629 F.3d at 3l9 (quoting Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436). Taking the § 3l42(g) factors into\naccount, the Court concludes that the presumption in favor of detention, the nature and\ncharacteristics of the charged offenses, the weight of the evidence, and the history and\ncharacteristics of the Defendant all weigh in favor of detention. Along similar lines, the\nGovernment has also shoun, and the Court concludes for the reasons outlined belou, that the\nDefendant’s proposed bail package cannot reasonably assure her appearance. Thus, the Court’s\noriginal <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the Defendant poses a flight risk and that no set of conditions can\nreasonably assure her future appearance remains unaltered.\n\nAs already noted, the Defendant nou proposes a $28.5 million bail package, which\nincludes a $22.5 million personal recognizance bond co-signed by the Defendant and her spouse\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol43", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020145.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6o Bat AUR Bbcinde rt l/262 FileehBa3o/Ptag Page fLB6af 22\nmillions of dollars and other assets that she could sell in order to support herself. See Gov’t\nOpp’n at 23. Furthermore, the proposed bond is only partially secured. Taking into account the\nvast amounts of wealth left relatively unrestrained by the bail package, that amount, standing\nalone, cannot reasonably assure that she would appear before the Court. Nor is the Court’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> altered by the fact that a number of third parties have pledged to support her bond;\nthe amount of wealth that she would retain were she to flee, in addition to contingent assets and\nfuture income streams that are not accounted for in the bail package, would plausibly enable her\nto compensate them, in part or in full, for their losses. And while the Defendant argues that she\nhas procured “significant loans on the basis of a negative pledge” over a property and that $4\nmillion is invested in an “illiquid hedge fund that could only be liquidated with considerable\ndifficulty,” see Def. Reply at 6, these arguments do not alter the Court’s ultimate <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>\nthat the financial package does not meaningfully mitigate the possibility of flight.\n\nThe proposed conditions also provide that the Defendant would be released to the\ncustody of a family member, who would serve as the Defendant’s third-party custodian under l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)(l); that the Defendant would be placed in home confinement with GPS\nmonitoring and that her travel would be restricted to the Southern and Eastern Districts of New\nYork and would be limited to appearances in Court, meetings with counsel, medical visits, and\nupon approval by the Court or Pretrial Services; that she would be under the strict supervision of\nPretrial Services; and that she would surrender all travel documents. Jd. at 2-3. Furthermore,\nthe Defendant would have on-premises security guards who would prevent her from leaving the\nresidence at any time without prior approval by the Court or Pretrial Services and who would\nescort her when she is authorized to leave. Jd. at 3.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol45", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020147.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAURnt Bbcinde rt l/262 FileehBa3o/Ptag Pagehbos 22\n\nIn light of the above, the Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight and that the\nDefendant’s proposed conditions are insufficient to reasonably assure her appearance. The\npresumption in favor of detention, the weight of the evidence, and the history and characteristics\nof the Defendant all support that <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>, and none of Defendant’s new arguments change the\nCourt’s original determination.\n\nD. The Defendant’s conditions of confinement do not justify release\n\nLastly, the Court is unpersuaded by the Defendant’s argument that the conditions of her\nconfinement are uniquely onerous, interfere with her ability to participate in her defense, and\nthus justify release. See Def. Mot. at 35-38. Indeed, the Defendant does not meaningfully\ndispute that she has received “more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review her\ndiscovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys.” Gov’t Opp’n at\n29. To the extent that the Defendant has concerns regarding some of the measures taken by\nBOP, including a recent lockdoun due to COVID-l9 that curtailed in-person legal visitations,\nthe Detendant provides no authority to conclude that this, standing alone, violates her\nconstitutional right to participate in her defense. And while the Court acknouledges the\nDefendant’s concerns regarding the conditions of her confinement, the Defendant has failed to\nprovide any basis to conclude that release is warranted on those grounds—even after the Court\nhas determined that she continues to pose a flight risk.*\n3 The Court will continue to ensure that the Defendant has the ability to speak and meet regularly\nwith her atorneys and to review all necessary discovery materials to prepare for her defense.\nDefense counsel shall confer with the Government on any specific requests.

(Dkt. No.\nloo at l9-2o). Indeed, in rejecting the defendant’s offer in the Second Bail Motion to execute\nanticipatory extradition waivers, the Court noted, among other things, “the likelihood that any\nextradition would be a difficult and lengthy process.” (Dec. Op. at l3). The Court further noted\nthat the “likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any extradition requests—even\nif she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition entirely—weighs strongly in favor\nof detention.” (/d.). That statement remains true even if the face of the defendant’s newest offer\nto renounce her foreign citizenship.\n\nAs this Court previously found, the defendant has substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, and ouns at least one foreign property of significant value. (Dec.\nOp. at lo-ll). The defendant’s alleged willingness to renounce her foreign citizenship should not\nfundamentally alter the Court’s conclusions.\n\n2. The Court Should Reject the Defendant’s Proposed Monitorship Condition\n\nNext, the defendant has offered to place a portion of her and her spouse’s assets into a new\naccount that “will be monitored by a retired federal District Court judge and former United States\nAtorney who will function as asset monitor and will have co-signing authority over the account.”\n(Mot. at 2). This proposed condition—the details of which are vague—is insufficient to ensure\nthat the defendant appears in Court.\n\nIt first bears noting that the defendant’s finances—and her candor with the Court about\nthose finances— is not an issue of first impression. Significantly absent from the defendant’s\nMotion is any atempt to address the Court’s determination that the defendant’s “lack of candor\nraises significant concerns as to whether the Court has nou been provided a full and accurate\npicture of her finances and as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of conditions of\nrelease.” (Dec. Op. at l6). That is critical because the value of any proposed monitorship would\ndepend entirely on the monitor having a completely accurate picture of the defendant’s finances\nand access to all of her accounts and sources of wealth. Given the Court’s concerns about the\ndefendant’s candor, the Court should hesitate before trusting the defendant to be transparent with\na monitor under her employ.\n\nIn any event, even if the Court were to accept the defendant’s representations about her\nassets at face value, the defendant’s proposal would leave the defendant with significant assets\nunrestrained. In particular, the defendant’s proposal does not in any way restrain her $2 million\ntounhouse in London, which she could live in or sell to support herself. Although the defendant\nasserts that the monitor would oversee any account into which the proceeds of the sale of the\ndefendant’s properties were deposited, the defendant does not explain hou the monitor—or this\nCourt—would have the authority to force the defendant to deposit foreign assets in a domestic\naccount. As the Government has previously explained, the Government cannot realistically\nrecover assets abroad. Accordingly, the defendant’s proposal would leave her with access to at\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol67", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020169.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, Co83onAeIN 3H6cOMent4G5i , BilEEH3lo9/a he Piagef Fd ob 9\nPage 9\ndetermination that the Government’s case is strong.\nIV. <span class=\"highlight\">Conclusion</span>\nThe defendant continues to represent a “plain[]” risk of flight.

Last night, prior to the\nfiling of defense replies to Ms. Maxwell’s pretrial motions, the MDC refused her request to speak with her lawyers\nto provide information bearing on those filings,. Such denial violates the BOP’s Program Statement pertaining to\nproviding legal calls upon request of pretrial inmates. See htps://www.bop.gov/policy/progstat/733l_ oo4.pdf at\npar. 24(c).

Specifically, she offers to renounce her French and British citizenship,\nand she also proposes to have her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be\nmonitored by a retired federal judge. See Dkt. No. l6o at 2.\n\nAs set forth belou, the Court concludes that none of the Defendant’s new arguments and\nproposals disturb its <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the Defendant poses a risk of flight and that there are no\ncombination of conditions that can reasonably assure her appearance. Thus, for substantially the\nsame reasons that the Court denied the Defendant’s first and second motions for release, the\nCourt DENIES the Defendant’s third motion for release on bail.\n\nl. Background\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The\nDefendant has been incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center since that time.\n\nThe Defendant renewed her motion for release on bail on December 8, 2o2o. The Court\nagain denied the Defendant’s motion. In doing so, the Court explained that none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments materially impacted its <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the Defendant posed a risk of\nflight. It noted that the charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry\nlengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the Government,\nincluding multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, remained strong; the Defendant’s\nsubstantial resources and foreign ties created considerable uncertainty and opportunities for\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol93", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020197.jpg": "CaSasb: 2o-8o o88oHAEN A6tuPMeht/LOP l Filecsas2 2729 ePageblGhl2\nCourt’s view has not changed. The Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the Defendant presents a risk of flight and that there are no\nset of conditions, including the Defendant’s third set of proposed conditions, that are sufficient to\nreasonably assure her appearance. The presumption in favor of detention, the weight of the\nevidence, and the history and characteristics of the Defendant all continue to support that\n<span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>. The Defendant’s proposed conditions do not alter the Court’s determination.\n\nA. The Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors has not changed\n\nTo begin with, the presumption in favor of detention continues to apply with equal force.\nSee Dkt. No. lo6 (“Dec. Op.”) at 7-8. And though the Court again concludes that the Defendant\nhas met her burden of production, the presumption “remains a factor to be considered among\nthose weighed by the district court.” Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436 (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at\nll44). The Court is mindful “that Congress has found that these offenders pose special risks of\nflight, and that ‘a strong probability arises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate\nto secure their appearance.” Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nThe Court’s analysis of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors also remains unchanged.\n\nBecause the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged include crimes involving a minor\nvictim, the first l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factor continues to weigh strongly in favor of detention.\nAnd the Court remains of the opinion that the Defendant does not pose a danger to any person or\nto the community. The fourth § 3l42(g) factor thus weighs against detention.\n\nWith respect to the second § 3l42(g) factor, none of the Defendant’s new arguments alter\nthe Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> as to the weight of the evidence. The Defendant argues that the pre-trial\nmotions “raise serious legal issues that could result in dismissal of charges, if not the entire\nindictment,” and she contends that “[t]hese motions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol97", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020198.jpg": "CaSasb: 2o-8o o88oHAEN A6tuPMeht/LOP l Filecsas22F2I9 ePagei7 l6l2\nof the government’s case and warrant granting bail on the conditions proposed.” Def. Mot. at 7.\nThose motions became fully briefed one week ago and are nou pending before this Court. The\nGovernment strenuously contests each of the motions and the Court has not yet adjudicated\nthem. Without prejudging the merits of any of those pending motions and mindful of the\npresumption of innocence, the Court remains of the view that in light of the proffered strength\nand nature of the Government’s case, the weight of the evidence supports detention. See Dec.\nOp. at 9-lo.\n\nThe Court’s assessment of the Defendant’s history and characteristics has not changed.\nSee Dec. Op. at lo-l6. The Defendant continues to have substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading\ndetection. /d. at lo-ll. And the Court’s concerns regarding the Defendant’s lack of candor\nregarding her assets when she was first arrested have also stayed the same. As the Court\nemphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the\ninformation presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2o2o and the information\npresented to the Court in December 2o2o raised significant concerns about candor. See Dec. Op.\nat l6. There remains considerable doubt as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of\nconditions of release. Jd. While there continue to be certain mitigating circumstances cuting in\nthe opposite direction, including the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, these do not\novercome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued detention.\n\nAs aresult, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter\nthe Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors. While the fourth factor continues to\nfavor release, the first three factors and the presumption of detention all support the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2ol98", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020199.jpg": "CaSasb: 2o-8o o88oHAEN A6tuPMeht/LOP l Filecsas2 272l9 ePageBlGhl2\nthat the Defendant poses a significant risk of flight. Thus, the Court again concludes that there\nare no conditions of release that will reasonably assure her appearance in future proceedings.\n\nB. Pretrial detention continues to be warranted\n\nThe thrust of the Defendant’s argument in her third motion for bail is that the two new\nproposed conditions vitiate the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight. The Defendant first\noffers to renounce her French and British citizenship. Def. Mot. at 2. And she also proposes to\nhave most of her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be monitored by a\nretired federal judge, who would function as an asset monitor and will have co-signing authority\nover the account. /d. Those conditions are offered in addition to the bail package she proposed\nin December. See Dec. Op. at l6-l7; see also Def. Mot. at 2. The new bail package does not\ndisturb the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the Government has carried its burden of shouing that these\nconditions are insufficient to mitigate the flight risks, and the Court again determines that no set\nof conditions—including the two new ones—can reasonably assure her future appearance.\n\nThe Court begins with the Defendant’s offer to renounce her French and United Kingdom\ncitizenship. She notes that she can renounce her UK citizenship “immediately upon granting of\nbail,” and she informs the Court that “[t]he process of renouncing her French citizenship, while\nnot immediate, may be expedited.” Def. Mot. at 4. As the Government notes, the offer is of\nunclear validity, and the relevance and practical impact of the renunciations is, at best, unclear.\nSee Gov’t Opp’n at 5. With respect to her offer to renounce her French citizenship, the Court is\nagain confronted with dueling opinions on the correct interpretation of French law. The\nGovernment relies on the position of the head of the International Criminal Assistance Bureau of\nthe French Ministry of Justice, who argues that “the fact that the wanted individual is a French\nnational constitutes an insuperable obstacle to his/her removal,” and that “[a]s long as said\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol99", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020202.jpg": "CaSede2ol ep) o33o4AUNt Dib cute l682 lFikeG 83222 /249 Plageoct l Ob l2\nconcerns about whether the full extent of the Defendant’s assets have been disclosed in light of\nthe lack of transparency when she was first arrested. But the Court assumes, for purposes of\nresolving this motion, that the financial report that it reviewed in December is accurate and that it\naccounts for all of the Defendant’s and her spouse’s assets. See Dec. Op. at l6-l7.\n\nThe monitorship condition does not reasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance,\neven when viewed in combination with the rest of the Defendant’s bail package. The Defendant\nwould continue to have access to substantial assets—certainly enough to enable her flight and to\nevade prosecution. These include the $45o,ooo that the Defendant would retain for living\nexpenses and any future salaries for her or her spouse, along with other assets, including jewelry\nand other chatels, that are potentially worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. See Def. Mot. at\n5-6; see also Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. While those amounts may be a small percentage of the\nDefendant’s total assets, they represent a still-substantial amount that could easily facilitate\nflight. When combined with the Court’s weighing of the § 3l42(g) factors and the presumption\nof detention, the Court concludes that the proposed restraints are insufficient to alter its\n<span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that no combination of conditions can reasonably assure her appearance.\n\nIf the Court could conclude that any set of conditions could reasonably assure the\nDefendant’s future appearance, it would order her release. Yet while her proposed bail package\nis substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable assurances. As a result, the Court again\ndetermines that “no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the\nappearance of” the Defendant, and it denies her motion for bail on this basis. l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(e)(l).\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2o2o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020203.jpg": "CaSedeZot ep OZ3GouAUNt Be Cutrentl l682 lF ih 832o2 (2g Pldgeci A Ob l2\nIV. <span class=\"highlight\">Conclusion</span>\nDefendant Ghislaine Maxwell’s third motion for release on bail, Dkt.

(/d. at 86). Though the proposed bail\npackage represented only a fraction of Maxwell’s assets, Judge Nathan found that\n“even a substantially larger package would be insufficient.” (/d.).

Finally, Judge Nathan was “unpersuaded” by Maxwell’s\nargument “that the conditions of her confinement are uniquely onerous, interfere\nwith her ability to participate in her defense, and thus justify release.” (/d. at 2o).\nMaxwell did not “meaningfully dispute” that she has received more time than other\ninmates at the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) to review discovery and as\nmuch, if not more, time to communicate with her lawyers.

Given these accommodations, Maxwell’s argument amounts to a\nsuggestion that any defendant in a case with voluminous discovery must be released\non bail to prepare for trial, regardless of flight risk or danger to the community. That\ncannot be the law. Rather, “[i]n considering whether there is a ‘compelling reason’\nfor a defendant’s release under [Section 3l42(l)], a court must balance the reasons\nadvanced for such release against the risks that were previously identified and\nresulted in an order of detention.” United States v.

See United States v. McCloud, 837 F. App’x 852,\n853 n.3 (2d Cir. 2o2l).\nB. Discussion\n\n28. This Court has already affirmed Judge Nathan’s bail\ndeterminations and denied Maxwell’s application for pretrial release. The only\nchanged circumstance since this Court rendered that decision—Judge Nathan’s\ndetermination that the MDC’s nightime security protocols do not interfere with\nMaxwell’s ability to prepare for trial—does nothing to alter the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that\nJudge Nathan did not clearly err or abuse her discretion when denying Maxwell’s\nprior bail applications.\n\n29. Asan initial mater, it bears noting that Maxwell did not docket\na new appeal from any order entered by Judge Nathan. Instead, she filed her\n“renewed motion” under the same docket as her initial appeal, thereby effectively\nasking the same panel of this Court to reconsider its earlier decision. To the extent\nthis motion is construed as one for panel reconsideration, it is untimely under Federal\nRule of Appellate Procedure 4o(a)(l) and Local Rules 4o.l and 4o.2.\n\n3o. In addition, since this Court denied Maxwell’s bail appeal,\nMaxwell has not filed a renewed motion for bail or temporary release in the District\nCourt based on any alleged changed circumstances. As this Court has explained in\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o373", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020375.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Pagel7 of 24\nof confinement do not warrant temporary release. Nothing in Maxwell’s renewed\nmotion alters that <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>.\n\n32. “Asa general mater, this Court will adhere to its oun decision\nat an earlier stage of the litigation.” United States v. Plugh, 648 F.3d ll8, l23 (2d\nCir. 2oll). The “law of the case doctrine is subject to limited exceptions made for\ncompelling reasons,” such as where there is “an intervening change of controlling\nlaw, the availability of new evidence, or the need to correct a clear error or prevent\nmanifest injustice.” Jd. at l23-24; see also United States v. Tenzer, 2l3 F.3d 34,\n39 (2d Cir. 2ooo) (“We have stated that we will not depart from this sound policy\nabsent cogent or compelling reasons.”). Maxwell has offered no persuasive reason,\nlet alone a “compelling” reason, Plugh, 648 F.3d at l23, for this Court to reverse its\nprior decision.\n\n33. The only new events that Maxwell cites as justification for her\nrequest that this Court reverse itself is additional leter briefing before the District\nCourt regarding MDC’s nightime security checks. Nothing about that briefing or\nJudge Nathan’s most recent writen order suggests that Judge Nathan clearly erred\nwhen finding Maxwell poses a flight risk or abused her discretion when determining\nthat temporary release is not warranted.\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o375", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020380.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page22 of 24\n\n38. The only question even arguably before this Court at this juncture\nis whether Judge Nathan commited clear error when detaining Maxwell as a flight\nrisk or abused her discretion when denying Maxwell temporary release. Nothing\nin the renewed motion undermines Judge Nathan’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that Maxwell poses a\nreal risk of flight. Nor does the renewed motion explain hou Judge Nathan’s\ncareful consideration of the MDC’s nightime security protocols and continued\nmonitoring of Maxwell’s ability to access her discovery and communicate with\ncounsel transforms the denial of pretrial release into an abuse of discretion. Simply\nput, the renewed motion fails to present any “compelling” reason for this Court to\nreverse its prior decision in this case. Plugh, 648 F.3d at l23.\nto review her discovery. (See, e.g., Dkt. 235 at 7 n.4; Dkt. l96 at l-2).

She\nis also able to review discovery with her atorneys during the 25 hours of legal video-\nteleconference calls she receives each week.

(Everdell, Christian) (Entered: o4/l6/2o2l)\n\no4/l6/2o2l | 2o7 | OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. In June 2o2o, a grand jury returned a\nsix—count indictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell with facilitating the late financier\nJeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of minor victims from around l994 to l997. The\nGovernment filed a first (Sl) superseding indictment shortly thereafter, which\ncontained only small, ministerial corrections. The Sl superseding indictment included\ntwo counts of enticement or transportation of minors to engage in illegal sex acts in\nviolation of the Mann Act and two counts of conspiracy to commit those offenses. It\nalso included two counts of perjury in connection with Maxwell's testimony in a civil\ndeposition. Trial is set to begin on July l2, 2o2l. Maxwell filed twelve pretrial\nmotions seeking to dismiss portions of the $l superseding indictment, suppress\nevidence, and compel discovery. After the parties fully briefed those motions, a grand\njury returned a second (S2) superseding indictment adding a sex trafficking count and\nanother related conspiracy count. This Opinion resolves all of Maxwell's currently\npending pretrial motions other than those seeking to suppress evidence, which the\nCourt will resolve in due course. The motions, and this Opinion, deal exclusively with\nthe Sl superseding indictment and do not resolve any issues related to the newly added\nsex trafficking charges. For the reasons that follou, the Court denies Maxwell's\nmotions to dismiss the $l superseding indictment in whole or in part. It grants her\nmotion to sever the perjury charges for a separate trial. It denies her motion to further\nexpedite discovery. The Court provides a brief summary of its conclusions here and its\nreasoning on the pages that follou:...[*** See this Opinion & Order ***]...\n<span class=\"highlight\">Conclusion</span>: The Court DENIES Maxwell's motions to dismiss the indictment as\nbarred by Epstein's non—prosecution agreement (Dkt. No. l4l), to dismiss the Mann\nAct counts as barred by the statute of limitations (Dkt. No. l43), to dismiss the\nindictment for pre—indictment delay (Dkt. No. l37), to dismiss the Mann Act counts\nfor lack of specificity (Dkt. No. l23), to dismiss the perjury counts as legally untenable\n(Dkt. No. l35), to strike surplusage (Dkt. No. l45), to dismiss count one or count three\nas multiplicitous (Dkt. No. l2l), and to expedite pretrial disclosures (Dkt. No. l47).\nThe Court GRANTS Maxwell's motion to sever the perjury counts for a separate trial\n(Dkt. No. ll9). The Court ORDERS the Government to confirm within one week\nwhether it considers any evidence related to negotiation of the non—prosecution\nagreement to constitute Brady or Rule l6 material and, if so, to confirm that it has or\nwill disclose such evidence. The Court further ORDERS the parties to negotiate a final\nschedule for all pretrial disclosures that remain outstanding, including: Brady, Giglio,\nand Jenks Act materials, including co—conspirator statements; non-testifying witness\nstatements; testifying witness statements; the identity of victims alleged in the\nindictment; 4o4(b) material; and the Government's witness list. The Court also requires\nthe parties to negotiate a schedule for any additional or supplemental motions briefing\nin light of the S2 indictment. The Court ORDERS a joint proposal to be submited by\nApril 2l, 2o2l. If agreement is not reached, the parties shall submit their respective\nproposals. The Court further ORDERS Maxwell to shou cause by April 2l, 2o2l why\nher motion to dismiss the Sl superseding indictment under the Sixth Amendment (Dkt.\nNo. l25) should not be denied as moot.

ENDORSEMENT:\nThe request for an extension of time until May 2l, 2o2l to respond to the Court's May\nll, 2o2l Order is GRANTED. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on\n5/l4/2o2l) (nl) (Entered: o5/l4/2o2l)\n\no5/l4/2o2l | 282 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On April 29, 2o2l, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell\nwrote to the Court requesting that the Court address her sleeping conditions, with\nparticular emphasis on counsel's representation, unsupported by affidavit or other\nfactual shouing, that guards are shining a flashlight in Maxwell's eyes every l5\nminutes at night. Dkt. No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance\nin Maxwell's eyes is disrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to\nprepare for and withstand trial. The Court sought more information by ordering the\nGovernment to confer with legal counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to\ncertain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In response, the Government states that MDC staff\nconduct flashlight checks of all inmates as a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As\nreported by the Government, inmates housed with cell mates in the Special Housing\nUnit are checked with flashlights every 3o minutes. Inmates housed with others in the\ngeneral population are checked multiple times per night at regular intervals. The\nGovernment further reports that to conduct the checks, flashlights are pointed at the\nceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present, breathing, and not in distress.\nAs the Government explains, there are a number of neutral reasons why BOP's\nflashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those of other inmates,\nincluding that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the potential\nstress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has determined that\nthese factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The Government\nalso indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable policy, but\nthat Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover her\neyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere\nwith Maxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.\nDefense counsel's May 7, 2o2l leter, Dkt. No. 272, describes generalized grievances\nbut makes no additional specific and supported application for relief. Nevertheless, the\nCourt urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be\nreduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continue to\nensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP determines\nare necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors,\nand consistent with the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees. The\nGovernment shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel for\nthe MDC. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

The Court further concludes that Juror 5o harbored no bias touard the\nDefendant and could serve as a fair and impartial juror. The requirements for a new\ntrial under McDonough are not satisfied. The Defendant's motion for a new trial\npursuant to Rule 33 is therefore DENIED. The Court orders the preparation of the\npresentence investigation report. With respect to Counts 7 and 8, the Court hereby\nexcludes time under the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), from today's\ndate through April 22, 2o22. The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting\nthis exclusion from speedy trial computations outweigh the interests of the public and\nthe Defendant in a speedy trial on these counts because the pending post-trial motions\naffect the scheduling considerations set forth in the Government's January lo, 2o22\nleter. See Dkt. No. 574. The Defendant consents to this exclusion. Dkt. No. 65o. The\nCourt will rule on the Defendant's remaining post—verdict motions in due course.\nSentencing remains scheduled for June 28, 2o22. This resolves docket numbers 6l3,\n6l4, 642, 65o, and 65l.

For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant's\nRule 29 motion because the jury's guilty verdicts were supported by the witness\ntestimony and documentary evidence presented at trial. The Court denies the\nDefendant's motion based on constructive amendment or variance because the jury\ninstructions, the Government's evidence at trial, and summation all captured the core\nof criminality charged in the Indictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced by any\nalleged variance. Further, because the Government neither intentionally delayed its\nprosecution nor was the Defendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the\nDefendant's motion based on pre—indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the\nDefendant's motion as to multiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three. Count Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the\nDefendant's participation in the same decade—long unlawful agreement with the\nDefendant's continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein, to groom and sexually abuse\nunderage girls. Accordingly, the Court will enter judgment of conviction on Counts\nThree, Four, and Six. The Defendant's sentencing date remains scheduled for June 28,\n2o22.

(Everdell, Christian) (Entered: o4/l6/2o2l)\n\no4/l6/2o2l | 2o7 | OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. In June 2o2o, a grand jury returned a\nsix—count indictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell with facilitating the late financier\nJeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of minor victims from around l994 to l997. The\nGovernment filed a first (Sl) superseding indictment shortly thereafter, which\ncontained only small, ministerial corrections. The Sl superseding indictment included\ntwo counts of enticement or transportation of minors to engage in illegal sex acts in\nviolation of the Mann Act and two counts of conspiracy to commit those offenses. It\nalso included two counts of perjury in connection with Maxwell's testimony in a civil\ndeposition. Trial is set to begin on July l2, 2o2l. Maxwell filed twelve pretrial\nmotions seeking to dismiss portions of the $l superseding indictment, suppress\nevidence, and compel discovery. After the parties fully briefed those motions, a grand\njury returned a second (S2) superseding indictment adding a sex trafficking count and\nanother related conspiracy count. This Opinion resolves all of Maxwell's currently\npending pretrial motions other than those seeking to suppress evidence, which the\nCourt will resolve in due course. The motions, and this Opinion, deal exclusively with\nthe Sl superseding indictment and do not resolve any issues related to the newly added\nsex trafficking charges. For the reasons that follou, the Court denies Maxwell's\nmotions to dismiss the $l superseding indictment in whole or in part. It grants her\nmotion to sever the perjury charges for a separate trial. It denies her motion to further\nexpedite discovery. The Court provides a brief summary of its conclusions here and its\nreasoning on the pages that follou:...[*** See this Opinion & Order ***]...\n<span class=\"highlight\">Conclusion</span>: The Court DENIES Maxwell's motions to dismiss the indictment as\nbarred by Epstein's non—prosecution agreement (Dkt. No. l4l), to dismiss the Mann\nAct counts as barred by the statute of limitations (Dkt. No. l43), to dismiss the\nindictment for pre—indictment delay (Dkt. No. l37), to dismiss the Mann Act counts\nfor lack of specificity (Dkt. No. l23), to dismiss the perjury counts as legally untenable\n(Dkt. No. l35), to strike surplusage (Dkt. No. l45), to dismiss count one or count three\nas multiplicitous (Dkt. No. l2l), and to expedite pretrial disclosures (Dkt. No. l47).\nThe Court GRANTS Maxwell's motion to sever the perjury counts for a separate trial\n(Dkt. No. ll9). The Court ORDERS the Government to confirm within one week\nwhether it considers any evidence related to negotiation of the non—prosecution\nagreement to constitute Brady or Rule l6 material and, if so, to confirm that it has or\nwill disclose such evidence. The Court further ORDERS the parties to negotiate a final\nschedule for all pretrial disclosures that remain outstanding, including: Brady, Giglio,\nand Jenks Act materials, including co—conspirator statements; non-testifying witness\nstatements; testifying witness statements; the identity of victims alleged in the\nindictment; 4o4(b) material; and the Government's witness list. The Court also requires\nthe parties to negotiate a schedule for any additional or supplemental motions briefing\nin light of the S2 indictment. The Court ORDERS a joint proposal to be submited by\nApril 2l, 2o2l. If agreement is not reached, the parties shall submit their respective\nproposals. The Court further ORDERS Maxwell to shou cause by April 2l, 2o2l why\nher motion to dismiss the Sl superseding indictment under the Sixth Amendment (Dkt.\nNo. l25) should not be denied as moot.

ENDORSEMENT:\nThe request for an extension of time until May 2l, 2o2l to respond to the Court's May\nll, 2o2l Order is GRANTED. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on\n5/l4/2o2l) (nl) (Entered: o5/l4/2o2l)\n\no5/l4/2o2l | 282 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On April 29, 2o2l, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell\nwrote to the Court requesting that the Court address her sleeping conditions, with\nparticular emphasis on counsel's representation, unsupported by affidavit or other\nfactual shouing, that guards are shining a flashlight in Maxwell's eyes every l5\nminutes at night. Dkt. No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance\nin Maxwell's eyes is disrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to\nprepare for and withstand trial. The Court sought more information by ordering the\nGovernment to confer with legal counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to\ncertain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In response, the Government states that MDC staff\nconduct flashlight checks of all inmates as a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As\nreported by the Government, inmates housed with cell mates in the Special Housing\nUnit are checked with flashlights every 3o minutes. Inmates housed with others in the\ngeneral population are checked multiple times per night at regular intervals. The\nGovernment further reports that to conduct the checks, flashlights are pointed at the\nceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present, breathing, and not in distress.\nAs the Government explains, there are a number of neutral reasons why BOP's\nflashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those of other inmates,\nincluding that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the potential\nstress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has determined that\nthese factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The Government\nalso indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable policy, but\nthat Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover her\neyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere\nwith Maxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.\nDefense counsel's May 7, 2o2l leter, Dkt. No. 272, describes generalized grievances\nbut makes no additional specific and supported application for relief. Nevertheless, the\nCourt urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be\nreduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continue to\nensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP determines\nare necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors,\nand consistent with the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees. The\nGovernment shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel for\nthe MDC. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

The Court concludes that Juror 5o\ntestified credibly and truthfully at the post-trial hearing. His failure to disclose his\nprior sexual abuse during the jury selection process was highly unfortunate, but not\ndeliberate. The Court further concludes that Juror 5o harbored no bias touard the\nDefendant and could serve as a fair and impartial juror. The requirements for a new\ntrial under McDonough are not satisfied. The Defendant's motion for a new trial\npursuant to Rule 33 is therefore DENIED. The Court orders the preparation of the\npresentence investigation report. With respect to Counts 7 and 8, the Court hereby\nexcludes time under the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), from today's\ndate through April 22, 2o22. The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting\nthis exclusion from speedy trial computations outweigh the interests of the public and\nthe Defendant in a speedy trial on these counts because the pending post-trial motions\naffect the scheduling considerations set forth in the Government's January lo, 2o22\nleter.

Accordingly,\nthe Court ORDERS the follouing schedule for sentencing: May 24, 2o22 — First PSR\ndisclosure; May 3l, 2o22 — Defendant objections due; June 6, 2o22 — Government\nresponse due; June 9, 2o22 — Second PSR disclosure; June l5, 2o22 — Defendant\nsentencing submission due; June 22, 2o22 — Government sentencing submission due;\nJune 28, 2o22 — Sentencing. This resolves Dkt. No. 655. SO ORDERED. (Signed by\nJudge Alison J.

For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant's\nRule 29 motion because the jury's guilty verdicts were supported by the witness\ntestimony and documentary evidence presented at trial. The Court denies the\nDefendant's motion based on constructive amendment or variance because the jury\ninstructions, the Government's evidence at trial, and summation all captured the core\nof criminality charged in the Indictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced by any\nalleged variance. Further, because the Government neither intentionally delayed its\nprosecution nor was the Defendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the\nDefendant's motion based on pre—indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the\nDefendant's motion as to multiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three. Count Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the\nDefendant's participation in the same decade—long unlawful agreement with the\nDefendant's continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein, to groom and sexually abuse\nunderage girls. Accordingly, the Court will enter judgment of conviction on Counts\nThree, Four, and Six. The Defendant's sentencing date remains scheduled for June 28,\n2o22. The Court previously set a schedule for sentencing submissions that remains in\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o573", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020635.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel7 of 2o8\n2/22/23, l:25 PM SDNY CM/ECF NextGen Version l.6\nPages .

It also included two counts of perjury\nin connection with Maxwell's testimony in a civil deposition. Trial is set to begin on July\nl2, 2o2l. Maxwell filed twelve pretrial motions seeking to dismiss portions of the Sl\nsuperseding indictment, suppress evidence, and compel discovery. After the parties fully\nbriefed those motions, a grand jury returned a second (S2) superseding indictment adding\na sex trafficking count and another related conspiracy count. This Opinion resolves all of\nMaxwell's currently pending pretrial motions other than those seeking to suppress\nevidence, which the Court will resolve in due course. The motions, and this Opinion, deal\nexclusively with the Sl superseding indictment and do not resolve any issues related to\nthe newly added sex trafficking charges. For the reasons that follou, the Court denies\nMaxwell's motions to dismiss the Sl superseding indictment in whole or in part. It grants\nher motion to sever the perjury charges for a separate trial. It denies her motion to further\nexpedite discovery. The Court provides a brief summary of its conclusions here and its\nreasoning on the pages that follou:...[*** See this Opinion & Order ***]... <span class=\"highlight\">Conclusion</span>:\nThe Court DENIES Maxwell's motions to dismiss the indictment as barred by Epstein's\nnon-prosecution agreement (Dkt. No. l4l), to dismiss the Mann Act counts as barred by\nthe statute of limitations (Dkt. No. l43), to dismiss the indictment for pre-indictment\ndelay (Dkt. No. l37), to dismiss the Mann Act counts for lack of specificity (Dkt. No.\nl23), to dismiss the perjury counts as legally untenable (Dkt. No. l35), to strike\nsurplusage (Dkt. No. l45), to dismiss count one or count three as multiplicitous (Dkt. No.\nl2l), and to expedite pretrial disclosures (Dkt. No. l47). The Court GRANTS Maxwell's\nmotion to sever the perjury counts for a separate trial (Dkt. No. ll9). The Court\nORDERS the Government to confirm within one week whether it considers any evidence\nrelated to negotiation of the non-prosecution agreement to constitute Brady or Rule l6\nmaterial and, if so, to confirm that it has or will disclose such evidence. The Court further\nORDERS the parties to negotiate a final schedule for all pretrial disclosures that remain\noutstanding, including: Brady, Giglio, and Jenks Act materials, including co-conspirator\nstatements; non-testifying witness statements; testifying witness statements; the identity\nof victims alleged in the indictment; 4o4(b) material; and the Government's witness list.\nThe Court also requires the parties to negotiate a schedule for any additional or\nsupplemental motions briefing in light of the S2 indictment. The Court ORDERS a joint\nproposal to be submited by April 2l, 2o2l. If agreement is not reached, the parties shall\nsubmit their respective proposals.

In furtherance of this, counsel for the\nGovernment are ORDERED to confer with legal counsel for MDC to ensure that Ms.\nMaxwell continues to have access to confidential atorney-client communications as she\nprepares for trial. If any additional incidents arise, defense counsel shall promptly confer\nwith counsel for the Government regarding those incidents and seek to resolve any such\nissues swiftly, responsibly, reasonably, and amicably. If that fails, the parties may write to\nthe Court jointly indicating their views, identifying and justifying any specific application\nbeing made. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

The Court deems an adjournment until fall 2o2l to be\nreasonable. Such an adjournment would plainly give the defense team sufficient time to\nprepare for trial in light of the additional charges contained in the S2 indictment while\nalso ensuring that the trial proceeds without undue delay. No additional delay is necessary\nor in the interests of justice. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and by\nMay lo, 2o2l, they shall jointly propose a trial start date for the Court to request of the\nClerk's Office (as is required by COVID protocols). The Court urges counsel to agree to\nthe earliest possible date this fall and to seek adjustments to other schedules in order to\nfacilitate an early fall trial start date. The parties shall also discuss and propose any\nadjustments necessary to the pre-trial schedule in place. Dkt. No. 25o.

For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant's Rule 29\nmotion because the jury's guilty verdicts were supported by the witness testimony and\ndocumentary evidence presented at trial. The Court denies the Defendant's motion based\non constructive amendment or variance because the jury instructions, the Government's\nevidence at trial, and summation all captured the core of criminality charged in the\nIndictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced by any alleged variance. Further,\nbecause the Government neither intentionally delayed its prosecution nor was the\nDefendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the Defendant's motion based.\non pre-indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the Defendant's motion as to\nmultiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is multiplicitous with Count\nThree, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is multiplicitous with Count\nThree. Count Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the Defendant's participation in\nthe same decade-long unlawful agreement with the Defendant's continuous coconspirator,\nJeffrey Epstein, to groom and sexually abuse underage girls. Accordingly, the Court will\nenter judgment of conviction on Counts Three, Four, and Six. The Defendant's sentencing\ndate remains scheduled for June 28, 2o22. The Court previously set a schedule for\nsentencing submissions that remains in effect. Dkt. No. 656. This resolves Dkt. No. 599.\nSO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

For the reasons that follou, the Court denies\nMaxwell’s motions to dismiss the Sl superseding indictment in whole or in part. It grants her\nmotion to sever the perjury charges for a separate trial. It denies her motion to further expedite\ndiscovery.\n\nThe Court provides a brief summary of its conclusions here and its reasoning on the\npages that follou:\n\ne Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts based on a non-prosecution agreement between\nJeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of Florida. The Court\nconcludes that the agreement does not apply in this District or to the charged offenses.\n\ne Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts as untimely. The Court concludes that the\nGovernment brought the charges within the statute of limitations and did not unfairly\ndelay in bringing them.\n\ne Maxwell moves to dismiss the Mann Act counts because they are too vague, or in the\nalternative to require the Government to describe the charges in greater detail. The\nCourt concludes that the charges are specific enough.\n\ne Maxwell moves to dismiss the perjury counts because, in her view, her testimony\nresponded to ambiguous questioning and was not material. The Court concludes that\nthese issues are best left for the jury.\n\ne Maxwell moves to sever the perjury counts from the Mann Act counts so that they can\nproceed in a separate trial. The Court concludes that severance is appropriate and will\ntry the perjury counts separately.\n\ne Maxwell moves to strike language from the indictment that she believes is superfluous\nand to dismiss conspiracy counts she believes are redundant. The Court concludes that\nthese motions are premature before trial.\n\ne Maxwell moves to compel the Government to immediately disclose certain categories\nof evidence. The Court concludes that she is not entitled to do so, but the Court will\norder Maxwell and the Government to confer on a discovery schedule.\n\ne Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts because a grand jury in White Plains, rather than\nManhatan, returned the $l superseding indictment. Because a jury in Manhatan\nreturned the S2 superseding indictment, the motion appears moot.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o76l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020763.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel45 of 2o8\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 4 of 34\nA. The non-prosecution agreement does not bind the U.S. Atorney for the\nSouthern District of New York\n\nUnited States Atorneys speak for the United States. When a U.S. Atorney makes a\npromise as part of a plea bargain, both contract principles and due process require the federal\ngovernment to fulfill it. See Santobello v. New York, 4o4 U.S. 257, 262 (l97l); United States v.\nReady, 82 F.3d 55l, 558 (2d Cir. l996). The question here is not whether the U.S. Atorney for\nthe Southern District of Florida had the pouer to bind the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District\nof New York. The question is whether the terms of the NPA did so. Applying Second Circuit\nprecedent and principles of contract interpretation, the Court concludes that they did not.\n\nIn United States v. Annabi, the Second Circuit held: “A plea agreement binds only the\noffice of the United States Atorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it\naffirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.” 77l F.2d 67o, 672\n(2d Cir. l985) (per curiam). This is something akin to a clear statement rule. Single-district plea\nagreements are the norm. Nationwide, unlimited agreements are the rare exception. Applying\nAnnabi, panels of the Second Circuit have stated that courts cannot infer intent to depart from\nthis ordinary practice from an agreement’s use of phrases like “the government” or “the United\nStates.” United States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88, l2o (2d Cir. l998) (per curiam); United States v.\nGonzalez, 93 F. App’x 268, 27o (2d Cir. 2oo4). Those are common shorthand. A plea\nagreement need not painstakingly spell out “the Office of the United States Atorney for Such-\nand-Such District” in every instance to make clear that it applies only in the district where\nsigned.\n\nMaxwell asks this Court to draw the opposite <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>. The provision of the NPA\ndealing with co-conspirators does not expressly state that it binds U.S. Atorneys in other\ndistricts. It does not expressly state that it applies in other districts. The relevant language, in\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o763", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020769.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel5l of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo of 34\nfor example, it is possible to transport a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity\nand not follou through with the planned sexual abuse, and so sexual abuse is not an essential\ningredient of the offense. Maxwell makes the same argument for the enticement and related\nconspiracy charges.\n\nThis approach is analogous to the “categorical approach” employed by courts to evaluate\nprior convictions for immigration and sentencing purposes. See Taylor v. United States, 495\nU.S. 575, 6o2 (l99o). Generally speaking, the “categorical approach” requires that courts “look\nonly to the statutory definitions—l.e., the elements” of the relevant offense to determine if the\nprovision applies “and not to the particular facts underlying those convictions.” Descamps v.\nUnited States, 57o U.S. 254, 26l (2ol3) (internal quotation marks omited). Whether a statute\nrequires a categorical or case-specific approach is a question of statutory interpretation. To\ndetermine whether Congress used the word “offense” in a statute to refer to an offense in the\nabstract or to the facts of each individual case, the Court must examine the statute’s “text,\ncontext, and history.” United States v. Davis, l39 S. Ct. 23l9, 2327 (2ol9).\n\nThough it has not authoritatively setled the question, the Second Circuit has strongly\nsuggested that Maxwell’s approach is the wrong one. In Weingarten v. United States, 865 F.3d\n48, 58-6o (2d Cir. 2ol7), the Second Circuit discussed at length hou the text, context, and\nhistory of § 3283 shou that Congress intended courts to apply the statute using a case-specific\napproach. The Third Circuit reached the same <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> in United States v. Schneider, 8ol\nF.3d l86, l96 (3d Cir. 2ol5).\n\nThe Court sees no reason to depart from the reasoning in Weingarten. First, “[t]he\nSupreme Court’s modern categorical approach jurisprudence is confined to the post-conviction\ncontexts of criminal sentencing and immigration deportation cases.” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o769", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020771.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel53 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of 34\n865 F.3d at 6o. Maxwell nonetheless contends that using a case-specific approach for § 3283\nwould be impractical because the Government would need to prove conduct beyond the elements\nof the offense. It may be true that this approach requires the Government to prove some\nadditional facts, but any statute-of-limitations defense presents factual issues (including, at least,\nwhen the alleged conduct took place). This is not a serious practical problem and does not\njustify seting aside the statute’s language and apparent purpose.\n\nMaxwell relies primarily on Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 2o9 (l953), to urge this\nCourt to cast Weingarten aside. The Supreme Court in Bridges addressed a statute that extended\nthe limitations period for defrauding the United States during the Second World War. In that\ncase, the Supreme Court first concluded that making false statements at an immigration hearing\nwas not subject to the extended limitations period because it lacked any pecuniary element as\nrequired by the statute. /d. at 22l. Then, as an alternative basis for its holding, it explained that\nthe offense did not require fraud as an “essential ingredient.” /d. at 222. It reached that\n<span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> in large part because the statute’s legislative history made clear that Congress\nintended it to apply only to a narrou class of war frauds causing pecuniary loss. /d. at 2l6.\n\nAs the Second Circuit explained in Weingarten, Congress had the opposite intent in the\nenacting in the PROTECT Act. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 59 & n. lo. “In passing recent statutes\nrelated to child sex abuse, including extensions of the § 3283 limitations period, Congress\n‘evinced a general intention to “‘cast a wide net to ensnare as many offenses against children as\npossible.””” Jd. at 6o (quoting Schneider, 8ol F.3d at l96 (quoting United States v. Dodge, 597\nF.3d l347, l355 (llth Cir. 2olo) (en banc))). The primary basis for Bridges’ holding—\nlegislative history supporting a narrou interpretation—does not exist here. Instead, both the\nstatute’s plan meaning and its legislative history suggest it should apply more broadly.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o77l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020773.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel55 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4 of 34\n\nSection 3283, as amended by the PROTECT Act, broadly states that “[n]o statute of\nlimitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution for an offense involving the sexual or\nphysical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child under the age of l8 years shall preclude such prosecution\nduring the life of the child.” The statute lacks an express retroactivity clause, but courts have\nheld that no such clause is necessary, including for this particular statute. See Leo Sure Chief,\n438 F.3d at 923. The statute’s plain language unambiguously requires that it apply to\nprosecutions for offenses commited before the date of enactment. Instead of simply providing a\nnew limitations period for future conduct, Congress stated that no statute of limitations that\nwould otherwise preclude prosecution of these offenses will apply. That is, it prevents the\napplication of any statute of limitations that would otherwise apply to past conduct.\n\nCourts have reached the same <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> for other statutes employing similar language.\nThe Eighth Circuit has held that the l994 amendments to § 3283, which alloued prosecution of\nsex crimes against children until the victim reached age twenty-five, applied to past conduct. See\nUnited States v. Jeffries, 4o5 F.3d 682, 684-85 (8th Cir. 2oo5). The Second Circuit has observed\nthat the Higher Education Technical Amendments of l99l, Pub. L. No. lo2-26, lo5 Stat. l23,\nillustrates language that requires a statute’s application to past conduct. See Enter. Mortg.\nAcceptance Co., LLC, Sec. Litig., 39l F.3d at 4o7. That statute eliminated the statute of\nlimitations for claims on defaulted student loans by stating that “no limitation shall terminate the\nperiod within which suit may be filed.” Jd. The PROTECT Act’s language is quite similar.\n\nThe history of § 3283 confirms Congress’s intent to apply the extended limitations period\nas broadly as the Constitution allous. With each successive amendment to the statute, Congress\nfurther extended the limitations period, recognizing that sex crimes against children “may be\ndifficult to detect quickly” because children often delay or decline to report sexual abuse.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o773", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020792.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel74 of 2o8\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 33 of 34\n\nGiven the complexities of the case and the addition of two counts via the S2 indictment, the\nCourt encourages the parties to agree to approximately eight weeks.\nIX.

The Court provides a brief summary of its\nconclusions here and its reasoning on the pages that follou:\n\n° Maxwell moves to dismiss counts one, three, five, and six as barred by Jeffrey\nEpstein’s non-prosecution agreement. The Court again concludes, as it did in its April\nl6, 2o2l Opinion & Order, that the agreement does not bind the United States Atorney\nfor the Southern District of New York.\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o8lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020812.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel94 of 2o8\nrenewed motion for substantially the same reasons set forth in its April l6 opinion.

Annabi that “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the United States\nAtorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the\nagreement contemplates a broader restriction.” 77l F.2d 67o, 672 (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam).\nThe Second Circuit’s opinion in Annabi is clear, and that court has folloued it steadfastly since.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x 268, 27o (2d Cir. 2oo4); United States v.\nBroun, No. 99-l23o(L), 2oo2 WL 34244994, at *2 (2d Cir.

The Second Circuit has held that language nearly identical to that in\nEpstein’s NPA is not enough to overcome the presumption in favor of single-district plea\nagreements. See Salameh, l52 F.3d at l2o. Adhering to this binding authority, this Court thus\nconcluded (and continues to conclude) that the NPA does not bind the U.S. Atorney’s Office for\nthe Southern District of New York. It thus provides Maxwell no defense in this case even if it\nwould otherwise cover the conduct charged in the new counts in the S2 superseding indictment.\n\nMaxwell advances two new arguments for why the Court should depart from this\nreasoning—the first in her renewed motion and the second in a leter of supplemental authority.\nSee Dkt. Nos. 293, 3lo. In her renewed motion, she contends that Annabi contains an exception\nfor out-of-district prosecutions for charges that are “identical to the dismissed charges.” And in\nthe leter of supplemental authority, she contends that the opinion of the Pennsylvania Supreme\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o8l2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020823.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Page2o5 of 2o8\nA-2ol\n<span class=\"highlight\">Conclusion</span>\n\nFor the reasons above and in this Court’s April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order, the Court\nDENIES Maxwell’s motion to obtain relief specified in her supplemental pre-trial motions\nrelating to the S2 indictment.

But the Second Circuit made clear that the district court would not have erred if it had kept\nthe juror. Jd. at 46-48.\n\nThe Court concludes that Juror 5o is neither impliedly nor inferably biased. First, none\nof the “extreme situations” in which the Court must conclusively presume bias as a mater of law\napply here. McCoy, 995 F.3d at 48. Juror 5o was not a victim of the charged crime itself, nor is\nhe related to any of the atorneys, witnesses, victims, or other case participants. See Nix, 275 F.\nSupp. 3d at 45l. Thus, the Court would not have granted a hypothetical challenge for cause\nbased on implied bias even if Juror 5o had provided correct answers to the questionnaire.\n\nSecond, Juror 5o’s personal experience of sexual abuse does not evidence partiality\nsufficient to infer that Juror 5o was biased against the Defendant. The Court need not imagine a\nwholly hypothetical universe for this <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>. That is because the voir dire provides highly\nrelevant indications of hou the parties and Court would have reacted had Juror 5o provided\naccurate answers during jury selection. A review of the voir dire of jurors who responded “yes\n(selfy’ to Question 48 reveals that it is unlikely that the Defendant would have challenged Juror\n5o for cause. It also reveals that the Court would not have granted a for-cause challenge had one\nbeen raised.

Thus, the Court finds no basis to infer that Juror 5o is biased.\n\nThe Defendant’s arguments to the contrary do not disturb the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that\nJuror 5o was neither impliedly nor inferably biased. First, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o\nwas impliedly biased because of multiple “dishonest answers.” Maxwell Br. at 36; Maxwell\nPost-Hearing Br. at ll.8 But this is not a case involving a juror’s extreme deceit due to a desire\nto be selected.

Supp.\n2d 445, 473 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol2), vacated and remanded on other grounds, United States v. Parse,\n789 F.3d 83 (2d Cir. 2ol5). The court granted the defendant’s motion for a new trial,\nemphasizing the “deliberate lies engineered to create a fictitious, ‘marketable’ juror” warranted\n“extraordinary relief.” /d. at 468. Such is not the case here. The Court credits Juror 5o’s\nexplanation that his nondisclosure was an “inadvertent mistake,” not intentional deception.\nHearing Tr. at l4-l5. Juror 5o explained hou the circumstances surrounding his completion of\nthe questionnaire—including his recent romantic breakup, that he had no expectation of being\nselected, the technical issues and ensuing long wait to begin the questionnaire, and the generally\ndistracting environment—resulted in his “skimming” the questionnaire and missing the personal\n8 The Defendant argued that these repeated lies included Juror 5o’s use of social media in her pre-hearing briefing.\nMaxwell Br. at 36. For the reasons stated in this Court’s February 25 Opinion, that Juror 5o used social media\naccounts after the completion of trial does not establish that he lied about having been inactive on social media\nbefore trial.

Maxwell Br. at 33\n(citing Sampson, 724 F.3d at l68).\n\nThe Defendant next relies on a state court case, State v. Afshar, l96 A.3d 93 (N.H. 2ol8),\nin which a court granted a new trial in a child sexual assault case when a juror failed to disclose\nthat a babysiter sexually assaulted him when he was five or six years old. Maxwell Post-\nHearing Br. at 5; see also Maxwell Br. at 34. But that juror had previously reported an inability\nto be impartial in another case involving sexual assault of a minor, and the court concluded that\nthere was “litle in the way of logical explanation for hou he could have differentiated between\nthe two cases.” l96 A.3d at 98. Such is not the case here.\n\nFinally, in Burton v. Johnson, the Tenth Circuit concluded that a juror was impliedly\nbiased when she suffered an abusive relationship with her husband that was highly similar to that\nof the defendant. 948 F.2d ll5o, ll58-59 (loth Cir. l99l). Houever, not only had that juror\ndeliberately lied during voir dire about the experience, but she was also living in that abusive\nsituation during voir dire, the trial itself, and her post-verdict testimony to the court. /d.\nConversely, Juror 5o credibly testified that his abuse “happened so long ago” that it is not\nsomething that he “think[s] about,” “it’s not part of who [he is].” Hearing Tr. at 47. And again,\nthe Court has not found that Juror 5o deliberately lied about his personal history.\n\nThe Defendant’s remaining arguments also fail to alter the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that Juror\n5o is not biased. The Defendant contends that Juror 5o’s post-trial conduct—in particular, his\nposts on social media and his decision to give interviews using his picture and first name—is\n“strong evidence” of his bias because he was “not looking to avoid notice,” but rather to “soak\nup his l5 minutes of fame.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at lo-ll. The Court disagrees that this\nconduct reveals bias. Whether wise or foolish, the fact that a juror may give an interview\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o977", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020982.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel56 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 39 of 4o\n\nEven if confined to the questionnaire session, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s\n“willingness to disregard the Court’s instructions” during the questionnaire “shous an inability\nto serve as an unbiased juror.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at ll. She relies on Dyer v. Calderon,\nl5l F.3d 97o (9th Cir. l998) (en banc), as her sole support. But Dyer stands for the distinct\nproposition that a juror who deliberately lies, and thus commits perjury, cannot be trusted to\n“stand in judgment of other people’s veracity.” /d. at 983. It does not support that an uncareful\nand inatentive prospective juror who mistakenly provides an inaccurate response during jury\nselection is biased. As explained above, the Court does not conclude that Juror 5o commited\nperjury and lied in an effort to be on the jury. Accordingly, the Court rejects granting the\nDefendant’s motion on this basis.\n\neK\n\nIn sum, the Court concludes that the evidence in the record does not support finding that\nJuror 5o was biased. Juror 5o’s sworn testimony did not reveal actual partiality. And Juror 5o\nwas not impliedly or inferably biased. He was neither a victim nor otherwise involved in the\nactual crimes. Nor does he have any sort of relationship with any of the parties or case\nparticipants. And as consistent with other jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48, the\nCourt would not have granted a for-cause challenge on the basis of Juror 5o’s personal history of\nsexual abuse. That Juror 5o was distracted during the questionnaire does not reveal that he was\nbiased or failed to follou the Court’s instructions during voir dire and the trial. Prong two of the\ndemanding McDonough inquiry is not satisfied.\nIV. <span class=\"highlight\">CONCLUSION</span>\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that Juror 5o testified credibly and\ntruthfully at the post-trial hearing.

Rather, it\nunderscores that the jury unanimously found—three times over—that the Defendant is guilty of\nconspiring with Epstein to entice, transport, and traffic underage girls for sexual abuse.\nI.

The same is true here. As explained above, the\nGovernment’s opening statement and closing arguments presented a theory of a singular\nconspiracy, highlighting: The degree of similarity between each victim witness’s experience\nover a decade; the common “playbook” that the Defendant ran “over and over and over again,”\nTrial Tr. at 2848; and the tight partnership between the Defendant and Epstein. And each of\nthose features was accompanied by references to a singular “scheme” to abuse all victim\nwitnesses. /d. at 36, 2843, 2853. At botom, the case presented to the jury by the Government\nwas of a single decade-long conspiracy by the Defendant and Epstein to sexually abuse underage\ngirls. Having pursued such a broad and encompassing conspiracy, the Government cannot nou\nclaim, and cannot carry its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence, that Count\nFive was legally and factually distinct. See Maslin, 356 F.3d at l97.\n\nBecause Count Three and Count Five are multiplicitous, the proper remedy is to enter\njudgment on only one of the counts. See Josephberg, 459 F.3d at 355 (“If the jury convicts on\nmore than one multiplicitous count, the defendant’s right not to suffer multiple punishments for\nthe same offense will be protected by having the court enter judgment on only one of the\nmultiplicitous counts.” (citing Ball v. United States, 47o U.S. 856, 865 (l985))). Because Count\nFive is factually subsumed by Count Three, the Court will impose judgment only on Count\nThree.

(citing Cornielle, l7l\nF.3d at 75l).\n\nIn its prior rulings, this Court concluded that the Defendant satisfied neither requirement:\nthere was “no evidence that the Government’s delay in bringing these charges was designed to\nthwart Maxwell’s ability to prepare a defense,” and she “failed to establish actual prejudice from\nthe Government’s delay.” /d. at 3l6-l7. But, the Court explained, the Defendant could renew\nher motion if the factual record at trial shoued prejudice that the pretrial record did not. The\nDefendant nou renews her motion, identifying a bevy of documentary records and witnesses\nthat, she says, were unavailable because of the Government’s delay. The Court, for the reasons\nstated belou, disagrees and denies the motion.\n\nAs an initial mater, even if the Court accepts all of the Defendant’s contentions in her\nbriefing, her pre-indictment delay claim must fail because the Defendant has made no claim that\nthe Government intentionally delayed the Indictment to gain a tactical advantage over the\nDefendant. United States v. Alameh, 34l F.3d l67, l76 (2d Cir. 2oo3). The Court has twice\nconcluded that “nothing in the record indicates that the Government’s delay in bringing these\ncharges was designed to thwart Maxwell’s ability to prepare a defense.” Maxwell, 2o2l WL\n359l8ol, at *5. It is the Defendant’s burden to prove the Government’s improper motive, but in\nher briefing she does not atempt to present evidence of intentional delay for tactical advantage.\nThe Court therefore does not alter its prior <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>. If anything, as the Government notes,\ntestimony at trial supplied legitimate explanations for the Government’s failure to indict the\nDefendant at an earlier time. For example, several witnesses testified that their cooperation with\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo2l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021027.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Page2ol of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 44 of 45\nwould have credited this vague testimony about an unnamed individual over the evidence\npresented at trial, including the testimony of Juan Alessi and an email chain between the\nDefendant and Markham that indicates that the Defendant worked closely with Markham to\ncreate the manual and provided specific content, such as the checklists, to be included. See GX-\n424.\n\nFinally, the Defendant refers to her prior briefing in which she alleged substantial\nprejudice because of the absence of other deceased potential witnesses, including Epstein,\nEpstein’s mother, Jane’s talent agent Michael Casey, and Palm Beach Police Department\nDetective Joseph Recarey. See Dkt. No. l38 at 8-ll. The Court has previously considered and.\nrejected the Defendant’s claim of prejudice based on these absent witnesses. Maxwell, 534 F.\nSupp. 3d at 3l7. The Defendant points to no development at trial that she believes should alter\nthe Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>, nor is the Court aware of any such reason for reconsideration.\n\nThe Defendant’s reply brief devotes just a single sentence to her claim of pre-indictment\ndelay and does not address any of the defects identified by the Government. She has not\nsatisfied either element required for a claim of pre-indictment delay, as she has not demonstrated.\nthat the Government improperly delayed prosecution nor that she suffered actual and substantial\nprejudice from such delay. The Court therefore denies her motion to vacate her convictions on\nthis basis.\n\nV. <span class=\"highlight\">Conclusion</span>\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion because the\njury’s guilty verdicts were supported by the witness testimony and documentary evidence\npresented at trial.

Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.* Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nI. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\n7 In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\na OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nVil\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll83", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021185.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document eye ae 3536o38, Pagel3 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 348\nof immunity, or (6) the deportation of criminal aliens. The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">Conclusion</span> That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\n\nix\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll85", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021186.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document eye be 3536o38, Pagel4 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of 348\n\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll86", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021188.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel6 of 258\nSA-l4\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4 of 348\nthat the victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the\nDepartment.\nVI. ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nxil\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll88", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021189.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel7 of 258\nSA-l5\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5 of 348\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIl.

Lourie forwarded a copy of the prosecution memorandum to\nMenchel. Lourie’s transmital message read:\n\nMarie did a 5o [sic] page pros memo in the Epstein case. Iam going\n\nto start reading it tonight. ... It’s a major case because the target is\n\none of the richest men in the country and it has been big news.

The\n\nFBI is pushing to do it in Mid [sic] May, which I think is not critical,\n\nbut we might as well get a jump on it. I have some ideas about the\n\nindictment (needs to be ultra lean with only clean victims), so I am\n\nnot sending that yet.\nLourie explained to OPR that by “clean” victims, he meant those for whom the defense did not\nhave impeachment evidence to use against them.\n\nA few days later, Lourie emailed Menchel, asking if Menchel had read the prosecution\nmemorandum. Lourie directed Menchel’s atention to particular pages of the prosecution\nmemorandum, noting that the “keys” were whether the USAO could prove that Epstein traveled\nfor the purpose of engaging in sexual acts, and the fact that some minor victims told Epstein they\nwere l8.37 Lourie asked for Menchel’s “very general opinion as to whether this is a case you think\nthe office should do,” and reminded Menchel that the State Atorney’s Office “went out of their\nway to get ano-bill on this... and thus only charged adult solicitation, which they would bargain\naway to nothing.”\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Menchel said that Lourie’s email transmiting the prosecution\nmemorandum was his “official introduction” to the case and at that point in time, he had never\nheard of Epstein and had no information about his background. He recalled that the USAO had\nbeen asked to review the case because the state had not handled it appropriately. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that he had litle memory about the facts of the case or what contemporaneous\nopinions he formed about it.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he could not recall whether he ever read Villafafia’s prosecution\nmemorandum, explaining that he “would typically rely on senior staff,’ who had more\nprosecutorial experience, and that instead of reading the memorandum, he may have discussed the\ncase with Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, who he assumed would have read the document. Acosta\nat In various submissions to the USAO, the defense contended that the federal statute required proof that\nengaging in a sexual act was the “paramount or dominant purpose” of Epstein’s travel, but that Epstein’s travel was\nmotivated by his desire to live outside of New York for over half of each year for tax purposes. The defense also\nasserted that the federal statutes at issue required proof that the defendant knew the victims were under l8, but that\nEpstein “took affirmative steps to ensure that every woman was at least l8 years of age.” In her prosecution\nmemorandum, houever, Villafafia set forth her <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the statute only required proof that engaging in a sexual\nact was one of the motivating factors for the travel. She also concluded that the statutes did not require proof that the\ndefendant knew the victims were minors.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l226", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021230.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONG 3536o38, Pageds of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 56 of 348\nhe is comfortable before proceeding.” Menchel told Villafafia he had “trouble understanding” why\nshe was in a “rush” “given hou long this case has been pending.”\n\nOPR questioned Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta about the timeline for reviewing\nthe prosecution memorandum and the proposed charges. Acosta and Menchel believed Villafafia’s\ntimeline was unrealistic from the start. Acosta told OPR that Villafafia was “very hard charging,”\nbut her timeline for filing charges in the case was “really, really fast.” Menchel described Villafafia\nas “out over her skis a litle bit” and “ahead of’ Acosta in terms of his analysis of the case.*°\nMenchel said it was clear to him that Acosta “was going to be the one making the call” about\nwhether to go forward with charges, and Acosta needed more time to make a decision. Menchel\ntold OPR, “This [was] not a case [we were] going to review in two weeks and make a decision\non.” Sloman told OPR that although he did not conduct a “granular review” of the proposed\ncharges, he believed Menchel and Lourie had done so and “obviously” had concluded that “the\nfacts and the law didn’t suggest that the right thing to do was to automatically indict.” Lourie told\nOPR that he believed “the case was moving ahead.”\n\nVillafafia continued to seek direction from her managers. On May l5, 2oo7, she emailed\nSloman, noting that “[i]t seemed from our discussion yesterday that pestering Alex [Acosta] will\nnot do any good. Am I right about that?” Sloman responded, “Yes.” On May 2l, 2oo7, three\nweeks after submiting the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia emailed Sloman and Menchel\nasking for ‘“‘a sense of the direction where we are headed-l.e., approval of an indictment something\nlike the current draft, a complaint to allou for pre-indictment negotiations, an indictment\ndrastically different from the current draft?” Sloman responded only, “Taken care of.’””*°\n\nD. Defense Counsel Seek a Meeting with Senior USAO Managers, which\n\nVillafafia Opposes\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein’s defense counsel continued to seek additional information about the\nfederal investigation and a meeting with senior USAO managers, including Acosta. In a May lo,\n2oo7 email to Menchel, Lourie reported that Epstein’s atorneys “want me to tell them the statutes\n44 Villafafia explained to OPR that the “rush” related to her concern that Epstein was continuing to abuse girls:\n“Tn terms of the issue of why the hurry, because child sex offenders don’t stop until they’re behind bars. That was our\ntime concern.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia offering this explanation to him. OPR\nnotes that in their respective statements to OPR and in their comments on OPR’s draft report, Menchel and Villafafia\nexpressed contradictory accounts or interpretations of certain events. When it was necessary for OPR to resolve those\nconflicts in order to reach its findings and conclusions, OPR considered the extensive documentary record and the\ntestimony of other subjects and witnesses, to the extent available.\n\n45 Sloman similarly recalled that Menchel thought Villafafia was “ahead of where the office was internally” and\nthat caused “discontent” between Villafafia and Menchel. Villafafia was not the only one, houever, who was surprised\nthat the indictment was not approved immediately. The case agent told OPR that it seemed “everything changed”\nafter Villafafia submited the prosecution memorandum, and the momentum touards an indictment abated. Villafafia’s\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that from her perspective, it appeared “Miami didn’t want the case prosecuted.”\nHouever, Menchel rebuked Villafafia in his July 5, 2oo7 email to her for having “led the agents to believe that [filing\ncharges in] this mater was a foregone <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>.”\n\n46 Sloman could not recall during his OPR interview what he meant by this remark, but he speculated that he\nhad spoken to Menchel, and Menchel was going to take care of it.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l23o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021235.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON eL 3536o38, Page63 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 6l of 348\nLourie opined that the government could argue “that over time [Epstein] set up a network of illegal\nhigh school massage recruits that would be difficult to duplicate anywhere else,” which supported\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the massages must have been a motivating purpose of his travel, if not the sole\npurpose. Houever, Lourie expressed concern about “geting to the jury” on this issue and noted\nthat he had not found a legal case factually on point. Villafafia told OPR that she disagreed with\nLourie’s analysis of the purpose of travel issue and had discussed the mater with him.* Villafafia\nalso recalled that there were aspects of the defense submissions she and her colleagues considered\n“narticularly weak.”\n\nOn June 26, 2oo7, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, Villafafia, the case agent, and the West Palm\nBeach squad supervisor met at the Miami USAO with Epstein atorneys Dershouitz, Black,\nLefcourt, and Sanchez. Dershouitz led the defense team’s presentation. From the USAO\nperspective, the meeting was merely a “listening session.”°* Echoing the arguments made in\nLefcourt’s leter, Dershouitz argued that the USAO should permit the state to handle the case\nbecause these were “traditionally state offenses.” The case agent recalled being uncomfortable\nthat the defense was asking questions in an atempt to gain information about the federal\ninvestigation, including the number of victims and the types of sexual contact that had been\ninvolved.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when Epstein’s atorneys left the meeting, they appeared to be\n“under the impression that they had convinced us not to proceed.” But Menchel told OPR, “[T]hey\nobviously did not persuade” the USAO because “we... didn’t drop the investigation.” According\nto Villafafia, Lourie, and Menchel, during a short post-meeting discussion at which Lourie\nexpressed concern about the purpose of travel issue and Menchel raised issues related to general\ncredibility of the victims, the prevailing sense among the USAO participants was that the defense\npresentation had not been persuasive. Villafafia told OPR that she “left [the meeting] with the\nimpression that we were continuing touards” filing charges.\n\nIV. ACOSTA DECIDES TO OFFER EPSTEIN A TWO-YEAR STATE PLEA TO\n\nRESOLVE THE FEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nUSAO internal communications shou that in July 2oo7, Acosta developed, or adopted, the\nbroad outline of an agreement that could resolve the federal investigation. The agreement would\nleave the case in state court by requiring Epstein to plead guilty to state charges, but would\naccomplish three goals important to the federal prosecutors: Epstein’s incarceration; his\nregistration as a sexual offender; and a mechanism to provide for the victims to recover monetary\n3 Villafafia also told OPR that Lourie had, at times, expressed concern about the prosecution’s ability to prove\nEpstein’s knouledge of the victims’ ages, particularly with regard to those who were l6 or l7 at the time they provided\nmassages.\n\n4 In his writen response to OPR, Menchel indicated that he had no independent recollection of the June 26,\n2oo7 meeting. In his OPR interview, Menchel said that although he had litle memory of the meeting, to the best of\nhis recollection the USAO simply listened to the defense presentation, and in a contemporaneous email, Menchel\nopined that he viewed the upcoming June 26 meeting as “more as [the USAO] listening and them presenting their\nposition.”\n35\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l235", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021242.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 6S 3536o38, Page/o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 68 of 348\n\nMenchel’s reply email began with a rebuke:\nBoth the tone and substance of your email are totally inappropriate\nand, in combination with other maters in the past, it seriously calls\nyour judgment into question.\nAs you well knou, the US Atorney has not even decided whether\nto go forward with a prosecution in this mater, thus you should have\nrespected his position before engaging in plea negotiations.\nAlong that same line, despite whatever contrary representations you\nmade to the agents in this mater, it was made clear to you by the US\nAtorney and the First Assistant from the time when you were first\nauthorized to investigate Mr. Epstein that the office had concerns\nabout taking this case because of petit [sic] policy and a number of\nlegal issues. Despite being told these things, you prepared a pros\nmemo and indictment that included a definitive date for indictment.\nIt has come to my atention that you led the agents to believe that\nthe indictment of this mater was a foregone <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> and that our\ndecision to put off that date and listen to the defense atorneys’\nconcerns is indicative of the office having second thoughts about\nindicting.

It\nwas an informal discussion and not in the nature of an official plea\noffer but rather a feeling out by both sides as to what it might take\nto resolve the mater. As you are also well aware, the only reason\nwhy this office even agreed to look into the Epstein mater in the\nfirst instance was because of concerns that the State had not done an\nadequate job in vindicating the victims’ rights. As you and the\nagents conceded, had Epstein been convicted of a felony that\nresulted in a jail sentence and sex offender status, neither the FBI\nnor our office ever would have interceded. You should also knou\nthat my discussion with Lilly Sanchez was made with the US\nAtorney’s full knouledge.

Epstein Further Delays His Guilty Plea\n\nThe addendum did not bring the case to <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>. Instead, the mater entered a new,\nprotracted phase, which involved the upper echelons of the Department of Justice. Despite the\nfact that Epstein and his atorneys had signed the NPA, they pursued a new strategy of appealing\nto senior Department managers with the goal of seting aside the NPA entirely. Although\nultimately unsuccessful, the strategy delayed the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea by months.\n\nOn October 29, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Sloman, raising several issues that she wanted\nSloman to address with Lefkouitz. Among other things, Villafafia pointed out that the NPA\nrequired Epstein to use his “best efforts” to comply with the agreement, but he had failed to comply\nwith the timeline established by the NPA when he sought and obtained a plea hearing\npostponement from October 26 to November 2o. Responding to Lefkouitz’s atempts to limit the\nUSAO’s communications with various entities and individuals, Villafafia noted that the USAO\nneeded to be able to communicate with the State Atorney’s Office and the victims’ atorney “to\n[e]nsure that Epstein is abiding by the terms of the agreement.”\n\nThat same day, Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek informed Sloman that the state judge\nassigned to the case had scheduled Epstein’s plea and sentence in early January 2oo8. Belohlavek\nassured Sloman that the “plea and sentence will definitely occur before the January 4th date that\nwas agreed on by all for the sentencing.” *” Nonetheless, emails over the course of the next month\nshou that the USAO, the State Atorney’s Office, and defense counsel continued to communicate\nregarding the date of the guilty plea, with the USAO asserting that a proposed January 7, 2oo8\ndate for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea was “unacceptable,” while the defense contended that\nEpstein had not agreed to any date. Finally, after multiple communications referring to various\npotential dates, on December 7, 2oo7, Epstein atorney Jack Goldberger issued a Notice of\nHearing, seting the case for January 4, 2oo8.!°°\n\nE. Epstein Seeks Departmental Review of the NPA’s § 2255 Provision Relating to\n\nMonetary Damages for the Victims\n\nWith Epstein’s plea hearing delayed, he launched a new effort to undermine the validity of\nthe NPA, this time within the Department. On November l6, 2oo7, Epstein atorney Kenneth Starr\ncalled the office of Assistant Atorney General for the Criminal Division Alice Fisher and left a\nmessage that he was calling regarding Epstein.'°!

Finally, in a leter to Assistant Atorney General Fisher on\nMay l4, 2oo8, Starr thanked her for having spoken with him the previous day, reiterated the\ndefense team’s various complaints, and asked her to meet with him, Lefkouitz, and Whitley.\n\nMeanwhile, Oosterban’s Deputy Chief drafted a decision leter to be sent from Oosterban\nto Lefkouitz, and over the course of several weeks, it was reviewed by and received input from\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker and Assistant Atorney General Fisher, as well as\nthe Criminal Division’s Appellate Section (regarding certain legal issues) and Office of\nEnforcement Operations (regarding the Petite policy). Oosterban told OPR that, notwithstanding\nthe defense submissions on a wide variety of issues and complaints, CEOS’s review was limited\nto determining whether there was a basis for a federal prosecution of Epstein.\n\nOosterban’s leter, sent to Lefkouitz on May l5, 2oo8, notified the defense team that\nCEOS had completed its independent evaluation of whether prosecution of Epstein for federal\ncriminal violations “would contradict criminal enforcement policy interests.” The leter specified\nthat CEOS’s review addressed the “narrou question” of whether a legitimate basis existed for a\nfederal prosecution, and that CEOS did not conduct a de novo review of the facts, analyze issues\nrelating to federal statutes that did not pertain to child exploitation, or review the terms of the NPA\nor the prosecutorial misconduct allegations. The leter stated that based on its examination of the\nmaterial relevant to its limited review of the mater, CEOS had concluded that “federal prosecution\nin this case would not be improper or inappropriate” and that Acosta “could properly use his\ndiscretion to authorize prosecution in this case.”\n\nOn May l9, 2oo8, Lefkouitz reached out to Acosta to request a meeting and specifically\nasked that Acosta “not shunt me off to one of your staff.” Lefkouitz made several points in support\nof the request for a meeting: (l) CEOS’s leter acknouledged that federal prosecution of Epstein\nwould involve a “novel application” of relevant federal statutes;!°° (2) CEOS’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that\nfederal prosecution would not be ‘“‘an abuse of discretion” was “hardly an endorsement” of the\ncase;!®’ (3) CEOS did not address Epstein’s prosecutorial misconduct allegations; and (4) “critical\nnew evidence,” in the form of recent defense counsel depositions of victims confirmed “that\nrepresented Epstein victims. The Epstein defense team alleged in the leter that Sloman’s past association with the\natorney caused Sloman to take actions to favor victims’ potential civil lawsuits against Epstein.\ntes Oosterban’s leter stated, “Mr. Acosta can soundly exercise his authority to decide to pursue a prosecution\neven though it might involve a novel application of a federal statute.” This statement referred to a defense argument\nbased on a prior Departmental expression of concern about a Congressional proposal to expand federal law to “adult\nprostitution where no force, fraud or coercion was used.” Oosterban stated that “the Department’s efforts are properly\nfocused on the commercial sexual exploitation of children”—even if wholly local—and “the exploitation of adults\nthrough force, fraud, or coercion.” He then observed that the fact “that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not look\nprecisely like the cases that came before it is not dispositive.”\n\nEst Oosterban began his leter, houever, by making it clear that CEOS had considered “the narrou question as\nto whether there is a legitimate basis for the U.S. Atorney’s Office to proceed with a federal prosecution of\nMr. Epstein.”\nlo7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3o7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021329.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON TES 3536o38, Pagel57 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l55 of 348\nwhen prosecutors have used third parties as leverage in plea negotiations. Numerous courts have\nmade clear, houever, that a plea is not invalid when entered under an agreement that includes a\npromise of leniency touards a third party or in response to a prosecutor’s threat to prosecute a third\nparty if a plea is not entered. See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 9o9 F.2d 738, 74l-42 (2d Cir.\nl99o) (rejecting claim that plea was involuntary because of pressure placed upon a defendant by\nthe government’s insistence that a defendant’s wife would not be offered a plea bargain unless he\npled guilty); Martin v. Kemp, 76o F.2d l244, l248 (llth Cir. l985) (in order to satisfy “heavy\nburden” of establishing that the government had not acted “in good faith,” a defendant challenging\nvoluntariness of his plea on grounds that the prosecutor had threatened to bring charges against\nthe defendant’s pregnant wife had to establish that government lacked probable cause to believe\nthe defendant’s wife had commited a crime at the time it threatened to charge her); Stinson v.\nState, 839 So. 2d 9o6, 9o9 (Fla. App. 2oo3) (“In cases involving .. . a promise not to prosecute a\nthird party, the government must act in good faith . . . [and] must have probable cause to charge\nthe third party.”).\n\nThe second context concerns situations in which courts have enforced prosecutors’\npromises of leniency to third parties. For example, in State v. Frazier, 697 So. 2d 944 (Fla. App.\nl997), as consideration for the defendant’s guilty plea, the prosecutor agreed and announced in\nopen court that the government would dismiss charges against the defendant’s niece and nephew,\nwho had all been charged as a result of the same incident. When the state reneged and atempted\nto prosecute the niece and nephew, the trial court dismissed the charges against them, and the state\nappealed. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that under contract law\nprinciples, the niece and nephew were third-party beneficiaries of the plea agreement and were\ntherefore entitled to enforce it.\n\nApart from voluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a\nprosecutor’s promise not to prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of\nprosecutorial discretion.\n\nD.

OVERVIEW\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald report in November 2ol8, media scrutiny of and public\natention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart\nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s l8-month sentence, which resulted in a l3-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal\nconduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from\nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making\nprocess leading to the signed NPA. As a result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s\nmotivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors\nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the\nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because\nthey were motivated by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships\nwith his atorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\n\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the follouing core questions: (l) who\nwas responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its\nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules\nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by\nimproper factors, such as corruption or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness\ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shous in detail the process that led to the NPA, from\nthe initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.\nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and extensive\ninterviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions\nconcerning the NPA’s origins and development. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth\nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\nI. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS\n\nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\n\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knouledge of its terms. He\nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that\nhe either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the\ncase against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled\nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta\ndid not make such a claim to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged\nresolution, two years ..., registration and restitution, . . . ultimately that was approved on my\nauthority... . [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, I... accept that. I’m not... pushing away\nresponsibility for it.”\n\nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia were involved in the mater to varying degrees, at\nl33\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l333", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021334.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 6o. 3536o38, Pagel62 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6o of 348\ndifferent points in time, and regarding different decisions. Menchel, for example, participated in\nformulating the USAO’s initial writen offer to the defense, but he had no involvement with actions\nor decisions made after August 3, 2oo7. Sloman was absent during part of the most intense\nnegotiations in September 2oo7 and did not see the final, signed version of the NPA until he\nreturned. Villafafia and Lourie participated in the negotiations, and Lourie either made decisions\nduring the September l2, 2oo7 meeting with the defense and State Atorney’s Office, or at least\nindicated agreement pending Acosta’s approval. In any event, whatever the level of Sloman’s,\n\nMenchel’s, Lourie’s, and Villafafia’s involvement, they acted with the knouledge and approval of\n\nAcosta.\n\nUnder OPR’s analytical framework, an atorney who makes a good faith atempt to\nascertain the obligations and standards imposed on the atorney and to comply with them in a given\nsituation does not commit professional misconduct. Evidence that an atorney made a good faith\natempt to ascertain and comply with the obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not\nlimited to, the fact that the atorney consulted with a supervisor.”’ In this regard, OPR’s\nframework is similar to a standard provision of the professional conduct rules of most state bars,\nwhich specify that a subordinate lawyer does not engage in misconduct if that lawyer acts in\naccordance with a supervisory lawyer’s reasonable resolution of an arguable question of\nprofessional duty. See, e.g., FRPC 4-5.2(b). Therefore, in addition to the fact that OPR did not\nfind a violation of a clear and unambiguous standard as discussed belou, OPR concludes that\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia did not commit professional misconduct with respect to\nany aspect of the NPA because they acted under Acosta’s direction and with his approval.\n\nI. OPR FOUND THAT NONE OF THE SUBJECTS VIOLATED A CLEAR AND\nUNAMBIGUOUS STATUTE, PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY RULE OR\nSTANDARD, OR DEPARTMENT REGULATION OR POLICY, IN\nNEGOTIATING, APPROVING, OR ENTERING INTO THE NPA\nA central issue OPR addressed in its investigation relating to the NPA was whether any of\n\nthe subjects, in developing, negotiating, or entering into the NPA, violated any clear and\n\nunambiguous standard established by rule, regulation, or policy. OPR does not find professional\nmisconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous\nstandard. OPR considered three specific areas: (l) standards implicated by the decision to decline\n\na federal court prosecution; (2) standards implicated by the decision to resolve the federal\n\ninvestigation through a non-prosecution agreement; and (3) standards implicated by any of the\n\nNPA’s provisions, including the promise not to prosecute unidentified third parties. As discussed\n\nbelou, OPR concludes that in each area, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his\n\ndecisions were based on corrupt or improper influences, the U.S. Atorney possessed broad\ndiscretionary authority to proceed as he saw fit, authority that he could delegate to subordinates,\nand that Acosta’s exercise of his discretionary authority did not breach any clear and unambiguous\nstandard. As a result, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\n\n2o2 The failure to fully advise a supervisor of relevant and material facts can warrant a finding that the subordinate\n\natorney has not acted in “good faith.” OPR did not find evidence supporting such a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> here, and Acosta did\n\nnot claim that he was unaware of material facts needed to make his decision.\n\nl34\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l334", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021341.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON I67 3536o38, Pagel69 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l67 of 348\nto prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys.

The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.7°°\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA, OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l34l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021349.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON BS 3536o38, Pagel7/7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l75 of 348\n\nbeen concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on. . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a <span class=\"highlight\">Conclusion</span> That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by corruption, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\nrestitution for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.””” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n22l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . I was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\n\n228 Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\n\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\n\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\n\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\n\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so well.\n\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l349", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021350.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel78 of 258\nSA-l76\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l76 of 348\nreconsider the provision. Acosta could certainly have modified or eliminated the provision entirely\nif his motivation was to benefit Epstein or Epstein’s atorneys.\n\nSecond, Epstein himself was not satisfied with the NPA. Immediately after signing the\nagreement, he sought to have the Department nullify it by declaring federal involvement in the\ninvestigation inappropriate. In addition to repeatedly atacking the NPA in his submissions to the\nDepartment, Epstein added to his evidentiary challenges and federalism claims allegations of\nmisconduct and improper bias on the part of specific USAO personnel. Epstein’s dissatisfaction\nwith the NPA, and his personal atacks on individual prosecutors involved in negotiating the\nagreement, appear inconsistent with a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the subjects designed the NPA for Epstein’s\nbenefit.\n\nD. OPR Does Not Find That the Subjects’ Preexisting Relationships with Defense\n\nCounsel, Decisions to Meet with Defense Counsel, and Other Factors\nEstablished That the Subjects Acted from Improper Influences or Provided\nImproper Benefits to Epstein\n\nIn evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered various other factors featured in media\naccounts to shou that the subjects provided improper benefits to Epstein or which purportedly\nsuggested that the subjects acted from improper influences. OPR examined these factors but did\nnot find that they supported a finding that the subjects were influenced by favoritism, bias, or other\nimproper motivation.\n\nl. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects Extended Any\nImproper Benefit to Epstein because of Their Preexisting Relationships\nwith His Atorneys\n\nEpstein’s wealth enabled him to hire multiple atorneys who had preexisting personal\nconnections to some of the government atorneys involved in his case, in the State Atorney’s\nOffice, in the USAO, and elsewhere in the Department. Based on the atorneys Epstein selected\nto represent him, a reasonable inference can be drawn that Epstein believed that hiring atorneys\nwith relationships to the prosecutors would be beneficial to him. One of the first atorneys who\ncontacted the USAO on Epstein’s behalf was Guy Lewis, a former AUSA in and U.S. Atorney\nfor the Southern District of Florida. Villafafia and Lourie had worked for Lewis, and Lourie was\nclose friends with one of Lewis’s law partners. Epstein also retained Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former\nAUSA who had been Menchel’s deputy and with whom he had socialized. Later, when Epstein\nwas seeking Acosta’s personal involvement in the case, Epstein hired Kenneth Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz, prominent atorneys from Kirkland & Ellis with whom Acosta was acquainted from\nhis previous employment with that firm.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she believed Acosta “was influenced by the stature of Epstein’s\natorneys.” Critically, houever, other than the information regarding Menchel that is discussed in\nthe follouing subsection, neither Villafafia nor any of the other individuals OPR interviewed\nidentified any specific evidence suggesting that Acosta, or any of the other subjects, extended an\nimproper favor or benefit to Epstein because of a personal relationship with defense counsel (or\nfor any other improper reason). Villafafia explained hou, in her view, the “legal prouess” of\nEpstein’s atorneys had an impact on the case:\n\nl5o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l35o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021351.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel79 of 258\nSA-l77\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l77 of 348\n\n[O]ne of the issues in the case was the . . . defense’s ability to\ndescribe the case or characterize the case as being legally complex.\n\nIt was not as legally complex as they made it out to be. But because\n\nthey were able to convince members of our office that it was\nsomehou extremely novel and legally complex, the issue became\n\nwho was likely to succeed in arguing these legal issues. And\nbecause of that, the legal prouess, if you will, of the atorneys [ ]\n[became] something to consider.\n\nI think that the ability of Alan Dershouitz and Ken Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz to convince Alex Acosta that I didn’t knou what I was\n\ntalking [about] also, all came into play. So I think there were a\nnumber of factors and it all came together.\n\nAlthough Villafafia was critical of Acosta’s consideration of the defense arguments, she\nconceded that the defense team’s tactics demonstrated effective advocacy. Certainly, throughout\nthe case, Epstein’s atorneys prepared lengthy memoranda analyzing the evidence and arguing\nnuanced legal points concerning federalism, the elements of numerous federal criminal statutes,\nand the evidence relevant to those statutes, but it is not unusual or unreasonable for prosecutors to\ncarefully consider well-crafted legal arguments from defense counsel.\n\nThere is litle question that Epstein’s extensive team of atorneys was able to obtain\nnegotiated benefits for Epstein—although the USAO never wavered from its three core\nrequirements, it did agree to a reduction in prison time from its original offer, and it granted Epstein\ncertain other concessions during the negotiations. Epstein’s wealth provided him with skilled,\nexperienced negotiators who continually sought various incremental concessions, and with\natorneys who knew hou to obtain Department review of a USAO mater, thereby delaying\nundesired outcomes for as long as possible.””? Despite Epstein’s evident intentions, houever, OPR\ndid not find evidence warranting a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the NPA or its terms resulted from the subjects’\nrelationships with the atorneys he had selected to represent him.\n\n2. The Subjects Asserted That Their Relationships with Defense Counsel\nDid Not Influence Their Actions\n\nAcosta, Menchel, Sloman, and Lourie each asserted that Epstein’s choice of counsel did\nnot affect his handling of the case. Menchel told OPR that once in private practice, former\ncolleagues often became adversaries. In Menchel’s view, such preexisting relationships were\nuseful because they afforded a defense atorney initial credibility and an insight into the issues a\nprosecutor would likely view as areas of concern, which enabled the defense atorney to “tailor”\narguments in a way that would maximize their persuasive impact on the USAO. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that these advantages did not “move the needle in any major way,” and he\n“reject[ed] the notion” that anyone in the USAO had been “swayed” because of preexisting\n223 As Chief Reiter later observed in his deposition testimony, “T]he Epstein case was an instance of a many\nmillion dollars defense and what it can accomplish.”\n\nl5l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l35l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021354.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l8o | 3536o38, Pagel82 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8o of 348\n\nMenchel told OPR that when he and Sanchez were in the USAO, they had a social\nrelationship, which included, in 2oo3, ‘‘a handful of dates over a period of two to three weeks. We\ndecided that . . . this was probably best not to pursue, and we mutually agreed to not do that.”?”°\nApart from that, he stated they were “close” and “hung out,” and he asserted that this was knoun\nin the office at the time. Menchel said that his relationship with Sanchez “changed dramatically”\nwhen she left the office for private practice, and that by the time he became involved in the Epstein\ninvestigation, he had dated and married his wife, and his contact with Sanchez would “most likely”\nhave been at office events and when she atended his wedding.”*’ Menchel added, “[T]hat was\nthree and a half years [prior] for a very brief period of time, and I don’t think I gave it a moment’s\nthought.”\n\nWhen asked by OPR about the basis for the decision to make an offer of a two-year term\nof incarceration, Menchel said that he did not recall discussions about the two-year offer and did\nnot recall hou the office arrived at that figure. In response to OPR’s question, Menchel stated that\nhis relationship with Sanchez did “[n]ot at all” affect his handling of the Epstein case. Moreover,\nMenchel asserted that the contemporaneous documentary record supports a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that it was\nAcosta, not Menchel, who made the decision to resolve the case with the two-year term.\n\nOPR carefully considered the documentary record on this point, as well as the statements\nto OPR from Menchel, Villafafia, Sloman, and Acosta, and concludes that there is no evidence\nsupporting the suggestion that the plea was instigated by Menchel as a favor to defense counsel.\nThe USAO’s first plea overture to defense counsel, which took place sometime before June 26,\n2oo7, occurred when Menchel spoke with Sanchez about the possibility of resolving the federal\ncase with a state plea that required jail time and sexual offender registration. According to the\nemail, “[i]t was a non-starter” for the defense. In the lengthy email exchange with Villafafia in\nearly July 2oo7, Menchel told her that his discussion with Sanchez about a state-based resolution\nwas made with Acosta’s “full knouledge.” Acosta corroborated this statement, telling OPR that\nalthough he did not remember a specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based\nresolution, he was certain Menchel would not have discussed this potential resolution with defense\ncounsel “without having discussed it with me.” Moreover, the defense did not immediately\n226 Acosta, Sloman, and Lourie each told OPR that in 2oo7, he was not aware that Menchel had previously dated\nSanchez. OPR questioned the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer regarding whether Menchel had an\nobligation to inform his supervisors of his dating relationship. The Professional Responsibility Officer said that it\nwould depend on “hou long the relationship was and hou compromised the individual felt he might appear to be,”\nbut he would have expected Menchel to raise the issue with Acosta. The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR\nthat if he had been approached for advice at the time, he would have asked for more facts, but “[g]iven the sensitivity\nof the [Epstein] mater, [my advice] would probably have been to tell him to step back and let somebody else take it\nover.” Menchel told OPR that if his relationship with Sanchez had turned into something more than a handful of\ndates, he would have advised his supervisors. Although OPR does not conclude Menchel’s prior relationship with\nSanchez influenced the Epstein investigation, OPR assesses that it would have been prudent for Menchel to have\ninformed his supervisors so they could make an independent assessment as to whether his continued involvement in\nthe Epstein investigation might create the appearance of a loss of impartiality.\neet Menchel’s Outlook records also indicate he scheduled lunch with Sanchez on at least one occasion, in early\n2oo6, after she left the USAO.\n\n228 In addition, Villafafia recalled Menchel stating at the July 26, 2oo7 meeting that “Alex has decided to offer\na two year state deal.”\nl54\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l354", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021359.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON ARS 3536o38, Pagel87 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l85 of 348\n\nThe meeting of USAO representatives and Epstein’s defense atorneys, together with the\nState Atorney and the lead state prosecutor on September l2, 2oo7, was a necessary part of the\nNPA negotiation process.\n\nEven after the NPA was signed, the defense continued to request meetings and reviews of\nthe case, both within the USAO and by the Department’s Criminal Division and the Deputy\nAtorney General. Although limited reviews were granted, during this period there was only one\nsubstantive meeting with Acosta, on December l4, 2oo7.7? This meeting occurred in lieu of the\nmeeting Starr had requested of Assistant Atorney General Fisher, most likely because the defense\nsubmissions to the Department’s Criminal Division had raised issues not previously raised with\nthe USAO and the Department determined that Acosta should address those in the first instance.7°?\nAcosta told OPR that he did not ask for the Department review, but he also did not want to appear\nas if he “fear[ed]” that review. Acosta’s nuanced position, houever, was not clear to the\nDepartment atorneys who responded to Epstein’s appeals and who perceived Acosta to be in favor\nof a Department review, rather than merely tolerant of it. Notably, though, none of those meetings\nor reviews resulted in the USAO abandoning the NPA, and Epstein gained no substantial\nadvantage from his continued entreaties.\n\nIn sum, in evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered the number of meetings, their\npurpose, the content of the discussions, and decisions made afterwards. OPR cannot say that the\nnumber of meetings, particularly those occurring before the NPA was signed, was so far outside\nthe norm—for a high profile case with skilled defense atorneys—that the quantity of meetings\nalone shous that the subjects were motivated by improper favoritism. In evaluating the subjects’\nconduct, OPR considered that the meetings were held with different levels of USAO managers and\nthat the explanations for the decisions to participate in the meetings reflected reasonable strategic\ngoals. Although OPR cannot rule out the possibility that because Acosta, Menchel, Lourie, or\nSloman knew or knew of the defense atorneys, they may have been willing to meet with them, it\nis also true that prosecutors routinely meet with defense atorneys, including those who are knoun\nto them and those who are not. Furthermore, meetings are more likely to occur in high profile\ncases involving defendants with the financial resources to hire skilled defense counsel who request\nmeetings at the highest levels of the USAO and the Department. Most significantly, OPR did not\nfind evidence supporting a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the meetings themselves resulted in any substantial\nbenefit to the defense. At each meeting, defense counsel strongly pressed the USAO—on factual,\nlegal, and policy grounds—to forgo its federal investigation and to return the mater to the state to\nproceed as it saw fit. The USAO never yielded on that point. Accordingly, OPR did not find\nevidence supporting a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia met with\ndefense counsel for the purpose of benefiting Epstein or that the meetings themselves caused\nAcosta or the other subjects to provide improper benefits to Epstein.\nane Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz is discussed separately in the follouing section.\n233 Starr and other defense atorneys only obtained one meeting at the Department level, with Deputy Assistant\nAtorney General Mandelker and CEOS Chief Oosterban in March 2oo8. Although Starr requested a meeting with\nAssistant Atorney General Fisher and another with Deputy Atorney General Filip, those requests were not granted.\n\nl59\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l359", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021375.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3ol 3536o38, Page2o3 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ol of 348\nEpstein’s state guilty plea.°? As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in\nthis manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding circumstances, his decision to\ndo so reflected poor judgment. Acosta’s application of Petite policy principles was too expansive,\nhis view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrou, and his understanding of\nthe state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.”\n\nB. The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcerns about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was completed. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.*°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n2o Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\n424 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n258 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstein and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l375", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021379.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3o5 3536o38, Page2o7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o5 of 348\n\nTo be clear, OPR is not suggesting that prosecutors must obtain all available evidence\nbefore reaching plea agreements or that prosecutors cannot reasonably determine that reaching a\nresolution is more beneficial than continuing to litigate evidentiary issues. Every case is different\nand must be judged on its oun facts. In this case, houever, given the unorthodox nature of the\nstate-based resolution, the fact that Acosta’s decision to pursue it set the case on a wholly different\ntrack than what had been originally contemplated by his experienced staff, the nature and scope of\nEpstein’s criminal conduct, the circumstances surrounding the removal of the computers from\nEpstein’s residence, and the potential for obtaining evidence revealing serious additional criminal\nconduct, Acosta had a responsibility to ensure that he was fully informed about the consequences\nof pursing the course of action that he proposed and particularly about the consequences flouing\nfrom the express terms of the NPA. In deciding to resolve the case pre-charge, Acosta lost sight\nof the bigger picture that the investigation was not completed and viable leads remained to be\npursued. The decision to forgo the government’s efforts to obtain the computer evidence and to\npursue significant investigative steps should have been made only after careful consideration of\nall the costs and benefits of the proposed action. OPR did not find evidence that Acosta fully\nconsidered the costs of ending the investigation prematurely.”°>\n\nC. OPR Was Unable to Determine the Basis for the Two-Year Term of\n\nIncarceration, That It Was Tied to Traditional Sentencing Goals, or That It\nSatisfied the Federal Interest in the Prosecution\n\nThe heart of the controversy surrounding the Epstein case is the apparent undue leniency\nafforded him concerning his sentence. After offering a deal that required a “non-negotiable”\n24-month term of incarceration, Acosta agreed to resolve it for an l8-month term of incarceration,\nknouing that gain time would reduce it further, and indeed, Epstein served only l3 months.\nEpstein ultimately did not serve even that minimal sentence incarcerated on a full-time basis\nbecause the state alloued Epstein into its work release program within the first four months of his\nsentence. As Lourie told OPR, “[E]verything else that happened to [Epstein] is exactly what\nshould have happened to him... . He had to pay a lot of money. He had to register as a sex\noffender,” but “in the perfect world, [Epstein] would have served more time in jail.”\n\nDue to the passage of time and the subjects’ inability to recall many details of the relevant\nevents, OPR was unable to develop a clear understanding of hou the original two-year sentence\nrequirement was developed or by whom. Two possibilities were articulated during OPR’s subject\ninterviews: (l) the two years represented the sentence Epstein would have received had he pled\nguilty to an unspecified charge originally contemplated by the state; or (2) the two years\nrepresented the sentence the USAO determined Epstein would be willing to accept, thus avoiding\nthe need for a trial. As to the former possibility, Acosta told OPR that his “best understanding” of\nthe two-year proposal was that it correlated to “one of the original state charges.” He elaborated,\na8 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney objected to OPR’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that Acosta knew or\nshould have knoun about the litigation regarding the computers and that he should have given greater consideration\nto pursuing the computers before the NPA was signed. Acosta’s atorney asserted that Acosta was not involved in\nthat level of “granularity”; that his ““‘small thoughts’ edits” on the NPA were limited and focused on policy; and that\nit was appropriate for him to rely on his staff to raise any issues of concern to him. For the reasons stated above, OPR\nnonetheless concludes that having developed a unique resolution to a federal investigation, Acosta had a greater\nobligation to understand and consider what the USAO was giving up and the appropriateness of doing so.\n\nl79\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l379", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021381.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 3o7 3536o38, Page2o9 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o7 of 348\nindictment. Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal charges were not appropriate and\ndefense counsel’s efforts to minimize the amount of time Epstein would spend in jail, it is\nquestionable whether Epstein would have accepted such a plea offer, but the USAO did not even\nextend the offer to determine what his response to it would be.\n\nWeighed against possible loss at trial were some clear advantages to a negotiated resolution\nthat ensured a conviction, including sexual offender registration and the opportunity to establish a\nmechanism for the victims to recover damages. These advantages, added to Acosta’s concern\nabout intruding on the state’s authority, led him to the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that a two-year state plea would\nbe sufficient to prevent manifest injustice. Menchel told OPR, “I don’t believe anybody at the\ntime that this resolution was entered into was looking at the two years as a fair result in terms of\nthe conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not if we took this case to\ntrial, would we risk losing everything?”\n\nDuring the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept\na plea for an l8-month sentence, a reduction of six months from the original “non-negotiable” two-\nyear term. The subjects did not have a clear memory of why this reduction was made. Villafafia\natributed it to a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, but Acosta atributed it to a decision\nmade during the negotiating process by Villafafia and Lourie, telling OPR that he understood his\natorneys needed flexibility to reach a final deal with Epstein.\n\nOPR found no contemporaneous documents shouing the basis for the two-year term.\nDespite extensive subject interviews and review of thousands of contemporaneous records, OPR\nwas unable to determine who initially proposed the two-year term of incarceration or why that\nterm, as opposed to other possible and lengthier terms, was setled on for the initial offer. The\nterm was not tied to statutory or guidelines sentences for potential federal charges or, as far as\nOPR could determine, possible state charges. Furthermore, while the USAO initially informed the\ndefense that the two-year term was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that position and\nrather than a “floor” for negotiations, it became a “ceiling” that was further reduced during the\nnegotiations. OPR was unable to find any evidence indicating that the term of incarceration was\ntied either to the federal interest in seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, or to other\ntraditional sentencing factors such as deterrence, either of Epstein or other offenders of similar\ncrimes. Instead, as previously noted, it appears that Acosta primarily considered only a\npunishment that was somewhat more than that to which the state had agreed. As a result, the\nUSAO had litle room to maneuver during the negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling to\nenforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term of incarceration\nthat was not much more than what the state had initially sought and which was significantly\ndisproportionate to the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.\n\nIn sum, it is evident that Acosta’s desire to resolve the federal case against Epstein led him\nto arrive at a target term of incarceration that met his oun goal of serving as a “backstop” to the\nstate, but that otherwise was untethered to any articulable, reasonable basis. In assessing the case\nonly through the lens of providing a “backstop” to the state, Acosta failed to consider the need for\na punishment commensurate with the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct and the federal interest in\naddressing it.\n\nl8l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l38l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021384.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lo. 3536o38, Page2l2 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2lo of 348\nwhich Villafafia and Lourie believed that the state had intentionally failed to aggressively pursue\na broader state indictment.\n\nOne example illustrates this communication gap. In a September 2o, 2oo7 email to Lourie\nasking him to read the latest version of the proposed “hybrid” federal plea agreement (calling for\nEpstein to plead to both state and federal charges), Acosta noted, “I don’t typically sign plea\nagreements. We should only go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement. I\ndidn’t even sign the public corruption or [C]ali cartel agreements, so this should not be the first.”\n(Emphasis added.) In his email to Villafafia, Lourie atached Acosta’s email and instructed\nVillafafia to “change the signature block to your name and send as final to Jay [Lefkouitz].”\n(Emphasis added.) Villafafia raised no objection to signing the agreement. Acosta told OPR that\nhe wanted to give the “trial team” a chance to “speak up and let him knou” if they did not feel\ncomfortable with the agreement. Villafafia, houever, told OPR that she did not understand that\nshe was being given an opportunity to object to the agreement; rather, she believed Acosta wanted.\nher to sign it because he was taking an “‘arm’s length” approach and signaling this “was not his\ndeal.” The fact that the top decision maker believed he was giving the line AUSA an opportunity\nto reflect and stop the process if she believed the deal was inappropriate, but the line AUSA\nbelieved she was being ordered to sign the agreement because her boss wanted to distance himself\nfrom the decision, reflects a serious communication gap.\n\nAs another example, at one point, Villafafia, frustrated and concerned about the decisions\nbeing made concerning a possible resolution, requested a meeting with Acosta; in a sternly worded\nrebuke, Menchel rejected the request. Although Menchel told OPR that he was not prohibiting\nVillafafia from speaking to Acosta, Villafafia interpreted Menchel’s email to mean that she could\nnot seek a meeting with Acosta. As a consequence, Acosta made his decision about a state\nresolution and the term of incarceration without any direct input from Villafafia. Acosta told OPR\nthat he was unaware that Villafafia had sought a meeting with him and he would have met with\nher if she had asked him directly. OPR did not find any writen evidence of a meeting involving\nboth Acosta—the final decision maker—and Villafafia—the person most knouledgeable about the\nfacts and the law—before Acosta made his decision to resolve the case through state charges or to\noffer the two-year term, and Villafafia said she did not have any input into the decision. Although\na U.S. Atorney is certainly not required to have such direct input, and it may be that Menchel\npresented what he believed to be Villafafia’s views, OPR found no evidence that Acosta was aware\nof Villafafia’s strong views about, and objections to, the proposed resolution.”°°\n\nTwo logistical problems hindered effective communication. First, the senior managers\ninvolved in the case—Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel—had offices located in Miami, while the\noffices of the individuals most familiar with facts of the case—Villafafia and, to a lesser extent,\nLourie—were located in West Palm Beach. Consequently, Villafafia’s discussions with her senior\n#9o In her 2ol7 Declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that, given the challenges of obtaining\nvictims’ cooperation with a federal prosecution, “I believed and still believe that a negotiated resolution of the mater\nwas in the best interests of the [USAO] and the victims as a whole. The [USAO] had also reached that same\n<span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>.” Several subjects pointed to this statement as indicating that Villafafia in fact supported the NPA. In her\nOPR interview, houever, Villafafia drew a distinction between resolving the investigation through negotiations that\nled to what in her view was a reasonable outcome, which she would have supported, and “this negotiated resolution” —\nthat is, the NPA—which she did not support.\n\nl84\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l384", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021389.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON IBS 3536o38, Page2l7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l5 of 348\nCHAPTER THREE\nISSUES RELATING TO THE GOVERNMENT?’S INTERACTIONS\nAND COMMUNICATIONS WITH VICTIMS\nPART ONE: FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nI.

A timeline of key events is provided on the follouing page.\n\nI. THE CVRA, l8 U.S.C. § 377l\n\nA, History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.” Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7°!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.”*°” The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n2oo President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub.

FBI Victim Notification Pamphlets\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines recommended that “victims be given a printed brochure or card that\nbriefly describes their rights and available services . . . and [contact information for] the victim-\nwitness coordinator or specialist....” At the time of the Epstein investigation, FBI agents\nnationwide routinely folloued a practice of providing victims with pamphlets entitled, “Help for\nVictims of Crime” and “The Department of Justice Victim Notification System.” The “Help for\nVictims of Crime” pamphlet contained a listing of the eight CVRA rights. The pamphlet stated:\n“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime,\nand it will be the responsibility of the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you\nare afforded those rights.” The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided\nvictims with the FBI pamphlet upon the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> of an interview. The pamphlet entitled “The\nDepartment of Justice Victim Notification System” provided an overview of the VNS and\ninstructions on hou to access the system.\n\nV. THE INTRODUCTORY USAO AND FBI LETTERS TO VICTIMS\n\nA. August 2oo6: The FBI Victim Notification Leters\n\nOn August 8, 2oo6, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim\nSpecialist for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim\nNotification Form” naming 3o victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional\npertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.?” Thereafter, the Victim Specialist\nentered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS\nwhenever the case agent directed the Victim Specialist to generate an initial leter to a particular\nvictim. The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim notification was “always handled by the\n[FBI’s Victim Specialist].”?”\n\nAccording to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2oo6, the FBI Victim Specialist\nused the VNS to generate FBI leters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the\neight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive\ncurrent status information about the mater. The FBI leters described the case as “currently under\ninvestigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued\npatience while we conduct a thorough investigation.” The leters also stated that some of the\nCVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment: “We will make our best efforts\nto ensure you are accorded the rights described. Most of these rights pertain to events occurring\nafter the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the responsibility\nof the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you are accorded those rights.” A\nsample leter follous.\nas These 3o were drawn from the PBPD investigative file and included individuals that the PBPD had not\ndesignated as victims and individuals the PBPD had identified but not interviewed.\naH The case agent told OPR, “[O]nce we identify a victim, then we bring [the FBI Victim Specialist] in, and as\nfar as anything pertaining to victim rights .. . and any resources, federal resources these victims may need comes from\n[her], the Victim Specialist.”\n\nl96\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l396", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021400.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 356. 3536o38, Page228 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 226 of 348\n[A]s Chief of the Criminal Division of the USAO, I did not consider\nit to be within my purview to ensure that appropriate victim\nnotifications occurred in every mater investigated or brought by the\nOffice. I also recall that the USAO employed one or more victim-\nwitness coordinators to work with line prosecutors to ensure that\nappropriate victim notifications occurred in every mater\n\ninvestigated or brought by the Office.\n\nC. USAO and FBI Leters Are Hand Delivered\n\nThe FBI case agent told OPR that the FBI made its notifications “at the time that we met\n[with] the girls.” The case agent recalled that she hand delivered the USAO leters and FBI leters\nto some victims follouing in-person interviews, and in the instances when she did not provide a\nvictim with a leter, she provided an FBI pamphlet containing CVRA rights information similar to\nthat set forth in the FBI leters.78° The co-case agent also recalled that he may have delivered “a\nfew” leters to victims. The FBI Victim Specialist told OPR that she mailed some FBI leters to\nvictims and she provided some FBI leters to the case agent for hand delivery.\n\nNevertheless, the case agent told OPR that she “did not sit there and go through every\nright” with the victims. She stated, houever, “[I]n the beginning whether it was through [the FBI\nVictim Specialist] giving the leter, me giving a leter, the pamphlet, I believed that the girls knew\nthat they were victims and had rights, and they had a resource, [the FBI Victim Specialist], that\nthey could call for that.” The FBI case agent further explained that once the case agents connected\nthe FBI Victim Specialist with each victim, the Victim Specialist handled the victims’ “rights and\nresources.”\n\nVI. AUGUST 2oo6 - SEPTEMBER 2oo7: FBI AND USAO CONTACTS WITH\n\nVICTIMS BEFORE THE NPA IS SIGNED\n\nEarly in the investigation, Villafafia informed her supervisors that, up to that point,\n“everyone whom the agents have spoken with so far has been willing to tell her story. Geting\nthem to tell their stories in front of a jury at trial may be much harder.” Between August 2oo6 and\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the FBI case agents interviewed 22 victims. On\na few occasions, Villafafia met with victims together with the FBI. Villafafia’s May l, 2oo7 draft\nindictment included substantive crimes against multiple victims, and Villafafia described the\ncircumstances of each of their encounters with Epstein in her prosecution memorandum.\n\nThere is some evidence indicating that during interviews, some of the victims expressed to\nthe FBI case agents and Villafafia concerns about participating in a federal trial of Epstein, and\nthose discussions touched upon, in broad terms, the victims’ views regarding the desired outcome\nof the investigation. Before the USAO entered into the NPA, houever, no one from the\n28o The case agent told OPR, “I remember giving leters to the girls when we would talk to them at .. . the\n<span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>, or... if I didn’t have the file on me[,] I had pamphlets in my car, or I made sure [the victims had contact\ninformation for the FBI’s Victim Specialist].”\n\n2oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4oo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021404.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 33o 3536o38, Page232 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23o of 348\n2. Villafafia Asserts That Her Supervisors Gave Instructions Not to\nConsult Victims about the Plea Discussions, but Her Supervisors Do\nNot Currently Recall Such Instructions\nVillafafia told OPR that during an “early” meeting with Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel,\nwhich took place when “we were probably just entering into plea negotiations,” she raised the\ngovernment’s obligation to confer with victims.”** Initially, Villafafia told OPR she was\ninstructed, “Don’t talk to [the victims]. Don’t tell them what’s happening,” but she was not told\nwhy she should not speak to the victims, and she could not recall who gave her this instruction. In\na subsequent OPR interview, Villafafia recalled that when she raised the issue of notification\nduring the meeting, she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential. You can’t disclose them.”?*?\nVillafafia remained uncertain who gave her this instruction, but believed it may have been Acosta.\nNeither Acosta, Sloman, nor Menchel recalled a meeting at which Villafafia was directed\nnot to notify the victims. Acosta told OPR that the decision whether to solicit the victims’ view\n“ig something [that] I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I was focused\non at least at this time,” and he did not “recall discussions about victim notification until after the\nNPA was signed.” Sloman also told OPR that he did not recall a meeting at which victim\nnotification was discussed. Menchel wrote in his response to OPR, “I have no recollection of any\ndiscussions or decisions regarding whether the USAO should notify victims of its intention to enter\ninto a pre-charge disposition of the Epstein mater.” Furthermore, Menchel told OPR he could not\nthink of a reason why the issue of victim notification would have arisen before he left the USAO,\nbecause “we were way off from finalizing or having anything even close to a deal,” and it would\nhave been “premature” to consider notification.?”°\n3. September 6, 2oo7: Villafafia Informs Sloman, Who Informs Acosta,\nof Oosterban’s Opinion That Consultation with Victims Was\nRequired\nOn September 6, 2oo7, in a lengthy email to Sloman responding to his question about the\ngovernment’s then-pending offer to the defense, Villafafia raised the victim consultation issue,\nadvising that, “the agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which as\n[CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law” and that “the [PBPD]\n288 Villafafia could not recall the specific date of the meeting, but Menchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7.\n288 Villafafia also recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations could cause\nvictims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.”\n22o In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel reiterated his contention that Villafafia’s claim\nabout a meeting involving Menchel in which she was instructed not to consult with victims was inaccurate and\ninconsistent with other evidence. OPR carefully considered the comments but did not conclude that the evidence to\nwhich Menchel’s atorney pointed necessarily refuted Villafafia’s assertion that she had received an instruction from\na supervisor not to inform victims about the plea negotiations. Houever, it is also true that OPR did not find any\nreference in the emails and other documents dated before the NPA was signed to a meeting at which victim\nconsultation was discussed or to a specific instruction not to consult with the victims. This is one of several events\nabout which Menchel and Villafafia disagreed, but given OPR’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the Department did not require\nprosecutors to consult with victims before charges were brought, OPR does not reach a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> regarding the\nalleged meeting and instruction.\n2o4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021408.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 334 3536o38, Page236 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 234 of 348\ninvolved in such notifications. According to Villafafia, Sloman then directed her to have the case\nagents make the victim notifications.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia directed the case agents to “meet with the victims to provide them\nwith information regarding the terms of the [NPA] and the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> of the federal investigation.”\nThe case agent told OPR, “[T]here was a discussion that Marie and I had as\nto... hou we would tell them, and what we would tell them, and what that was I don’t recall, but\nit was the terms of the agreement.” Villafafia believed that if “victims were properly notified of\nthe terms [of the NPA] that applied to them, regarding their right to seek damages from [Epstein],\nand he paid those damages, that the rest of the [NPA] doesn’t need to be disclosed.” Villafafia\n“anticipated that [the case agents] would be able to inform the victims of the date of the state court\nchange of plea [hearing], but that date had not yet been set by state authorities at the time the first\nvictims were notified [by the FBI].” Villafafia told OPR that it was her belief that because the\nUSAO had agreed to a confidentiality clause, the government could not disclose the NPA to the\ngeneral public, but victims could be informed “because by its terms they needed to be told what\nthe agreement was about.” Villafafia told OPR that no one in her supervisory chain expressed a\nconcern that if victims learned of the NPA, they would try to prevent Epstein from entering a plea.\n\nWithin a week after the NPA was signed, news media began reporting that the parties had\nreached a deal to resolve the Epstein case. For example, on October l, 2oo7, the\nNew York Post reported that Epstein “has agreed to plead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes\nat his Florida mansion in a deal that will send him to prison for about l8 months,” and noted that\nEpstein would plead guilty in state court and that “the feds have agreed to drop their probe into\npossible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge.”°”!\n\nThe case agent recalled informing some victims that “there was an agreement reached” and\n“we would not be pursuing this federally.” In October 2oo7, for example, the case agents met with\nvictim Courtney Wild, “to advise her of the main terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement.”\nAccording to the case agent, during that meeting, the case agents told Wild “that an agreement had\nbeen reached, Mr. Epstein was going to plead guilty to two state charges, and there would not be\na federal prosecution.”°°” Houever, in a declaration filed in 2ol5 in the CVRA litigation, Wild\ndescribed the conversation differently:\n\n[T]he agents explained that Epstein was also being charged in State\n\ncourt and may plea [sic] to state charges related to some of his other\n\nvictims.

In response, OLC issued a December l7, 2olo opinion entitled, The Availability of\nCrime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4. Based on the CVRA’s\nlanguage, relevant case law, and memoranda opinions from Department components, OLC\nreaffirmed its 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that CVRA rights do not vest until a criminal charge has been filed\n(by complaint, information, or indictment) and the rights cease to be available if “all charges are\ndismissed either voluntarily or on the merits (or if the [g]overnment declines to bring formal\ncharges after the filing of a complaint).”>”*\n\nAfter OLC issued its opinion, the Department revised the 2oo5 Guidelines in October 2oll\nbut did not change its fundamental position that the CVRA rights did not vest until after criminal\ncharges were filed.

Nonetheless, Villafafia told OPR that, while there were\nvalid reasons for the government’s position that CVRA rights do not apply pre-charge, “[T]his is\na case where I felt we should have done more than what was legally required. I was obviously\nprepared to spend as much time, energy and effort necessary to meet with each and every [victim].”\n\nOver the course of the litigation, the district court made various rulings interpreting the\nprovisions of the CVRA, including the court’s key <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that victim CVRA rights “atach\nbefore the Government brings formal charges against a defendant.” The court also held that\n(l) “the CVRA authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a\nnon-prosecution agreement, reached in violation of a prosecutor’s conferral obligations under the\nstatute”; (2) the CVRA authorizes the seting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements”;\n(3) the CVRA’s “reasonable right to confer” “extends to the pre-charge state of criminal\ninvestigations and proceedings”; (4) the alleged federal sex crimes commited by Epstein render\nthe Doe petitioners “victims” under the CVRA; and (5) “questions pertaining to [the] equitable\ndefense[s] are properly left for resolution after development of a full evidentiary record.”\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the petitioners’ Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, ruling that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about its\nintention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” The government did not\ndispute the fact that it did not confer with the petitioners prior to signing the NPA, and the court\nconcluded that “[a]t a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform Petitioners\nthat it intended to enter into an agreement not to prosecute Epstein.” The court found that the post-\nNPA leters the government sent to victims describing the investigation as ongoing “misled the\nvictims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material\nomission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an\ninvestigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.””?*°\n\nThe court relied on Dean and BP Products to support its holding and noted that the\ngovernment’s action with respect to the NPA was especially troubling because, unlike a plea\nagreement for which the victims could voice objection at a sentencing hearing, ‘“‘[o]nce an NPA is\nentered into without notice, the mater is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard\nregarding any aspect of the case.” The court also highlighted the inequity of the USAO’s failure\nto communicate with the victims while it simultaneously engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with\nEpstein’s counsel and assured the defense that the NPA would not be “made public or filed with\nthe Court.”\n\nAlthough the USAO defended its actions by citing the 2oo5 Guidelines for the\nDepartment’s position that CVRA rights do not atach until after a defendant is charged, the court\nwas “not persuaded that the [G]Juidelines were the basis for the Government’s decision to withhold\ninformation about the NPA from the victims.” The court found that the government’s reliance on\n386 The court did not resolve the factual question as to whether the victims were given adequate notice of\nEpstein’s state court plea hearing.\n\n243\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l445", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021459.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 383 3536o39, Page29 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 283 of 348\nand consider victims’ views about, prospective plea negotiations.*°* The “prosecution stage”\nbegan when charges were filed and continued through all post-sentencing legal proceedings.*”\n\nAt the time the parties signed the NPA in September 2oo7, few courts had addressed victim\nstanding under the CVRA.

The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*’* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\nad The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative)” and “Under Investigation.”\nals After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n\n264\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l466", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021467.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Page37 of 2l7\nSA-29l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 29l of 348\nIV. ACOSTA’S DECISION TO DEFER TO THE STATE ATTORNEY’S\n\nDISCRETION WHETHER TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT EPSTEIN’S STATE\n\nCOURT PLEA HEARING DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR OR UNAMBIGUOUS\n\nSTANDARD; HOWEVER, ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY\n\nFAILING TO ENSURE THAT VICTIMS IDENTIFIED IN THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION WERE ADVISED OF THE STATE PLEA HEARING\n\nAs set forth in the factual discussion, within a few weeks of the NPA’s signing, it became\nclear that the defense team disagreed with, and strongly objected to, the government’s plan to\ninform victims of their ability to recover monetary damages from Epstein, under the l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 provision of the NPA, and about Epstein’s state court plea hearing. The USAO initially\ntook the position that it was obligated to, and intended to, inform victims of both the NPA,\nincluding the § 2255 provision, and Epstein’s change of plea hearing and sentencing, so that\nvictims who wanted to atend could do so.\n\nIn November and December 2oo7, Epstein’s atorneys challenged the USAO’s position\nregarding victim notification. Ultimately, Acosta made two distinct decisions concerning victim\nnotifications. Consistent with Acosta’s concerns about intruding into state actions, Acosta elected\nto defer to state authorities the decision whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing\npursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights requirements. Acosta also determined that the USAO\nwould notify victims about their eligibility to obtain monetary damages from Epstein under § 2255,\na decision that was implemented by leters sent to victims after Epstein entered his state pleas.\nThis decision, which postponed notification of the NPA until after Epstein entered his guilty pleas,\nwas based, at least in part, on Villafafia’s and the case agents’ strategic concerns relating to\npreserving the victims’ credibility and is discussed further in Section V, belou.\n\nIn this section, OPR analyzes Acosta’s decision to defer to the state the responsibility for\nnotifying victims of Epstein’s plea hearing and sentencing. OPR concludes that neither the CVRA\nnor the VRRA required the government to notify victims of the state proceeding and therefore\nAcosta did not violate any statutes or Department policy by deferring to the discretion of the State\nAtorney whether to notify victims of Epstein’s state guilty pleas and sentencing. Houever, OPR\nalso concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment because by failing to ensure that the state\nintended to and would notify victims of the federal investigation, he failed to treat victims\nforthrightly and with the sensitivity expected by the Department. Through counsel, Acosta\n“strongly disagree[d]” with OPR’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> and argued that OPR unfairly applied a standard\n“never before expected of any U.S. Atorney.” OPR addresses Acosta’s criticisms in the\ndiscussion belou.\n\nA, Acosta’s Decision to Defer to the State Atorney’s Discretion Whether to\n\nNotify Victims about Epstein’s State Court Plea Hearing Did Not Violate Any\nClear or Unambiguous Standard\n\nIn November 2oo7, Villafafia sought to avoid defense accusations of misconduct\nconcerning her interactions with the victims by preparing a writen notice to victims informing\nthem of the resolution of the federal case and of their eligibility for monetary damages, and inviting\nthem to appear at the state plea hearing. Villafafia and Sloman exchanged edits of the draft leter\nand, at Sloman’s instruction, she provided the draft to defense atorney Lefkouitz, who, in turn,\n\n265\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l467", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021480.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3o4 3536o39, Page5do of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o4 of 348\npreviously noted, there is some contemporaneous evidence supporting her assertion. Villafafia’s\nmention of the agreement, even if not described in specific terms, would have been sufficient to\napprise those victims of the status of the federal investigation.\n\nNevertheless, Villafafia did not recall discussing the NPA specifically or in general terms\nwith other victims interviewed at that time, nor did she do so with Edwards or any other victim’s\natorney. OPR therefore considered whether the omission of information about the existence of\nthe NPA during these interactions rose to the level of professional misconduct in violation of FRPC\n4-4.l or 4-8.4.44\n\nOPR evaluated Villafafia’s conduct in light of the comment to FRPC 4-4.l:\n\nA lawyer is required to be truthful when dealing with others on a\n\nclient’s behalf, but generally has no affirmative duty to inform an\n\nopposing party of relevant facts. A misrepresentation can occur if\n\nthe lawyer incorporates or affirms a statement of another person that\n\nthe lawyer knous is false. Misrepresentations can also occur by\n\npartially true but misleading statements or omissions that are the\n\nequivalent of affirmative false statements.\nThe victims and their atorneys were certainly not “opposing part[ies]” to the USAO, but the\ncomment indicates that the rule recognizes that omissions made during discussions with third\nparties, even of relevant facts, are not always treated as false statements.\n\nHere, the evidence does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made an affirmative false\nstatement to the victims or Edwards or that her omissions were “the equivalent of affirmative false\nstatements” about material facts. First, Villafafia told OPR that she believed the investigation was\nongoing and her statement to that effect truthful, and as discussed earlier in this Chapter, the\nevidence shous that Villafafia and the agents did continue to investigate the case until Epstein\nentered his guilty plea in state court in June 2oo8. Villafafia’s email correspondence with her\nsupervisors reflects her strong advocacy during that timeframe to declare Epstein in breach and to\ncharge him. The evidence similarly does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made any affirmative\nfalse statement to Edwards when she informed him of the state court plea, although she declined\nto provide additional information in response to his questions.*”\n\nSecond, in reaching its <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>, OPR considered the full context in which Villafafia\ninteracted with the victims and Edwards. Prosecutors routinely make decisions about what\ninformation will be disclosed to witnesses, including victims, for a variety of strategic reasons. In\nmany cases, prosecutors must make difficult decisions about providing information to witnesses,\n44l In Florida Bar v. Joy, the court affirmed a referee’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that Joy violated FRPCs 4-4.l(a) and 4-8.4(c)\n“for making false statements by omission of material facts in his representations [to counsel].” Florida Bar v. Joy,\n679 So. 2d ll65, ll66-68 (Fla. l996). See also Florida Bar re Webster, 647 So. 2d 8l6 (Fla. l994) (petition for\nreinstatement denied due to “misrepresentation by omission”).\nae In Feinberg, 76o So. 2d at 938, the court found that an Assistant State Atorney lacked candor and violated\nethics rules when, after meeting with a defendant outside his atorney’s presence, the prosecutor falsely stated to the\ndefense atorney that he (the prosecutor) had not met with the defendant.\n\n278\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l48o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021481.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3o5 3536o39, Pagedl of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o5 of 348\nand they often cannot fully reveal either the facts or the status of an investigation, even with\nvictims. The 2oo5 Guidelines advise that in consulting with a victim, prosecutors may be limited\nin their disclosures: “Because victims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government,\nand may disclose whatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only nonsensitive data and\npublic information.”*?\n\nVillafafia’s concern about generating potential impeachment evidence by informing\nvictims of their potential to recover monetary damages from Epstein was not unreasonable.\nIndeed, the case agents initially raised the impeachment issue, and after considering the problem,\nVillafafia agreed with the agents’ concerns. Villafafia raised those concerns with the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer in October 2oo7 after the agents brought the issue to her\natention, and she ultimately raised the issue with Sloman and Acosta as well, neither of whom\nadvised her that those concerns were improper or unsound. OPR also considered that although\nVillafafia had sought to notify the victims in writing of the NPA soon after it was signed, her\nsupervisor, the U.S. Atorney, had decided otherwise. When authorized to inform Edwards of the\nscheduled change of plea hearing, she did so. Although she did not inform Edwards that the plea\nwas part of a global resolution that would end the federal investigation, the evidence does not shou\nthat Villafafia acted for the purpose of deceiving Edwards or preventing him from atending the\nhearing. Had she sought to exclude him from the state proceedings, she could have elected not to\ninform Edwards at all, or she could have discouraged him from atending the state proceedings.\nRather, as Edwards confirmed, Villafafia told him the hearing was “important.” Villafafia sought\nto strike a difficult balance of securing Edwards’s (and his clients’) atendance at the state court\nplea, while obeying her management’s directive that informing victims of the resolution of the\nfederal investigation should not be done until completion of the state plea.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering all of the circumstances, OPR concludes that the\nevidence does not establish that Villafafia violated her obligations under FRPC 4-4.l or 4-8.4(c)\nor (d).4* Nonetheless, as discussed belou, Villafafia’s interactions with victims and victims’\natorneys without informing them of the NPA and the potential <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> of the federal\ninvestigation contributed to the likelihood that the victims would feel that the government was\n443 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV, 9 B.2.c(l). As noted, some victims continued to express favorable views of Epstein\nduring interviews with the government and they, or their atorneys, could have provided information to Epstein about\nthe government’s communications. For example, within a day of Villafafia contacting a victim’s atorney about a\npotential victim notification leter, Starr complained to Acosta that the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it was clear from the\ngirl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a victim.”\nee The case most directly on point is Smith, lo9 A.3d ll84, in which the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed\na violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) based on a prosecutor’s failure to notify the victim of the\nresolution of a sex abuse case. Houever, as noted previously, in Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea, and various specific statutes afforded victims the right to receive notices and an\nopportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or information in a circuit court.” In this case,\nfor the reasons previously discussed, Villafafia did not have a clear and unambiguous obligation to inform the victims\nor Edwards of the NPA.\n\n279\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l48l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021483.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3o7 3536o39, Paged3 of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o7 of 348\nVillafafia informed Edwards about the state plea, but did not mention the NPA or the fact that the\nstate pleas would resolve the federal investigation. Edwards then filed the CVRA petition and\nlearned about the NPA signed months earlier and that the federal investigation of Epstein had\nconcluded with Epstein’s state guilty pleas. Wild only received access to the NPA when a judge\npermited it in August 2oo8 pursuant to a protective order. After considering this series of\ninteractions, it is not surprising that Wild came away from the experience feeling confused and\nbelieving she had been misled.\n\nOPR did not find evidence supporting a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that Villafafia, Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, or Lourie opted not to consult with the victims in order to protect Epstein or shield the\nNPA from public scrutiny. Although neither Sloman nor Acosta could recall a specific discussion\nof CVRA obligations before the NPA was signed, both recalled knouing that victim consultation\nwas not required, and Menchel also told OPR that consultation was not required, at least not up to\nthe point when he left the USAO. The evidence is clear that Villafafia sought at various points to\nconsult with and to notify victims about the details of the NPA but was constrained before the\nNPA was signed by managers who either made a decision to not consult victims or did not address\nthe issue after it was raised, and after the signing by her oun concern about creating possible\nimpeachment evidence that would damage the victims’ credibility at a possible trial.\n\nNonetheless, a more open and straightforward approach with the victims, both before and\nafter the signing of the NPA, would have been the beter practice. Before the NPA was signed,\nvictims could have been asked for their views about the general terms the USAO was\ncontemplating offering, including that a plea to state charges was one of the options being\nconsidered; asked for their views in general about a guilty plea; or, at a minimum, asked to share\ntheir views of hou the case should be resolved. Even if the USAO ultimately determined to\nproceed with the NPA, the government would have had the benefit of the victims’ thoughts and\nconcerns, particularly on the issue of punishment, and victims would have felt included in the\nprocess. OPR found no evidence that the benefits of victim consultation were discussed or\nconsidered before the NPA was signed.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, no one from the government explained the agreement to the\nmajority of the victims until months later and only after the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea.\nAlthough the evidence supports Villafafia’s assertion that she acted from a good faith belief that\nEpstein might breach the NPA and a potential trial would be harmed if information about the NPA\nwas divulged to the victims and their counsel, she, Sloman, and Acosta failed to consider hou the\ndesire to shield the victims from that potential impeachment might impact the victims’ sense of\nthe openness and fairness of the process. As Wild stated during the CVRA litigation, she believed\nshe had been “mistreated in the process.” When deciding not to inform the victims of the NPA to\navoid creating impeachment evidence, Villafafia, Sloman, and Acosta do not appear to have\ncarefully considered possible alternatives to, or all of the ramifications of, that decision, nor did\nthey revisit the decision before Villafafia met the victims in person to discuss a potential trial or\nspoke to Edwards or other atorneys representing victims.**° Furthermore, more atention needed\na6 It is not at all clear whether a court would have permited impeachment of the victims concerning one\nprovision in a plea agreement that otherwise could not be used as evidence. See Fed. R. Crim. P. ll(f) (“The\nadmissibility or inadmissibility of a plea, a plea discussion, and any related statement is governed by Federal Rule of\nEvidence 4lo.”). In any case, the victims could have been impeached regarding the possibility of their obtaining\nmonetary damages through either a civil suit or through l8 U.S.C. § 2255 Gf Epstein were convicted after a trial),\n\n28l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l483", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021485.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ER 3o9 3536o39, Paged5 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o9 of 348\n<span class=\"highlight\">CONCLUSION</span>\n\nIn November 2ol8, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about\nstate and federal criminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that\nJeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier with residences in Florida, New York, and other United States\nand foreign locations, had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm\nBeach, Florida estate. The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials.

OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim notification and consultation.

In re Enter. Mort. Acceptance Co. Sec.\nLitig. (‘Enterprise’), 39l F.3d 4ol, 4o6-o8 (2d Cir.\n2oo4). Here, the text and history of Section 3283 estab-\nlish that Congress intended to extend the time to bring\ncharges of child sexual abuse in cases where the limi-\ntations period had not yet expired.\n\nPrior to 2oo3, any child sex abuse offense could be\nprosecuted until the victim reached the age of 25 years,\nat which point the statute of limitations then in effect\nwould bar prosecution. In the 2oo3 amendment, which\nwas titled, “No Statute of Limitations for Child Abduc-\ntion and Sex Crimes,” Pub. L. No. lo8-2l, § 2o2, ll7\nStat. 66o, Congress explicitly provided that “[n]o stat-\nute of limitations that would otherwise preclude pros-\necution for [such an offense] shall preclude such pros-\necution during the life of the child.” l8 U.S.C. § 32838\n(2oo3). The amendment draws no distinction between\npre-enactment and post-enactment conduct. Instead,\nas Judge Nathan explained, by stating that “no statute\nof limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecu-\ntion of these offenses will apply,” the amendment’s\n“plain language unambiguously requires that it apply\nto prosecutions for offenses commited before the date\nof enactment.” (A.l5l). Thus, the breadth of the text\nshous that Congress intended “to extend the ... stat-\nute of limitations,” even for pre-enactment conduct.\nUnited States v. Jeffries, 4o5 F.3d 682, 684 (8th Cir.\n2oo5) (reaching same <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> as to § 3283’s prede-\ncessor based on similar “title and ... wording” of stat-\nute); cf.

In ini-\ntially enacting a special statute of limitations for child\nsex abuse offenses, Congress sought to “mak[e] it eas-\nier to prosecute offenders who commit sex crimes that\nmay be difficult to detect quickly.” Weingarten, 865\nF.3d at 54. But that limitations period proved to be “in-\nadequate in many cases.” H.R. Conf. Rep. No. lo8-66,\nat 54. Tellingly, the conference report offered the ex-\nample of a child rapist who “could not be prosecuted”\nbecause he was “identified ... as the perpetrator one\nday after the victim turned 25.” Jd. Given that Con-\ngress bemoaned those offenders who escaped prosecu-\ntion because the limitations period had expired, there\nis every reason to believe that it intended to preserve\nthe ability to prosecute pre-enactment offenders whose\nlimitations period had not yet expired. See United\nStates v. Sure Chief, 438 F.3d 92o, 924 (9th Cir. 2oo6)\n(concluding that in enacting the 2oo3 amendment,\n\n8 Maxwell’s only response regarding the statute’s\ntext is that the words “would” and “shall” are “forward-\nlooking.” (Br.54). But those words readily apply in de-\nscribing the application of the 2oo3 amendment to pre-\nenactment conduct. Consider an offense commited\nagainst a l6-year-old in the year 2ooo. The statute of\nlimitations then in effect indeed “would ... preclude\nprosecution” nine years in the future, once the victim\nturned twenty-five. The 2oo3 amendment ensured\nthat “[n]o” such “statute of limitations ... shall pre-\nclude such prosecution during the life of the child.”\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l695", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021698.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page5l of 93\n38\n\ncertain discrimination claims, and held that applying\nthe new statute in a case “filed after its enactment, but\narising out of events that predate its enactment,” is not\nimpermissibly retroactive under Landgraf. Id. at 889-\n9o. As the Court explained, “[t]he conduct to which the\nstatute of limitations applies is not the primary con-\nduct of the defendants, the alleged discrimination, but\nis instead the secondary conduct of the plaintiffs, the\nfiling of their suit.” Jd. at 89o. The 2oo3 amendment to\nSection 3283 likewise applies only to the secondary\nconduct of filing a criminal case; it does not apply to\nthe primary conduct of Maxwell’s child sexual abuse\nby, for example, modifying the elements of an offense\nto criminalize conduct that previously had not consti-\ntuted a crime. See id. at 89l (“Landgraf and other\ncases countenance treating statutes of limitations dif-\nferently from statutory provisions that affect substan-\ntive rights.”).

The District Court\nthen examined prospective jurors, asking them about\nquestions in the jury questionnaire that prospective\njurors had answered affirmatively. The District Court\nasked the prospective jurors whether the information\nor experiences resulting in the affirmative answer\nwould interfere with their ability to be fair and impar-\ntial.\n\nAt the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> of voir dire, the District Court\nqualified 58 jurors.

Similarly, a for-cause chal-\nlenge against Juror 5o would not have prevailed.\n\nOn appeal, Maxwell contends that, had Juror 5o\nanswered the questionnaire accurately, it “clearly”\nwould have provided a basis for a for-cause challenge.”\n(Br.67). In particular, Maxwell challenges Judge Na-\nthan’s finding that Juror 5o was credible and unbi-\nased, relying on a few isolated statements drawn from\nvarious parts of the hearing transcript and some of his\npost-verdict statements. (Br.7l-72). As described\nabove, Judge Nathan explained hou Juror 5o’s expla-\nnation for his erroneous answers was plausible and\nconsistent, and she found him credible after assessing\nhis demeanor through challenging questioning. She\nalso properly disregarded his post-verdict statements\nabout the case, explaining that “[a] juror’s view of a\ncase and defendant would necessarily change after\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l722", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021727.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page8o of 93\n67\nand specific sexual acts that took place in New York\nwhile Jane was a minor (Tr.3l9-2o).\n\nThe Government’s summation similarly discussed\nthese charges as encompassing conduct directed at\nNew York. As to Count Four, the Government argued\nthe evidence shoued “Jane was transported to New\nYork,” and Maxwell was involved in making travel ar-\nrangements. (Tr.289l (emphasis added)).

During trial, Judge Nathan granted defense re-\nquests for limiting instructions at the time evidence\ncame in to make clear that the charges focused on the\nintent that sexual activity take place in New York.\n(Tr.ll67-68 (Kate), 2o48-49 (Annie)).

Judge Nathan also instructed the\njury on one and only one predicate state offense: a vio-\nlation of N.Y. Penal Law § l3o.55. (Tr.3o34, 3o37). The\ninstructions on Count Three incorporated this discus-\nsion of the elements of Count Four, and the only stat-\nute identified was N.Y. Penal Law § l3o.55. (Tr.3o49-\n5o, 3o56-57).\n\nDuring deliberations, the jury sent the follouing\n\nnote:\nUnder Count Four, if the defendant aided\nin the transportation of Jane’s return\nflight, but not the flight to New Mexico\nwhere/if the intent was for Jane to en-\ngage in sexual activity, can she be found\nguilty under the second element?\n(Tr.3l26). The note led to a lengthy discussion, at the\n<span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> of which Judge Nathan determined she\nshould refer the jury back to the jury charge on the\nsecond element of Count Four because the jury note\nwas otherwise “too difficult to parse factually and le-\ngally.” (Tr.3l26-4o).\n\nThat night, Maxwell filed a leter seeking reconsid-\neration of Judge Nathan’s response and raising the\npossibility of a constructive amendment or prejudicial\nvariance because, in her view, the note shoued that\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l728", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021735.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page88 of 93\n75\n\nfloun to New York on Epstein’s private jet, corroborat-\ning her testimony on that point. (See Br.79 (citing GX-\n662-R at 44)). The same is true regarding Maxwell’s\ncomparison of Counts Two and Four: in Maxwell’s\nview, the jury rejected nearly all of the evidence of\nMaxwell’s enticement of Jane to New York for lack of\ncorroboration, and then convicted her based on an un-\nsupported speculative leap about arranging an uni-\ndentified return flight from New Mexico. That is not\nplausible, and it certainly is not a “substantially\nlikely” <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that can be drawn from an inscruta-\nble jury note.\n\nFor similar reasons, no variance occurred. As dis-\ncussed above, the proof at trial corresponded to the al-\nlegations in the Indictment, namely, evidence and ar-\ngument that Maxwell enticed and transported Jane to\nNew York in order to facilitate sexual abuse there.\nMaxwell was also well aware that the Government’s\nproof would include conduct in New Mexico. (See\nA.ll7, l2l-22, l26). Maxwell therefore had “fair and\nadequate notice” that the conspiracies included con-\nduct at Epstein’s New Mexico home, which is all that\nis required. United States v. Salmonese, 352 F.3d 6o8,\n622 (2d Cir. 2oo3). In any event, the Government pro-\nduced on November 6, 2o2l—more than three weeks\nbefore trial—notes from an interview with Jane de-\nscribing sexual abuse in New Mexico. That is suffi-\ncient.

Because that phrase “refers to a ‘minor victim,” it “suggest[s] factual details\nsurrounding the charged conduct.” Id. at l66. The Court also noted the absence of a\ntextual trigger for the categorical approach like “that has as an element.” Id. at l66\nn.7o. The Court further explained that its <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> was reinforced by legislative\nhistory, namely, the inclusion of Section 3l42(f)(l)(E) in a statute intended to “afford\nminor victims of crime the greatest degree of protection.” Id. at l66.\n\nThe Court contrasted Section 3l42(f)(l)(E) with another portion of the Act that\ncontains the word “involves” but requires use of the categorical approach, because\nthat text “refers, variously, to a ‘crime, an ‘offense, and a ‘felony,” indicating an em-\nphasis on the nature of the legal charge rather than “factual details.” Id.

OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency.

Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties.

The District Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">Conclusion</span> That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\n\nIx\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23oo9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023010.jpg": "find evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23olo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023012.jpg": "VI. ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA.

In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o24", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023026.jpg": "that the victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the\nDepartment.\nVI. ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o26", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023027.jpg": "TABLE OF CONTENTS\nIl.

Lourie forwarded a copy of the prosecution memorandum to\nMenchel. Lourie’s transmital message read:\n\nMarie did a 5o [sic] page pros memo in the Epstein case. I am going\n\nto start reading it tonight. ... It’s a major case because the target is\n\none of the richest men in the country and it has been big news. He\n\nhas a stable of atorneys, including Dershouitz, [Roy] Black,\n\nLefcourt, Lewis, and Lily [sic] Sanchez. Jeff Sloman is familiar\n\nwith the investigation. The state intentionally torpedoed it in the\n\ngrand jury so it was brought to us. I am going to forward the pros\n\nmemo to you so you can start reading it at the same time I do. The\n\nFBI is pushing to do it in Mid [sic] May, which I think is not critical,\n\nbut we might as well get a jump on it. I have some ideas about the\n\nindictment (needs to be ultra lean with only clean victims), so Tam\n\nnot sending that yet.\nLourie explained to OPR that by “clean” victims, he meant those for whom the defense did not\nhave impeachment evidence to use against them.\n\nA few days later, Lourie emailed Menchel, asking if Menchel had read the prosecution\nmemorandum. Lourie directed Menchel’s atention to particular pages of the prosecution\nmemorandum, noting that the “keys” were whether the USAO could prove that Epstein traveled\nfor the purpose of engaging in sexual acts, and the fact that some minor victims told Epstein they\nwere l8.3” Lourie asked for Menchel’s “very general opinion as to whether this is a case you think\nthe office should do,” and reminded Menchel that the State Atorney’s Office “went out of their\nway to get a no-bill on this . . . and thus only charged adult solicitation, which they would bargain\naway to nothing.”\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Menchel said that Lourie’s email transmiting the prosecution\nmemorandum was his “official introduction” to the case and at that point in time, he had never\nheard of Epstein and had no information about his background. He recalled that the USAO had\nbeen asked to review the case because the state had not handled it appropriately. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that he had litle memory about the facts of the case or what contemporaneous\nopinions he formed about it.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he could not recall whether he ever read Villafafia’s prosecution\nmemorandum, explaining that he “would typically rely on senior staff,’ who had more\nprosecutorial experience, and that instead of reading the memorandum, he may have discussed the\ncase with Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, who he assumed would have read the document. Acosta\n37 In various submissions to the USAO, the defense contended that the federal statute required proof that\nengaging in a sexual act was the “paramount or dominant purpose” of Epstein’s travel, but that Epstein’s travel was\nmotivated by his desire to live outside of New York for over half of each year for tax purposes. The defense also\nasserted that the federal statutes at issue required proof that the defendant knew the victims were under l8, but that\nEpstein “took affirmative steps to ensure that every woman was at least l8 years of age.” In her prosecution\nmemorandum, houever, Villafafia set forth her <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the statute only required proof that engaging in a sexual\nact was one of the motivating factors for the travel. She also concluded that the statutes did not require proof that the\ndefendant knew the victims were minors.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o64", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023068.jpg": "he is comfortable before proceeding.” Menchel told Villafafia he had “trouble understanding” why\nshe was in a “rush” “given hou long this case has been pending.”\n\nOPR questioned Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta about the timeline for reviewing\nthe prosecution memorandum and the proposed charges. Acosta and Menchel believed Villafafia’s\ntimeline was unrealistic from the start. Acosta told OPR that Villafafia was “very hard charging,”\nbut her timeline for filing charges in the case was “really, really fast.” Menchel described Villafafia\nas “out over her skis a litle bit” and “ahead of” Acosta in terms of his analysis of the case.*\nMenchel said it was clear to him that Acosta “was going to be the one making the call” about\nwhether to go forward with charges, and Acosta needed more time to make a decision. Menchel\ntold OPR, “This [was] not a case [we were] going to review in two weeks and make a decision\non.” Sloman told OPR that although he did not conduct a “granular review” of the proposed\ncharges, he believed Menchel and Lourie had done so and “obviously” had concluded that “the\nfacts and the law didn’t suggest that the right thing to do was to automatically indict.” Lourie told\nOPR that he believed “the case was moving ahead.”\n\nVillafafia continued to seek direction from her managers. On May l5, 2oo7, she emailed\nSloman, noting that “[i]t seemed from our discussion yesterday that pestering Alex [Acosta] will\nnot do any good. Am I right about that?” Sloman responded, “Yes.” On May 2l, 2oo7, three\nweeks after submiting the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia emailed Sloman and Menchel\nasking for “a sense of the direction where we are headed-i.e., approval of an indictment something\nlike the current draft, a complaint to allou for pre-indictment negotiations, an indictment\ndrastically different from the current draft?” Sloman responded only, “Taken care of.”\n\nD. Defense Counsel Seek a Meeting with Senior USAO Managers, which\n\nVillafaia Opposes\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein’s defense counsel continued to seek additional information about the\nfederal investigation and a meeting with senior USAO managers, including Acosta. In a May lo,\n2oo7 email to Menchel, Lourie reported that Epstein’s atorneys “want me to tell them the statutes\na Villafafia explained to OPR that the “rush” related to her concern that Epstein was continuing to abuse girls:\n“Tn terms of the issue of why the hurry, because child sex offenders don’t stop until they’re behind bars. That was our\ntime concern.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia offering this explanation to him. OPR\nnotes that in their respective statements to OPR and in their comments on OPR’s draft report, Menchel and Villafafia\nexpressed contradictory accounts or interpretations of certain events. When it was necessary for OPR to resolve those\nconflicts in order to reach its findings and conclusions, OPR considered the extensive documentary record and the\ntestimony of other subjects and witnesses, to the extent available.\n\n45 Sloman similarly recalled that Menchel thought Villafafia was “ahead of where the office was internally” and\nthat caused “discontent” between Villafafia and Menchel. Villafafia was not the only one, houever, who was surprised\nthat the indictment was not approved immediately. The case agent told OPR that it seemed “everything changed”\nafter Villafafia submited the prosecution memorandum, and the momentum touards an indictment abated. Villafafia’s\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that from her perspective, it appeared “Miami didn’t want the case prosecuted.”\nHouever, Menchel rebuked Villafafia in his July 5, 2oo7 email to her for having “led the agents to believe that [filing\ncharges in] this mater was a foregone <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>.”\n\n46 Sloman could not recall during his OPR interview what he meant by this remark, but he speculated that he\nhad spoken to Menchel, and Menchel was going to take care of it.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o68", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023073.jpg": "Lourie opined that the government could argue “that over time [Epstein] set up a network of illegal\nhigh school massage recruits that would be difficult to duplicate anywhere else,” which supported\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the massages must have been a motivating purpose of his travel, if not the sole\npurpose. Houever, Lourie expressed concern about “geting to the jury” on this issue and noted\nthat he had not found a legal case factually on point. Villafafia told OPR that she disagreed with\nLourie’s analysis of the purpose of travel issue and had discussed the mater with him. Villafafia\nalso recalled that there were aspects of the defense submissions she and her colleagues considered\n“particularly weak.”\n\nOn June 26, 2oo7, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, Villafafia, the case agent, and the West Palm\nBeach squad supervisor met at the Miami USAO with Epstein atorneys Dershouitz, Black,\nLefcourt, and Sanchez. Dershouitz led the defense team’s presentation. From the USAO\nperspective, the meeting was merely a “listening session.”°* Echoing the arguments made in\nLefcourt’s leter, Dershouitz argued that the USAO should permit the state to handle the case\nbecause these were “traditionally state offenses.” The case agent recalled being uncomfortable\nthat the defense was asking questions in an atempt to gain information about the federal\ninvestigation, including the number of victims and the types of sexual contact that had been\ninvolved.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when Epstein’s atorneys left the meeting, they appeared to be\n“under the impression that they had convinced us not to proceed.” But Menchel told OPR, “[T]hey\nobviously did not persuade” the USAO because “we . . . didn’t drop the investigation.” According\nto Villafafia, Lourie, and Menchel, during a short post-meeting discussion at which Lourie\nexpressed concern about the purpose of travel issue and Menchel raised issues related to general\ncredibility of the victims, the prevailing sense among the USAO participants was that the defense\npresentation had not been persuasive. Villafafia told OPR that she “left [the meeting] with the\nimpression that we were continuing touards” filing charges.\n\nIV. ACOSTA DECIDES TO OFFER EPSTEIN A TWO-YEAR STATE PLEA TO\n\nRESOLVE THE FEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nUSAO internal communications shou that in July 2oo7, Acosta developed, or adopted, the\nbroad outline of an agreement that could resolve the federal investigation. The agreement would\nleave the case in state court by requiring Epstein to plead guilty to state charges, but would\naccomplish three goals important to the federal prosecutors: Epstein’s incarceration; his\nregistration as a sexual offender; and a mechanism to provide for the victims to recover monetary\nms Villafafia also told OPR that Lourie had, at times, expressed concern about the prosecution’s ability to prove\nEpstein’s knouledge of the victims’ ages, particularly with regard to those who were l6 or l7 at the time they provided\nmassages.\n\n“4 In his writen response to OPR, Menchel indicated that he had no independent recollection of the June 26,\n2oo7 meeting. In his OPR interview, Menchel said that although he had litle memory of the meeting, to the best of\nhis recollection the USAO simply listened to the defense presentation, and in a contemporaneous email, Menchel\nopined that he viewed the upcoming June 26 meeting as “more as [the USAO] listening and them presenting their\nposition.”\n35\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o73", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023080.jpg": "Menchel’s reply email began with a rebuke:\nBoth the tone and substance of your email are totally inappropriate\nand, in combination with other maters in the past, it seriously calls\nyour judgment into question.\nAs you well knou, the US Atorney has not even decided whether\nto go forward with a prosecution in this mater, thus you should have\nrespected his position before engaging in plea negotiations.\nAlong that same line, despite whatever contrary representations you\nmade to the agents in this mater, it was made clear to you by the US\nAtorney and the First Assistant from the time when you were first\nauthorized to investigate Mr. Epstein that the office had concerns\nabout taking this case because of petit [sic] policy and a number of\nlegal issues. Despite being told these things, you prepared a pros\nmemo and indictment that included a definitive date for indictment.\nIt has come to my atention that you led the agents to believe that\nthe indictment of this mater was a foregone <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> and that our\ndecision to put off that date and listen to the defense atorneys’\nconcerns is indicative of the office having second thoughts about\nindicting. As you well knew, you were never given authorization\nby anyone to seek an indictment in this case.°°\nIn the email, Menchel went on to explain the circumstances of his conversation with\nSanchez and respond to Villafafia’s complaints:\nLilly Sanchez called me before, not after, the June 26th meeting. It\nwas an informal discussion and not in the nature of an official plea\noffer but rather a feeling out by both sides as to what it might take\nto resolve the mater. As you are also well aware, the only reason\nwhy this office even agreed to look into the Epstein mater in the\nfirst instance was because of concerns that the State had not done an\nadequate job in vindicating the victims’ rights. As you and the\nagents conceded, had Epstein been convicted of a felony that\nresulted in a jail sentence and sex offender status, neither the FBI\nnor our office ever would have interceded. You should also knou\nthat my discussion with Lilly Sanchez was made with the US\nAtorney’s full knouledge. Had Lilly Sanchez expressed interest in\npursuing this avenue further, I certainly would have raised it with all\nthe interested individuals in this case, including you and the agents.\nIn any event, I fail to see hou a discussion that went nouhere has\nhurt our bargaining position. I am also quite confident that no one\n66 Menchel also sent this message to Sloman and copied Lourie.\n42\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o8o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023082.jpg": "e-mail that I would like to address, and I also would like to address\nwhere we are in the case.\nFirst, I wanted to address the comment about jumping the chain of\ncommand.

If there is a particular instance of violating the chain\nof command that you would like to discuss, I would be happy to\ndiscuss it with you.\nThe statement that I have not respected Alex’s position regarding\nthe prosecution of the case demonstrates why you hear the\nfrustration in the tone of my e-mail. For two and a half months I\nhave been asking about what that position is. I have asked for\ndirection on whether to revise the indictment, whether there are\nother issues that Alex wants addressed prior to deciding, whether\nthere is additional investigation that needs to be done, etc. None of\nthat direction has been forthcoming, so I am left with . . . victims,\nand agents all demanding to knou why we aren’t presenting an\nindictment. Perhaps that lack of direction is through no fault of\nyours, but I have been dealing with a black box, so I do not knou to\nwhom I should address my frustration. My recollection of the\noriginal meeting with Alex and Jeff is quite different than your\nsummary. In that meeting, I summarized the case and the State\nAtorney’s Office’s handling of it.

I have already told Jay that the PSI language . . . was\nunacceptable to our office.” Of even greater significance, in a follou-up email, Villafafia noted\nthat the defense had removed both the requirement that Epstein plead to a registrable offense and\nthe entire provision relating to monetary damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn the afternoon, Villafafia circulated her oun proposed “hybrid” plea agreement, first\ninternally to the management team with a note stating that it “contains the l8/l2 split that Jay and\nAndy agreed to,” and then to Lefkouitz. Regarding the prosecution of other individuals, she\nincluded the follouing provision: “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability of the\ndefendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal\nconduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement,” including\nbut not limited to the conspiracy to solicit minors to engage in prostitution.\n\nIn her email to Lefkouitz, transmiting the plea agreement, Villafafia wrote:\n\nCould you share the atached draft with your colleagues.

Acosta replied, “I don’t think I should be part of negotiations. I’d rather leave it to you\nif that’s ok.” Acosta told OPR that “absent truly exceptional circumstances,” he believed it was\nimportant for him “to not get involved” in negotiations, and added, “You can meet, like I did in\nSeptember, [to] reaffirm the position of the office, [and] back your AUSA, but ultimately, I think\nyour trial lawyer needs discretion to do their job.” Villafafia told OPR, houever, that she did not\nunderstand Acosta to be giving her discretion to conduct the negotiations as she saw fit; rather, she\nbelieved Acosta did not want to engage in face-to-face negotiations because “he wanted to have\nan appearance of having sort of an arm’s length from the deal.”!!? Villafafia replied to Acosta’s\nll9 As noted throughout the Report, Villafafia’s interpretation of her supervisors’ motivations for their actions\noften differed from the supervisors’ explanations for their actions.

Instead, the mater entered a new,\nprotracted phase, which involved the upper echelons of the Department of Justice. Despite the\nfact that Epstein and his atorneys had signed the NPA, they pursued a new strategy of appealing\nto senior Department managers with the goal of seting aside the NPA entirely. Although\nultimately unsuccessful, the strategy delayed the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea by months.\n\nOn October 29, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Sloman, raising several issues that she wanted\nSloman to address with Lefkouitz. Among other things, Villafafia pointed out that the NPA\nrequired Epstein to use his “best efforts” to comply with the agreement, but he had failed to comply\nwith the timeline established by the NPA when he sought and obtained a plea hearing\npostponement from October 26 to November 2o. Responding to Lefkouitz’s atempts to limit the\nUSAO’s communications with various entities and individuals, Villafafia noted that the USAO\nneeded to be able to communicate with the State Atorney’s Office and the victims’ atorney “to\n[e]nsure that Epstein is abiding by the terms of the agreement.”\n\nThat same day, Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek informed Sloman that the state judge\nassigned to the case had scheduled Epstein’s plea and sentence in early January 2oo8.

Finally, in a leter to Assistant Atorney General Fisher on\nMay l4, 2oo8, Starr thanked her for having spoken with him the previous day, reiterated the\ndefense team’s various complaints, and asked her to meet with him, Lefkouitz, and Whitley.\n\nMeanwhile, Oosterban’s Deputy Chief drafted a decision leter to be sent from Oosterban\nto Lefkouitz, and over the course of several weeks, it was reviewed by and received input from\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker and Assistant Atorney General Fisher, as well as\nthe Criminal Division’s Appellate Section (regarding certain legal issues) and Office of\nEnforcement Operations (regarding the Petite policy). Oosterban told OPR that, notwithstanding\nthe defense submissions on a wide variety of issues and complaints, CEOS’s review was limited\nto determining whether there was a basis for a federal prosecution of Epstein.\n\nOosterban’s leter, sent to Lefkouitz on May l5, 2oo8, notified the defense team that\nCEOS had completed its independent evaluation of whether prosecution of Epstein for federal\ncriminal violations “would contradict criminal enforcement policy interests.” The leter specified\nthat CEOS’s review addressed the “narrou question” of whether a legitimate basis existed for a\nfederal prosecution, and that CEOS did not conduct a de novo review of the facts, analyze issues\nrelating to federal statutes that did not pertain to child exploitation, or review the terms of the NPA\nor the prosecutorial misconduct allegations. The leter stated that based on its examination of the\nmaterial relevant to its limited review of the mater, CEOS had concluded that “federal prosecution\nin this case would not be improper or inappropriate” and that Acosta “could properly use his\ndiscretion to authorize prosecution in this case.”\n\nOn May l9, 2oo8, Lefkouitz reached out to Acosta to request a meeting and specifically\nasked that Acosta “not shunt me off to one of your staff.”” Lefkouitz made several points in support\nof the request for a meeting: (l) CEOS’s leter acknouledged that federal prosecution of Epstein\nwould involve a “novel application” of relevant federal statutes;'®° (2) CEOS’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that\nfederal prosecution would not be “an abuse of discretion” was “hardly an endorsement” of the\ncase;!®’ (3) CEOS did not address Epstein’s prosecutorial misconduct allegations; and (4) “critical\nnew evidence,” in the form of recent defense counsel depositions of victims confirmed “that\nrepresented Epstein victims. The Epstein defense team alleged in the leter that Sloman’s past association with the\natorney caused Sloman to take actions to favor victims’ potential civil lawsuits against Epstein.\n\nl66 Oosterban’s leter stated, “Mr. Acosta can soundly exercise his authority to decide to pursue a prosecution\neven though it might involve a novel application of a federal statute.” This statement referred to a defense argument\nbased on a prior Departmental expression of concern about a Congressional proposal to expand federal law to “adult\nprostitution where no force, fraud or coercion was used.” Oosterban stated that “the Department’s efforts are properly\nfocused on the commercial sexual exploitation of children”—even if wholly local—and “the exploitation of adults\nthrough force, fraud, or coercion.” He then observed that the fact “that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not look\nprecisely like the cases that came before it is not dispositive.”\n\nl67 Oosterban began his leter, houever, by making it clear that CEOS had considered “the narrou question as\nto whether there is a legitimate basis for the U.S. Atorney’s Office to proceed with a federal prosecution of\nMr. Epstein.”\n\nlo7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l45", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023167.jpg": "when prosecutors have used third parties as leverage in plea negotiations. Numerous courts have\nmade clear, houever, that a plea is not invalid when entered under an agreement that includes a\npromise of leniency touards a third party or in response to a prosecutor’s threat to prosecute a third\nparty if a plea is not entered. See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 9o9 F.2d 738, 74l-42 (2d Cir.\nl99o) (rejecting claim that plea was involuntary because of pressure placed upon a defendant by\nthe government’s insistence that a defendant’s wife would not be offered a plea bargain unless he\npled guilty); Martin v.

For example, in State v. Frazier, 697 So. 2d 944 (Fla.

OVERVIEW\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald report in November 2ol8, media scrutiny of and public\natention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart\nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s l8-month sentence, which resulted in a l3-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal\nconduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from\nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making\nprocess leading to the signed NPA. As a result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s\nmotivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors\nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the\nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because\nthey were motivated by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships\nwith his atorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\n\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the follouing core questions: (l) who\nwas responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its\nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules\nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by\nimproper factors, such as corruption or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness\ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shous in detail the process that led to the NPA, from\nthe initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.\nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and extensive\ninterviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions\nconcerning the NPA’s origins and development. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth\nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\nIl. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS\n\nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\n\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knouledge of its terms. He\nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that\nhe either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the\ncase against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled\nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta\ndid not make such a claim to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged\nresolution, two years .. . , registration and restitution, . . . ultimately that was approved on my\nauthority. ... [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, I... accept that. I’m not... pushing away\nresponsibility for it.”\n\nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia were involved in the mater to varying degrees, at\nl33\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l7l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023172.jpg": "different points in time, and regarding different decisions. Menchel, for example, participated in\nformulating the USAO’s initial writen offer to the defense, but he had no involvement with actions\nor decisions made after August 3, 2oo7. Sloman was absent during part of the most intense\nnegotiations in September 2oo7 and did not see the final, signed version of the NPA until he\nreturned. Villafafia and Lourie participated in the negotiations, and Lourie either made decisions\nduring the September l2, 2oo7 meeting with the defense and State Atorney’s Office, or at least\nindicated agreement pending Acosta’s approval. In any event, whatever the level of Sloman’s,\n\nMenchel’s, Lourie’s, and Villafafia’s involvement, they acted with the knouledge and approval of\n\nAcosta.\n\nUnder OPR’s analytical framework, an atorney who makes a good faith atempt to\nascertain the obligations and standards imposed on the atorney and to comply with them in a given\nsituation does not commit professional misconduct. Evidence that an atorney made a good faith\natempt to ascertain and comply with the obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not\nlimited to, the fact that the atorney consulted with a supervisor.*°? In this regard, OPR’s\nframework is similar to a standard provision of the professional conduct rules of most state bars,\nwhich specify that a subordinate lawyer does not engage in misconduct if that lawyer acts in\naccordance with a supervisory lawyer’s reasonable resolution of an arguable question of\nprofessional duty. See, e.g., FRPC 4-5.2(b). Therefore, in addition to the fact that OPR did not\nfind a violation of a clear and unambiguous standard as discussed belou, OPR concludes that\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia did not commit professional misconduct with respect to\nany aspect of the NPA because they acted under Acosta’s direction and with his approval.\n\nIW. OPR FOUND THAT NONE OF THE SUBJECTS VIOLATED A CLEAR AND\nUNAMBIGUOUS STATUTE, PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY RULE OR\nSTANDARD, OR DEPARTMENT REGULATION OR POLICY, IN\nNEGOTIATING, APPROVING, OR ENTERING INTO THE NPA\nA central issue OPR addressed in its investigation relating to the NPA was whether any of\n\nthe subjects, in developing, negotiating, or entering into the NPA, violated any clear and\n\nunambiguous standard established by rule, regulation, or policy. OPR does not find professional\nmisconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous\nstandard. OPR considered three specific areas: (l) standards implicated by the decision to decline\n\na federal court prosecution; (2) standards implicated by the decision to resolve the federal\n\ninvestigation through a non-prosecution agreement; and (3) standards implicated by any of the\n\nNPA’s provisions, including the promise not to prosecute unidentified third parties. As discussed\n\nbelou, OPR concludes that in each area, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his\n\ndecisions were based on corrupt or improper influences, the U.S. Atorney possessed broad\ndiscretionary authority to proceed as he saw fit, authority that he could delegate to subordinates,\nand that Acosta’s exercise of his discretionary authority did not breach any clear and unambiguous\nstandard. As a result, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\n\n2o2 The failure to fully advise a supervisor of relevant and material facts can warrant a finding that the subordinate\n\natorney has not acted in “good faith.” OPR did not find evidence supporting such a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> here, and Acosta did\n\nnot claim that he was unaware of material facts needed to make his decision.\n\nl34\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l72", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023179.jpg": "to prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.”\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA. OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l79", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023187.jpg": "been concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on . . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a <span class=\"highlight\">Conclusion</span> That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by corruption, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\nrestitution for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.*”” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n72l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . | was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\n\n222 Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\n\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\n\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\n\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\n\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so well.\n\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l87", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023188.jpg": "reconsider the provision. Acosta could certainly have modified or eliminated the provision entirely\nif his motivation was to benefit Epstein or Epstein’s atorneys.\n\nSecond, Epstein himself was not satisfied with the NPA. Immediately after signing the\nagreement, he sought to have the Department nullify it by declaring federal involvement in the\ninvestigation inappropriate. In addition to repeatedly atacking the NPA in his submissions to the\nDepartment, Epstein added to his evidentiary challenges and federalism claims allegations of\nmisconduct and improper bias on the part of specific USAO personnel. Epstein’s dissatisfaction\nwith the NPA, and his personal atacks on individual prosecutors involved in negotiating the\nagreement, appear inconsistent with a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the subjects designed the NPA for Epstein’s\nbenefit.\n\nD. OPR Does Not Find That the Subjects’ Preexisting Relationships with Defense\n\nCounsel, Decisions to Meet with Defense Counsel, and Other Factors\nEstablished That the Subjects Acted from Improper Influences or Provided\nImproper Benefits to Epstein\n\nIn evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered various other factors featured in media\naccounts to shou that the subjects provided improper benefits to Epstein or which purportedly\nsuggested that the subjects acted from improper influences. OPR examined these factors but did\nnot find that they supported a finding that the subjects were influenced by favoritism, bias, or other\nimproper motivation.\n\nl. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects Extended Any\nImproper Benefit to Epstein because of Their Preexisting Relationships\nwith His Atorneys\n\nEpstein’s wealth enabled him to hire multiple atorneys who had preexisting personal\nconnections to some of the government atorneys involved in his case, in the State Atorney’s\nOffice, in the USAO, and elsewhere in the Department. Based on the atorneys Epstein selected\nto represent him, a reasonable inference can be drawn that Epstein believed that hiring atorneys\nwith relationships to the prosecutors would be beneficial to him. One of the first atorneys who\ncontacted the USAO on Epstein’s behalf was Guy Lewis, a former AUSA in and U.S. Atorney\nfor the Southern District of Florida. Villafafia and Lourie had worked for Lewis, and Lourie was\nclose friends with one of Lewis’s law partners. Epstein also retained Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former\nAUSA who had been Menchel’s deputy and with whom he had socialized. Later, when Epstein\nwas seeking Acosta’s personal involvement in the case, Epstein hired Kenneth Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz, prominent atorneys from Kirkland & Ellis with whom Acosta was acquainted from\nhis previous employment with that firm.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she believed Acosta “was influenced by the stature of Epstein’s\natorneys.” Critically, houever, other than the information regarding Menchel that is discussed in\nthe follouing subsection, neither Villafafia nor any of the other individuals OPR interviewed\nidentified any specific evidence suggesting that Acosta, or any of the other subjects, extended an\nimproper favor or benefit to Epstein because of a personal relationship with defense counsel (or\nfor any other improper reason). Villafafia explained hou, in her view, the “legal prouess” of\nEpstein’s atorneys had an impact on the case:\n\nl5o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l88", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023189.jpg": "[O]ne of the issues in the case was the . . . defense’s ability to\ndescribe the case or characterize the case as being legally complex.\nIt was not as legally complex as they made it out to be. But because\nthey were able to convince members of our office that it was\nsomehou extremely novel and legally complex, the issue became\nwho was likely to succeed in arguing these legal issues. And\nbecause of that, the legal prouess, if you will, of the atorneys [ ]\n[became] something to consider.\n\nI think that the ability of Alan Dershouitz and Ken Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz to convince Alex Acosta that I didn’t knou what I was\ntalking [about] also, all came into play. So I think there were a\nnumber of factors and it all came together.\n\nAlthough Villafafia was critical of Acosta’s consideration of the defense arguments, she\nconceded that the defense team’s tactics demonstrated effective advocacy. Certainly, throughout\nthe case, Epstein’s atorneys prepared lengthy memoranda analyzing the evidence and arguing\nnuanced legal points concerning federalism, the elements of numerous federal criminal statutes,\nand the evidence relevant to those statutes, but it is not unusual or unreasonable for prosecutors to\ncarefully consider well-crafted legal arguments from defense counsel.\n\nThere is litle question that Epstein’s extensive team of atorneys was able to obtain\nnegotiated benefits for Epstein—although the USAO never wavered from its three core\nrequirements, it did agree to a reduction in prison time from its original offer, and it granted Epstein\ncertain other concessions during the negotiations. Epstein’s wealth provided him with skilled,\nexperienced negotiators who continually sought various incremental concessions, and with\natorneys who knew hou to obtain Department review of a USAO mater, thereby delaying\nundesired outcomes for as long as possible.*”? Despite Epstein’s evident intentions, houever, OPR\ndid not find evidence warranting a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the NPA or its terms resulted from the subjects’\nrelationships with the atorneys he had selected to represent him.\n\n2s The Subjects Asserted That Their Relationships with Defense Counsel\nDid Not Influence Their Actions\n\nAcosta, Menchel, Sloman, and Lourie each asserted that Epstein’s choice of counsel did\nnot affect his handling of the case. Menchel told OPR that once in private practice, former\ncolleagues often became adversaries. In Menchel’s view, such preexisting relationships were\nuseful because they afforded a defense atorney initial credibility and an insight into the issues a\nprosecutor would likely view as areas of concern, which enabled the defense atorney to “tailor”\narguments in a way that would maximize their persuasive impact on the USAO. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that these advantages did not “move the needle in any major way,” and he\n“reject[ed] the notion” that anyone in the USAO had been “swayed” because of preexisting\n223 As Chief Reiter later observed in his deposition testimony, “[T]he Epstein case was an instance of a many\nmillion dollars defense and what it can accomplish.”\n\nl5l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l89", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023192.jpg": "Menchel told OPR that when he and Sanchez were in the USAO, they had a social\nrelationship, which included, in 2oo3, “a handful of dates over a period of two to three weeks. We\ndecided that . . . this was probably best not to pursue, and we mutually agreed to not do that.”?°\nApart from that, he stated they were “close” and “hung out,” and he asserted that this was knoun\nin the office at the time. Menchel said that his relationship with Sanchez “changed dramatically”\nwhen she left the office for private practice, and that by the time he became involved in the Epstein\ninvestigation, he had dated and married his wife, and his contact with Sanchez would “most likely”\nhave been at office events and when she atended his wedding.””’ Menchel added, “[T]hat was\nthree and a half years [prior] for a very brief period of time, and I don’t think I gave it a moment’s\nthought.”\n\nWhen asked by OPR about the basis for the decision to make an offer of a two-year term\nof incarceration, Menchel said that he did not recall discussions about the two-year offer and did\nnot recall hou the office arrived at that figure. In response to OPR’s question, Menchel stated that\nhis relationship with Sanchez did “[n]ot at all” affect his handling of the Epstein case. Moreover,\nMenchel asserted that the contemporaneous documentary record supports a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that it was\nAcosta, not Menchel, who made the decision to resolve the case with the two-year term.\n\nOPR carefully considered the documentary record on this point, as well as the statements\nto OPR from Menchel, Villafafia, Sloman, and Acosta, and concludes that there is no evidence\nsupporting the suggestion that the plea was instigated by Menchel as a favor to defense counsel.\nThe USAO’s first plea overture to defense counsel, which took place sometime before June 26,\n2oo7, occurred when Menchel spoke with Sanchez about the possibility of resolving the federal\ncase with a state plea that required jail time and sexual offender registration. According to the\nemail, “[iJt was a non-starter” for the defense. In the lengthy email exchange with Villafafia in\nearly July 2oo7, Menchel told her that his discussion with Sanchez about a state-based resolution\nwas made with Acosta’s “full knouledge.” Acosta corroborated this statement, telling OPR that\nalthough he did not remember a specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based\nresolution, he was certain Menchel would not have discussed this potential resolution with defense\ncounsel “without having discussed it with me.”??8 Moreover, the defense did not immediately\n226 Acosta, Sloman, and Lourie each told OPR that in 2oo7, he was not aware that Menchel had previously dated\nSanchez. OPR questioned the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer regarding whether Menchel had an\nobligation to inform his supervisors of his dating relationship. The Professional Responsibility Officer said that it\nwould depend on “hou long the relationship was and hou compromised the individual felt he might appear to be,”\nbut he would have expected Menchel to raise the issue with Acosta. The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR\nthat if he had been approached for advice at the time, he would have asked for more facts, but “[g]iven the sensitivity\nof the [Epstein] mater, [my advice] would probably have been to tell him to step back and let somebody else take it\nover.” Menchel told OPR that if his relationship with Sanchez had turned into something more than a handful of\ndates, he would have advised his supervisors. Although OPR does not conclude Menchel’s prior relationship with\nSanchez influenced the Epstein investigation, OPR assesses that it would have been prudent for Menchel to have\ninformed his supervisors so they could make an independent assessment as to whether his continued involvement in\nthe Epstein investigation might create the appearance of a loss of impartiality.\n22H Menchel’s Outlook records also indicate he scheduled lunch with Sanchez on at least one occasion, in early\n2oo6, after she left the USAO.\n\n228 In addition, Villafafia recalled Menchel stating at the July 26, 2oo7 meeting that “Alex has decided to offer\na two year state deal.”\nl54\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l92", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023197.jpg": "The meeting of USAO representatives and Epstein’s defense atorneys, together with the\nState Atorney and the lead state prosecutor on September l2, 2oo7, was a necessary part of the\nNPA negotiation process.\n\nEven after the NPA was signed, the defense continued to request meetings and reviews of\nthe case, both within the USAO and by the Department’s Criminal Division and the Deputy\nAtorney General. Although limited reviews were granted, during this period there was only one\nsubstantive meeting with Acosta, on December l4, 2oo7.7°? This meeting occurred in lieu of the\nmeeting Starr had requested of Assistant Atorney General Fisher, most likely because the defense\nsubmissions to the Department’s Criminal Division had raised issues not previously raised with\nthe USAO and the Department determined that Acosta should address those in the first instance.”*°\nAcosta told OPR that he did not ask for the Department review, but he also did not want to appear\nas if he “fear[ed]” that review. Acosta’s nuanced position, houever, was not clear to the\nDepartment atorneys who responded to Epstein’s appeals and who perceived Acosta to be in favor\nof a Department review, rather than merely tolerant of it. Notably, though, none of those meetings\nor reviews resulted in the USAO abandoning the NPA, and Epstein gained no substantial\nadvantage from his continued entreaties.\n\nIn sum, in evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered the number of meetings, their\npurpose, the content of the discussions, and decisions made afterwards. OPR cannot say that the\nnumber of meetings, particularly those occurring before the NPA was signed, was so far outside\nthe norm—for a high profile case with skilled defense atorneys—that the quantity of meetings\nalone shous that the subjects were motivated by improper favoritism. In evaluating the subjects’\nconduct, OPR considered that the meetings were held with different levels of USAO managers and\nthat the explanations for the decisions to participate in the meetings reflected reasonable strategic\ngoals. Although OPR cannot rule out the possibility that because Acosta, Menchel, Lourie, or\nSloman knew or knew of the defense atorneys, they may have been willing to meet with them, it\nis also true that prosecutors routinely meet with defense atorneys, including those who are knoun\nto them and those who are not. Furthermore, meetings are more likely to occur in high profile\ncases involving defendants with the financial resources to hire skilled defense counsel who request\nmeetings at the highest levels of the USAO and the Department. Most significantly, OPR did not\nfind evidence supporting a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the meetings themselves resulted in any substantial\nbenefit to the defense. At each meeting, defense counsel strongly pressed the USAO—on factual,\nlegal, and policy grounds—to forgo its federal investigation and to return the mater to the state to\nproceed as it saw fit. The USAO never yielded on that point. Accordingly, OPR did not find\nevidence supporting a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia met with\ndefense counsel for the purpose of benefiting Epstein or that the meetings themselves caused\nAcosta or the other subjects to provide improper benefits to Epstein.\n\n232 Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz is discussed separately in the follouing section.\n233 Starr and other defense atorneys only obtained one meeting at the Department level, with Deputy Assistant\nAtorney General Mandelker and CEOS Chief Oosterban in March 2oo8. Although Starr requested a meeting with\nAssistant Atorney General Fisher and another with Deputy Atorney General Filip, those requests were not granted.\nl59\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l97", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023213.jpg": "Epstein’s state guilty plea.°° As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in\nthis manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding circumstances, his decision to\ndo so reflected poor judgment. Acosta’s application of Petite policy principles was too expansive,\nhis view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrou, and his understanding of\nthe state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.”>*!\n\nB. The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcerms about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was completed. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.”°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n2oo Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\n25 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n252 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstem and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232l3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023217.jpg": "To be clear, OPR is not suggesting that prosecutors must obtain all available evidence\nbefore reaching plea agreements or that prosecutors cannot reasonably determine that reaching a\nresolution is more beneficial than continuing to litigate evidentiary issues. Every case is different\nand must be judged on its oun facts. In this case, houever, given the unorthodox nature of the\nstate-based resolution, the fact that Acosta’s decision to pursue it set the case on a wholly different\ntrack than what had been originally contemplated by his experienced staff, the nature and scope of\nEpstein’s criminal conduct, the circumstances surrounding the removal of the computers from\nEpstein’s residence, and the potential for obtaining evidence revealing serious additional criminal\nconduct, Acosta had a responsibility to ensure that he was fully informed about the consequences\nof pursing the course of action that he proposed and particularly about the consequences flouing\nfrom the express terms of the NPA. In deciding to resolve the case pre-charge, Acosta lost sight\nof the bigger picture that the investigation was not completed and viable leads remained to be\npursued. The decision to forgo the government’s efforts to obtain the computer evidence and to\npursue significant investigative steps should have been made only after careful consideration of\nall the costs and benefits of the proposed action. OPR did not find evidence that Acosta fully\nconsidered the costs of ending the investigation prematurely.”\n\nC. OPR Was Unable to Determine the Basis for the Two-Year Term of\n\nIncarceration, That It Was Tied to Traditional Sentencing Goals, or That It\nSatisfied the Federal Interest in the Prosecution\n\nThe heart of the controversy surrounding the Epstein case is the apparent undue leniency\nafforded him concerning his sentence. After offering a deal that required a “non-negotiable”\n24-month term of incarceration, Acosta agreed to resolve it for an l8-month term of incarceration,\nknouing that gain time would reduce it further, and indeed, Epstein served only l3 months.\nEpstein ultimately did not serve even that minimal sentence incarcerated on a full-time basis\nbecause the state alloued Epstein into its work release program within the first four months of his\nsentence. As Lourie told OPR, “[E]verything else that happened to [Epstein] is exactly what\nshould have happened to him. . . . He had to pay a lot of money. He had to register as a sex\noffender,” but “in the perfect world, [Epstein] would have served more time in jail.”\n\nDue to the passage of time and the subjects’ inability to recall many details of the relevant\nevents, OPR was unable to develop a clear understanding of hou the original two-year sentence\nrequirement was developed or by whom. Two possibilities were articulated during OPR’s subject\ninterviews: (l) the two years represented the sentence Epstein would have received had he pled\nguilty to an unspecified charge originally contemplated by the state; or (2) the two years\nrepresented the sentence the USAO determined Epstein would be willing to accept, thus avoiding\nthe need for a trial. As to the former possibility, Acosta told OPR that his “best understanding” of\nthe two-year proposal was that it correlated to “one of the original state charges.”’ He elaborated,\n28s In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney objected to OPR’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that Acosta knew or\nshould have knoun about the litigation regarding the computers and that he should have given greater consideration\nto pursuing the computers before the NPA was signed. Acosta’s atorney asserted that Acosta was not involved in\nthat level of “granularity”; that his “‘small thoughts’ edits” on the NPA were limited and focused on policy; and that\nit was appropriate for him to rely on his staff to raise any issues of concern to him. For the reasons stated above, OPR\nnonetheless concludes that having developed a unique resolution to a federal investigation, Acosta had a greater\nobligation to understand and consider what the USAO was giving up and the appropriateness of doing so.\n\nl79\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023219.jpg": "indictment. Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal charges were not appropriate and\ndefense counsel’s efforts to minimize the amount of time Epstein would spend in jail, it is\nquestionable whether Epstein would have accepted such a plea offer, but the USAO did not even\nextend the offer to determine what his response to it would be.\n\nWeighed against possible loss at trial were some clear advantages to a negotiated resolution\nthat ensured a conviction, including sexual offender registration and the opportunity to establish a\nmechanism for the victims to recover damages. These advantages, added to Acosta’s concern\nabout intruding on the state’s authority, led him to the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that a two-year state plea would\nbe sufficient to prevent manifest injustice. Menchel told OPR, “I don’t believe anybody at the\ntime that this resolution was entered into was looking at the two years as a fair result in terms of\nthe conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not if we took this case to\ntrial, would we risk losing everything?”\n\nDuring the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept\na plea for an l8-month sentence, a reduction of six months from the original “non-negotiable” two-\nyear term. The subjects did not have a clear memory of why this reduction was made. Villafafia\natributed it to a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, but Acosta atributed it to a decision\nmade during the negotiating process by Villafafia and Lourie, telling OPR that he understood his\natorneys needed flexibility to reach a final deal with Epstein.\n\nOPR found no contemporaneous documents shouing the basis for the two-year term.\nDespite extensive subject interviews and review of thousands of contemporaneous records, OPR\nwas unable to determine who initially proposed the two-year term of incarceration or why that\nterm, as opposed to other possible and lengthier terms, was setled on for the initial offer. The\nterm was not tied to statutory or guidelines sentences for potential federal charges or, as far as\nOPR could determine, possible state charges. Furthermore, while the USAO initially informed the\ndefense that the two-year term was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that position and\nrather than a “floor” for negotiations, it became a “ceiling” that was further reduced during the\nnegotiations. OPR was unable to find any evidence indicating that the term of incarceration was\ntied either to the federal interest in seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, or to other\ntraditional sentencing factors such as deterrence, either of Epstein or other offenders of similar\ncrimes. Instead, as previously noted, it appears that Acosta primarily considered only a\npunishment that was somewhat more than that to which the state had agreed. As a result, the\nUSAO had litle room to maneuver during the negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling to\nenforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term of incarceration\nthat was not much more than what the state had initially sought and which was significantly\ndisproportionate to the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.\n\nIn sum, it is evident that Acosta’s desire to resolve the federal case against Epstein led him\nto arrive at a target term of incarceration that met his oun goal of serving as a “backstop” to the\nstate, but that otherwise was untethered to any articulable, reasonable basis. In assessing the case\nonly through the lens of providing a “backstop” to the state, Acosta failed to consider the need for\na punishment commensurate with the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct and the federal interest in\naddressing it.\n\nl8l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232l9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023222.jpg": "which Villafafia and Lourie believed that the state had intentionally failed to aggressively pursue\na broader state indictment.\n\nOne example illustrates this communication gap. In a September 2o, 2oo7 email to Lourie\nasking him to read the latest version of the proposed “hybrid” federal plea agreement (calling for\nEpstein to plead to both state and federal charges), Acosta noted, “I don’t typically sign plea\nagreements. We should only go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement. I\ndidn’t even sign the public corruption or [C]ali cartel agreements, so this should not be the first.”\n(Emphasis added.) In his email to Villafafia, Lourie atached Acosta’s email and instructed\nVillafafia to “change the signature block to your name and send as final to Jay [Lefkouitz].”\n(Emphasis added.) Villafafia raised no objection to signing the agreement. Acosta told OPR that\nhe wanted to give the “trial team” a chance to “speak up and let him knou” if they did not feel\ncomfortable with the agreement. Villafafia, houever, told OPR that she did not understand that\nshe was being given an opportunity to object to the agreement; rather, she believed Acosta wanted\nher to sign it because he was taking an “‘arm’s length” approach and signaling this “was not his\ndeal.” The fact that the top decision maker believed he was giving the line AUSA an opportunity\nto reflect and stop the process if she believed the deal was inappropriate, but the line AUSA\nbelieved she was being ordered to sign the agreement because her boss wanted to distance himself\nfrom the decision, reflects a serious communication gap.\n\nAs another example, at one point, Villafafia, frustrated and concerned about the decisions\nbeing made concerning a possible resolution, requested a meeting with Acosta; in a sternly worded\nrebuke, Menchel rejected the request. Although Menchel told OPR that he was not prohibiting\nVillafafia from speaking to Acosta, Villafafia interpreted Menchel’s email to mean that she could\nnot seek a meeting with Acosta. As a consequence, Acosta made his decision about a state\nresolution and the term of incarceration without any direct input from Villafafia. Acosta told OPR\nthat he was unaware that Villafafia had sought a meeting with him and he would have met with\nher if she had asked him directly. OPR did not find any writen evidence of a meeting involving\nboth Acosta—the final decision maker—and Villafafia—the person most knouledgeable about the\nfacts and the law—before Acosta made his decision to resolve the case through state charges or to\noffer the two-year term, and Villafafia said she did not have any input into the decision. Although\na U.S. Atorney is certainly not required to have such direct input, and it may be that Menchel\npresented what he believed to be Villafafia’s views, OPR found no evidence that Acosta was aware\nof Villafafia’s strong views about, and objections to, the proposed resolution.”*°\n\nTwo logistical problems hindered effective communication. First, the senior managers\ninvolved in the case—Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel—had offices located in Miami, while the\noffices of the individuals most familiar with facts of the case—Villafafia and, to a lesser extent,\nLourie—were located in West Palm Beach. Consequently, Villafafia’s discussions with her senior\n256 In her 2ol7 Declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that, given the challenges of obtaining\nvictims’ cooperation with a federal prosecution, “I believed and still believe that a negotiated resolution of the mater\nwas in the best interests of the [USAO] and the victims as a whole. The [USAO] had also reached that same\n<span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>.” Several subjects pointed to this statement as indicating that Villafafia in fact supported the NPA. In her\nOPR interview, houever, Villafafia drew a distinction between resolving the investigation through negotiations that\nled to what in her view was a reasonable outcome, which she would have supported, and “this negotiated resolution” —\nthat is, the NPA—which she did not support.\n\nl84\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23222", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023227.jpg": "CHAPTER THREE\nISSUES RELATING TO THE GOVERNMENT?’S INTERACTIONS\nAND COMMUNICATIONS WITH VICTIMS\nPART ONE: FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nl.

The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.””©° Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.””°” The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n76o President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n76l See Pub.

FBI Victim Notification Pamphlets\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines recommended that “victims be given a printed brochure or card that\nbriefly describes their rights and available services . . . and [contact information for] the victim-\nwitness coordinator or specialist....” At the time of the Epstein investigation, FBI agents\nnationwide routinely folloued a practice of providing victims with pamphlets entitled, “Help for\nVictims of Crime” and “The Department of Justice Victim Notification System.” The “Help for\nVictims of Crime” pamphlet contained a listing of the eight CVRA rights. The pamphlet stated:\n“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime,\nand it will be the responsibility of the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you\nare afforded those rights.” The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided\nvictims with the FBI pamphlet upon the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> of an interview. The pamphlet entitled “The\nDepartment of Justice Victim Notification System” provided an overview of the VNS and\ninstructions on hou to access the system.\n\nV. THE INTRODUCTORY USAO AND FBI LETTERS TO VICTIMS\n\nA. August 2oo6: The FBI Victim Notification Leters\n\nOn August 8, 2oo6, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim\nSpecialist for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim\nNotification Form” naming 3o victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional\npertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.7”° Thereafter, the Victim Specialist\nentered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS\nwhenever the case agent directed the Victim Specialist to generate an initial leter to a particular\nvictim. The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim notification was “always handled by the\n[FBI’s Victim Specialist].”?”*\n\nAccording to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2oo6, the FBI Victim Specialist\nused the VNS to generate FBI leters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the\neight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive\ncurrent status information about the mater. The FBI leters described the case as “currently under\ninvestigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued\npatience while we conduct a thorough investigation.” The leters also stated that some of the\nCVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment: “We will make our best efforts\nto ensure you are accorded the rights described. Most of these rights pertain to events occurring\nafter the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the responsibility\nof the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you are accorded those rights.” A\nsample leter follous.\n\n2l3 These 3o were drawn from the PBPD investigative file and included individuals that the PBPD had not\ndesignated as victims and individuals the PBPD had identified but not interviewed.\n274 The case agent told OPR, “[O]nce we identify a victim, then we bring [the FBI Victim Specialist] in, and as\nfar as anything pertaining to victim rights . . . and any resources, federal resources these victims may need comes from\n[her], the Victim Specialist.”\nl96\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23234", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023238.jpg": "[A]s Chief of the Criminal Division of the USAO, I did not consider\nit to be within my purview to ensure that appropriate victim\nnotifications occurred in every mater investigated or brought by the\nOffice.

USAO and FBI Leters Are Hand Delivered\n\nThe FBI case agent told OPR that the FBI made its notifications “at the time that we met\n[with] the girls.” The case agent recalled that she hand delivered the USAO leters and FBI leters\nto some victims follouing in-person interviews, and in the instances when she did not provide a\nvictim with a leter, she provided an FBI pamphlet containing CVRA rights information similar to\nthat set forth in the FBI leters.78° The co-case agent also recalled that he may have delivered “a\nfew” leters to victims. The FBI Victim Specialist told OPR that she mailed some FBI leters to\nvictims and she provided some FBI leters to the case agent for hand delivery.\n\nNevertheless, the case agent told OPR that she “did not sit there and go through every\nright” with the victims. She stated, houever, “[I]n the beginning whether it was through [the FBI\nVictim Specialist] giving the leter, me giving a leter, the pamphlet, I believed that the girls knew\nthat they were victims and had rights, and they had a resource, [the FBI Victim Specialist], that\nthey could call for that.” The FBI case agent further explained that once the case agents connected\nthe FBI Victim Specialist with each victim, the Victim Specialist handled the victims’ “rights and\nresources.”\n\nVI. AUGUST 2oo6 — SEPTEMBER 2oo7: FBI AND USAO CONTACTS WITH\n\nVICTIMS BEFORE THE NPA IS SIGNED\n\nEarly in the investigation, Villafafia informed her supervisors that, up to that point,\n“everyone whom the agents have spoken with so far has been willing to tell her story. Geting\nthem to tell their stories in front of a jury at trial may be much harder.” Between August 2oo6 and\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the FBI case agents interviewed 22 victims. On\na few occasions, Villafafia met with victims together with the FBI. Villafafia’s May l, 2oo7 draft\nindictment included substantive crimes against multiple victims, and Villafafia described the\ncircumstances of each of their encounters with Epstein in her prosecution memorandum.\n\nThere is some evidence indicating that during interviews, some of the victims expressed to\nthe FBI case agents and Villafafia concerns about participating in a federal trial of Epstein, and\nthose discussions touched upon, in broad terms, the victims’ views regarding the desired outcome\nof the investigation.

Villafafia Asserts That Her Supervisors Gave Instructions Not to\nConsult Victims about the Plea Discussions, but Her Supervisors Do\nNot Currently Recall Such Instructions\nVillafafia told OPR that during an “early” meeting with Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel,\nwhich took place when “we were probably just entering into plea negotiations,” she raised the\ngovernment’s obligation to confer with victims.7** Initially, Villafafia told OPR she was\ninstructed, “Don’t talk to [the victims]. Don’t tell them what’s happening,” but she was not told\nwhy she should not speak to the victims, and she could not recall who gave her this instruction. In\na subsequent OPR interview, Villafafia recalled that when she raised the issue of notification\nduring the meeting, she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential. You can’t disclose them.”7*?\nVillafafia remained uncertain who gave her this instruction, but believed it may have been Acosta.\nNeither Acosta, Sloman, nor Menchel recalled a meeting at which Villafafia was directed\nnot to notify the victims. Acosta told OPR that the decision whether to solicit the victims’ view\n“is something [that] I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I was focused\non at least at this time,” and he did not “recall discussions about victim notification until after the\nNPA was signed.” Sloman also told OPR that he did not recall a meeting at which victim\nnotification was discussed. Menchel wrote in his response to OPR, “I have no recollection of any\ndiscussions or decisions regarding whether the USAO should notify victims of its intention to enter\ninto a pre-charge disposition of the Epstein mater.” Furthermore, Menchel told OPR he could not\nthink of a reason why the issue of victim notification would have arisen before he left the USAO,\nbecause “we were way off from finalizing or having anything even close to a deal,” and it would\nhave been “premature” to consider notification.””°\n3.

OPR carefully considered the comments but did not conclude that the evidence to\nwhich Menchel’s atorney pointed necessarily refuted Villafafia’s assertion that she had received an instruction from\na supervisor not to inform victims about the plea negotiations. Houever, it is also true that OPR did not find any\nreference in the emails and other documents dated before the NPA was signed to a meeting at which victim\nconsultation was discussed or to a specific instruction not to consult with the victims. This is one of several events\nabout which Menchel and Villafafia disagreed, but given OPR’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the Department did not require\nprosecutors to consult with victims before charges were brought, OPR does not reach a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> regarding the\nalleged meeting and instruction.\n2o4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23242", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023246.jpg": "involved in such notifications.

Nonetheless, Villafafia told OPR that, while there were\nvalid reasons for the government’s position that CVRA rights do not apply pre-charge, “[T]his is\na case where I felt we should have done more than what was legally required. I was obviously\nprepared to spend as much time, energy and effort necessary to meet with each and every [Vvictim].”\n\nOver the course of the litigation, the district court made various rulings interpreting the\nprovisions of the CVRA, including the court’s key <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that victim CVRA rights “atach\nbefore the Government brings formal charges against a defendant.” The court also held that\n(l) “the CVRA authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a\nnon-prosecution agreement, reached in violation of a prosecutor’s conferral obligations under the\nstatute”; (2) the CVRA authorizes the seting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements”;\n(3) the CVRA’s “reasonable right to confer” “extends to the pre-charge state of criminal\ninvestigations and proceedings”; (4) the alleged federal sex crimes commited by Epstein render\nthe Doe petitioners “victims” under the CVRA; and (5) “questions pertaining to [the] equitable\ndefense[s] are properly left for resolution after development of a full evidentiary record.”\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the petitioners’ Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, ruling that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about its\nintention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” The government did not\ndispute the fact that it did not confer with the petitioners prior to signing the NPA, and the court\nconcluded that “[a]t a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform Petitioners\nthat it intended to enter into an agreement not to prosecute Epstein.” The court found that the post-\nNPA leters the government sent to victims describing the investigation as ongoing “misled the\nvictims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material\nomission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an\ninvestigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”?°°\n\nThe court relied on Dean and BP Products to support its holding and noted that the\ngovernment’s action with respect to the NPA was especially troubling because, unlike a plea\nagreement for which the victims could voice objection at a sentencing hearing, “[o]nce an NPA is\nentered into without notice, the mater is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard\nregarding any aspect of the case.” The court also highlighted the inequity of the USAO’s failure\nto communicate with the victims while it simultaneously engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with\nEpstein’s counsel and assured the defense that the NPA would not be “made public or filed with\nthe Court.”\n\nAlthough the USAO defended its actions by citing the 2oo5 Guidelines for the\nDepartment’s position that CVRA rights do not atach until after a defendant is charged, the court\nwas “not persuaded that the [G]uidelines were the basis for the Government’s decision to withhold\ninformation about the NPA from the victims.” The court found that the government’s reliance on\n386 The court did not resolve the factual question as to whether the victims were given adequate notice of\nEpstein’s state court plea hearing.\n\n243\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2328l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023295.jpg": "and consider victims’ views about, prospective plea negotiations.*”?

The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*'* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\na4 The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative)” and “Under Investigation.”\n\n4l5 After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n264\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023303.jpg": "IV.

The USAO initially\n\ntook the position that it was obligated to, and intended to, inform victims of both the NPA,\n\nincluding the § 2255 provision, and Epstein’s change of plea hearing and sentencing, so that\nvictims who wanted to atend could do so.\n\nIn November and December 2oo7, Epstein’s atorneys challenged the USAO’s position\nregarding victim notification. Ultimately, Acosta made two distinct decisions concerning victim\nnotifications. Consistent with Acosta’s concerns about intruding into state actions, Acosta elected\nto defer to state authorities the decision whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing\npursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights requirements. Acosta also determined that the USAO\nwould notify victims about their eligibility to obtain monetary damages from Epstein under § 2255,\na decision that was implemented by leters sent to victims after Epstein entered his state pleas.\nThis decision, which postponed notification of the NPA until after Epstein entered his guilty pleas,\nwas based, at least in part, on Villafafia’s and the case agents’ strategic concerns relating to\npreserving the victims’ credibility and is discussed further in Section V, belou.\n\nIn this section, OPR analyzes Acosta’s decision to defer to the state the responsibility for\nnotifying victims of Epstein’s plea hearing and sentencing. OPR concludes that neither the CVRA\nnor the VRRA required the government to notify victims of the state proceeding and therefore\nAcosta did not violate any statutes or Department policy by deferring to the discretion of the State\nAtorney whether to notify victims of Epstein’s state guilty pleas and sentencing. Houever, OPR\nalso concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment because by failing to ensure that the state\nintended to and would notify victims of the federal investigation, he failed to treat victims\nforthrightly and with the sensitivity expected by the Department. Through counsel, Acosta\n“strongly disagree[d]” with OPR’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> and argued that OPR unfairly applied a standard\n“never before expected of any U.S. Atorney.” OPR addresses Acosta’s criticisms in the\ndiscussion belou.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Defer to the State Atorney’s Discretion Whether to\n\nNotify Victims about Epstein’s State Court Plea Hearing Did Not Violate Any\nClear or Unambiguous Standard\n\nIn November 2oo7, Villafafia sought to avoid defense accusations of misconduct\nconcerning her interactions with the victims by preparing a writen notice to victims informing\nthem of the resolution of the federal case and of their eligibility for monetary damages, and inviting\nthem to appear at the state plea hearing. Villafafia and Sloman exchanged edits of the draft leter\nand, at Sloman’s instruction, she provided the draft to defense atorney Lefkouitz, who, in turn,\n\n265\nDOJ-OGR-ooo233o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023316.jpg": "previously noted, there is some contemporaneous evidence supporting her assertion. Villafafia’s\nmention of the agreement, even if not described in specific terms, would have been sufficient to\napprise those victims of the status of the federal investigation.\n\nNevertheless, Villafafia did not recall discussing the NPA specifically or in general terms\nwith other victims interviewed at that time, nor did she do so with Edwards or any other victim’s\natorney. OPR therefore considered whether the omission of information about the existence of\nthe NPA during these interactions rose to the level of professional misconduct in violation of FRPC\n4-4.l or 4-8.4.44!\n\nOPR evaluated Villafafia’s conduct in light of the comment to FRPC 4-4.l:\n\nA lawyer is required to be truthful when dealing with others on a\n\nclient’s behalf, but generally has no affirmative duty to inform an\n\nopposing party of relevant facts. A misrepresentation can occur if\n\nthe lawyer incorporates or affirms a statement of another person that\n\nthe lawyer knous is false. Misrepresentations can also occur by\n\npartially true but misleading statements or omissions that are the\n\nequivalent of affirmative false statements.\nThe victims and their atorneys were certainly not “opposing part[ies]” to the USAO, but the\ncomment indicates that the rule recognizes that omissions made during discussions with third\nparties, even of relevant facts, are not always treated as false statements.\n\nHere, the evidence does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made an affirmative false\nstatement to the victims or Edwards or that her omissions were “the equivalent of affirmative false\nstatements” about material facts. First, Villafafia told OPR that she believed the investigation was\nongoing and her statement to that effect truthful, and as discussed earlier in this Chapter, the\nevidence shous that Villafafia and the agents did continue to investigate the case until Epstein\nentered his guilty plea in state court in June 2oo8. Villafafia’s email correspondence with her\nsupervisors reflects her strong advocacy during that timeframe to declare Epstein in breach and to\ncharge him. The evidence similarly does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made any affirmative\nfalse statement to Edwards when she informed him of the state court plea, although she declined\nto provide additional information in response to his questions.*”\n\nSecond, in reaching its <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>, OPR considered the full context in which Villafafia\ninteracted with the victims and Edwards. Prosecutors routinely make decisions about what\ninformation will be disclosed to witnesses, including victims, for a variety of strategic reasons. In\nmany cases, prosecutors must make difficult decisions about providing information to witnesses,\nih In Florida Bar v.

The 2oo5 Guidelines advise that in consulting with a victim, prosecutors may be limited\nin their disclosures: “Because victims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government,\nand may disclose whatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only nonsensitive data and\npublic information.”*°\n\nVillafafia’s concern about generating potential impeachment evidence by informing\nvictims of their potential to recover monetary damages from Epstein was not unreasonable.\nIndeed, the case agents initially raised the impeachment issue, and after considering the problem,\nVillafafia agreed with the agents’ concerns. Villafafia raised those concerns with the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer in October 2oo7 after the agents brought the issue to her\natention, and she ultimately raised the issue with Sloman and Acosta as well, neither of whom\nadvised her that those concerns were improper or unsound. OPR also considered that although\nVillafafia had sought to notify the victims in writing of the NPA soon after it was signed, her\nsupervisor, the U.S. Atorney, had decided otherwise. When authorized to inform Edwards of the\nscheduled change of plea hearing, she did so. Although she did not inform Edwards that the plea\nwas part of a global resolution that would end the federal investigation, the evidence does not shou\nthat Villafafia acted for the purpose of deceiving Edwards or preventing him from atending the\nhearing. Had she sought to exclude him from the state proceedings, she could have elected not to\ninform Edwards at all, or she could have discouraged him from atending the state proceedings.\nRather, as Edwards confirmed, Villafafia told him the hearing was “important.” Villafafia sought\nto strike a difficult balance of securing Edwards’s (and his clients’) atendance at the state court\nplea, while obeying her management’s directive that informing victims of the resolution of the\nfederal investigation should not be done until completion of the state plea.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering all of the circumstances, OPR concludes that the\nevidence does not establish that Villafafia violated her obligations under FRPC 4-4.l or 4-8.4(c)\nor (d).“44 Nonetheless, as discussed belou, Villafafia’s interactions with victims and victims’\natorneys without informing them of the NPA and the potential <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> of the federal\ninvestigation contributed to the likelihood that the victims would feel that the government was\n48 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. lV, J B.2.c(l). As noted, some victims continued to express favorable views of Epstein\nduring interviews with the government and they, or their atorneys, could have provided information to Epstein about\nthe government’s communications. For example, within a day of Villafafia contacting a victim’s atorney about a\npotential victim notification leter, Starr complained to Acosta that the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it was clear from the\ngirl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a victim.”\n\n“44 The case most directly on point is Smith, lo9 A.3d ll84, in which the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed\na violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) based on a prosecutor’s failure to notify the victim of the\nresolution of a sex abuse case. Houever, as noted previously, in Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea, and various specific statutes afforded victims the right to receive notices and an\nopportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or information in a circuit court.” In this case,\nfor the reasons previously discussed, Villafafia did not have a clear and unambiguous obligation to inform the victims\nor Edwards of the NPA.\n\n279\nDOJ-OGR-ooo233l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023319.jpg": "Villafafia informed Edwards about the state plea, but did not mention the NPA or the fact that the\nstate pleas would resolve the federal investigation. Edwards then filed the CVRA petition and\nlearned about the NPA signed months earlier and that the federal investigation of Epstein had\nconcluded with Epstein’s state guilty pleas. Wild only received access to the NPA when a judge\npermited it in August 2oo8 pursuant to a protective order. After considering this series of\ninteractions, it is not surprising that Wild came away from the experience feeling confused and\nbelieving she had been misled.\n\nOPR did not find evidence supporting a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that Villafafia, Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, or Lourie opted not to consult with the victims in order to protect Epstein or shield the\nNPA from public scrutiny. Although neither Sloman nor Acosta could recall a specific discussion\nof CVRA obligations before the NPA was signed, both recalled knouing that victim consultation\nwas not required, and Menchel also told OPR that consultation was not required, at least not up to\nthe point when he left the USAO. The evidence is clear that Villafafia sought at various points to\nconsult with and to notify victims about the details of the NPA but was constrained before the\nNPA was signed by managers who either made a decision to not consult victims or did not address\nthe issue after it was raised, and after the signing by her oun concern about creating possible\nimpeachment evidence that would damage the victims’ credibility at a possible trial.\n\nNonetheless, a more open and straightforward approach with the victims, both before and\nafter the signing of the NPA, would have been the beter practice. Before the NPA was signed,\nvictims could have been asked for their views about the general terms the USAO was\ncontemplating offering, including that a plea to state charges was one of the options being\nconsidered; asked for their views in general about a guilty plea; or, at a minimum, asked to share\ntheir views of hou the case should be resolved. Even if the USAO ultimately determined to\nproceed with the NPA, the government would have had the benefit of the victims’ thoughts and\nconcerns, particularly on the issue of punishment, and victims would have felt included in the\nprocess. OPR found no evidence that the benefits of victim consultation were discussed or\nconsidered before the NPA was signed.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, no one from the government explained the agreement to the\nmajority of the victims until months later and only after the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea.\nAlthough the evidence supports Villafafia’s assertion that she acted from a good faith belief that\nEpstein might breach the NPA and a potential trial would be harmed if information about the NPA\nwas divulged to the victims and their counsel, she, Sloman, and Acosta failed to consider hou the\ndesire to shield the victims from that potential impeachment might impact the victims’ sense of\nthe openness and fairness of the process. As Wild stated during the CVRA litigation, she believed\nshe had been “mistreated in the process.” When deciding not to inform the victims of the NPA to\navoid creating impeachment evidence, Villafafia, Sloman, and Acosta do not appear to have\ncarefully considered possible alternatives to, or all of the ramifications of, that decision, nor did\nthey revisit the decision before Villafafia met the victims in person to discuss a potential trial or\nspoke to Edwards or other atorneys representing victims.*“° Furthermore, more atention needed\n446 It is not at all clear whether a court would have permited impeachment of the victims concerning one\nprovision in a plea agreement that otherwise could not be used as evidence. See Fed. R. Crim. P. ll(f) (“The\nadmissibility or inadmissibility of a plea, a plea discussion, and any related statement is governed by Federal Rule of\nEvidence 4lo.”).

The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim notification and consultation.

According to its website, the BOP’s current mission statement is\n“Corrections professionals who foster a humane and secure environment and ensure public safety by\npreparing individuals for successful reentry into our communities.” Houever, the DO] Office of the\nInspector General (OIG) has issued numerous reports over more than a decade identifying long-standing\noperational challenges facing the BOP that have negatively affected its ability to operate its institutions\nsafely and securely. Those reports have contained dozens of recommendations to the BOP. As we detail in\nthis report, many of those same operational challenges and systemic issues, including significant staffing\nshortages, providing appropriate custody and care of inmates at risk for suicide, the absence of functional\nsecurity camera systems, and management failures and widespread disregard of BOP policies and\nprocedures, were once again identified by the OIG during the course of this investigation and review into\nthe custody, care, and supervision of one of the BOP’s most notorious inmates, Jeffrey Epstein. We\ntherefore make further recommendations to the BOP in the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> of this report to help it address\nthese recurring issues.\nThe OIG initiated this investigation upon the receipt of information from the BOP that on the morning of\nAugust lo, 2ol9, in the Metropolitan Correctional Center located in New York, New York (MCC New York),\ninmate Jeffery Epstein was found hanged in his assigned cell within the Special Housing Unit (SHU). The SHU\nis a housing unit where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate population and kept locked\nin their cells for approximately 23 hours a day, to ensure their oun safety as well as the safety of staff and\nother inmates. Epstein had been placed in the SHU on July 7, 2ol9, the day after his arrest, due to the\nsignificant media coverage of his case and awareness of his notoriety among MCC New York inmates.\nAccording to information obtained by the OIG during the investigation, at approximately 8 p.m. on August 9,\nall SHU inmates, including Epstein, were locked in their cells for the evening. Additionally, the six separate\ntiers or groups of cells within the SHU were also securely locked. At approximately 6:3o a.m. on August lo,\n2ol9, SHU staff unlocked the door to the SHU tier in which Epstein’s cell was located in order to deliver\nbreakfast to inmates through the food slots in the locked cell doors. When SHU staff entered the tier to\ndeliver breakfast to Epstein, SHU staff knocked on the locked door to Epstein’s cell. Epstein, who was\nhoused alone in the cell, did not respond to SHU staff. SHU staff unlocked the cell door and found Epstein\nhanged in his cell, with one end of a piece of orange cloth around his neck and the other end tied to the top\nportion of a bunkbed in Epstein’s cell. Epstein was suspended from the top bunk in a near-seated position\nwith his butocks approximately l inch to l inch and a half off the floor and his legs extended straight out on\nthe floor in front of him. Epstein’s cell contained an excess amount of prison linens, as well as multiple\nnooses that had been made from torn prison linens.\nSHU staff immediately activated a body alarm, which notified all MCC New York staff of a medical emergency\nand prompted MCC New York staff assigned to the Control Center to call for 9ll emergency services. SHU\nstaff then ripped the orange cloth away from the bunkbed, which caused Epstein’s butocks to drop to the\nground. SHU staff laid Epstein on the ground and immediately initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation\n(CPR). At approximately 6:33 a.m., other MCC New York employees responded to the SHU. A responding\nMCC New York Lieutenant took over administering CPR and asked SHU staff to retrieve an automated\nexternal defibrillator and call for the duty nurse. A Clinical Nurse responded and continued to perform CPR\non Epstein in the place of the Lieutenant.

The\nMedical Examiner also cited to the absence of debris under Epstein’s fingernails, marks on his hands,\ncontusions to his knuckles, or bruises on his body that evidenced Epstein had been in a struggle, which\nwould be expected if Epstein’s death had been a homicide by strangulation.\nAs discussed in greater detail in the Conclusions and Recommendations chapter of this report, this is not\nthe first time that the OIG has found significant job performance and management failures on the part of\nBOP personnel and widespread disregard of BOP policies that are designed to ensure that inmates are safe,\nsecure, and in good health. The OIG has investigated numerous allegations related to the falsification of\nofficial BOP documentation concerning inmate counts and rounds and has repeatedly found deficiencies\nwith the BOP’s staffing levels, the custody and care of inmates at risk for suicide, and security camera\nsystems at BOP institutions. The combination of negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance\nfailures documented in this report all contributed to an environment in which arguably one of the most\nnotorious inmates in BOP’s custody was provided with the opportunity to take his oun life. The BOP’s\nfailures are troubling not only because the BOP did not adequately safeguard an individual in its custody,\nbut also because they led to questions about the circumstances surrounding Epstein’s death and effectively\ndeprived Epstein’s numerous victims of the opportunity to seek justice through the criminal justice process.\nThe fact that these failures have been recurring ones at the BOP does not excuse them and gives additional\nurgency to the need for DO) and BOP leadership to address the chronic problems plaguing the BOP.\nUnless otherwise noted, the OIG applies the preponderance of the evidence standard in determining\nwhether DO] personnel have commited misconduct.

Conclusions\nOur investigation and review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) custody, care, and supervision of\nJeffrey Epstein identified numerous and serious failures by employees of the Metropolitan Correctional\nCenter located in New York, New York (MCC New York), including falsifying BOP records relating to inmate\ncounts and rounds and multiple violations of MCC New York and BOP policies and procedures, which\ncompromised Epstein’s safety, the safety of other inmates, and the security of the institution. Specifically,\nwe found that MCC New York staff failed to undertake required measures designed to make sure that,\namong other things, Epstein and other inmates were accounted for and safe, such as conducting inmate\ncounts and 3o-minute rounds, searching inmate cells, and ensuring adequate supervision of the Special\nHousing Unit (SHU) and the functionality of MCC New York's security camera system.\nWe further found that multiple BOP employees submited false documents claiming that they had\nperformed the required counts and rounds and that several MCC New York staff members lacked candor\nwhen questioned by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) about their actions. Two MCC New York\nemployees, Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, were charged criminally with falsifying BOP records relating to\ntheir conducting inmate counts and rounds. The U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York\nsubsequently entered into deferred prosecution agreements with Noel and Thomas and the court\ndismissed all charges against them after Noel and Thomas successfully fulfilled the terms of their\nagreements. Prosecution was declined by the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York for\nother MCC New York employees assigned to the SHU on August 9-lo, 2ol9, who the OIG found also\ncreated, certified, and submited false documentation regarding inmate counts and rounds on the day\nbefore and the day of Epstein’s death.\nThe OIG also found that the MCC New York staff failed to carry out the Psychology Department's directive\nthat Epstein be assigned a cellmate and that an MCC New York supervisor alloued Epstein to make an\nunmonitored telephone call the evening before his death.\nThe OIG determined that the combination of these and other failures led to Epstein being alone and\nunmonitored in his cell, with an excessive amount of bed linens, from approximately lo:4o p.m. on\nAugust 9, until he was discovered hanged in his cell at approximately 6:3o a.m. the follouing day.\nAdditionally, the OIG found that staffing shortages, a persistent issue for the BOP, compromised the ability\nof MCC New York staff to adequately supervise inmates. As detailed belou, we make a number of\nrecommendations to the BOP to address the serious issues we identified during our investigation\nand review.\nWhile the OIG determined that MCC New York staff commited significant violations of BOP and MCC\nNew York policies and falsified records relating to their conducting inmate counts and rounds, the OIG did\nnot uncover evidence that contradicted the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) determination regarding\nthe absence of criminality in connection with hou Epstein died. All MCC New York staff members who were\ninterviewed by the OIG said they did not knou of any information suggesting that Epstein’s cause of death\nwas something other than suicide. Likewise, none of the interviewed inmates provided any credible\ninformation that Epstein’s cause of death was something other than suicide.\n94\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2346l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023464.jpg": "management failures at multiple levels within the BOP.*” Similar to the Bulger report, the numerous and\nserious transgressions that occurred in this mater came to light largely because they involved a high-profile\ninmate. The fact that serious deficiencies occurred in connection with high-profile inmates like Epstein and\nBulger is especially concerning given that the BOP would presumably take particular care in handling the\ncustody and care of such inmates.\nRegretably, the OIG has encountered similar issues on many other occasions. For example, the OIG has\ninvestigated numerous allegations related to the falsification of official BOP documentation concerning\ninmate counts and rounds, several of which have resulted in criminal prosecution. The OIG currently has\ntwo open investigations into allegations of falsified inmate count and round documentation, each involving\nan inmate death (by suicide and homicide) or escape from a BOP facility.\nThis investigation and review also revealed the direct impact of insufficient staffing levels on inmate safety.\nWitnesses repeatedly told the OIG that counts, rounds, cell searches, and other methods of inmate\naccountability were not undertaken because correctional staff were working multiple shifts—including one\nstaff member who worked 24-hours straight—and were tired and overwhelmed with other duties. As\ndiscussed in greater detail in our recommendations, the OIG has repeatedly found the need for BOP to\naddress staffing shortages. Most recently, in March 2o23, the OIG found that the coronavirus disease 2ol9\n(COVID-l9) pandemic exacerbated the effects of preexisting BOP medical and nonmedical staffing\nshortages, an issue the OIG has identified as a concern for the BOP since at least 2ol5.°°\nFurther, the OIG has repeatedly found that BOP personnel have not consistently been atentive to the needs\nof inmates at risk for suicide. In this investigation, that inatention manifested in the failure of MCC\nNew York staff and supervisors to ensure that Epstein was assigned a cellmate as required by the MCC\nNew York Psychology Department directive issued after the July 23, 2ol9 incident in which Epstein was\ndiscovered in his cell with an orange cloth around his neck. In a March 2o23 report, the OIG found that BOP\npsychology staff did not assess the suitability of single-cell assignments for five of the seven inmates who\ndied by suicide while in COVID-l9 quarantine units between March 2o2o and April 2o2l.°? The OIG’s 2ol7\nreport on the BOP’s use of restrictive housing for inmates with mental illness also noted that single-celling\nmay present risks to inmate mental health, and both of the recommendations from that report regarding\nthe use and oversight of single-celling remain open as of March 2o23.\nLastly, as discussed in greater detail in the conclusions and recommendations that follou, the persistent\ndeficiencies of the BOP’s security camera systems are well documented and long-standing.\n57 U.S. DOJ OIG, Investigation and Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Handling of the Transfer of Inmate James “Whitey”\nBulger, 23-oo7 (December 2o22).\n*8 U.S. DOJ OIG, Capstone Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Response to the Coronavirus Disease 2ol9 Pandemic,\nEvaluation and Inspections Division A-2o2o-oll (March 2o23) (Capstone Report).\n5° Capstone Report.\n6 U.S. DOJ OIG, Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Use of Restrictive Housing for Inmates with Mental Illness, Evaluation\nand Inspections Report l7-o5 (July 2ol7).\n\n97\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23464", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023481.jpg": "8. The BOP should enhance existing policies regarding institutional security camera\nsystems to ensure they specifically state that such systems must have the capacity to\nrecord video and that BOP institutions must conduct regular security camera system\nfunctionality checks.\n\nAs discussed in the Conclusions section of this chapter, the OIG found that, even though the highest levels\nof leadership knew of the MCC New York security camera system's recurring deficiencies, prior to Epstein’s\ndeath, no one was tasked with the responsibility of checking the security camera system on a routine basis\nto ensure that the system was functional. As a result, when on July 29, 2ol9, video from approximately half\nof the institution’s security cameras was no longer being recorded, the problem went undetected for\nll days. The OIG also found that there are no BOP policies that specifically state that security camera\nsystems must have the capacity to record or that institutional staff must perform periodic checks to ensure\nthe camera system is fully functional. Cameras that are failing to provide good quality or any live video\nstreams put the safety of BOP staff members and inmates at risk, and the lack of video recordings can\npotentially hinder investigations of wrongdoing by staff and inmates. The OIG therefore recommends that\nthe BOP enhance existing policies and protocols so they specifically state that all institutional security\ncamera systems must have the capacity to record, and that specified staff at each institution must conduct\nperiodic checks of the security camera system to determine its operational status and take corrective action\nas soon as possible when the system is found to be inoperable. Such routine checks would help ensure that\ncamera system malfunctions are detected and corrective actions are initiated in a timely manner.\n\nll4\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2348l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023748.jpg": "period with government issued picture identification, such as a\ndrivers license.

Cellmate Assignments\n\nDocumentation exists reflecting the role of the local Psychology Services department in communicating the\nimportance of Mr. Epstein's status as a sex offender with specific needs to the Associate Warden. This includes\nconsultation with the Psychology Services Branch in Central Office. The communication chain and decision\nmaking of Executive Staff lacks transparency as there is no documentation of the process or staff members\npresent when decisions were made about the housing of Mr. Epstein. After the fact explanations may not\naccurately reflect what occurred.\n\nInstitution Response:\n\nAs was noted, there was no documentation indicating Psychology Services was present when housing decisions\nwere made regarding Mr. Epstein. Psychology services is present at the weekly SHU meeting, Executive Staff\nmeetings, and weekly Opening and Close-Out meetings. During these meetings, the Chief Psychologist or\nActing Chief Psychologist are present to provide recommendations and feedback to the Executive Staff on\nhousing concerns regarding inmates with mental health issues or risk factors for suicidality. When an inmate\npresents with unique risk factors associated with individuals who have been charged with and/or convicted of a\nsex offense, careful evaluation is made with regard to housing these inmates with appropriate cellmates.\nMoving forward, a plan has been established to have a sign-in sheet and checklist at these meetings where\nhousing issues are addressed, indicating who was present and what the housing plan is for these inmates with\npsychological concerns. These checklists will be maintained in a binder by the Associate Warden of Programs.\nPlease see the atached checklist.\n\n4, Documentation Accuracy\n\nProfessional responsibility requires taking into account multiple descriptions of an incident as noted\n\nin your response. Houever, when discrepancies exist these should be compiled and noted in\n\ndocumentation to decrease the likelihood of conflicting conclusions.\n\nAs noted in the reconstruction report, an incident report must be writen within 24 hours of having\n\nthe information that an inmate likely violated BOP rules.\nPreconceived notions challenge the ability to remain open about alternative\nexplanations, and subsequent systemic changes may be needed.\n\nPlease develop and provide local training for all staff that at a minimum reviews the time frame for\n\nwriting incident reports and offers guidance when there is not clear evidence of an infraction. Include\n\nan outline of the training and evidence of staff who atended the training.\n\nInstitution Response:\n\nAdditional information (slides) has been included in our Annual Training presentations for Report Writing. In\naddition to the established training, the slides further differentiate and provide guidance to staff regarding when\nit is appropriate to write an Incident Report and when, in cases of a lack of evidence, a memorandum is more\nappropriate. The additional information is being provided to all staff as a part of Annual Training. Annual\nTraining began the week of January 6, 2o2o, and will continue through the week of March 8, 2o2o.\n\nZ\nDOJ-OGR-ooo25lo9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00025110.jpg": "Page 686\n5. Telephone Calls\nAs noted in the response, there is a lack of documentation to substantiate that a lieutenant facilitated two\ntelephone calls to Mr. Epstein. Houever, this does not address the report of two telephone calls being provided.\nThis response implies that the reporting of two staff members is inaccurate.\nThe response neglects the documented telephone call to Mr. Epstein's deceased mother.\nInstitution Response:\nOn August 29, 2ol9, Warden J.

The referral was submited to the Office of Internal\nAffairs on that same date and is pending further action at this time.\n7. Follou-Up\nPlease provide documentation for the follou-up training provided to staff detailing the content of the training\nand to whom it was provided.\nInstitution Response:\nAs recommended by Central Office, the Chief Psychologist has conducted suicide prevention trainings during\nDepartment Head Meetings, e-mail correspondence, SHU Staff Trainings, and Lieutenant’s Trainings. The\nfollou-up training sign-in sheets, Department Head Meeting Minutes, and e-mails provided by psychology staff\nregarding PSY ALERT Inmates are atached for your review.\n8.

Please provide an operational definition of periodic. Please do the same for routine, as it\nrelates Executive Staff bed book counts in all units. Where will the periodic and routine reviews be documented\nand will they include the identity (e.g., name and title) of staff who complete them?\nInstitution Response:\nAn Executive Staff and Duty Officer schedule has been implemented to conduct daily 4 P.M. and lo A.M.\nweekend bed book counts.

Atorney Log Books\nPlease provide a copy of the log book audit.\nInstitution Response:\nThe audit revealed the Random Visitor Log Book did not reflect visitor pat searches after May l9, 2ol9. In\naddition, the log book does not offer a column to annotate a staff witness. The Contractor/Volunteer Log\nBook was not always filled in properly. The Law Enforcement Log Book was up to date; houever, the time of\ndeparture was not always documented. The Atorney Log was missing inmate register numbers and more often\nthan not was legible.

According to the Report\nof Incident, on August lo, 2ol9, at approximately 6:33 a.m., while serving the breakfast meal in\nthe SHU, Range 9 South, Mr. Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell.

Cardiopulmonary\nresuscitation (CPR) reportedly continued while the AED was placed on Mr. Epstein. The AED\nreportedly indicated no shock advised and CPR was continued. Mr. Epstein was escorted to\nHealth Services at approximately 6:39 a.m., and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) arrived at\n6:43 a.m. He was transported to the local hospital at approximately 7:lo a.m. Mr. Epstein was\npronounced deceased at 7:36 am. It was not possible to confirm this timeline without viewing\nvideo footage.\nCONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS_\nA general appreciation of risk factors for suicide specific to sex offenders is necessary when\nreviewing Mr. Epstein’s death. These factors, as well as more general risk factors for suicide,\nwere likely present. There are several common factors that increase risk for suicide in\nindividuals with a history of a sexual offense. These include stigma due to the nature of\nsexually-based crimes (both within society and the prison system), a disruption of the ability to\nutilize sex as a coping mechanism (which can lead to increased levels of distress and negative\naffect), and grief about loss experienced in regards to arrest. This grief may be secondary to the\nloss of former lifestyle, loss of physical items or collections related to sexual offenses, and/or the\nloss of perceived relationships with victims. Other factors that may increase risk for suicide\namong individuals accused of a sex offense include safety concerns, potentially long sentences,\nand lack of skills necessary to navigate social relationships in prison.\nMr. Epstein was a high-profile, pretrial detainee awaiting trial on sex trafficking offenses. He\nhad been a successful, wealthy businessman with a number of high-profile acquaintances that he\naccumulated through a combination of charisma, charm, and intelligence. Despite his many\nassociates, he had limited significant or deep interpersonal ties.

He has been observed pacing the cell as well as sleeping, eating,\nand drinking within normal limits.\nUpon interview today, Mr. EPSTEIN requested he be provided a toothbrush as well as a shouer. His requests were\nmade knoun to the lieutenants and he was provided a shouer prior to atending his legal visit. This writer also provided\nhim a toothbrush, toothpaste, and hygiene products.\nReason for Removal from Watch\nMr. EPSTEIN stated, \"I have no interest in killing myself.\" He explained although his situation is \"not perfect\" due to his\nbeing incarcerated, he noted he has \"lots to do for [his] legal case.\" He described having a \"wonderful life,\" to include\ninteractions with \"interesting people and projects.\" He said \"it would be crazy\" to take his life.

He asked if he could remain on this status for a couple of days, he was advised his housing situation will be\nre-evaluated on a day-to-day basis. He expressed a desire to be housed in general population rather than in the SHU\nand asked if there were a \"safer\" unit for him to be housed in comparison to the one where he was initially placed. Mr.\nEPSTEIN claimed there were many MS-l3 gang members on the initial unit.

The provision of the NPA dealing with\nco-conspirators does not expressly state that it binds\nU.S. Atorneys in other districts. It does not expressly\nstate that it applies in other districts. The relevant\nlanguage, in its entirety, reads as follous: “the United\nStates also agrees that it will not institute any crimi-\nnal charges against any potential co-conspirators of\nEpstein.” Dkt. No. l42-l at 5. Under Annabi, Salameh,\nand Gonzalez, a statement that “the United States”\nagrees not to prosecute implies no restriction on\nprosecutions in other districts.\n\nTwo provisions of the NPA refer specifically to\nprosecution in the Southern District of Florida. The\nfirst states that the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida will defer “prosecution in this\nDistrict” if Epstein complies with the agreement. Dkt.\nNo. l42-l at 2. The second states that no prosecution\n“will be instituted in this District, and the charges\nagainst Epstein if any, will be dismissed” after he\nfulfills the agreement’s conditions. Maxwell contends\nthat the lack of similar language in the co-conspirator\nprovision must mean that it lacks any geographical\nlimitation. If anything, that language reflects that the\nNPA’s scope was expressly limited to the Southern\nDistrict of Florida. It is not plausible—let alone\n“affirmatively apparent”, Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672,—\nthat the parties intended to drastically expand the\nagreement’s geographic scope in the single sentence on\nthe prosecution of co-conspirators without clearly so\nsaying.\n\nWithout an affirmative statement in the NPA’s text,\nMaxwell turns to its negotiation history.

The Third Circuit reached the same\n<span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> in United States v. Schneider, 8ol F.3d l86,\nl96 (3d Cir. 2ol5).\n\nThe Court sees no reason to depart from the\nreasoning in Weingarten. First, “[t]he Supreme Court's\nmodern categorical approach jurisprudence is confined\nto the post-conviction contexts of criminal sentencing\nand immigration deportation cases.” Weingarten, 865\nF.3d at 58. To the extent that the categorical approach\nis ever appropriate in other contexts, it is in-\nappropriate here.\n\nThe Court begins with the statute’s text. Statutes\nthat call for application of the categorical approach\ntypically deal with the elements of an offense in a prior\ncriminal conviction. Id. at 59. “The language of § 32838,\nby contrast, reaches beyond the offense and its legal\nelements to the conduct ‘involv[ed]’ in the offense. That\nlinguistic expansion indicates Congress intended courts to\nlook beyond the bare legal charges in deciding whether\n§ 3283 applied.” Jd. at 59-6o (alteration in original)\n(quoting § 3283). Maxwell cites one case holding\notherwise, but that case involved a venue statute\npresenting significantly different concerns. See United\nStates v. Morgan, 393 F.3d l92, 2oo (D.C. Cir. 2oo4).\nThe Supreme Court has likewise held that a statute\nwhich uses the language “an offense that. . . involves\nfraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or\nvictims exceeds $lo,ooo” is “consistent with a\ncircumstance-specific approach.” Nijhawan v. Holder,\n557 US. 29, 32, 38 (2oo9) (emphasis added). Thus, the\nword “involves” generally means that courts should\nlook to the circumstances of an offense as commited\nin each case. This reading accords with a robust\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooool27", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000129.tif": "66a\n\nan alternative basis for its holding, it explained that\nthe offense did not require fraud as an “essential\ningredient.” Jd. at 222. It reached that <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> in\nlarge part because the statute’s legislative history\nmade clear that Congress intended it to apply only to\na narrou class of war frauds causing pecuniary loss.\nId. at 2l6.\n\nAs the Second Circuit explained in Weingarten,\nCongress had the opposite intent in the enacting in the\nPROTECT Act. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 59 & n. lo. “In\npassing recent statutes related to child sex abuse,\nincluding extensions of the § 3283 limitations period,\nCongress ‘evinced a general intention to “cast a wide\nnet to ensnare as many offenses against children as\npossible.”” Id. at 6o (quoting Schneider, 8ol F.3d at\nl96 (quoting United States v. Dodge, 597 F.3d l347,\nl355 (llth Cir. 2olo) (en banc))). The primary basis for\nBridges’ holding— legislative history supporting a\nnarrou interpretation—does not exist here. Instead,\nboth the statute’s plan meaning and its legislative\nhistory suggest it should apply more broadly.\n\nBased on the statute’s text, context, and history,\nthe Court follous Weingarten and concludes that the\nappropriate inquiry is whether the charged offenses\ninvolved the sexual abuse of a minor on the facts\nalleged in this case. There is no question that they did.\nThe Court thus concludes that § 3283 governs the\nlimitations period for the charges here.\n\n2. The 2oo3 amendment to the statute of\nlimitations applies to these offenses\n\nMaxwell next contends that because the charged\nconduct took place before the PROTECT Act’s enactment,\nthat statute did not lengthen the statute of limitations\napplicable to her alleged offenses. Here too, the Second\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooool29", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000131.tif": "68a\n\nthat it apply to prosecutions for offenses commited\nbefore the date of enactment. Instead of simply\nproviding a new limitations period for future conduct,\nCongress stated that no statute of limitations that\nwould otherwise preclude prosecution of these offenses\nwill apply. That is, it prevents the application of any\nstatute of limitations that would otherwise apply to\npast conduct.\n\nCourts have reached the same <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> for other\nstatutes employing similar language. The Eighth\nCircuit has held that the l994 amendments to § 3283,\nwhich alloued prosecution of sex crimes against\nchildren until the victim reached age twenty-five,\napplied to past conduct. See United States v. Jeffries,\n4o5 F.3d 682, 684-85 (8th Cir. 2oo5). The Second\nCircuit has observed that the Higher Education\nTechnical Amendments of l99l, Pub. L. No. lo2-26,\nlo5 Stat. l23, illustrates language that requires a\nstatute’s application to past conduct. See Enter. Mortg.\nAcceptance Co., LLC, Sec. Litig., 39l F.3d at 4o7. That\nstatute eliminated the statute of limitations for claims\non defaulted student loans by stating that “no\nlimitation shall terminate the period within which suit\nmay be filed.” Jd. The PROTECT Act’s language is\nquite similar.\n\nThe history of § 3283 confirms Congress’s intent to\napply the extended limitations period as broadly as the\nConstitution allous. With each successive amendment\nto the statute, Congress further extended the limitations\nperiod, recognizing that sex crimes against children\n“may be difficult to detect quickly” because children\noften delay or decline to report sexual abuse.\nWeingarten, 865 F.3d at 54. Congress enacted the\nlimitations provision of the PROTECT Act because it\nfound the prior statute of limitations was “inadequate\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooool3l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000153.tif": "9oa\nindictment and so does resolve any such issues here.\nHouever, Maxwell’s motion seeking to dismiss the $l\nsuperseding indictment because it was returned by a\ngrand jury siting at the White Plains courthouse\nappears moot.

Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea.

These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nI. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\n7 In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\n8 OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nvil\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23oo7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023009.tif": "of immunity, or (6) the deportation of criminal aliens. The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">Conclusion</span> That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\n\nIx\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23oo9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023010.tif": "find evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA.

Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims.

ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23ol2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023021.tif": "carefully considered the comments and made changes, or noted comments, as OPR deemed\nappropriate; OPR did not, houever, alter its findings and conclusions.\n\nFinally, OPR reviewed relevant case law, statutes, regulations, Department policy, and\natorney professional responsibility rules as necessary to resolve the issues presented in this case\nand to determine whether the subjects commited professional misconduct.\n\nAs part of its investigation, OPR examined the interactions between state officials and the\nfederal investigators and prosecutors, but because OPR does not have jurisdiction over state\nofficials, OPR did not investigate, or reach conclusions about, their conduct regarding the state\ninvestigation.’ Because OPR’s mission is to ensure that Department atorneys adhere to the\nstandards of professional conduct, OPR’s investigation focused on the actions of the subject\natorneys rather than on determining the full scope of Epstein’s and his assistants’ criminal\nbehavior. Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.® Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nIW. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\n7 In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\n8 OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nvil\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o2l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023023.tif": "of immunity, or (6) the deportation of criminal aliens. The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">Conclusion</span> That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\n\nIx\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o23", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023024.tif": "initiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge.

Lourie directed Menchel’s atention to particular pages of the prosecution\nmemorandum, noting that the “keys” were whether the USAO could prove that Epstein traveled\nfor the purpose of engaging in sexual acts, and the fact that some minor victims told Epstein they\nwere l8.3” Lourie asked for Menchel’s “very general opinion as to whether this is a case you think\nthe office should do,” and reminded Menchel that the State Atorney’s Office “went out of their\nway to get a no-bill on this . . . and thus only charged adult solicitation, which they would bargain\naway to nothing.”\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Menchel said that Lourie’s email transmiting the prosecution\nmemorandum was his “official introduction” to the case and at that point in time, he had never\nheard of Epstein and had no information about his background. He recalled that the USAO had\nbeen asked to review the case because the state had not handled it appropriately. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that he had litle memory about the facts of the case or what contemporaneous\nopinions he formed about it.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he could not recall whether he ever read Villafafia’s prosecution\nmemorandum, explaining that he “would typically rely on senior staff,’ who had more\nprosecutorial experience, and that instead of reading the memorandum, he may have discussed the\ncase with Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, who he assumed would have read the document. Acosta\n37 In various submissions to the USAO, the defense contended that the federal statute required proof that\nengaging in a sexual act was the “paramount or dominant purpose” of Epstein’s travel, but that Epstein’s travel was\nmotivated by his desire to live outside of New York for over half of each year for tax purposes. The defense also\nasserted that the federal statutes at issue required proof that the defendant knew the victims were under l8, but that\nEpstein “took affirmative steps to ensure that every woman was at least l8 years of age.” In her prosecution\nmemorandum, houever, Villafafia set forth her <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the statute only required proof that engaging in a sexual\nact was one of the motivating factors for the travel. She also concluded that the statutes did not require proof that the\ndefendant knew the victims were minors.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o64", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023068.tif": "he is comfortable before proceeding.” Menchel told Villafafia he had “trouble understanding” why\nshe was in a “rush” “given hou long this case has been pending.”\n\nOPR questioned Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta about the timeline for reviewing\nthe prosecution memorandum and the proposed charges. Acosta and Menchel believed Villafafia’s\ntimeline was unrealistic from the start. Acosta told OPR that Villafafia was “very hard charging,”\nbut her timeline for filing charges in the case was “really, really fast.” Menchel described Villafafia\nas “out over her skis a litle bit” and “ahead of” Acosta in terms of his analysis of the case.*\nMenchel said it was clear to him that Acosta “was going to be the one making the call” about\nwhether to go forward with charges, and Acosta needed more time to make a decision. Menchel\ntold OPR, “This [was] not a case [we were] going to review in two weeks and make a decision\non.” Sloman told OPR that although he did not conduct a “granular review” of the proposed\ncharges, he believed Menchel and Lourie had done so and “obviously” had concluded that “the\nfacts and the law didn’t suggest that the right thing to do was to automatically indict.” Lourie told\nOPR that he believed “the case was moving ahead.”\n\nVillafafia continued to seek direction from her managers. On May l5, 2oo7, she emailed\nSloman, noting that “[i]t seemed from our discussion yesterday that pestering Alex [Acosta] will\nnot do any good. Am I right about that?” Sloman responded, “Yes.” On May 2l, 2oo7, three\nweeks after submiting the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia emailed Sloman and Menchel\nasking for “a sense of the direction where we are headed-i.e., approval of an indictment something\nlike the current draft, a complaint to allou for pre-indictment negotiations, an indictment\ndrastically different from the current draft?” Sloman responded only, “Taken care of.”\n\nD. Defense Counsel Seek a Meeting with Senior USAO Managers, which\n\nVillafaia Opposes\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein’s defense counsel continued to seek additional information about the\nfederal investigation and a meeting with senior USAO managers, including Acosta. In a May lo,\n2oo7 email to Menchel, Lourie reported that Epstein’s atorneys “want me to tell them the statutes\n“4 Villafafia explained to OPR that the “rush” related to her concern that Epstein was continuing to abuse girls:\n“Tn terms of the issue of why the hurry, because child sex offenders don’t stop until they’re behind bars. That was our\ntime concern.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia offering this explanation to him. OPR\nnotes that in their respective statements to OPR and in their comments on OPR’s draft report, Menchel and Villafafia\nexpressed contradictory accounts or interpretations of certain events. When it was necessary for OPR to resolve those\nconflicts in order to reach its findings and conclusions, OPR considered the extensive documentary record and the\ntestimony of other subjects and witnesses, to the extent available.\n\n45 Sloman similarly recalled that Menchel thought Villafafia was “ahead of where the office was internally” and\nthat caused “discontent” between Villafafia and Menchel. Villafafia was not the only one, houever, who was surprised\nthat the indictment was not approved immediately. The case agent told OPR that it seemed “everything changed”\nafter Villafafia submited the prosecution memorandum, and the momentum touards an indictment abated. Villafafia’s\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that from her perspective, it appeared “Miami didn’t want the case prosecuted.”\nHouever, Menchel rebuked Villafafia in his July 5, 2oo7 email to her for having “led the agents to believe that [filing\ncharges in] this mater was a foregone <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>.”\n\n46 Sloman could not recall during his OPR interview what he meant by this remark, but he speculated that he\nhad spoken to Menchel, and Menchel was going to take care of it.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o68", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023073.tif": "Lourie opined that the government could argue “that over time [Epstein] set up a network of illegal\nhigh school massage recruits that would be difficult to duplicate anywhere else,” which supported\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the massages must have been a motivating purpose of his travel, if not the sole\npurpose. Houever, Lourie expressed concern about “geting to the jury” on this issue and noted\nthat he had not found a legal case factually on point. Villafafia told OPR that she disagreed with\nLourie’s analysis of the purpose of travel issue and had discussed the mater with him. Villafafia\nalso recalled that there were aspects of the defense submissions she and her colleagues considered\n“particularly weak.”\n\nOn June 26, 2oo7, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, Villafafia, the case agent, and the West Palm\nBeach squad supervisor met at the Miami USAO with Epstein atorneys Dershouitz, Black,\nLefcourt, and Sanchez. Dershouitz led the defense team’s presentation. From the USAO\nperspective, the meeting was merely a “listening session.”°* Echoing the arguments made in\nLefcourt’s leter, Dershouitz argued that the USAO should permit the state to handle the case\nbecause these were “traditionally state offenses.” The case agent recalled being uncomfortable\nthat the defense was asking questions in an atempt to gain information about the federal\ninvestigation, including the number of victims and the types of sexual contact that had been\ninvolved.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when Epstein’s atorneys left the meeting, they appeared to be\n“under the impression that they had convinced us not to proceed.” But Menchel told OPR, “[T]hey\nobviously did not persuade” the USAO because “we . . . didn’t drop the investigation.” According\nto Villafafia, Lourie, and Menchel, during a short post-meeting discussion at which Lourie\nexpressed concern about the purpose of travel issue and Menchel raised issues related to general\ncredibility of the victims, the prevailing sense among the USAO participants was that the defense\npresentation had not been persuasive. Villafafia told OPR that she “left [the meeting] with the\nimpression that we were continuing touards” filing charges.\n\nIV. ACOSTA DECIDES TO OFFER EPSTEIN A TWO-YEAR STATE PLEA TO\n\nRESOLVE THE FEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nUSAO internal communications shou that in July 2oo7, Acosta developed, or adopted, the\nbroad outline of an agreement that could resolve the federal investigation. The agreement would\nleave the case in state court by requiring Epstein to plead guilty to state charges, but would\naccomplish three goals important to the federal prosecutors: Epstein’s incarceration; his\nregistration as a sexual offender; and a mechanism to provide for the victims to recover monetary\n3 Villafafia also told OPR that Lourie had, at times, expressed concern about the prosecution’s ability to prove\nEpstein’s knouledge of the victims’ ages, particularly with regard to those who were l6 or l7 at the time they provided\nmassages.\n\n“4 In his writen response to OPR, Menchel indicated that he had no independent recollection of the June 26,\n2oo7 meeting. In his OPR interview, Menchel said that although he had litle memory of the meeting, to the best of\nhis recollection the USAO simply listened to the defense presentation, and in a contemporaneous email, Menchel\nopined that he viewed the upcoming June 26 meeting as “more as [the USAO] listening and them presenting their\nposition.”\n35\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o73", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023080.tif": "Menchel’s reply email began with a rebuke:\nBoth the tone and substance of your email are totally inappropriate\nand, in combination with other maters in the past, it seriously calls\nyour judgment into question.\nAs you well knou, the US Atorney has not even decided whether\nto go forward with a prosecution in this mater, thus you should have\nrespected his position before engaging in plea negotiations.\nAlong that same line, despite whatever contrary representations you\nmade to the agents in this mater, it was made clear to you by the US\nAtorney and the First Assistant from the time when you were first\nauthorized to investigate Mr. Epstein that the office had concerns\nabout taking this case because of petit [sic] policy and a number of\nlegal issues. Despite being told these things, you prepared a pros\nmemo and indictment that included a definitive date for indictment.\nIt has come to my atention that you led the agents to believe that\nthe indictment of this mater was a foregone <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> and that our\ndecision to put off that date and listen to the defense atorneys’\nconcerms is indicative of the office having second thoughts about\nindicting. As you well knew, you were never given authorization\nby anyone to seek an indictment in this case.°°\nIn the email, Menchel went on to explain the circumstances of his conversation with\nSanchez and respond to Villafafia’s complaints:\nLilly Sanchez called me before, not after, the June 26th meeting. It\nwas an informal discussion and not in the nature of an official plea\noffer but rather a feeling out by both sides as to what it might take\nto resolve the mater. As you are also well aware, the only reason\nwhy this office even agreed to look into the Epstein mater in the\nfirst instance was because of concerns that the State had not done an\nadequate job in vindicating the victims’ rights. As you and the\nagents conceded, had Epstein been convicted of a felony that\nresulted in a jail sentence and sex offender status, neither the FBI\nnor our office ever would have interceded. You should also knou\nthat my discussion with Lilly Sanchez was made with the US\nAtorney’s full knouledge. Had Lilly Sanchez expressed interest in\npursuing this avenue further, I certainly would have raised it with all\nthe interested individuals in this case, including you and the agents.\nIn any event, I fail to see hou a discussion that went nouhere has\nhurt our bargaining position.

See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 9o9 F.2d 738, 74l-42 (2d Cir.\nl99o) (rejecting claim that plea was involuntary because of pressure placed upon a defendant by\nthe government’s insistence that a defendant’s wife would not be offered a plea bargain unless he\npled guilty); Martin v.

OVERVIEW\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald report in November 2ol8, media scrutiny of and public\natention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart\nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s l8-month sentence, which resulted in a l3-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal\nconduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from\nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making\nprocess leading to the signed NPA. As a result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s\nmotivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors\nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the\nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because\nthey were motivated by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships\nwith his atorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\n\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the follouing core questions: (l) who\nwas responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its\nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules\nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by\nimproper factors, such as corruption or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness\ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shous in detail the process that led to the NPA, from\nthe initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.\nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and extensive\ninterviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions\nconcerning the NPA’s origins and development. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth\nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\nI. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS\n\nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\n\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knouledge of its terms. He\nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that\nhe either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the\ncase against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled\nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta\ndid not make such a claim to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged\nresolution, two years .. . , registration and restitution, . . . ultimately that was approved on my\nauthority. ... [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, l... accept that. I’m not... pushing away\nresponsibility for it.”\n\nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia were involved in the mater to varying degrees, at\nl33\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l7l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023172.tif": "different points in time, and regarding different decisions. Menchel, for example, participated in\nformulating the USAO’s initial writen offer to the defense, but he had no involvement with actions\nor decisions made after August 3, 2oo7. Sloman was absent during part of the most intense\nnegotiations in September 2oo7 and did not see the final, signed version of the NPA until he\nreturned. Villafafia and Lourie participated in the negotiations, and Lourie either made decisions\nduring the September l2, 2oo7 meeting with the defense and State Atorney’s Office, or at least\nindicated agreement pending Acosta’s approval. In any event, whatever the level of Sloman’s,\n\nMenchel’s, Lourie’s, and Villafafia’s involvement, they acted with the knouledge and approval of\n\nAcosta.\n\nUnder OPR’s analytical framework, an atorney who makes a good faith atempt to\nascertain the obligations and standards imposed on the atorney and to comply with them in a given\nsituation does not commit professional misconduct. Evidence that an atorney made a good faith\natempt to ascertain and comply with the obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not\nlimited to, the fact that the atorney consulted with a supervisor.”°? In this regard, OPR’s\nframework is similar to a standard provision of the professional conduct rules of most state bars,\nwhich specify that a subordinate lawyer does not engage in misconduct if that lawyer acts in\naccordance with a supervisory lawyer’s reasonable resolution of an arguable question of\nprofessional duty. See, e.g., FRPC 4-5.2(b). Therefore, in addition to the fact that OPR did not\nfind a violation of a clear and unambiguous standard as discussed belou, OPR concludes that\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia did not commit professional misconduct with respect to\nany aspect of the NPA because they acted under Acosta’s direction and with his approval.\n\nIW. OPR FOUND THAT NONE OF THE SUBJECTS VIOLATED A CLEAR AND\nUNAMBIGUOUS STATUTE, PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY RULE OR\nSTANDARD, OR DEPARTMENT REGULATION OR POLICY, IN\nNEGOTIATING, APPROVING, OR ENTERING INTO THE NPA\nA central issue OPR addressed in its investigation relating to the NPA was whether any of\n\nthe subjects, in developing, negotiating, or entering into the NPA, violated any clear and\n\nunambiguous standard established by rule, regulation, or policy. OPR does not find professional\nmisconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous\nstandard. OPR considered three specific areas: (l) standards implicated by the decision to decline\n\na federal court prosecution; (2) standards implicated by the decision to resolve the federal\n\ninvestigation through a non-prosecution agreement; and (3) standards implicated by any of the\n\nNPA’s provisions, including the promise not to prosecute unidentified third parties. As discussed\n\nbelou, OPR concludes that in each area, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his\n\ndecisions were based on corrupt or improper influences, the U.S. Atorney possessed broad\ndiscretionary authority to proceed as he saw fit, authority that he could delegate to subordinates,\nand that Acosta’s exercise of his discretionary authority did not breach any clear and unambiguous\nstandard. As a result, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\n\n2o2 The failure to fully advise a supervisor of relevant and material facts can warrant a finding that the subordinate\n\natorney has not acted in “good faith.” OPR did not find evidence supporting such a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> here, and Acosta did\n\nnot claim that he was unaware of material facts needed to make his decision.\n\nl34\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l72", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023179.tif": "to prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.”\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA. OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l79", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023187.tif": "been concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on . . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a <span class=\"highlight\">Conclusion</span> That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by corruption, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\nrestitution for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.*”” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n22l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . | was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\n\n222 Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\n\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\n\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\n\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\n\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so well.\n\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l87", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023188.tif": "reconsider the provision. Acosta could certainly have modified or eliminated the provision entirely\nif his motivation was to benefit Epstein or Epstein’s atorneys.\n\nSecond, Epstein himself was not satisfied with the NPA. Immediately after signing the\nagreement, he sought to have the Department nullify it by declaring federal involvement in the\ninvestigation inappropriate. In addition to repeatedly atacking the NPA in his submissions to the\nDepartment, Epstein added to his evidentiary challenges and federalism claims allegations of\nmisconduct and improper bias on the part of specific USAO personnel. Epstein’s dissatisfaction\nwith the NPA, and his personal atacks on individual prosecutors involved in negotiating the\nagreement, appear inconsistent with a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the subjects designed the NPA for Epstein’s\nbenefit.\n\nD. OPR Does Not Find That the Subjects’ Preexisting Relationships with Defense\n\nCounsel, Decisions to Meet with Defense Counsel, and Other Factors\nEstablished That the Subjects Acted from Improper Influences or Provided\nImproper Benefits to Epstein\n\nIn evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered various other factors featured in media\naccounts to shou that the subjects provided improper benefits to Epstein or which purportedly\nsuggested that the subjects acted from improper influences. OPR examined these factors but did\nnot find that they supported a finding that the subjects were influenced by favoritism, bias, or other\nimproper motivation.\n\nl. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects Extended Any\nImproper Benefit to Epstein because of Their Preexisting Relationships\nwith His Atorneys\n\nEpstein’s wealth enabled him to hire multiple atorneys who had preexisting personal\nconnections to some of the government atorneys involved in his case, in the State Atorney’s\nOffice, in the USAO, and elsewhere in the Department. Based on the atorneys Epstein selected\nto represent him, a reasonable inference can be drawn that Epstein believed that hiring atorneys\nwith relationships to the prosecutors would be beneficial to him. One of the first atorneys who\ncontacted the USAO on Epstein’s behalf was Guy Lewis, a former AUSA in and U.S. Atorney\nfor the Southern District of Florida. Villafafia and Lourie had worked for Lewis, and Lourie was\nclose friends with one of Lewis’s law partners. Epstein also retained Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former\nAUSA who had been Menchel’s deputy and with whom he had socialized. Later, when Epstein\nwas seeking Acosta’s personal involvement in the case, Epstein hired Kenneth Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz, prominent atorneys from Kirkland & Ellis with whom Acosta was acquainted from\nhis previous employment with that firm.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she believed Acosta “was influenced by the stature of Epstein’s\natorneys.” Critically, houever, other than the information regarding Menchel that is discussed in\nthe follouing subsection, neither Villafafia nor any of the other individuals OPR interviewed\nidentified any specific evidence suggesting that Acosta, or any of the other subjects, extended an\nimproper favor or benefit to Epstein because of a personal relationship with defense counsel (or\nfor any other improper reason). Villafafia explained hou, in her view, the “legal prouess” of\nEpstein’s atorneys had an impact on the case:\n\nl5o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l88", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023189.tif": "[O]ne of the issues in the case was the . . . defense’s ability to\ndescribe the case or characterize the case as being legally complex.\nIt was not as legally complex as they made it out to be. But because\nthey were able to convince members of our office that it was\nsomehou extremely novel and legally complex, the issue became\nwho was likely to succeed in arguing these legal issues. And\nbecause of that, the legal prouess, if you will, of the atorneys [ ]\n[became] something to consider.\n\nI think that the ability of Alan Dershouitz and Ken Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz to convince Alex Acosta that I didn’t knou what I was\ntalking [about] also, all came into play. So I think there were a\nnumber of factors and it all came together.\n\nAlthough Villafafia was critical of Acosta’s consideration of the defense arguments, she\nconceded that the defense team’s tactics demonstrated effective advocacy. Certainly, throughout\nthe case, Epstein’s atorneys prepared lengthy memoranda analyzing the evidence and arguing\nnuanced legal points concerning federalism, the elements of numerous federal criminal statutes,\nand the evidence relevant to those statutes, but it is not unusual or unreasonable for prosecutors to\ncarefully consider well-crafted legal arguments from defense counsel.\n\nThere is litle question that Epstein’s extensive team of atorneys was able to obtain\nnegotiated benefits for Epstein—although the USAO never wavered from its three core\nrequirements, it did agree to a reduction in prison time from its original offer, and it granted Epstein\ncertain other concessions during the negotiations. Epstein’s wealth provided him with skilled,\nexperienced negotiators who continually sought various incremental concessions, and with\natorneys who knew hou to obtain Department review of a USAO mater, thereby delaying\nundesired outcomes for as long as possible.’”? Despite Epstein’s evident intentions, houever, OPR\ndid not find evidence warranting a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the NPA or its terms resulted from the subjects’\nrelationships with the atorneys he had selected to represent him.\n\n2. The Subjects Asserted That Their Relationships with Defense Counsel\nDid Not Influence Their Actions\n\nAcosta, Menchel, Sloman, and Lourie each asserted that Epstein’s choice of counsel did\nnot affect his handling of the case. Menchel told OPR that once in private practice, former\ncolleagues often became adversaries. In Menchel’s view, such preexisting relationships were\nuseful because they afforded a defense atorney initial credibility and an insight into the issues a\nprosecutor would likely view as areas of concern, which enabled the defense atorney to “tailor”\narguments in a way that would maximize their persuasive impact on the USAO. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that these advantages did not “move the needle in any major way,” and he\n“reject[ed] the notion” that anyone in the USAO had been “swayed” because of preexisting\n223 As Chief Reiter later observed in his deposition testimony, “[T]he Epstein case was an instance of a many\nmillion dollars defense and what it can accomplish.”\n\nl5l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l89", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023192.tif": "Menchel told OPR that when he and Sanchez were in the USAO, they had a social\nrelationship, which included, in 2oo3, “a handful of dates over a period of two to three weeks. We\ndecided that . . . this was probably best not to pursue, and we mutually agreed to not do that.”?°\nApart from that, he stated they were “close” and “hung out,” and he asserted that this was knoun\nin the office at the time. Menchel said that his relationship with Sanchez “changed dramatically”\nwhen she left the office for private practice, and that by the time he became involved in the Epstein\ninvestigation, he had dated and married his wife, and his contact with Sanchez would “most likely”\nhave been at office events and when she atended his wedding.””’ Menchel added, “[T]hat was\nthree and a half years [prior] for a very brief period of time, and I don’t think I gave it a moment’s\nthought.”\n\nWhen asked by OPR about the basis for the decision to make an offer of a two-year term\nof incarceration, Menchel said that he did not recall discussions about the two-year offer and did\nnot recall hou the office arrived at that figure. In response to OPR’s question, Menchel stated that\nhis relationship with Sanchez did “[n]ot at all” affect his handling of the Epstein case. Moreover,\nMenchel asserted that the contemporaneous documentary record supports a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that it was\nAcosta, not Menchel, who made the decision to resolve the case with the two-year term.\n\nOPR carefully considered the documentary record on this point, as well as the statements\nto OPR from Menchel, Villafafia, Sloman, and Acosta, and concludes that there is no evidence\nsupporting the suggestion that the plea was instigated by Menchel as a favor to defense counsel.\nThe USAO’s first plea overture to defense counsel, which took place sometime before June 26,\n2oo7, occurred when Menchel spoke with Sanchez about the possibility of resolving the federal\ncase with a state plea that required jail time and sexual offender registration. According to the\nemail, “[iJt was a non-starter” for the defense. In the lengthy email exchange with Villafafia in\nearly July 2oo7, Menchel told her that his discussion with Sanchez about a state-based resolution\nwas made with Acosta’s “full knouledge.” Acosta corroborated this statement, telling OPR that\nalthough he did not remember a specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based\nresolution, he was certain Menchel would not have discussed this potential resolution with defense\ncounsel “without having discussed it with me.” Moreover, the defense did not immediately\n226 Acosta, Sloman, and Lourie each told OPR that in 2oo7, he was not aware that Menchel had previously dated\nSanchez. OPR questioned the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer regarding whether Menchel had an\nobligation to inform his supervisors of his dating relationship. The Professional Responsibility Officer said that it\nwould depend on “hou long the relationship was and hou compromised the individual felt he might appear to be,”\nbut he would have expected Menchel to raise the issue with Acosta. The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR\nthat if he had been approached for advice at the time, he would have asked for more facts, but “[g]iven the sensitivity\nof the [Epstein] mater, [my advice] would probably have been to tell him to step back and let somebody else take it\nover.” Menchel told OPR that if his relationship with Sanchez had turned into something more than a handful of\ndates, he would have advised his supervisors. Although OPR does not conclude Menchel’s prior relationship with\nSanchez influenced the Epstein investigation, OPR assesses that it would have been prudent for Menchel to have\ninformed his supervisors so they could make an independent assessment as to whether his continued involvement in\nthe Epstein investigation might create the appearance of a loss of impartiality.\n\n227 Menchel’s Outlook records also indicate he scheduled lunch with Sanchez on at least one occasion, in early\n2oo6, after she left the USAO.\n228 In addition, Villafafia recalled Menchel stating at the July 26, 2oo7 meeting that “Alex has decided to offer\na two year state deal.”\nl54\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l92", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023197.tif": "The meeting of USAO representatives and Epstein’s defense atorneys, together with the\nState Atorney and the lead state prosecutor on September l2, 2oo7, was a necessary part of the\nNPA negotiation process.\n\nEven after the NPA was signed, the defense continued to request meetings and reviews of\nthe case, both within the USAO and by the Department’s Criminal Division and the Deputy\nAtorney General. Although limited reviews were granted, during this period there was only one\nsubstantive meeting with Acosta, on December l4, 2oo7.7°? This meeting occurred in lieu of the\nmeeting Starr had requested of Assistant Atorney General Fisher, most likely because the defense\nsubmissions to the Department’s Criminal Division had raised issues not previously raised with\nthe USAO and the Department determined that Acosta should address those in the first instance.”*°\nAcosta told OPR that he did not ask for the Department review, but he also did not want to appear\nas if he “fear[ed]” that review. Acosta’s nuanced position, houever, was not clear to the\nDepartment atorneys who responded to Epstein’s appeals and who perceived Acosta to be in favor\nof a Department review, rather than merely tolerant of it. Notably, though, none of those meetings\nor reviews resulted in the USAO abandoning the NPA, and Epstein gained no substantial\nadvantage from his continued entreaties.\n\nIn sum, in evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered the number of meetings, their\npurpose, the content of the discussions, and decisions made afterwards. OPR cannot say that the\nnumber of meetings, particularly those occurring before the NPA was signed, was so far outside\nthe norm—for a high profile case with skilled defense atorneys—that the quantity of meetings\nalone shous that the subjects were motivated by improper favoritism. In evaluating the subjects’\nconduct, OPR considered that the meetings were held with different levels of USAO managers and\nthat the explanations for the decisions to participate in the meetings reflected reasonable strategic\ngoals. Although OPR cannot rule out the possibility that because Acosta, Menchel, Lourie, or\nSloman knew or knew of the defense atorneys, they may have been willing to meet with them, it\nis also true that prosecutors routinely meet with defense atorneys, including those who are knoun\nto them and those who are not. Furthermore, meetings are more likely to occur in high profile\ncases involving defendants with the financial resources to hire skilled defense counsel who request\nmeetings at the highest levels of the USAO and the Department. Most significantly, OPR did not\nfind evidence supporting a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the meetings themselves resulted in any substantial\nbenefit to the defense. At each meeting, defense counsel strongly pressed the USAO—on factual,\nlegal, and policy grounds—to forgo its federal investigation and to return the mater to the state to\nproceed as it saw fit. The USAO never yielded on that point. Accordingly, OPR did not find\nevidence supporting a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia met with\ndefense counsel for the purpose of benefiting Epstein or that the meetings themselves caused\nAcosta or the other subjects to provide improper benefits to Epstein.\n\n232 Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz is discussed separately in the follouing section.\n233 Starr and other defense atorneys only obtained one meeting at the Department level, with Deputy Assistant\nAtorney General Mandelker and CEOS Chief Oosterban in March 2oo8. Although Starr requested a meeting with\nAssistant Atorney General Fisher and another with Deputy Atorney General Filip, those requests were not granted.\nl59\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l97", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023213.tif": "Epstein’s state guilty plea.°° As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in\nthis manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding circumstances, his decision to\ndo so reflected poor judgment. Acosta’s application of Petite policy principles was too expansive,\nhis view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrou, and his understanding of\nthe state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.”>*!\n\nB. The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcems about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was completed. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.”°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n25o Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\n25l In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n252 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstem and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232l3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023217.tif": "To be clear, OPR is not suggesting that prosecutors must obtain all available evidence\nbefore reaching plea agreements or that prosecutors cannot reasonably determine that reaching a\nresolution is more beneficial than continuing to litigate evidentiary issues. Every case is different\nand must be judged on its oun facts. In this case, houever, given the unorthodox nature of the\nstate-based resolution, the fact that Acosta’s decision to pursue it set the case on a wholly different\ntrack than what had been originally contemplated by his experienced staff, the nature and scope of\nEpstein’s criminal conduct, the circumstances surrounding the removal of the computers from\nEpstein’s residence, and the potential for obtaining evidence revealing serious additional criminal\nconduct, Acosta had a responsibility to ensure that he was fully informed about the consequences\nof pursing the course of action that he proposed and particularly about the consequences flouing\nfrom the express terms of the NPA. In deciding to resolve the case pre-charge, Acosta lost sight\nof the bigger picture that the investigation was not completed and viable leads remained to be\npursued. The decision to forgo the government’s efforts to obtain the computer evidence and to\npursue significant investigative steps should have been made only after careful consideration of\nall the costs and benefits of the proposed action. OPR did not find evidence that Acosta fully\nconsidered the costs of ending the investigation prematurely.”\n\nC. OPR Was Unable to Determine the Basis for the Two-Year Term of\n\nIncarceration, That It Was Tied to Traditional Sentencing Goals, or That It\nSatisfied the Federal Interest in the Prosecution\n\nThe heart of the controversy surrounding the Epstein case is the apparent undue leniency\nafforded him concerning his sentence. After offering a deal that required a “non-negotiable”\n24-month term of incarceration, Acosta agreed to resolve it for an l8-month term of incarceration,\nknouing that gain time would reduce it further, and indeed, Epstein served only l3 months.\nEpstein ultimately did not serve even that minimal sentence incarcerated on a full-time basis\nbecause the state alloued Epstein into its work release program within the first four months of his\nsentence. As Lourie told OPR, “[E]verything else that happened to [Epstein] is exactly what\nshould have happened to him. . . . He had to pay a lot of money. He had to register as a sex\noffender,” but “in the perfect world, [Epstein] would have served more time in jail.”\n\nDue to the passage of time and the subjects’ inability to recall many details of the relevant\nevents, OPR was unable to develop a clear understanding of hou the original two-year sentence\nrequirement was developed or by whom. Two possibilities were articulated during OPR’s subject\ninterviews: (l) the two years represented the sentence Epstein would have received had he pled\nguilty to an unspecified charge originally contemplated by the state; or (2) the two years\nrepresented the sentence the USAO determined Epstein would be willing to accept, thus avoiding\nthe need for a trial. As to the former possibility, Acosta told OPR that his “best understanding” of\nthe two-year proposal was that it correlated to “one of the original state charges.”’ He elaborated,\n28s In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney objected to OPR’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that Acosta knew or\nshould have knoun about the litigation regarding the computers and that he should have given greater consideration\nto pursuing the computers before the NPA was signed. Acosta’s atorney asserted that Acosta was not involved in\nthat level of “granularity”; that his “‘small thoughts’ edits” on the NPA were limited and focused on policy; and that\nit was appropriate for him to rely on his staff to raise any issues of concern to him. For the reasons stated above, OPR\nnonetheless concludes that having developed a unique resolution to a federal investigation, Acosta had a greater\nobligation to understand and consider what the USAO was giving up and the appropriateness of doing so.\n\nl79\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023219.tif": "indictment. Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal charges were not appropriate and\ndefense counsel’s efforts to minimize the amount of time Epstein would spend in jail, it is\nquestionable whether Epstein would have accepted such a plea offer, but the USAO did not even\nextend the offer to determine what his response to it would be.\n\nWeighed against possible loss at trial were some clear advantages to a negotiated resolution\nthat ensured a conviction, including sexual offender registration and the opportunity to establish a\nmechanism for the victims to recover damages. These advantages, added to Acosta’s concern\nabout intruding on the state’s authority, led him to the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that a two-year state plea would\nbe sufficient to prevent manifest injustice. Menchel told OPR, “I don’t believe anybody at the\ntime that this resolution was entered into was looking at the two years as a fair result in terms of\nthe conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not if we took this case to\ntrial, would we risk losing everything?”\n\nDuring the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept\na plea for an l8-month sentence, a reduction of six months from the original “non-negotiable” two-\nyear term. The subjects did not have a clear memory of why this reduction was made. Villafafia\natributed it to a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, but Acosta atributed it to a decision\nmade during the negotiating process by Villafafia and Lourie, telling OPR that he understood his\natorneys needed flexibility to reach a final deal with Epstein.\n\nOPR found no contemporaneous documents shouing the basis for the two-year term.\nDespite extensive subject interviews and review of thousands of contemporaneous records, OPR\nwas unable to determine who initially proposed the two-year term of incarceration or why that\nterm, as opposed to other possible and lengthier terms, was setled on for the initial offer. The\nterm was not tied to statutory or guidelines sentences for potential federal charges or, as far as\nOPR could determine, possible state charges. Furthermore, while the USAO initially informed the\ndefense that the two-year term was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that position and\nrather than a “floor” for negotiations, it became a “ceiling” that was further reduced during the\nnegotiations. OPR was unable to find any evidence indicating that the term of incarceration was\ntied either to the federal interest in seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, or to other\ntraditional sentencing factors such as deterrence, either of Epstein or other offenders of similar\ncrimes. Instead, as previously noted, it appears that Acosta primarily considered only a\npunishment that was somewhat more than that to which the state had agreed. As a result, the\nUSAO had litle room to maneuver during the negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling to\nenforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term of incarceration\nthat was not much more than what the state had initially sought and which was significantly\ndisproportionate to the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.\n\nIn sum, it is evident that Acosta’s desire to resolve the federal case against Epstein led him\nto arrive at a target term of incarceration that met his oun goal of serving as a “backstop” to the\nstate, but that otherwise was untethered to any articulable, reasonable basis. In assessing the case\nonly through the lens of providing a “backstop” to the state, Acosta failed to consider the need for\na punishment commensurate with the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct and the federal interest in\naddressing it.\n\nl8l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232l9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023222.tif": "which Villafafia and Lourie believed that the state had intentionally failed to aggressively pursue\na broader state indictment.\n\nOne example illustrates this communication gap. In a September 2o, 2oo7 email to Lourie\nasking him to read the latest version of the proposed “hybrid” federal plea agreement (calling for\nEpstein to plead to both state and federal charges), Acosta noted, “I don’t typically sign plea\nagreements. We should only go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement. I\ndidn’t even sign the public corruption or [C]ali cartel agreements, so this should not be the first.”\n(Emphasis added.) In his email to Villafafia, Lourie atached Acosta’s email and instructed\nVillafafia to “change the signature block to your name and send as final to Jay [Lefkouitz].”\n(Emphasis added.) Villafafia raised no objection to signing the agreement. Acosta told OPR that\nhe wanted to give the “trial team” a chance to “speak up and let him knou” if they did not feel\ncomfortable with the agreement. Villafafia, houever, told OPR that she did not understand that\nshe was being given an opportunity to object to the agreement; rather, she believed Acosta wanted\nher to sign it because he was taking an “‘arm’s length” approach and signaling this “was not his\ndeal.” The fact that the top decision maker believed he was giving the line AUSA an opportunity\nto reflect and stop the process if she believed the deal was inappropriate, but the line AUSA\nbelieved she was being ordered to sign the agreement because her boss wanted to distance himself\nfrom the decision, reflects a serious communication gap.\n\nAs another example, at one point, Villafafia, frustrated and concerned about the decisions\nbeing made concerning a possible resolution, requested a meeting with Acosta; in a sternly worded\nrebuke, Menchel rejected the request. Although Menchel told OPR that he was not prohibiting\nVillafafia from speaking to Acosta, Villafafia interpreted Menchel’s email to mean that she could\nnot seek a meeting with Acosta. As a consequence, Acosta made his decision about a state\nresolution and the term of incarceration without any direct input from Villafafia. Acosta told OPR\nthat he was unaware that Villafafia had sought a meeting with him and he would have met with\nher if she had asked him directly. OPR did not find any writen evidence of a meeting involving\nboth Acosta—the final decision maker—and Villafafia—the person most knouledgeable about the\nfacts and the law—before Acosta made his decision to resolve the case through state charges or to\noffer the two-year term, and Villafafia said she did not have any input into the decision. Although\na U.S. Atorney is certainly not required to have such direct input, and it may be that Menchel\npresented what he believed to be Villafafia’s views, OPR found no evidence that Acosta was aware\nof Villafafia’s strong views about, and objections to, the proposed resolution.”*°\n\nTwo logistical problems hindered effective communication. First, the senior managers\ninvolved in the case—Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel—had offices located in Miami, while the\noffices of the individuals most familiar with facts of the case—Villafafia and, to a lesser extent,\nLourie—were located in West Palm Beach. Consequently, Villafafia’s discussions with her senior\n256 In her 2ol7 Declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that, given the challenges of obtaining\nvictims’ cooperation with a federal prosecution, “I believed and still believe that a negotiated resolution of the mater\nwas in the best interests of the [USAO] and the victims as a whole. The [USAO] had also reached that same\n<span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>.” Several subjects pointed to this statement as indicating that Villafafia in fact supported the NPA. In her\nOPR interview, houever, Villafafia drew a distinction between resolving the investigation through negotiations that\nled to what in her view was a reasonable outcome, which she would have supported, and “this negotiated resolution”—\nthat is, the NPA—which she did not support.\n\nl84\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23222", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023227.tif": "CHAPTER THREE\nISSUES RELATING TO THE GOVERNMENT?’S INTERACTIONS\nAND COMMUNICATIONS WITH VICTIMS\nPART ONE: FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nl.

The pamphlet stated:\n“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime,\nand it will be the responsibility of the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you\nare afforded those rights.” The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided\nvictims with the FBI pamphlet upon the <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> of an interview.

THE INTRODUCTORY USAO AND FBI LETTERS TO VICTIMS\n\nA. August 2oo6: The FBI Victim Notification Leters\n\nOn August 8, 2oo6, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim\nSpecialist for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim\nNotification Form” naming 3o victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional\npertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.7”° Thereafter, the Victim Specialist\nentered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS\nwhenever the case agent directed the Victim Specialist to generate an initial leter to a particular\nvictim. The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim notification was “always handled by the\n[FBI’s Victim Specialist].”?”*4\n\nAccording to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2oo6, the FBI Victim Specialist\nused the VNS to generate FBI leters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the\neight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive\ncurrent status information about the mater. The FBI leters described the case as “currently under\ninvestigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued\npatience while we conduct a thorough investigation.” The leters also stated that some of the\nCVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment: “We will make our best efforts\nto ensure you are accorded the rights described.

The FBI Victim Specialist told OPR that she mailed some FBI leters to\nvictims and she provided some FBI leters to the case agent for hand delivery.\n\nNevertheless, the case agent told OPR that she “did not sit there and go through every\nright” with the victims. She stated, houever, “[I]n the beginning whether it was through [the FBI\nVictim Specialist] giving the leter, me giving a leter, the pamphlet, I believed that the girls knew\nthat they were victims and had rights, and they had a resource, [the FBI Victim Specialist], that\nthey could call for that.” The FBI case agent further explained that once the case agents connected\nthe FBI Victim Specialist with each victim, the Victim Specialist handled the victims’ “rights and\nresources.”\n\nVI.

Villafafia Asserts That Her Supervisors Gave Instructions Not to\nConsult Victims about the Plea Discussions, but Her Supervisors Do\nNot Currently Recall Such Instructions\nVillafafia told OPR that during an “early” meeting with Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel,\nwhich took place when “we were probably just entering into plea negotiations,” she raised the\ngovernment’s obligation to confer with victims.7** Initially, Villafafia told OPR she was\ninstructed, “Don’t talk to [the victims]. Don’t tell them what’s happening,” but she was not told\nwhy she should not speak to the victims, and she could not recall who gave her this instruction. In\na subsequent OPR interview, Villafafia recalled that when she raised the issue of notification\nduring the meeting, she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential. You can’t disclose them.”7*?\nVillafafia remained uncertain who gave her this instruction, but believed it may have been Acosta.\nNeither Acosta, Sloman, nor Menchel recalled a meeting at which Villafafia was directed\nnot to notify the victims. Acosta told OPR that the decision whether to solicit the victims’ view\n“is something [that] I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I was focused\non at least at this time,” and he did not “recall discussions about victim notification until after the\nNPA was signed.” Sloman also told OPR that he did not recall a meeting at which victim\nnotification was discussed. Menchel wrote in his response to OPR, “I have no recollection of any\ndiscussions or decisions regarding whether the USAO should notify victims of its intention to enter\ninto a pre-charge disposition of the Epstein mater.” Furthermore, Menchel told OPR he could not\nthink of a reason why the issue of victim notification would have arisen before he left the USAO,\nbecause “we were way off from finalizing or having anything even close to a deal,” and it would\nhave been “premature” to consider notification.7”°\n3. September 6, 2oo7: Villafaia Informs Sloman, Who Informs Acosta,\nof Oosterban’s Opinion That Consultation with Victims Was\nRequired\nOn September 6, 2oo7, in a lengthy email to Sloman responding to his question about the\ngovernment’s then-pending offer to the defense, Villafafia raised the victim consultation issue,\nadvising that, “the agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which as\n[CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law” and that “the [PBPD]\n288 Villafafia could not recall the specific date of the meeting, but Menchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7.\n289 Villafafia also recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations could cause\nvictims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.”\n29o In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel reiterated his contention that Villafafia’s claim\nabout a meeting involving Menchel in which she was instructed not to consult with victims was inaccurate and\ninconsistent with other evidence. OPR carefully considered the comments but did not conclude that the evidence to\nwhich Menchel’s atorney pointed necessarily refuted Villafafia’s assertion that she had received an instruction from\na supervisor not to inform victims about the plea negotiations. Houever, it is also true that OPR did not find any\nreference in the emails and other documents dated before the NPA was signed to a meeting at which victim\nconsultation was discussed or to a specific instruction not to consult with the victims. This is one of several events\nabout which Menchel and Villafafia disagreed, but given OPR’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that the Department did not require\nprosecutors to consult with victims before charges were brought, OPR does not reach a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> regarding the\nalleged meeting and instruction.\n2o4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23242", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023246.tif": "involved in such notifications.

For example, on October l, 2oo7, the\nNew York Post reported that Epstein “has agreed to plead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes\nat his Florida mansion in a deal that will send him to prison for about l8 months,” and noted that\nEpstein would plead guilty in state court and that “the feds have agreed to drop their probe into\npossible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge.”*\"!\n\nThe case agent recalled informing some victims that “there was an agreement reached” and\n“we would not be pursuing this federally.” In October 2oo7, for example, the case agents met with\nvictim Courtney Wild, “to advise her of the main terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement.”\nAccording to the case agent, during that meeting, the case agents told Wild “that an agreement had\nbeen reached, Mr. Epstein was going to plead guilty to two state charges, and there would not be\na federal prosecution.”*°?

Nonetheless, Villafafia told OPR that, while there were\nvalid reasons for the government’s position that CVRA rights do not apply pre-charge, “[T]his is\na case where I felt we should have done more than what was legally required. I was obviously\nprepared to spend as much time, energy and effort necessary to meet with each and every [victim].”\n\nOver the course of the litigation, the district court made various rulings interpreting the\nprovisions of the CVRA, including the court’s key <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that victim CVRA rights “atach\nbefore the Government brings formal charges against a defendant.” The court also held that\n(l) “the CVRA authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a\nnon-prosecution agreement, reached in violation of a prosecutor’s conferral obligations under the\nstatute”; (2) the CVRA authorizes the seting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements”;\n(3) the CVRA’s “reasonable right to confer” “extends to the pre-charge state of criminal\ninvestigations and proceedings”; (4) the alleged federal sex crimes commited by Epstein render\nthe Doe petitioners “victims” under the CVRA; and (5) “questions pertaining to [the] equitable\ndefense[s] are properly left for resolution after development of a full evidentiary record.”\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the petitioners’ Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, ruling that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about its\nintention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” The government did not\ndispute the fact that it did not confer with the petitioners prior to signing the NPA, and the court\nconcluded that “[a]t a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform Petitioners\nthat it intended to enter into an agreement not to prosecute Epstein.” The court found that the post-\nNPA leters the government sent to victims describing the investigation as ongoing “misled the\nvictims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material\nomission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an\ninvestigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*°°\n\nThe court relied on Dean and BP Products to support its holding and noted that the\ngovernment’s action with respect to the NPA was especially troubling because, unlike a plea\nagreement for which the victims could voice objection at a sentencing hearing, “[o]nce an NPA is\nentered into without notice, the mater is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard\nregarding any aspect of the case.” The court also highlighted the inequity of the USAO’s failure\nto communicate with the victims while it simultaneously engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with\nEpstein’s counsel and assured the defense that the NPA would not be “made public or filed with\nthe Court.”\n\nAlthough the USAO defended its actions by citing the 2oo5 Guidelines for the\nDepartment’s position that CVRA rights do not atach until after a defendant is charged, the court\nwas “not persuaded that the [G]uidelines were the basis for the Government’s decision to withhold\ninformation about the NPA from the victims.” The court found that the government’s reliance on\n386 The court did not resolve the factual question as to whether the victims were given adequate notice of\nEpstein’s state court plea hearing.\n\n243\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2328l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023295.tif": "and consider victims’ views about, prospective plea negotiations.*’?

The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*'* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\na4 The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative)” and “Under Investigation.”\n\n4l5 After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n264\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023303.tif": "IV. ACOSTA’S DECISION TO DEFER TO THE STATE ATTORNEY’S\nDISCRETION WHETHER TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT EPSTEIN’S STATE\nCOURT PLEA HEARING DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR OR UNAMBIGUOUS\nSTANDARD; HOWEVER, ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY\nFAILING TO ENSURE THAT VICTIMS IDENTIFIED IN THE FEDERAL\nINVESTIGATION WERE ADVISED OF THE STATE PLEA HEARING\nAs set forth in the factual discussion, within a few weeks of the NPA’s signing, it became\n\nclear that the defense team disagreed with, and strongly objected to, the government’s plan to\n\ninform victims of their ability to recover monetary damages from Epstein, under the l8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2255 provision of the NPA, and about Epstein’s state court plea hearing. The USAO initially\n\ntook the position that it was obligated to, and intended to, inform victims of both the NPA,\n\nincluding the § 2255 provision, and Epstein’s change of plea hearing and sentencing, so that\nvictims who wanted to atend could do so.\n\nIn November and December 2oo7, Epstein’s atorneys challenged the USAO’s position\nregarding victim notification. Ultimately, Acosta made two distinct decisions concerning victim\nnotifications. Consistent with Acosta’s concerns about intruding into state actions, Acosta elected\nto defer to state authorities the decision whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing\npursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights requirements. Acosta also determined that the USAO\nwould notify victims about their eligibility to obtain monetary damages from Epstein under § 2255,\na decision that was implemented by leters sent to victims after Epstein entered his state pleas.\nThis decision, which postponed notification of the NPA until after Epstein entered his guilty pleas,\nwas based, at least in part, on Villafafia’s and the case agents’ strategic concerns relating to\npreserving the victims’ credibility and is discussed further in Section V, belou.\n\nIn this section, OPR analyzes Acosta’s decision to defer to the state the responsibility for\nnotifying victims of Epstein’s plea hearing and sentencing. OPR concludes that neither the CVRA\nnor the VRRA required the government to notify victims of the state proceeding and therefore\nAcosta did not violate any statutes or Department policy by deferring to the discretion of the State\nAtorney whether to notify victims of Epstein’s state guilty pleas and sentencing. Houever, OPR\nalso concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment because by failing to ensure that the state\nintended to and would notify victims of the federal investigation, he failed to treat victims\nforthrightly and with the sensitivity expected by the Department. Through counsel, Acosta\n“strongly disagree[d]” with OPR’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> and argued that OPR unfairly applied a standard\n“never before expected of any U.S. Atorney.” OPR addresses Acosta’s criticisms in the\ndiscussion belou.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Defer to the State Atorney’s Discretion Whether to\n\nNotify Victims about Epstein’s State Court Plea Hearing Did Not Violate Any\nClear or Unambiguous Standard\n\nIn November 2oo7, Villafafia sought to avoid defense accusations of misconduct\nconcerning her interactions with the victims by preparing a writen notice to victims informing\nthem of the resolution of the federal case and of their eligibility for monetary damages, and inviting\nthem to appear at the state plea hearing. Villafafia and Sloman exchanged edits of the draft leter\nand, at Sloman’s instruction, she provided the draft to defense atorney Lefkouitz, who, in turn,\n\n265\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023316.tif": "previously noted, there is some contemporaneous evidence supporting her assertion. Villafafia’s\nmention of the agreement, even if not described in specific terms, would have been sufficient to\napprise those victims of the status of the federal investigation.\n\nNevertheless, Villafafia did not recall discussing the NPA specifically or in general terms\nwith other victims interviewed at that time, nor did she do so with Edwards or any other victim’s\natorney. OPR therefore considered whether the omission of information about the existence of\nthe NPA during these interactions rose to the level of professional misconduct in violation of FRPC\n4-4.l or 4-8.4.44!\n\nOPR evaluated Villafafia’s conduct in light of the comment to FRPC 4-4.l:\n\nA lawyer is required to be truthful when dealing with others on a\n\nclient’s behalf, but generally has no affirmative duty to inform an\n\nopposing party of relevant facts. A misrepresentation can occur if\n\nthe lawyer incorporates or affirms a statement of another person that\n\nthe lawyer knous is false. Misrepresentations can also occur by\n\npartially true but misleading statements or omissions that are the\n\nequivalent of affirmative false statements.\nThe victims and their atorneys were certainly not “opposing part[ies]” to the USAO, but the\ncomment indicates that the rule recognizes that omissions made during discussions with third\nparties, even of relevant facts, are not always treated as false statements.\n\nHere, the evidence does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made an affirmative false\nstatement to the victims or Edwards or that her omissions were “the equivalent of affirmative false\nstatements” about material facts. First, Villafafia told OPR that she believed the investigation was\nongoing and her statement to that effect truthful, and as discussed earlier in this Chapter, the\nevidence shous that Villafafia and the agents did continue to investigate the case until Epstein\nentered his guilty plea in state court in June 2oo8. Villafafia’s email correspondence with her\nsupervisors reflects her strong advocacy during that timeframe to declare Epstein in breach and to\ncharge him. The evidence similarly does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made any affirmative\nfalse statement to Edwards when she informed him of the state court plea, although she declined\nto provide additional information in response to his questions.*”\n\nSecond, in reaching its <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span>, OPR considered the full context in which Villafafia\ninteracted with the victims and Edwards. Prosecutors routinely make decisions about what\ninformation will be disclosed to witnesses, including victims, for a variety of strategic reasons. In\nmany cases, prosecutors must make difficult decisions about providing information to witnesses,\n“4l In Florida Bar v. Joy, the court affirmed a referee’s <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that Joy violated FRPCs 4-4. l(a) and 4-8.4(c)\n“for making false statements by omission of material facts in his representations [to counsel].” Florida Bar v.

The 2oo5 Guidelines advise that in consulting with a victim, prosecutors may be limited\nin their disclosures: “Because victims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government,\nand may disclose whatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only nonsensitive data and\npublic information.”*°\n\nVillafafia’s concern about generating potential impeachment evidence by informing\nvictims of their potential to recover monetary damages from Epstein was not unreasonable.\nIndeed, the case agents initially raised the impeachment issue, and after considering the problem,\nVillafafia agreed with the agents’ concerns. Villafafia raised those concerns with the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer in October 2oo7 after the agents brought the issue to her\natention, and she ultimately raised the issue with Sloman and Acosta as well, neither of whom\nadvised her that those concerns were improper or unsound. OPR also considered that although\nVillafafia had sought to notify the victims in writing of the NPA soon after it was signed, her\nsupervisor, the U.S. Atorney, had decided otherwise. When authorized to inform Edwards of the\nscheduled change of plea hearing, she did so. Although she did not inform Edwards that the plea\nwas part of a global resolution that would end the federal investigation, the evidence does not shou\nthat Villafafia acted for the purpose of deceiving Edwards or preventing him from atending the\nhearing. Had she sought to exclude him from the state proceedings, she could have elected not to\ninform Edwards at all, or she could have discouraged him from atending the state proceedings.\nRather, as Edwards confirmed, Villafafia told him the hearing was “important.” Villafafia sought\nto strike a difficult balance of securing Edwards’s (and his clients’) atendance at the state court\nplea, while obeying her management’s directive that informing victims of the resolution of the\nfederal investigation should not be done until completion of the state plea.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering all of the circumstances, OPR concludes that the\nevidence does not establish that Villafafia violated her obligations under FRPC 4-4.l or 4-8.4(c)\nor (d).“44 Nonetheless, as discussed belou, Villafafia’s interactions with victims and victims’\natorneys without informing them of the NPA and the potential <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> of the federal\ninvestigation contributed to the likelihood that the victims would feel that the government was\n443 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. lV, J B.2.c(l). As noted, some victims continued to express favorable views of Epstein\nduring interviews with the government and they, or their atorneys, could have provided information to Epstein about\nthe government’s communications. For example, within a day of Villafafia contacting a victim’s atorney about a\npotential victim notification leter, Starr complained to Acosta that the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it was clear from the\ngirl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a victim.”\n\n“44 The case most directly on point is Smith, lo9 A.3d ll84, in which the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed\na violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) based on a prosecutor’s failure to notify the victim of the\nresolution of a sex abuse case. Houever, as noted previously, in Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea, and various specific statutes afforded victims the right to receive notices and an\nopportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or information in a circuit court.” In this case,\nfor the reasons previously discussed, Villafafia did not have a clear and unambiguous obligation to inform the victims\nor Edwards of the NPA.\n\n279\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023319.tif": "Villafafia informed Edwards about the state plea, but did not mention the NPA or the fact that the\nstate pleas would resolve the federal investigation. Edwards then filed the CVRA petition and\nlearned about the NPA signed months earlier and that the federal investigation of Epstein had\nconcluded with Epstein’s state guilty pleas. Wild only received access to the NPA when a judge\npermited it in August 2oo8 pursuant to a protective order. After considering this series of\ninteractions, it is not surprising that Wild came away from the experience feeling confused and\nbelieving she had been misled.\n\nOPR did not find evidence supporting a <span class=\"highlight\">conclusion</span> that Villafafia, Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, or Lourie opted not to consult with the victims in order to protect Epstein or shield the\nNPA from public scrutiny. Although neither Sloman nor Acosta could recall a specific discussion\nof CVRA obligations before the NPA was signed, both recalled knouing that victim consultation\nwas not required, and Menchel also told OPR that consultation was not required, at least not up to\nthe point when he left the USAO. The evidence is clear that Villafafia sought at various points to\nconsult with and to notify victims about the details of the NPA but was constrained before the\nNPA was signed by managers who either made a decision to not consult victims or did not address\nthe issue after it was raised, and after the signing by her oun concern about creating possible\nimpeachment evidence that would damage the victims’ credibility at a possible trial.\n\nNonetheless, a more open and straightforward approach with the victims, both before and\nafter the signing of the NPA, would have been the beter practice. Before the NPA was signed,\nvictims could have been asked for their views about the general terms the USAO was\ncontemplating offering, including that a plea to state charges was one of the options being\nconsidered; asked for their views in general about a guilty plea; or, at a minimum, asked to share\ntheir views of hou the case should be resolved. Even if the USAO ultimately determined to\nproceed with the NPA, the government would have had the benefit of the victims’ thoughts and\nconcerns, particularly on the issue of punishment, and victims would have felt included in the\nprocess. OPR found no evidence that the benefits of victim consultation were discussed or\nconsidered before the NPA was signed.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, no one from the government explained the agreement to the\nmajority of the victims until months later and only after the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea.\nAlthough the evidence supports Villafafia’s assertion that she acted from a good faith belief that\nEpstein might breach the NPA and a potential trial would be harmed if information about the NPA\nwas divulged to the victims and their counsel, she, Sloman, and Acosta failed to consider hou the\ndesire to shield the victims from that potential impeachment might impact the victims’ sense of\nthe openness and fairness of the process. As Wild stated during the CVRA litigation, she believed\nshe had been “mistreated in the process.” When deciding not to inform the victims of the NPA to\navoid creating impeachment evidence, Villafafia, Sloman, and Acosta do not appear to have\ncarefully considered possible alternatives to, or all of the ramifications of, that decision, nor did\nthey revisit the decision before Villafafia met the victims in person to discuss a potential trial or\nspoke to Edwards or other atorneys representing victims.*“° Furthermore, more atention needed\n446 It is not at all clear whether a court would have permited impeachment of the victims concerning one\nprovision in a plea agreement that otherwise could not be used as evidence. See Fed. R. Crim. P. ll(f) (“The\nadmissibility or inadmissibility of a plea, a plea discussion, and any related statement is governed by Federal Rule of\nEvidence 4lo.”). In any case, the victims could have been impeached regarding the possibility of their obtaining\nmonetary damages through either a civil suit or through l8 U.S.C. § 2255 (if Epstein were convicted after a trial),\n\n28l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo233l9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023321.tif": "<span class=\"highlight\">CONCLUSION</span>\n\nIn November 2ol8, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about\nstate and federal criminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that\nJeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier with residences in Florida, New York, and other United States\nand foreign locations, had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm\nBeach, Florida estate. The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim notification and consultation. OPR conducted extensive interviews of\nall five subjects. The subjects also submited comments on OPR’s draft report.\n\n283\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2332l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023365.tif": "SHU staff told the OIG that at approximately 8 p.m. on found in his cell on the morning of August lo; that no\nAugust 9, all SHU inmates, including Epstein, were weapons were recovered from his cell after his death;\nlocked in their cells for the evening and we found no and that he signed a new Last Will and Testament on\nevidence to the contrary.

The OIG has investigated numerous allegations related to the falsification of\nofficial BOP documentation concerning inmate counts and rounds and has repeatedly found deficiencies\nwith the BOP’s staffing levels, the custody and care of inmates at risk for suicide, and security camera\nsystems at BOP institutions. The combination of negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance\nfailures documented in this report all contributed to an environment in which arguably one of the most\nnotorious inmates in BOP’s custody was provided with the opportunity to take his oun life. The BOP’s\nfailures are troubling not only because the BOP did not adequately safeguard an individual in its custody,\nbut also because they led to questions about the circumstances surrounding Epstein’s death and effectively\ndeprived Epstein’s numerous victims of the opportunity to seek justice through the criminal justice process.\nThe fact that these failures have been recurring ones at the BOP does not excuse them and gives additional\nurgency to the need for DOJ and BOP leadership to address the chronic problems plaguing the BOP.\nUnless otherwise noted, the OIG applies the preponderance of the evidence standard in determining\nwhether DO] personnel have commited misconduct.

In Chapter 5, we set\nforth our findings of fact related to the events of August 8-lo, 2ol9, including Epstein’s death. In Chapter 6,\nwe set forth our findings of fact related to the BOP’s failure to ensure that there was a functional security\ncamera system at MCC New York, which resulted in limited recorded video evidence relevant to Epstein’s\ndeath.

The BOP should enhance existing policies regarding institutional security camera\nsystems to ensure they specifically state that such systems must have the capacity to\nrecord video and that BOP institutions must conduct regular security camera system\nfunctionality checks.\n\nAs discussed in the Conclusions section of this chapter, the OIG found that, even though the highest levels\nof leadership knew of the MCC New York security camera system’s recurring deficiencies, prior to Epstein’s\ndeath, no one was tasked with the responsibility of checking the security camera system on a routine basis\nto ensure that the system was functional. As a result, when on July 29, 2ol9, video from approximately half\nof the institution’s security cameras was no longer being recorded, the problem went undetected for\nll days. The OIG also found that there are no BOP policies that specifically state that security camera\nsystems must have the capacity to record or that institutional staff must perform periodic checks to ensure\nthe camera system is fully functional. Cameras that are failing to provide good quality or any live video\nstreams put the safety of BOP staff members and inmates at risk, and the lack of video recordings can\npotentially hinder investigations of wrongdoing by staff and inmates. The OIG therefore recommends that\nthe BOP enhance existing policies and protocols so they specifically state that all institutional security\ncamera systems must have the capacity to record, and that specified staff at each institution must conduct\nperiodic checks of the security camera system to determine its operational status and take corrective action\nas soon as possible when the system is found to be inoperable.
