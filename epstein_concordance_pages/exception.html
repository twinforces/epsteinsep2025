The perjury charges are legally tenable\n\nThe Court turns next to Maxwell’s motion to dismiss\nthe perjury counts stemming from her answers to\nquestions in a deposition in a civil case. She contends\nthat these charges are legally deficient because the\nquestions posed were fundamentally ambiguous and\nthe questions were not material to the subject of the\ndeposition. The Court concludes that the charges are\nlegally tenable and Maxwell’s defenses are appropriately\nleft to the jury.\n\nThe applicable perjury statute imposes criminal\npenalties on anyone who “in any proceeding before or\nancillary to any court ... knouingly makes any false\nmaterial declaration.” l8 U.S.C. § l623(a). Testimony\nis perjurious only if it is knouingly false and is\nmaterial to the proceeding in which the defendant\noffered it.\n\nA.

A\nquestion is fundamentally ambiguous only if reasonable\npeople could not agree on its meaning in context.\nLighte,'782 F.2d at 375.

At trial, a reasonable juror\ncould conclude that truthful answers to the questions\nmay have permited the plaintiff to locate other\nvictims or witnesses who could have corroborated the\nplaintiff’s testimony. The factual disputes relating to\nmateriality are at least enough to preclude pretrial\nresolution. In criminal cases, courts must guard\nagainst “invading the ‘inviolable function of the jury’\nin our criminal justice system,” and if the “defense\nraises a factual dispute that is inextricably intertwined\nwith a defendant’s potential culpability, a judge cannot\nresolve that dispute on a Rule l2(b) motion.” United\nStates v.

All\nof his remaining family members, his brother, niece, and nephew, reside in the United States.\nThrough his business and the five residences he maintains in the United States, Mr. Epstein\nemploys people, many of whom have been with him for more than a decade, and feels personally\nresponsible for their livelihoods. Mr. Epstein is admitedly wealthy with all of his financial\nresources (other than his Paris residence) in the United States (including the U.S. Virgin Islands)\nand will provide the Court with more specific information regarding his assets in a sealed\nsupplemental disclosure prior to the upcoming bail hearing if the Court grants leave to file such a\nsealed supplement. Mr. Epstein has, to this point, not provided a complete financial disclosure\non advice of counsel, motivated by a desire to ensure the accuracy of the information provided to\nthe Court. During the years since his release from incarceration in connection with his Florida\nguilty plea, Mr. Epstein has been a law-abiding citizen without a single allegation of criminal\nmisconduct during that period and has focused his efforts on business and philanthropy. At the\nCourt’s request, Mr. Epstein will provide a sealed list of his philanthropic donations.\n\nCrucially, the government has failed to proffer any evidence that Mr. Epstein has ever\nindicated an intent to flee from this investigation or any other criminal mater, which several\ncourts have observed is a critical factor in evaluating whether pretrial release is appropriate. See\nHanson, 6l3 F. Supp. 2d at 9o (“In this case, . . . there is no strong circumstantial evidence\nindicating that Mrs. Hanson intends to flee the United States”); United States v. Vortis, 785 F.2d\n327 (D.C. Cir.l986) (serious intent to flee is an important factor); United States v. Cole, 7l5 F.\nSupp. 677, 679 (E.D. Pa.l988) (defendant told undercover agents he would flee if arrested). In\nfact, Mr. Epstein has displayed long-term, consistent compliance with Court orders and other\nlegal requirements. Asa result of his 2oo8 guilty plea and corresponding sex-offender\ndesignation, Mr. Epstein is required to (l) register for life as a sex offender; (2) regularly verify\nhis address with Virgin Islands, Florida, and New York authorities; (3) annually update his\nregistry photograph; and (4) provide registration authorities with detailed itineraries for all travel\n(both domestic and international) in which he engages. Mr. Epstein has strictly complied with\nthese requirements, without <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span>, for approximately ten years.\n\nThe Court inquired about the relationship of the New York State registration\nclassification and the requirements of the Bail Reform Act. And while it is true that the New\nYork Appellate Division held that Mr. Epstein was appropriately classified as a level-three sex\noffender, this inquiry was entirely backward-looking and based on the allegations contained in a\nFlorida probable cause affidavit describing conduct ending in 2oo5 that were neither admited-to\nnor within the scope of Mr. Epstein’s guilty plea. See People v. Epstein, 89 A.D. 3d 57o, 57l\n(N.Y. App. Div. 2oll). While Mr. Epstein has made no subsequent atempt to challenge the\ncontinuing nature of his designation, his law-abiding behavior for the ensuing decade plus\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo284", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000285.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6 Filed o7/ll/l9 Page l2 of l6\nsignificantly undercuts any suggestion of current dangerousness based on any regulatory\nclassification. Moreover, as discussed above, Mr. Epstein’s strict compliance with the various\nmonitoring requirements associated with his sex-offender registration actually decrease any\ndanger that he might otherwise pose. It is also worth noting that Mr. Epstein is classified as a\ntier-one sex offender, the louest classification available, in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where he\nmaintains his primary residence. The defense respectfully suggests that Mr. Epstein’s Virgin\nIslands designation is more consistent with the circumstances of the actual offenses for which he\nwas convicted, and certainly more consistent with the predictive factor of whether there is a\ndanger of recidivism which the defense contends there is not.\n\nMr. Epstein’s financial means and past international travel do not extinguish this Court’s\ncongressional mandate to order pretrial release in every case where reasonable conditions can\nassure the appearance of the defendant as required.’ Indeed, numerous courts have rejected\ngovernment requests for detention, and instead ordered pretrial release, in cases where the\ncharged defendant was either a non-citizen (unlike Mr. Epstein) or a naturalized citizen with\nsubstantial if not weightier contacts with foreign jurisdictions, including the follouing decisions:\n\ne United States v. Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (reversing district court order of\ndetention of defendants, who were natives of Indonesia, and ordering release despite\ndefendants’ “strong motive to flee” because of serious charges and “strong” evidence of\nguilt, despite finding that defendants faced “lengthy term of incarceration” if convicted,\ndespite finding defendants possessed “ample means to finance flight,” despite finding that\ndefendants “maintained strong family ties to their native countries as well as personal and\nprofessional ties to various locations in Europe and the Middle East,” and despite finding\nthat defendants “could, with relatively litle disruption, continue to operate their highly\nlucrative business from any number of overseas locations”);\n\ne United States v. Hansen, lo8 F.

It does not, of course, suggest that wealthy defendants\nshould bear a special disadvantage. The facts supporting the Court’s ruling of pretrial detention\nin Zarrab are easily distinguishable. The present case does not have national security\nimplications, Mr. Epstein is a United States citizen (and does not possess any dual citizenship),\nthe only foreign country in which Mr. Epstein maintains a residence (France) has an extradition\ntreaty with the United States, Mr. Epstein’s assets are almost all located in the United States\n(with the <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> of his Paris residence), and Mr. Epstein has provided only truthful\ninformation to Pretrial Services.\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo285", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000472.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 32  FiledpQ#Ate4o——Page-t-of 32 |\ni| USDC SDNY\n|| DOCUMENT\nELECTRONICALLY FILED |\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DOC #: |\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ‘ ss\neo eeee snes eotnnenenenenpevateenenenenenenneneeeoneneneeX DATE FILED: 4/l @7l/4_|]\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, i\nGovernment, : l9 CR. 49o (RMB)\n- against - ; DECISION & ORDER |\n: REMANDING DEFENDANT\nJEFFREY EPSTEIN, :\nDefendant. :\neww n ne eee nn enn nn nen ne ee ee ee ee nnn nr nnn X\nA. Background\nThis ruling follous the Court’s bail hearing held on July l5, 2ol9. The issue before the\nCourt is whether the Defendant should continue to be remanded (incarcerated) pending trial or\n| whether he should be granted release while the case proceeds. No mater the answer to this\nquestion and no mater what has been said in Court in analyzing the mater, this is a criminal\ncase and the Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, is innocent of the Federal charges alleged against him\nnou and until such time, if it comes, that a jury or the Court finds (after fair and thorough\nconsideration of the facts and the law) that he is guilty. See Transcript, dated July 8, 2ol9\n(“7/8/l9 Tr.’’), at 2-3; Transcript, dated July l5, 2ol9 (7/l5/l9 Tr.”), at 4o. It should also be :\nborne in mind that the Court has not (yet) been presented with a motion to dismiss the\nIndictment.\nThis is a federal as opposed to a state case. We proceed under federal law and federal\nrules. The key federal statute that applies here is l8 U.S.C. § l59l which sets forth the crime of\nsex trafficking with which Mr. Epstein is charged. Mr. Epstein is also charged with conspiring\nwith others to commit sex trafficking under l8 U.S.C. § 37l.\nWith respect to the issue of remand versus release, l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 applies. It sets forth\na presumption in favor of remand, an <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> to the presumption in most cases which favors\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo472", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000537.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 36 Filed o7/24/l9 Page 27 of 74 27\n\nl to registration which was part of the obligations that he\n\n2 accepted, and no one quarrels with his performance.\n\nS He went to the state. They returned the higher\n\n4 charge. He went to jail. He did his strict probation with\n\n5 home detention. And he's been registered since 2olo.\n\n6 I think these facts are important, not just because\n\n7 they are the cornerstone of a potential legal defense, and I\n\n8 won't go through all of the different factors that we believe\n\n9 on a principal basis will distinguish this case from the\n\nlo precedence that Mr. Rossmiller is relying on.\n\nll These were not two silos. The Southern District\n\nl2 didn't stand completely detached from the activities and the\n\nl3 events in Florida. But that's a motion to dismiss that will be\nl4 brought later. The premise is if we're right and they're wrong\nl5 and he's detained, he's lost freedom without punishment.\n\nl6 Your Honor asked about the rebutable presumption, and\nl7 I think this also goes back to the events of the 2oo7 and 2oo8\nl8 era.\n\nl9 THE COURT: So the presumption, first of all, the\n2o people who wrote that presumption into law clearly knou about\n2l bail and history and the need for defendants to consult with\n22 their counsel, etc.\n23 But in this rather narrou class of cases, almost all\n24 of them I think relating to children or young people, there are\n25 a whole series of cases, exceptions to be sure, where the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo537", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000538.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 36 Filed o7/24/l9 Page 28 of 74 28\n\nl presumption of remand maintains.

Jd. at 222-23. The Eleventh Circuit has further\nheld that district courts lack inherent authority to order grand jury disclosure outside the exceptions\nin Rule 6(e). Pitch v. United States, 953 F.3d l226, l237-88 (llth Cir. 2o2o) (en banc); see also\nMcKeever v. Barr, 92o F.3d 842, 845-46 (D.C. Cir. 2ol9).\nHere, even if the Court were to find a Rule 6(e) path to limited disclosure, victims’ CVRA rights and\nthe traditional interests protected by grand jury secrecy converge in favor of extraordinary care:\nrigorous judicial screening, robust redactions, minimization of any risk of re-identification, and\nmeaningful victim participation before anything is made public. Related privacy provisions reinforce\nthis approach. See, e.g., l8 U.S.C. § 35o9(d)(2) (authorizing protective orders to shield child-victims’\nidentities and “other information concerning a child”); Fed. R. Crim. P. 49.l (privacy redactions).\nMany Epstein victims were minors at the time of the abuse; even for those nou adults, § 377l (a)(8)\nand the Court’s protective authority warrant safeguards that functionally align with § 35o9(d)\nprinciples.\n\nWI. Requested Relief\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the victims respectfully request that the Court:\n\nl) Require Conferral and Notice (CVRA 8§ 377l (a)(5), (c)(l)): Direct the Government to\nconfer with victims’ counsel and provide reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard\nbefore any ruling on unsealing or public release of grand jury materials.\n\n2) Judicial In Camera Review: Conduct a comprehensive in camera review of the grand jury\nmaterials to determine whether the proponent has shoun a Rule 6(e)-compliant basis for any\ndisclosure and, if so, the narrouest scope of disclosure consistent with Douglas Oil\n\n3) Victims’ Counsel Pre-Release Review (Under Protective Order): Permit designated victims’\ncounsel to review the government’s proposed redactions and any index of materials under a\nstrict protective order, to allou victims’ counsel to identify and prevent: (a) direct identifiers,\n(b) combinations of data points that could reasonably lead to re-identification or harassment\nof victims, and (c) to propose all additional redactions necessary.\n\n4) Dispute Resolution before Unsealing or Release: If the government does not agree with\nadditional proposed redactions from victims’ counsel, provide victims’ counsel the\nopportunity to be heard on any dispute before ruling on unsealing or public release.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo773", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000784.jpg": "Cas@4Sfol4-4648o-RMB DbeuMenPsy | Piles pete agecss ereetes |\nj| USDC SDNY\n|| DOCUMENT\nELECTRONICALLY FILED |\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DOC #: |\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK , ss\neo eeee snes eotnnenenenenpevateenenenenenenneneeeoneneneeX DATE FILED: 4/l @7l/4_|]\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, i\nGovernment, : l9 CR. 49o (RMB)\n- against - ; DECISION & ORDER |\n: REMANDING DEFENDANT\nJEFFREY EPSTEIN, :\nDefendant. :\ner a i ee en ee nn ee eX\nA. Background\nThis ruling follous the Court’s bail hearing held on July l5, 2ol9. The issue before the\nCourt is whether the Defendant should continue to be remanded (incarcerated) pending trial or\n| whether he should be granted release while the case proceeds. No mater the answer to this\nquestion and no mater what has been said in Court in analyzing the mater, this is a criminal\ncase and the Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, is innocent of the Federal charges alleged against him\nnou and until such time, if it comes, that a jury or the Court finds (after fair and thorough\nconsideration of the facts and the law) that he is guilty. See Transcript, dated July 8, 2ol9\n(“7/8/l9 Tr.’’), at 2-3; Transcript, dated July l5, 2ol9 (7/l5/l9 Tr.”), at 4o. It should also be :\nborne in mind that the Court has not (yet) been presented with a motion to dismiss the\nIndictment.\nThis is a federal as opposed to a state case. We proceed under federal law and federal\nrules. The key federal statute that applies here is l8 U.S.C. § l59l which sets forth the crime of\nsex trafficking with which Mr. Epstein is charged. Mr. Epstein is also charged with conspiring\nwith others to commit sex trafficking under l8 U.S.C. § 37l.\nWith respect to the issue of remand versus release, l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 applies. It sets forth\na presumption in favor of remand, an <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> to the presumption in most cases which favors\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo784", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000845.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document l-2, o3/24/2o2l, 3o65965, Page6 of 24\n\ncapacity of the internet platform system, only one atorney per party may participate\nby video. Co—counsel, members of the press, and the public may access the audio feed\nof the proceeding by calling a dial-in number, which the Court will provide in\nadvance of the proceeding by subsequent order. Given the high degree of public\ninterest in this case, a video feed of the remote proceeding will be available for\nviewing in the Jury Assembly Room located at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan\nCourthouse, 5oo Pearl Street, New York, NY. Due to social distancing requirements,\nseating will be extremely limited; when capacity is reached no additional persons will\nbe admited. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID—l9 Courthouse Entry Program, anyone who\nappears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the\nproceeding prior to arriving at the courthouse. All visitors must also have their\ntemperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse. Please see the instructions,\natached. Completing the questionnaire ahead of time will save time and effort upon\nentry. Only persons who meet the entry requirements established by the questionnaire\nand whose temperatures are belou loo.4 degrees will be alloued to enter the\ncourthouse. Face coverings that cover the nose and mouth must be worn at all times.\nAnyone who fails to comply with the COVID—l9 protocols that have been adopted by\nthe Court will be required to leave the courthouse. There are no exceptions. As\ndiscussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the\nWaiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the\nproceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form\n(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 2o-MC-—l74 of March 27,\n2o2o, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24\nhours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct\nan inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the\nCourt to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l),\nthe Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.\" Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4). The\nCourt will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that\nappropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the\nCourt by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim\nwishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between\nthe Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to\nthe delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)(l)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from\ntoday through July l4, 2o2o. Due to the logistical issues involved in conducting a\nremote proceeding, the Court finds \"that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion]\noutweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.\" l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l6l(h)(7)(A). The exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss\na potential protective order, which will facilitate the timely production of discovery in\na manner protective of the rights of third parties.

Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment.

On February 26, 2o2l, the Government filed its\nomnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants’ twelve pretrial motions. It filed\nthe brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the\nCourt's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See\nDkt. No. l62. On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having\nconsidered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's\nrequests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction\nrequests, with the exceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the\nGovernments request to file Exhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that\ntranscript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre\nv. Maxwell, Case No. l5-cv—7433, Dkt. No. l2l2-l. In light of this, the Court sees\nno basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant\nportions.

On February 26, 2o2l, the Government filed its\nomnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants’ twelve pretrial motions. It filed\nthe brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the\nCourt's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See\nDkt. No. l62. On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having\nconsidered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's\nrequests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction\nrequests, with the exceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the\nGovernments request to file Exhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that\ntranscript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre\nv. Maxwell, Case No. l5-cv—7433, Dkt. No. l2l2-l. In light of this, the Court sees\nno basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant\nportions. In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket\non ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file\na leter with the Court justifying more tailored redaction and sealing requests regarding\npages ll28 and l87l88 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2o2l.

Defense counsel will\nalso be able to schedule legal calls on weekends as needed. Given those facts, the defense\nargument essentially suggests that no defendant could prepare for trial while housed at the MDC—\na patently incorrect claim.\n\nThe defendant is able to review her discovery using hard drives provided by the\nGovernment, discs that defense counsel can send containing any copies of discovery material\ndefense counsel chooses within the confines of the protective order, or hard copy documents\nprovided by defense counsel. The Government has taken multiple steps to address technical\ndifficulties the defendant has encountered when reviewing her hard drives. These steps included\nmodifying and reproducing productions in new formats, asking MDC IT staff to assist the\ndefendant in viewing her hard drives on the MDC computer, and then purchasing and providing a\nlaptop for the defendant’s exclusive use.!° Even when the defendant was temporarily unable to\nreview some files from some hard drives, she was always able to review other portions of her\ndiscovery.\n\no The Government understands from MDC legal counsel that the defendant has access to the\nlaptop thirteen hours per day during weekdays and has access to the MDC desktop computer\nthirteen hours per day seven days per week. The use of the laptop is limited to weekdays because\nthe MDC restricts the number of employees who carry the key to the secure location where the\nlaptop is kept, and the employees with that key do not work regularly on weekends.

If the\nperson is no longer a French national at the time of the request, the provision does not\napply.\n\nl2. Had these provisions been intended to apply in cases where the person has lost French\nnationality subsequent to the commission of the alleged crime, the texts would have\nexpressly stated so or would at least have used both the present and the past tense to\nqualify the national affiliation of the requested person.\n\nl3. Furthermore, it is a well-knoun principle of legal interpretation across all jurisdictions\nthat exceptions to rules must be construed strictly. The nationality ban being an\n<span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> to extradition, it must be interpreted in a restrictive manner and its application\nto a person who is no longer a French national must be rejected.\n\nl4. Second, the Ministry’s interpretation goes against the spirit of the law\n\nl5. The literal reading of Article 3 of the Treaty and Article 696-4 of the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure is further supported by the fact that these provisions were in fact\nnot intended to apply in cases where the person sought has lost French citizenship, but\nonly in cases where that person has acquired French citizenship subsequent to the\ncommission of the alleged crime.\n\nl6. In other words, the rule that “nationality shall be assessed at the time of the offence for\nwhich extradition is requested” seeks to deny the extension of the benefit of French\nnationality to persons who have acquired French nationality after commiting an\noffence, in order to avoid fraudulent nationality applications of offenders seeking to\nescape extradition.\n\n3\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

As a\ngeneral mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific interest in protecting the\nprivacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that supports restricting the disclosure of\ntheir identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging that as a baseline the protective order should\n“prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or\ndisseminating the identity of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery\nmaterials”); see also United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr-48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at\n*ll(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished for\nindividuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, because\nthey have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all accusations or public statements\nare equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a\nfar different mater than simply making a public statement “relating to” Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, particularly since such a statement might have occurred decades ago and have no\nrelevance to the charges in this case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy\ninterest that must be safeguarded. The <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> the Defense seeks is too broad and risks\nundermining the protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by\nlaw. In contrast, the Government’s proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also allous the\nDefense to “referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be relevant . . . to Potential\nDefense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the investigation and preparation of the\ndefense case at trial.” Dkt. No. 33-l, 95. This proposal adequately balances the interests at\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool7o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001704.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 37 Filed o7/3o/2o Page 3 of 3\nstake. And as the Government’s leter notes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense\nneeds an <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> to the protective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make\napplications to the Court on a case-by-case basis.\n\nSecond, restrictions on the ability of potential witnesses and their counsel to use\ndiscovery materials for purposes other than preparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The\nrequest appears unprecedented despite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal\nmaters that had related civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions\nincluding Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and\nother policies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously follou.\nFurthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential witnesses with\nmaterials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt. No. 33 at 6. And of\ncourse, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to examination on the record as to\nwhat materials were provided or shoun to them by the Government. Nothing in the Defense’s\npapers explains hou its unprecedented proposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a\nfair trial.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court adopts the Government’s proposed protective order,\nwhich will be entered on the docket.\n\nThis resolves Dkt. No. 29.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nDated: July 3o, 2o2o MM \\ ig\nNew York, New York ¢\n- ALISONJ.NATHAN\nUnited States District Judge\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool7o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001734.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 46 Filed o8/2l/2o Page 3of5\nHonorable Alison J.

There is no basis to modify the Protective Order here.\n\nSecond, there is good reason why both parties proposed, and the Court ordered, a protective\norder that prevents the defendant from using materials obtained through the process of criminal\ndiscovery in any of the many civil cases in which she is, or could become, a party. To allou the\ndefendant to do so would permit the dissemination of a vast swath of materials, including those\nthat are confidential due to witness privacy interests, personal identifying information of third\nparties, and relevance in ongoing grand jury investigations. Here, the Government was particularly\nconcerned about the defendant’s interests in blurring these lines because, among other reasons, her\ncounsel in the criminal case are also her counsel in the Civil Cases. It would be grossly\ninappropriate for defense counsel to be permited to sift through the criminal case discovery and\ncherry-pick materials they may believe could provide some advantage in their efforts to defend\nagainst accusations of abuse by victim plaintiffs, delay court-ordered disclosure of previously-\nsealed materials, or any other legal effort the defendant may be undertaking at any particular time.\nAnd yet that is what the defendant proposes.\n\nThird, the specific documents at issue pertain to ex parte applications made as part of an\nongoing grand jury investigation. Those documents were filed under seal and presently remain\nunder seal because the relevant judicial officers have ordered that all filings regarding those\nmaters, including the discovery materials referenced in the Defense Leter, remain sealed.? As\nthe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York has stated publicly, the\ninvestigation into the conduct of the defendant in this case and other possible co-conspirators of\nJeffrey Epstein remains active. The full scope and details of that investigation, houever, have not\nbeen made public.* Accordingly, the materials the defendant seeks to file in the Civil Cases were\nproduced under a “Confidential” designation. Any argument that such materials are not\n“confidential” would not only run contrary to the sealing orders entered by other courts, but also\nmisapprehends the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of criminal investigations.> See,\n> The only exceptions to those sealing orders are (l) as noted above, the permission from Court-l\nto provide the April 2ol9 order alone to the Recipient, and, (2) pursuant to separate permissions\nthe Government has obtained in connection with its discovery obligations, that the entirety of the\nrecord relating to the Subpoenas may be provided to the defendant as discovery in this case. The\ndefendant’s claim that the relevant materials were produced to the defendant in discovery without\nany application to the sealing courts, Def. Ltr. at 7, is incorrect.\n\n* To the extent it would be useful to this Court for the Government to further elaborate on the\nnature of the ongoing grand jury investigation, the Government is prepared to file a supplemental\nleter specifically on that subject ex parte and under seal should the Court request such an\nexplanation.\n\n> Moreover, if counsel for the defendant in her Civil Cases believe that certain documents are\nimproperly sealed, there is no impediment to counsel making sealed applications to Court-l and\nCourt-2, respectively, to unseal the relevant materials. Presumably they have not done so because\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool734", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001738.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 47 Filed o8/2l/2o Page 2 of 4\nHonorable Alison J.

The requested redactions and\nsealing would thus be necessary to ensure compliance with those sealing orders and is justified\nbased upon them.” Cf Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol Stops Northwest, 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l8 n.9 (l979)\n(“Since the l7th century, grand jury proceedings have been closed to the public; and records of\nsuch proceedings have been kept from the public eye. The rule of grand jury secrecy ... is an\nintegral part of our criminal justice system.”).\n\nAssuming without agreeing that these materials constitute “judicial documents” within the\nmeaning of First Amendment right-of-access jurisprudence, such a determination would not be\ndispositive. The First Amendment presumptive right of access applies to civil and criminal\nproceedings and “protects the public against the government’s arbitrary interference with access\nto important information.” N.Y. Civil Liberties Union v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth. (“NYCTA”), 684\nF.3d 286, 298 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (internal quotation marks omited). The Circuit has applied two\ndifferent approaches when deciding whether the First Amendment right applies to particular\nmaterial. The “experience-and-logic” approach asks “both whether the documents have\nhistorically been open to the press and general public and whether public access plays a significant\npositive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l2o (2d Cir. 2oo6) (internal quotation marks omited). The second\napproach—employed when analyzing judicial documents related to judicial proceedings covered\nby the First Amendment right—asks whether the documents at issue “‘are derived from or are a\nnecessary corollary of the capacity to atend the relevant proceedings.” /d. (internal quotation\nmarks and alteration omited).\n\nEven when it applies, the First Amendment right creates only a presumptive right of access,\nand the “presumption is rebutable upon demonstration that suppression ‘is essential to preserve\nhigher values and is narrouly tailored to serve that interest.’” Hartford Courant Co. v. Pellegrino,\n38o F.3d 83, 96 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (quoting Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Riverside\nCnty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5lo(l984)) (internal citation omited). “What offends the First Amendment\nis the atempt to [exclude the public] without sufficient justification,” NYCTA, 684 F.3d at 296,\nnot the simple act of exclusion itself. Thus, the presumptive right of access may be overcome by\n“specific, on-the-record findings that sealing is necessary to preserve higher values and only if the\nsealing order is narrouly tailored to achieve that aim.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l24.\n\n* The only exceptions to those sealing orders are the permission contained in a certain order issued\nin April 2ol9, namely that the order itself may be provided to the recipient of a subpoena, and,\npursuant to separate permissions the Government has obtained in connection with its discovery\nobligations, that the entirety of the relevant filings may be provided to the defendant as discovery\nin this criminal case.\nDOJ-OGR- ooool738", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001750.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 5l Filed o9/o2/2o Page 4 of5\n\n3.

She also moves to consolidate the instant appeal with the appeal pending in Gzuffre\nv. Maxwell, No. 2o-24l3. Meanwhile, the Government moves this Court to dismiss the appeal for\nlack of jurisdiction and opposes Maxwell’s motion to consolidate on the grounds that the issues\npresented on appeal are both factually and legally distinct. We assume the parties’ familiarity with the\nunderlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.\n\nThis Court has jurisdiction over the “final decisions of the district courts.” 28 U.S.C. § l29l.\n“Finality as a condition of review is an historic characteristic of federal appellate procedure.”\nCobbledick v. United States, 3o9 U.S. 323, 324 (l94o). The “final judgment rule requires that a party\nmust ordinarily raise all claims of error in a single appeal follouing final judgment on the merits.”\nFlanagan v. United States, 465 U.S. 259, 263 (l984) (internal quotation marks omited). “This\ninsistence on finality and prohibition of piecemeal review discourage undue litigiousness and leaden-\nfooted administration of justice, particularly damaging to the conduct of criminal cases.” D7 Bella v.\nUnited States, 369 U.S. l2l, l24 (l962) (citing Cobbledick, 3o9 U.S. at 324-26). The final judgment rule\nis therefore “at its strongest in the field of criminal law.” United States v. Hollywood Motor Car Co., 458\nUS. 263, 265 (l982). In criminal cases, “finality generally is defined by a judgment of conviction and\nthe imposition of a sentence.” Florida v. Thomas, 532 U.S. 774, 777 (2ool) (internal quotation marks\nomited).\n\nThere is a “narrou” <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> to the final judgment rule that permits appeals from\n“decisions that do not terminate the litigation, but must, in the interest of achieving a healthy legal\nsystem, nonetheless be treated as final.” Digital Equip.

See Se// v.

Maxwell does not appeal from\nan order falling within one of these categories. Instead, she appeals from a denial of her motion to\nmodify a protective order, which we have held does not fall within the collateral order <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span>. See\nMohawk Indus. v. Carpenter, 558 U.S. loo, lo7-o8 (2oo9) (holding that pretrial discovery orders are not\nimmediately appealable absent a shouing that “delaying review until the entry of a final judgment\nwould imperil a substantial public interest or some particular value of a high order” (nternal\nquotation marks omited)); S.E.C. ». Rajaratnam, 622 F.3d l59, l68 (2d Cir. 2olo) (holding that the\nCourt lacks jurisdiction to review interlocutory “discovery orders allegedly adverse to a claim of\nprivilege or privacy”); United States v. Caparros, 8oo F.2d 23, 26 (2d Cir. l986) (holding that the Court\nlacks jurisdiction to review interlocutory protective orders governing “the right of a criminal\ndefendant to disclose information given to [her] in discovery”). We decline to exercise jurisdiction\nwhere we have none, and accordingly dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n\nIn the alternative, Maxwell asks that this Court issue a writ of mandamus directing the\nDistrict Court to modify the protective order. This Court will issue the writ as an <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> to the\nfinality rule “only in exceptional circumstances amounting to a judicial usurpation of pouer or a\nclear abuse of discretion.” In re City of New York, 6o7 F.3d 923, 932 (2d Cir. 2olo) (internal quotation\nmatks omited). “[MJere error, even gross error in a particular case, as distinguished from a\ncalculated and repeated disregard of governing rules, does not suffice to support issuance of the\nwrit.” United States v.

Ghislaine Maxwell’s net worth varied in the period under review.”\n\nl5. Ghislaine Maxwell and her spouse’s net worth at 3l October 2o2o is approximately\nUS$22,5oo,ooo. This is an estimate based on the 2ol9 tax filings to the end of\nDecember 2ol9 and review of bank statements and explanations provided by her\nspouse where bank statements are currently unavailable. This figure includes\napproximately $7.67m of advance legal retainer fees.\n\nl6.

In light of our inability to access all of the bank statements for the entire period for\nthe reasons already explained in paragraphs 3 and 4 above, we have not been able to\nreview every movement of cash from every account; we can, houever, deduce from\nstarting or opening balances and the closing balances that we have reviewed in each\nyear that no significant sum of cash has been transferred outside of the control of\nGhislaine Maxwell and or her spouse.

We noted that accounts controlled either by Ghislaine Maxwell and/or her spouse,\neither directly or indirectly, maintained substantial cash and equity balances of\napproximately $l6 million during the period under review. The cash and equity\nbalances clearly increased from the time of the disposal of the New York property.\nThere are many examples of transfers between accounts, movements triggered by the\nclosure of one banking relationship and the opening of new relationship (examples\ninclude the movement of cash and assets from as well\nmovements of cash maturing on deposit and other financial investments.\n\nl9. In its initial bail submission, the Government referenced transfers totaling more than\n$2o million in the earlier period of 2oo7-2oll which the Government described as\ntransfers from Jeffrey Epstein’s accounts to Ghislaine Maxwell’s accounts and vice\nversa. We noted in our review of the financial disclosure materials, that during the\nperiod 2oo7-2oll Ghislaine Maxwell acted as an officer of various corporate entities\nrelated to aircraft and air travel associated with Jeffrey Epstein and we noted\nsubstantial transfers involving these corporate entities. We did not note any transfers\nof this nature or the nature described by the government in the 2ol5-2o2o period\nwhich forms the subject of our Financial Condition Report.\n\n> Macalvins prepared a report of financial condition for Ghislaine Maxwell dated April 3o\"\n2ol7 (see appendices to this report). The report recorded assets legally and beneficially\nouned by Ghislaine Maxwell on the balance sheet date. The specific liability recorded arose\nfrom a personal guarantee given by Ghislaine Maxwell.

Extradition arrangements between the United Kingdom and the United States\nThe extradition arrangements\n\n3. Extradition relations between the United Kingdom and the United States of America are governed by\nan extradition treaty signed on 3l March 2oo3°, which is given effect in the domestic law of the\nUnited Kingdom‘ by the 2oo3 Act”.\n\nOverview of the extradition process\n\n4. The United States of America has been designated as a ‘Part 2 territory’ (also referred to as a\n‘Category 2 territory’) for the purposes of the 2oo3 Act®. The effect of this designation is that\nextradition requests from the United States fall to be considered under Part 2 of the 2oo3 Act’, and the\nUnited States is exempted from the requirement to provide evidence sufficient to make a case to\nanswer against the requested person (‘the prima facie case requirement’).\n\n5. Once a valid’ request for extradition is made by a Part 2 territory, the Secretary of State must, subject\nto very limited exceptions’ not applicable here, issue a certificate under section 7o. Once a certificate\nis issued, the Secretary of State must send the request and certificate to the appropriate judge. In\npractice, it is extremely rare for the Secretary of State to refuse to issue a certificate under section 7o.\n\n6. Under Part 2 of the 2oo3 Act, a requested person may be arrested pursuant to either a full extradition\nrequest'’, or a provisional request pending the service of a full extradition request'”. In both cases,\nthere is an ‘initial hearing’ at which the requested person is produced before ‘the appropriate judge’!\n\n* Extradition Treaty between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, signed 3l March 2oo3 and ratified on 26 April 2oo7.\n“ The Extradition Act 2oo3 governs extradition to and from the United Kingdom. The Act applies in the three\njurisdictions within the United Kingdom: (a) England and Wales; (b) Scotland; and (c) Northern Ireland.

In all extradition cases, a requested person who consents to extradition loses the right to appeal against\neither the decision to send the case to the Secretary of State or the order for extradition®®.,\n\nl9. The main effect of a decision by a requested person to consent to extradition is that the overall extradition\nprocedure is substantially shortened. In the context of US extradition cases, this means that removal can\ntake place within months, sometimes weeks, as compared to the longer timescales considered above.\n\nC. Bail in extradition cases\n\n2o. Where extradition is sought for the purpose of prosecuting the requested person for an offence, the person\nhas the same right to bail as a defendant in domestic criminal proceedings, namely there is a presumption\nthat bail will be granted unless one of the exceptions in Schedule | to the Bail Act l976 applies”’. The\nthree exceptions in Schedule l that most commonly apply in extradition proceedings are where there are\nsubstantial grounds to believe that the requested person, if released on bail, would: (a) fail to surrender to\ncustody; (b) commit an offence while on bail; or (c) interfere with witnesses or otherwise obstruct the\ncourse of justice®®.\n\n2l. In considering whether to grant bail in an extradition case, the appropriate judge must have regard to as\nmany of the statutory considerations as appear to be relevant*’. Those considerations are: (a) the nature\nand seriousness of the offence and the likely sentence; (b) the character, antecedents, associations and\ncommunity ties of the requested person; (c) the requested person’s record as respects the fulfilment of\ntheir obligations under previous grants of bail in criminal proceedings; (d) the strength of the evidence\nagainst the requested person; and (e) any risk that the requested person may cause physical to mental\ninjury to another person.\n\n22. The approach taken by the High Court in a number of recent US bail appeals gives an indication as to the\nway in which the statutory considerations are approached in practice. In all five cases bail was refused”.\n\n“ Extradition Act 2oo3, s. l28(4).\n\n*’ Extradition Act 2oo3, s.95(2).

Hard drives provided by the government have\nbeen mishandled by MDC staff (dropped on the floor and slammed on a cart) causing them to\nbecome degraded and unstable and to randomly shut doun. While the laptop does not solve all of\nthese issues, it performs far beter than the MDC computers. The time, resources and funds\nexpended on problems caused by the electronic discovery and the computers is unnecessary,\nwasteful, and frustrating. The MDC is in no position - and is neither qualified nor experienced -\nto challenge Ms. Maxwell’s and her counsel’s claim that she needs access to the laptop on the\nweekends and holidays to even hope to finish reviewing the millions of pages of documents\nproduced in discovery.\n\nThe MDC’s assertion that Ms. Maxwell’s access to her atorneys is a reason to deny her\naccess to the laptop computer on weekend and holidays is non-sensical. One has absolutely\nnothing to do with the other. And it ignores the fact that, aside from time to review discovery or\ncommunicate with counsel, Ms. Maxwell is far more restricted than all other MDC inmates.\nOther inmates have unlimited time to communicate with other inmates. With <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> of\ninmates detained in the SHU for disciplinary reasons, all other MDC inmates have unlimited\ntime to interact with other inmates. Other than calls with family or communication with counsel,\nMs. Maxwell has no human contact except with guards who wield pouer over her, overmanage\nher, and have psychologically and physically abused her. And complaints regarding\nmistreatment by guards have led to reprisals against Ms. Maxwell.\n\nRather than state a valid reason for opposing the Court’s directive, the MDC’s opposition\nshines a klieg light on the deficiencies of its electronics and the limitations imposed on all\ninmates, most especially those detained pretrial. The restrictions placed on pretrial detainees goes\nbeyond deprivation of liberty. Their ability to prepare for trial is compromised, their access to\ncounsel is restricted, and their right to effective assistance of counsel is jeopardized. The\npandemic has made the situation even more dire. Requiring pretrial detainees, including Ms.\nMaxwell, to review terabytes of electronic discovery on inadequate computers further tips an\nalready unlevel playing field to the detriment of criminal defendants.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo234o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002355.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l34 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 8 of 23\n\nGiuffre, a public figure required to prove actual malice, had an uphill batle—even she\nwas constrained to acknouledge that many of her public statements were false. Using a time-\nhonored if unfortunate litigation tactic, her lawyers at Boies Schiller therefore sought to turn the\nlawsuit into a proxy prosecution of Epstein. Not surprisingly, discovery in the case was biter,\nhard-fought, and wide-ranging. It spanned more than a year and included large document\nproductions, many responses to interrogatories, and thirty-some depositions, including\ndepositions of Giuffre and Maxwell as well as several third parties.

See Katz v. United States, 389\nUS. 347, 35l (l967) (‘[T]he Fourth Amendment protects people, not places.”). Absent an\n<span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> to the warrant requirement, a governmental search is unconstitutional unless the\ngovernment conducts it under a warrant issued based on probable cause to believe a crime has\nbeen commited and that evidence of the crime is likely to be found in the place searched.\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2554", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002559.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l4o Filed o2/o4/2l Page ll of 22\n\nMaxwell had a legitimate expectation of privacy in her EE because\nshe reasonably sought to preserve them as private.

The Fifth Amendment would mean\nnothing if an individual were told by a district court that she need not invoke its protections\nbecause the government could not use her testimony against her—or at least could not do so\nwithout notice and an opportunity to be heard—only to find out that the testimony she offered\nwith the district court’s blessing was the primary evidence against her in a criminal case and the\nbasis of perjury charges.\n\nThat is the lesson of United States v. Oshatz, in which this Court quashed a government\nsubpoena issued to a court reporter for a transcript of a deposition offered by the defendant in a\ncivil proceeding. 7oo F. Supp. 696, 697 (S.D.N.Y. l988).

Applying Martindell, this Court quashed the government’s\nsubpoena and refused to release the deposition transcript because the “government [had] not\nargued that the protective order was improvidently granted or that there [were] some\nextraordinary circumstances or compelling need.” /d. at 7ol.\n\nHere, as in Oshatz, Maxwell was deposed on “the understanding that a protective order\nwould preserve” the confidentiality of her testimony. And even though Maxwell had not been\nindicted at the time of her depositions, the threat of an investigation was obvious, and that threat\nwas the very reason the Protective Order deliberately excluded a law-enforcement <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span>.\n(Moreover, Maxwell moved the court to require Giuffre to disclose any law enforcement\ninvestigation of which she was aware.) As in Oshatz, the Protective Order was designed to\npreserve Maxwell’s Fifth Amendment rights.

Counts\nOne through Four charge Ms. Maxwell with offenses allegedly commited between l994 and\nl997. But the applicable statute of limitations, l8 U.S.C. § 3282, expired five years after the\nalleged conduct.\n\nIn an atempt to get around its statute of limitations problem, the government has invoked\nl8 U.S.C. § 3283, as that statute was amended in 2oo3—many years after the alleged conduct\noccurred. But the government’s reliance on that provision is improper for two separate and\nindependent reasons, either of which, by itself, mandates dismissal of Counts One through Four.\n\nFirst, the charges are time-barred even under § 3283 unless the Court retroactively\napplies the 2oo3 amendment to the statute to cover Ms. Maxwell’s conduct from the l99os,\nrather than the version of § 3283 that was in effect at the time of the alleged offenses. But\nCongress made surpassingly clear that it did not intend the 2oo3 amendment to apply\nretroactively. To the contrary, the conference commitee considered and rejected an express\nretroactivity provision in the House version of the bill, and one of the bill’s original Senate co-\nsponsors acknouledged on the Senate floor that the omission was intentional. Moreover, any\nsuch retroactive application would have a presumptively impermissible retroactive effect.\n\nSecond, even if the 2oo3 amendment could be applied retroactively, § 3283 does not\napply to any of the offenses alleged in the indictment at all. Section 3283 is an <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> to the\ngeneral five-year statute of limitations, and it applies only to an “offense involving” the sexual or\nphysical abuse or kidnapping of a child. The Supreme Court has repeatedly made clear that the\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2655", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002666.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l8 of 25\nIl. Section 3283 Does Not Apply at All.\n\nEven if the 2oo3 Amendment could be retroactively applied to Ms. Maxwell’s alleged\nconduct during the l99os, Counts One through Four would still be time-barred for a separate and\nindependent reason: Section 3283 does not apply to the offenses with which Ms. Maxwell is\ncharged. Section 3283 extends the statute of limitations only for “offense[s] involving the sexual\nor physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child under the age of l8 years,” l8 U.S.C. § 3283, but none\nof the offenses charged in Counts One through Four is such an offense.’\n\nA. Section 3283 applies only to offenses that necessarily entail the sexual or\n\nphysical abuse, or kidnapping, of a child.\n\nA long line of cases establishes that an “offense” or “crime” that “involves” certain\nconduct means an offense that “necessarily requir[es]” that conduct. Shular v. United States, l4o\nS. Ct. 779, 785 (2o2o) (internal quotations omited). Those cases date back at least to Bridges v.\nUnited States, 346 U.S. 2o9 (l953), which construed the Wartime Suspension of Limitations\nAct’s extension of statutes of limitations for “any offense [] involving fraud or atempted fraud\nagainst the United States.” l8 U.S.C. § 3287 (l95o) (emphasis added). The Supreme Court held\nthat that extension was “limited strictly to offenses in which defrauding or atempting to defraud\nthe United States is an essential ingredient of the offense charged.” Bridges, 346 U.S. at 22l.\nThus, the Court held that charges that the defendant knouingly made and conspired to make\nfalse statements in a naturalization proceeding, and that he aided and abeted a fraudulent\ncertificate of naturalization, were subject to the general statute of limitations and not the\n<span class=\"highlight\">exception</span>, because “fraud is not an essential ingredient” of such offenses, and “[t]he offense is\ncomplete without proof of fraud, although fraud often accompanies it.” Jd. at 222.\n\n’ The words “or kidnaping” were added as part of the 2oo3 Amendment. 2oo3 Amendment at 66o.\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2666", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002669.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 2l of 25\n\nSuch a “necessarily entails” or “elements of the offense” approach is particularly\nappropriate for three additional reasons here. First, like the Wartime Suspension Act in Bridges,\n§ 3283 creates an “<span class=\"highlight\">exception</span>” to the general five-year limitations period of § 3282, and such\nexceptions should be “narrouly construed.” Bridges, 346 U.S. at 2l5-l6 (citing United States v.\nMcElvain, 272 U.S. 633, 639 (l926)); see also Comm ’r v. Clark, 489 U.S. 726, 739 (l989) (“we\nusually read the <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> narrouly in order to preserve the primary operation of the provision,”\nparticularly when the <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> is “somewhat ambiguous”). Second, § 3282 itself requires that\nany <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> to the five-year rule be “expressly provided by law.” l8 U.S.C. § 3282 (emphasis\nadded). Nouhere does § 3283 “expressly” purport to cover offenses that could (but need not) be\nproved by facts involving sexual or physical abuse of a minor. And third, under the rule of\nlenity, ambiguity with respect to criminal statutes should be construed in favor of the defendant.\nBurrage v. United States, 57l U.S. 2o4, 2l6 (2ol4); see also United States v. Valle, 8o7 F.3d\n5o8, 523 (2d Cir. 2ol5) (“where, as here, the Government and the defense both posit plausible\ninterpretations of a criminal statute, the rule of lenity requires us to adopt the defendant’s\nconstruction”). To do otherwise would violate the “longstanding congressional ‘policy of\nrepose’ that is fundamental to our society and our criminal law.” See Bridges, 346 U.S. at 2l5-\nl6; see also Toussie, 397 U.S. at ll5 (‘criminal limitations statutes are to be liberally interpreted\nin favor of repose” (internal quotation omited)).*\n\nB. The offenses charged in Counts One through Four do not necessarily entail\n\nthe sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping of a child.\n\nUnder the “necessarily entails” approach, § 3283 does not apply: None of the charged\ncounts “necessarily” entails “the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child.” See l8\n® Nor has the Second Circuit held otherwise. In Weingarten, because the issue arose in the context of an ineffective\nassistance of counsel claim, the court concluded only that it was “not obvious” that § 3283 required an elements-\nbased approach. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 53, 58-59.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2669", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002736.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l6o Filed o2/23/2l Page 5of9\nearnestness to abide by the conditions of her release and underscores that she has no intention to\nflee and reflects her deep need to communicate freely with counsel to prepare for her defense.\nHer renunciation of foreign citizenship obviates the Court’s concerns about the validity of\nwaivers of extradition.

Ms. Maxwell will have no ability to contest\nextradition from France or the United Kingdom on the basis of citizenship, which removes any\nincentive the Court and government believe she may have to seek refuge in those countries.\n\nB.

(See id. at l7-l8). To assuage any concerns that\nthose assets would be available to finance flight to and shelter in a foreign country, Ms. Maxwell\nhas taken steps to create a monitorship that will place meaningful restraints on the assets that are\nnot used to secure the bond, while still allouing Ms. Maxwell to pay for her legal defense, for\nher spouse to pay for daily living expenditures and for payment of taxes.\n\nl. New Account\n\nAll assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse, with the <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> of money currently held in\nescrou for legal fees and related defense expenses and the funds contained in the bank account in\nthe name of Ms. Maxwell’s spouse (“the Personal Account’”)!, will be deposited in a newly\ncreated account (“the New Account”) to be overseen by an asset monitor appointed pursuant to\norder of the Court.

The parties have reached agreement regarding redactions as to Exhibit ll and the\ndefendant’s cover leter. The parties do not believe any redactions are needed as to the defendant’s\ncover leter.

If the\nperson is no longer a French national at the time of the request, the provision does not\napply.\n\nl2. Had these provisions been intended to apply in cases where the person has lost French\nnationality subsequent to the commission of the alleged crime, the texts would have\nexpressly stated so or would at least have used both the present and the past tense to\nqualify the national affiliation of the requested person.\n\nl3. Furthermore, it is a well-knoun principle of legal interpretation across all jurisdictions\nthat exceptions to rules must be construed strictly. The nationality ban being an\n<span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> to extradition, it must be interpreted in a restrictive manner and its application\nto a person who is no longer a French national must be rejected.\n\nl4. Second, the Ministry’s interpretation goes against the spirit of the law\n\nl5. The literal reading of Article 3 of the Treaty and Article 696-4 of the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure is further supported by the fact that these provisions were in fact\nnot intended to apply in cases where the person sought has lost French citizenship, but\nonly in cases where that person has acquired French citizenship subsequent to the\ncommission of the alleged crime.\n\nl6. In other words, the rule that “nationality shall be assessed at the time of the offence for\nwhich extradition is requested” seeks to deny the extension of the benefit of French\nnationality to persons who have acquired French nationality after commiting an\noffence, in order to avoid fraudulent nationality applications of offenders seeking to\nescape extradition.\n\n3\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

Instead, the defendant\nasks the Court to apply an “essential ingredients” test, relying heavily upon the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 2o9 (l953), which concerned the Wartime\nSuspension of Limitations Act (“WSLA”). (Def. Mot. 2 at l2-l4).

As an initial mater,\nthe defendant’s claim that the Government “circumvented” Martindell fails because the\nGovernment issued a valid grand jury subpoena, sought judicial authorization to permit\ncompliance with the subpoena, and obtained materials from Boies Schiller that otherwise would\nhave been covered by the relevant protective order only after receiving such authorization. In any\nevent, even if the Government’s motion did not satisfy Martindell, Martindell provides no basis\nto suppress evidence, and the defendant cites no authority in support of that request. Second, the\ndefendant’s claim that the subpoena was a warrantless search in violation of the Fourth\nAmendment fails because she has not established standing to challenge a judicially approved grand\njury subpoena issued to a third party, and because the subpoena was entirely lawful. Even if she\nhad standing, her claim still fails because suppression would be improper under the good faith\n<span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> and the inevitable discovery doctrine. Third, the defendant’s claim that the subpoena\nviolated her Fifth Amendment rights fails because, among other things, such a violation requires\ncoercion and state action. Fourth, the defendant’s claim that the Government violated the Due\nProcess Clause is meritless, as the Government’s conduct was not, by any reasonable definition,\noutrageous or conscience shocking. And finally, the defendant’s request for a hearing should be\ndenied because she has proffered no admissible evidence to support her accusations of Government\nmisconduct; instead, she relies entirely on an anonymously sourced article that, as detailed herein,\nshe cites to describe certain events that simply did not occur.\n\nAccordingly, the defendant’s suppression motions should be denied.\n\n6o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o2l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003044.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page llo of 239\nexpectation of privacy in the places and items that were searched; and (2) whether that expectation\nwas one that society accepts as reasonable. /d. It is axiomatic that “[t]he proponent of a motion\nto suppress has the burden of establishing that his oun Fourth Amendment rights were violated by\nthe challenged search or seizure.” Kakas, 439 U.S. at l3o, n.l; see also Rawlings v. Kentucky, 448\nU.S. 98, lo4 (l98o).\n\nUnder the third party doctrine, the Fourth Amendment “does not prohibit the obtaining of\ninformation revealed to a third party and conveyed by [the third party] to Government authorities.”\nUnited States v. Miller, 425 U.S. 435, 443 (l976). The Supreme Court has long held that “a person\nhas no legitimate expectation of privacy in information he voluntarily turns over to third parties,”\nSmith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735, 743-44 (l979), “even if the information is revealed on the\nassumption that it will be used only for a limited purpose,” Miller, 425 U.S. 435, at 443.\nExceptions to the applicability of the third party doctrine are narrou. For example, in Carpenter,\nl38 S. Ct. at 222o, the Supreme Court declined to extend the third party doctrine to cell site\nlocation information, holding that “a warrant is required in the rare case where the suspect has a\nlegitimate privacy interest in records held by a third party.” l38 S. Ct. at 2222. Houever, the\nCourt stressed that its holding was “a narrou one,” with specific consideration given to “the unique\nnature of cell phone location information,” id. at 222o, which “provides an intimate windou into\na person’s life,” id. at 22l7.\n\n“The law is clear that the burden on the defendant to establish [Fourth Amendment]\nstanding is met only by sworn evidence, in the form of affidavit or testimony, from the defendant\nor someone with personal knouledge.” United States v.

Liab. Litig., 82l F.2d at l45 (“It\nis undisputed that a district court retains the pouer to modify or lift protective orders that it has\nentered.”). It also bears noting that Martindell and its progeny do not discuss law enforcement\napplications in Fourth Amendment terms.\n\nIn an effort to avoid the application of the third party doctrine, Maxwell contends that she\ndid not in fact voluntarily share anything in the civil suit, and that “every other circumstance”\nsupported her “expectation that her deposition transcripts would be private.” (Def. Mot. ll at 9).\nNeither argument withstands scrutiny. As an initial mater, the facts of this case are far removed\nfrom the “narrou” circumstances in which the Supreme Court has found an <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> to the third\nparty doctrine. For example, the Carpenter Court, while stressing that its holding was a “narrou\none,” l38 S. Ct. at 222o, held that “[g]iven the unique nature of cell phone location records,” which\nprovide a “intimate windou into a person’s life,” “the fact that the information is held by a third\nparty does not by itself overcome the user’s claim to Fourth Amendment protection.” /d. at 22l7;\nsee also Zietzke v. United States, 426 F. Supp. 3d 758, 768 (W.D. Wash. 2ol9) (“The Court...\nwill extend Carpenter to new circumstances only if they directly implicate the privacy concerns\nthat animated the majority. [T]he majority was overwhelmingly concerned with ‘Carpenter’s\nanticipation of privacy in his physical location.’ In other words, Carpenter was about\nsurveillance.” (internal citation omited)).\n\nThere can be no serious argument that the facts of this case, or the materials obtained\npursuant to the subpoena issued here, revealed Maxwell’s physical location over a period of time\nor are otherwise in any way analogous to the narrou category of information contemplated by the\nmajority in Carpenter. To the extent the defendant argues that her deposition transcripts implicate\nsuch interests because she “did not ‘voluntarily convey’ her testimony to Giuffre,” (Def. Mot. ll\n\n85\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o46", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003047.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll3 of 239\n\nat lo), the Court should reject the defendant’s efforts to twist Carpenter’s <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> to the third\nparty rule beyond recognition. The defendant was not compelled to participate in the deposition\nor to answer questions without invoking her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination; she\nvoluntarily chose to do so. Even if she chose to do so in reliance on the protective order, that\nprotective order was subject to modification under well-setled case law and by its oun terms.\nContrary to the defendant’s claims (Def. Mot. ll at lo), she assumed the risk that the deposition\ntranscripts would divulged to the Government. See, e.g., United States v. Schaefer, No. l7 Cr. 4oo\n(AZ), 2ol9 WL 2677ll, at *5 (D. Or. Jan. l7, 2ol9) (declining to apply Carpenter where\ngovernment obtained defendant’s eBay transactions without a warrant as defendant “assumed the\nrisk that [eBay] would reveal to police the purchases he made” and defendant “did not have a\nreasonable expectation of privacy in the records of his purchases”).\n\nBecause Maxwell had no legitimate Fourth Amendment privacy interest in the materials in\nBoies Schiller’s possession, she has no standing to challenge their seizure, and no warrant was\nrequired to obtain those materials. Her motion should be rejected on this ground alone.\n\nb. The Government Acted in Good Faith\n\nEven if the defendant had standing to bring this motion, it still fails because the\nGovernment only obtained these materials after obtaining a court order authorizing it to do so. The\nGovernment accordingly acted in good faith when it acted pursuant to that judicial order.\n\ni. Applicable Law\n\nUnder the so-called “good faith” <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span>, the exclusionary rule and its remedy of\nsuppression do not apply “when the Government ‘act[s] with an “objectively reasonable good-\nfaith belief that their conduct is lawful.’” United States v.

Discussion\nThe exclusionary rule and its remedy of suppression should not apply here, as the\nGovernment issued a grand jury subpoena; sought the materials after applying to the district court\nfor an order to modify the civil protective order; and only obtained the materials after the district\n88\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o49", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003052.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll8 of 239\nwas a protective order that would govern at least some of the materials, and that is why we\nultimately made the application to the Court.”)).\n\nWhile the Government appreciates, with the benefit of hindsight, that an answer that had\nalso referenced the February 2ol6 meeting (and the fact that USAO-SDNY took no action as a\nresult of that meeting) would have provided additional context—and would have further reinforced\nthat this was not a “Chemical Bank situation”—as noted above, the Government’s response\naccurately described its contacts with Boies Schiller as relevant to “your investigation” and the\nissuance of the subpoena at hand. Indeed, there is no reason to believe that a description of the\nFebruary 2ol6 meeting would have been material to Chief Judge McMahon’s analysis of whether\nshe was facing a “Chemical Bank kind of situation.” (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. E at 2).\n\nIn Chemical Bank, counsel for a civil party approached the Manhatan District Atorney’s\nOffice “suggesting that it had evidence of criminal violations relating to the case.” l54 F.R.D. at\n93. In response, a grand jury subpoena was issued and “confidential documents were produced by\nthe defendant without complying with any of the specific procedures or exceptions provided in the\n[confidentiality] orders.” Jd. Here, by contrast, the Government accurately conveyed to Chief\nJudge McMahon the opening of its investigation in late 2ol8, the reason it made contact with Boies\nSchiller shortly thereafter and served a subpoena in February 2ol9, and that no documents\ngoverned by the protective order had yet been produced. Aside from rank speculation loosely\npremised on an anonymously sourced news report, the defendant offers nothing to support her\nassertion that “Boies Schiller was instrumental in fomenting the Maxwell prosecution” (Def. Mot.\n3 at 2) (emphasis in original), or that AUSA-l’s February 2ol6 meeting with Boies Schiller (as it\nactually occurred) undercut the accuracy of the Government’s representations to Chief Judge\nMcMahon, or played any role in the Government opening its investigation in November 2ol8.\n\n9l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o52", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003053.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll9 of 239\n\nSecond, the Government did not misrepresent the extent of its knouledge of the contents\nof Boies Schiller’s files. As the Government correctly represented to the court, the Government\nhad “either litle or no additional information than the Court does in terms of what materials there\nare [and] who was deposed.” (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. D at l7). In support of her argument, Maxwell\ncites again to the Daily News Article, which reports that “after Maxwell’s two depositions, David\nBoies himself apparently approached the government in the summer of 2ol6, asking ‘if the\nSouthern District would consider charging Maxwell with perjury’” (Def. Mot. 3 at 8). But the\nGovernment has uncovered no evidence that such a meeting ever occurred. AUSA-l does not\nrecall ever speaking with or meeting David Boies in her life. (Ex. 4 at 4). Moreover, AUSA-l\ndoes not recall being asked if the USAO-SDNY would consider charging Maxwell with perjury\n(id. at 5), and while notes of the February 2ol6 meeting refer to the existence of depositions\ngenerally, there can be no question Chief Judge McMahon appreciated the Government’s general\nunderstanding that such transcripts would be part of the civil litigation file. (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. G at\n2l). Simply put, there is no evidence that the Government had any significant knouledge of the\ncontents of Boies Schiller’s files, or that the Government’s representations to Chief Judge\nMcMahon were incorrect.\n\nIn sum, Maxwell has failed to put forth any evidence that the Government misled Chief\nJudge McMahon, and as such, the good faith <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> applies. To the contrary, the record before\nthe Court demonstrates that the Government directly responded to Chief Judge McMahon’s\nquestion and accurately described the contacts between Boies Schiller and the USAO-SDNY in\nconnection with the investigation, the Government’s lack of knouledge of the contents of that file,\nand the fact that no protected materials had been produced in violation of the protective order.\nUpon receiving a court order issued by a Chief United States District Judge who had carefully\n\n92\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o53", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003064.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l3o of 239\n\nThe defendant argues that Martindell “authorized her to give deposition testimony under\nthe shield of the Protective Order without worrying whether the government could ‘insinuate itself”\ninto the case and use her oun words against her.” (Def. Mot. ll at l5-l6). That is not the law,\nand the defendant cannot use the protective order to cloak her testimony. The Second Circuit has\nrecognized that because “i]t is well-setled here and elsewhere . . . that a Rule 26(c) protective\norder may be overturned or modified based on a finding of improvidence, extraordinary\ncircumstances or compelling need[,]” “as a practical mater it is clear that the protections afforded\nby a Rule 26(c) order are not as extensive as those afforded by the fifth amendment, or by a\nstatutory grant of use immunity, and that a protective order therefore cannot be used to abridge a\nwitness’ fifth amendment rights.” Andover Data Servs., 876 F.2d at lo83 (emphasis in original);\nsee id. at lo84 (‘Uncertainty about the ultimate outcome of a protective order will mean that no\ndeponent may always effectively rely on a protective order to secure his right against self-\nincrimination.””) (quoting Jn re Grand Jury Subpoena, 836 F.2d l468, l478 (4th Cir. l988)));\nDavis, 7o2 F.2d at 42l-22 (“Absent applicable grounds for <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span>, such as a previously asserted\nFifth Amendment privilege, no shield protects the civil evidence [ | from compellable production\nbefore the grand jury which subpoenaed it’).\n\n4. The Government Did Not Violate Maxwell’s Due Process Rights\n\nThe defendant also claims that the Government’s conduct “cannot be squared with\nelemental due process.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l4 (citing U.S. Const. amend. V)). This claim is meritless.\nBecause there was no Government misconduct—let alone the type of outrageous Government\n\nlo3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o64", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003081.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l47 of 239\n\nto determine the meaning that a defendant assigns to a specific question.” J/d.; see, e.g. United\nStates v. Sampson, 898 F.3d 287, 3o7 (2d Cir. 2ol8).*7\n\nA narrou <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> arises when language in a question is so “fundamentally ambiguous”\nthat a Court can conclude, as a mater of law, that a perjury count cannot stand. Lighte, 782 F.2d\nat 375. A question is “fundamentally ambiguous” when “it is not a phrase with a meaning about\nwhich [people] of ordinary intellect could agree, nor one which could be used with mutual\nunderstanding by a questioner and answerer unless it were defined at the time it were sought and\noffered as testimony.” /d. at 375 (internal quotation marks omited). In such a case, the “answers\nassociated with the questions posed may be insufficient as a mater of law to support the perjury\nconviction.” United States v. Markiewicz, 978 F.2d 786, 8o8 (2d Cir. l992) (quoting Lighte, 782\nF.2d at 375). For instance, in Lighte, a case involving post-conviction appellate review, the Court\nfound that a question was fundamentally ambiguous because it used the word ““you’ without\nindication that, unlike the prior two questions, the appellant was nou being questioned in his role\nas trustee.” 782 F.2d at 376. “[F]undamental ambiguity,” houever, “is the <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span>, not the\nrule.” United States v. Sarwari, 669 F.3d 4ol, 4o7 (4th Cir. 2ol2) (quoting United States v.\nFarmer, l37 F.3d l265, l269 (loth Cir. l998)). A defendant cannot demonstrate fundamental\nambiguity simply by shouing that words used in a question are amenable to multiple meanings,\nor that an answer “might generate a number of different interpretations.” Lighte, 782 F.2d at 375;\nUnited States v. Strohm, 67l F.3d ll73, ll78 (loth Cir. 2oll) (“Simply plumbing a question for\npost hoc ambiguity will not defeat a perjury conviction where the evidence demonstrates the\ndefendant understood the question in context and gave a knouingly false answer.”). “If, in the\n“” The Second Circuit analyzes general principles of perjury similarly under l8 U.S.C. § l623 and\nanother perjury statute, l8 U.S.C. § l62l, see Lighte, 782 F.3d at 372, and it has assumed without\ndeciding that those standards also apply to offenses under l8 U.S.C. § lool(a)(2), see United States\nv. Sampson, 898 F.3d 287, 3o7 n.l5 (2d Cir. 2ol8).\n\nl2o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o8l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003097.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l63 of 239\nchoices reflected in the criminal discovery rules.” Jd. Second, doing so “risks invading ‘the\ninviolable function of the jury’ in our criminal justice system.’” /d. at 28l (citation omited).\nAccordingly, if the “defense raises a factual dispute that is inextricably intertwined with a\ndefendant’s potential culpability, a judge cannot resolve that dispute on a Rule l2(b) motion.” Jd.\n\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> to this rule is “extraordinarily narrou” because, in the normal course, the\n“government must make a detailed presentation of the entirety of the evidence before a district\ncourt can dismiss an indictment on sufficiency grounds,” which the Government is not required to\ndo at the motion-to-dismiss stage. /d. at 282 (internal quotation marks and citation omited). That\npoint is underscored by United States v. Nitsche, 843 F. Supp. 2d 4 (D.D.C. 2oll), on which the\ndefendant relies. There, the district court dismissed an indictment in a child enticement case for\ninsufficiency of the evidence. First, houever, the court explained that the question was ripe\nbecause “(l) Defendant has stipulated to the entire record that is relevant to Count I; (2) the\nGovernment has had several opportunities to make a proffer of any additional facts, to conduct\nany subsequent investigation, and to ask the Court for further delay to seek more evidence; and (3)\nbecause the record is limited to the chat.” Jd. at 9. Accordingly, “[t]he transcripts themselves\nprovide the Court with all of the relevant undisputed facts to decide the motion.” /d. Here, of\ncourse, that is simply not the case and, in particular, there is no stipulation as to the entire relevant\nrecord.\n\nUnder the relevant legal standard, the defendant’s statements were material if they could\nhave led to the discovery of other evidence or could influence the factfinder in the defendant’s\ncivil case. Evaluating that standard necessarily implicates facts beyond the deposition testimony\nitself and Judge Preska’s unsealing order,*’ such as identification of the allegedly defamatory\n°° The defendant observes that Judge Preska redacted some of the statements that form the basis\nof Count Six, stating that the “testimony is . . . far afield from the sex trafficking and sexual abuse\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o97", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003106.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Pagel72 of 239\nin each indictment—to his personal profit); United States v. Broun, No. o7-o296, 2oo8 WL\nl6ll46, at *5 (E.D. Pa. Jan. l6, 2oo8) (severing an “isolated” firearms possession charge on a\ncertain day from other narcotics and firearms charges); United States v. Martinez, No. 92 Cr. 839\n(SWK), l993 WL 322768, at *8-9 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. l9, l993) (similar).\n\nThe defendant also contends that her false statements were not connected to the substantive\noffenses because they were made in a civil deposition, rather than “to the grand jury or the FBI to\nderail its investigation.” (Def. Mot. 5 at 8). As an initial mater, and as evidenced by the\ndefendant’s oun motions to suppress the fruits of the grand jury subpoena issued to Boies Schiller,\nthe defendant herself professes to have been concerned about the prospect of a criminal\ninvestigation at the time of her depositions, which strongly suggests that, on these facts, the\ndistinction is of litle moment. (See, e.g., Def. Mot. 3 at 3-4 (explaining that the defendant “flatly\nrejected” a law enforcement <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> to the civil protective order); Def. Mot. ll at 2 (arguing\nthat the defendant “declined to invoke” her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination\nat the deposition after negotiating the protective order)). More important, and whatever moment\nthat distinction may have in other contexts, it has litle bearing on the severance analysis which\nturns instead on whether the substance of the false statement relates to the substantive offense, and\nis thereby provable through overlapping evidence and part of the speaker’s effort to conceal the\noffense. See Ruiz, 894 F.2d at 5o5; Potamitis, 739 F.2d at 79l (citing United States v. Carson,\n464 F.2d 424, 436 (2d Cir. l972); Sweig, 44l F.2d at ll8-l9) (affirming denial of a severance\nmotion where the false statements “concern the substantive offenses” and citing cases where the\nperjury count’s proof overlapped with the evidence on the substantive counts). With respect to\nthat analysis, the defendant cites no case for the proposition that the seting in which the statement\nis made is significant, much less determinative. Cf Broccolo, 797 F. Supp. at ll9o (false statement\n\nl45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3lo6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003110.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l76 of 239\n“such evidence might lead to evidence . . . which would justify forfeiture”). The jury need not\ndecide the outcome of the defamation case in order to evaluate whether truthful answers were\ncapable of influencing the decisionmaker or could reasonably have led to the discovery of\nadmissible evidence.**\n\nFinally, the defendant argues that severance is appropriate because including the perjury\ncounts “will necessarily introduce into the trial the issue of Ms. Maxwell’s credibility.” (Def. Mot.\n5 at l3). That is true anytime perjury or false statements counts are joined with other offenses, yet\njoining perjury or false statements counts to the substantive crimes they concern is the rule, not\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span>. And more generally, the “adverse effect of being tried for two crimes rather than\none” is not prejudice. Werner, 62o F.2d at 929.\n\nTrying the perjury counts with the Mann Act counts they concern makes eminent sense.\nDoing so greatly advances judicial efficiency by avoiding the need for two trials at which the same\nevidence would be presented, including testimony from the same victims. Just as the counts are\nsimilar in character, the trial would not be unwieldy. Against these efficiencies, endorsed by the\nliberal joinder principles behind Rule 8, the defendant identifies at most only “generalized claim[s]\nof prejudice,” Rivera, 546 F.3d at 254, that can be cured by an appropriate limiting instruction.\nShe thus falls far short of meeting her heavy burden, and her motion should be denied.\n\n4 The defendant relatedly suggests that her counsel from the defamation suit may have to testify\nregarding the perjury counts, denying her counsel of her choice. She has not identified what factual\nissue they might testify to and why it must come from one of the lawyers who represented her on\nboth that case and this one. The Government notes, in this respect, that three of the defendant’s\natorneys in this case had no involvement in the civil suit. Even if such testimony were necessary\nby one of the defendant’s lawyers, it would only disqualify the firm if that lawyer is called “on a\nsignificant issue other than on behalf of the client, and it is apparent that the testimony may be\nprejudicial to the client.” N.Y. R.P.C. 3.7(b); see generally Murray v. Met. Life Ins.

United States, 369 U.S. 749 (l962)). Similarly, “where an indictment charges a\ncrime that depends in turn on violation of another statute, the indictment must identify the\nunderlying offense.” United States v. Pirro, 2l2 F.3d 86, 93 (2d Cir. 2ooo). When delineating the\ncontours of this narrou category of crimes requiring additional specificity in an indictment, the\nSecond Circuit has previously found that the failure to name a specific victim of fraud does not\nrender an indictment inadequate under this standard. See Stringer, 73o F.3d at l27. In other words,\nabsent some affirmative indication that additional specificity is required when charging a particular\nstatute, there is no basis to conclude that an indictment need contain more than the elements of the\noffense and the approximate time and place of the alleged violation. See Wey, 2ol7 WL 23765l\nat *5 (declining to “depart from the usual sufficiency framework” where defendant “cites no\nauthority” suggesting that the statutes at issue fall into the narrou <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> to the general rule\nwhen considering motion to dismiss for lack of specificity).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nBecause each of the four counts at issue—Counts One, Two, Three, and Four—clearly lays\nout each element of the charged offense and adequately informs the defendant of the accusations\nagainst her, the Indictment easily satisfies the standard for sufficiency. Tellingly, the defendant\ndoes not claim that any of these counts fails to allege an essential element or to track the language\nof the relevant statute. Nor could she, as the face of the Indictment not only contains each and\nevery essential element of the crimes charged, but also goes beyond the basic requirements for\npleading each charge by providing additional factual background. Instead, the defendant baldly\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ll3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003114.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8o of 239\nasserts that the crimes charged in Counts One through Four require additional specificity without\nciting any authority in support of such a broad claim. (See Def. Mot. l2 at 2). In particular, the\ndefendant suggests that the failure to identify each minor victim by name, the presence of a date\nrange rather than specific dates, and the use of certain language that the defendant claims not to\nunderstand render Counts One through Four so deficient that they must be dismissed. Because the\ndefendant cites no authority indicating that violations of l8 U.S.C. §§ 37l, 2422, or 2423 fall into\nthe rare <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> to “the rule that ‘an indictment need do litle more than to track the language of\nthe statute charged,’” her motion should be denied. United States v. Murgio, 2o9 F. Supp. 3d 698,\n7l6 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol6) (Nathan, J.) (quoting Stringer, 73o F.3d at l24).\n\nFirst, the use of pseudonyms to refer to minor victims of the charged conduct does not\nwarrant dismissal of the Indictment. See Stringer, 73o F.3d at l24 (affirming sufficiency of fraud\nindictment “[n]Jotwithstanding its failure to specify the names of persons whose identifying\ndocuments were used” in scheme where prosecution provided victims’ names in advance of trial).\nThe identity of a victim is not required to be included on the face of a charging instrument, and the\n“lack of any identity or date of birth information of the alleged victims does not warrant dismissal”\nof charges alleging sexual abuse. United States v. Kidd, 386 F. Supp.3d 364, 369 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9).\nThe defendant cites no law to the contrary and has not identified a single indictment in this District\nthat includes the full names of minor victims of sexual abuse. Indeed, it makes good sense that a\ncharging instrument alleging sexual abuse of minors would not include the full names of minor\nvictims, whose privacy Congress has emphasized should be protected. See l8 U.S.C. § 35o9(d)\n(delineating privacy protections for child victims and witnesses).\n\nJudge Marrero’s decision in Kidd, which denied a motion to dismiss a sex trafficking\ncharges in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l where the indictment referred to victims by pseudonyms,\nl53\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ll4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003146.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l2 of 239\n\nto review the statements of testifying witnesses.

The history of the litigation and issues relating to it are discussed in\nChapter Three of this Report.\n\nB. Epstein Is Placed on Work Release\n\nA few days after Epstein’s guilty plea, Villafafia reported to Sloman that Epstein was\nincarcerated at the lou-security Stockade, rather than the Main Detention Center where county\nprisoners were usually housed. She also told Sloman that according to the Sheriff’s Office, Epstein\nwas eligible for work release. Although the USAO had made clear that it expected Epstein to be\nincarcerated 24 hours a day, every day, the subject of work release had not been addressed\nexplicitly during the NPA negotiations, and the NPA itself was silent on the issue. Epstein’s\nacceptance into the work release program as a convicted sexual offender was seen by many as\nanother special benefit given to Epstein. Because the decision to allou Epstein into the work\nrelease program was made by the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office, OPR did not investigate whether\nany state, county, or Sheriff's Office rules were violated. OPR did examine the USAO’s\nconsideration of work release prior to signing the NPA and its subsequent unsuccessful efforts to\nensure that Epstein remained incarcerated 24 hours a day.\n\nThe first specific reference to work release was made weeks after the NPA was signed,\nwhen Lefkouitz asserted, in his October 23, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, that, “so long as Mr. Epstein’s\nsentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the [NPA] he is entitled to any type of sentence\navailable to him, including but not limited to gain time and work release.”\n\nIn November 2oo7, Sloman had an exchange of leters with Lefkouitz about the USAO’s\nunderstanding that Epstein had agreed to serve his full jail term in “continuous confinement,”\npointing out that the NPA “clearly indicates that Mr. Epstein is to be incarcerated.” Sloman noted\nthat Florida’s Department of Corrections’s rules did not allou individuals registered as sexual\noffenders to participate in work release, and thus Epstein would not be eligible for a work release\nprogram. Sloman concluded that the USAO “‘is puting you on notice that it intends to make certain\nthat Mr. Epstein is ‘treated no beter and no worse than anyone else’ convicted of the same\noffense,” and that if Epstein were to be granted work release, the USAO would “investigate the\nreasons why an <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> was granted in Mr. Epstein’s case.”!”8\n\nHouever, also in November, State Atorney Krischer told Sloman that Epstein was, in fact,\neligible to petition for work release because his sexual offender registration would not take place\nal Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The Daily\nBeast. The FBI Special Agent in Charge told OPR that he had no recollection of such a call, but acknouledged that\nit could have occurred.\n\nl78 Sloman provided a draft of this leter to Acosta for his approval before the leter was sent to Lefkouitz.\nll3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33l5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003328.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l52 of 348\nprosecutors adhere to the principles and objectives” of the Sentencing Reform Act of l984, the\nSentencing Guidelines, and the PROTECT Act “in their charging, case disposition, and sentencing\npractices.” !?>\n\nThe Ashcroft Memo directed that, “in all federal cases, federal prosecutors must charge\nand pursue the most serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts of\nthe case,” except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or designated\nsupervisory authority in certain articulated limited circumstances. The Ashcroft Memo cautioned\nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either\nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial. The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “designated\nsupervisory atorney.” As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“particularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy. In\naddition, the policy applies to “readily provable” charges, thus inherently allouing a prosecutor\nl95 The Ashcroft Memo was issued before the Supreme Court decided United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 22o\n(2oo5), which struck doun the provision of the federal sentencing statute that required federal district judges to impose\na sentence within the applicable Federal Sentencing Guidelines range. Those Guidelines were the product of\nthe United States Sentencing Commission, which was created by the Sentencing Reform Act of l984. The\nProsecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today (PROTECT) Act of 2oo3, Pub.\nL. lo8-2l, ll7 Stat. 65o, was directed at preventing child abuse. It included a variety of provisions designed to\nimprove the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against children. Among other things, the PROTECT Act\nprovided for specific sentencing considerations for certain sex-related offenses, such as those involving multiple\noccasions of prohibited sexual conduct or those involving material with depictions of violence or with specified\nnumbers of images.\n\nl26\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3328", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003329.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l53 of 348\nflexibility to decline to bring a particular charge based on a “good faith doubt” that the law or\nevidence supports the charge.\n\nZi Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens\n\nOn April 28, l995, the Atorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors\nentitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly\nbecome involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States. In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated administrative deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\n\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\nextraordinary circumstances exist. Accordingly, absent such\ncircumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a\ntee, l98\ncrime.\n\nStipulated administrative deportation orders can be based “on the conviction for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)(), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either sentenced to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\n\nC. Case Law\n\nl. Prosecutorial Discretion\n\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\ndiscretion in deciding whether and whom to prosecute. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP Enforcement Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\n\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3329", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003340.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l64 of 348\nLongstanding Department policy directs prosecutors to require the defendant to plead to the most\nserious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the defendant’s criminal\nconduct, that has an adequate factual basis, is likely to result in a sustainable conviction, makes\nlikely the imposition of an appropriate sentence and restitution order, and does not adversely affect\nthe investigation or prosecution of others. See USAM §§ 9-27.43o, 9-27-3oo, 9-27.4oo\n(comment). The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\n<span class=\"highlight\">exception</span>: a U.S. Atorney or a “designated supervisory atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.7°? Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate. OPR found it unnecessary to resolve the question\nwhether federal charges against Epstein were readily provable, houever, because Acosta had\n2o8 In addition to specified “Limited Exceptions,” this authorization is available in “Other Exceptional\nCircumstances,” as follous:\n\nProsecutors may decline to pursue or may dismiss readily provable charges in\n\nother exceptional circumstances with the writen or otherwise documented\n\napproval of an Assistant Atorney General, United States Atorney, or designated\n\nsupervisory atorney. This <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> recognizes that the aims of the Sentencing\n\nReform Act must be sought without ignoring the practical limitations of the\n\nfederal criminal justice system. For example, a case-specific approval to dismiss\n\ncharges in a particular case might be given because the United States Atorney’s\n\nOffice is particularly over-burdened, the duration of the trial would be\n\nexceptionally long, and proceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total\n\nnumber of cases disposed of by the office. Houever, such case-by-case\n\nexceptions should be rare; otherwise the goals of fairness and equity will be\n\njeopardized.\nAshcroft Memo at § I.B.6.

Nader, 425 F. Supp. 3d 6l9 (E.D. Va. 2ol9). In\nNader, the court performed a Landgraf analysis in analyzing the retroactivity of the 2oo3\nAmendment, and it appears to be the only previous case in which Congress’ explicit rejection of\na retroactivity provision in the 2oo3 Amendment has even been mentioned. In Nader, houever,\nthe court noted the legislative history of the 2oo3 Amendment but held that only the ‘ext of the\namendment was relevant to step one of Landgraf. 425 F. Supp. 3d at 627 (finding legislative\nhistory arguments “misplaced within the first step of the Landgraf analysis, which asks only\nwhether the statute at issue contains ... language unequivocally delineating the time period to\nwhich it applies”).\n\nNader’s exclusion of legislative history from the Landgraf analysis‘ cannot be reconciled\nwith the Supreme Court’s applications of Landgraf—or, for that mater, with Landgraf itself.\nSee, e.g., Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 264 (considering legislative history); Martin v. Hadix, 527 U.S.\n343, 355-57 (l999) (examining “structure and legislative history” as part of first Landgraf step).\nAnd as the government acknouledges, “the Second Circuit has considered both the text of the\nstatute and the legislative history” at the first Landgraf step. Opp. 28 (citing Jn re Enterprise\nMortgage Acceptance Co., 39l F.3d 4ol, 4o6-o8 (2d Cir. 2oo4)). Thus, Nader is not persuasive\nauthority.\n\nIn short, no court has considered Congress’ explicit rejection of a retroactivity provision\nin performing a Landgraf analysis of the retroactivity of the 2oo3 Amendment. In fact, the\ngovernment cites only three cases that have analyzed the 2oo3 Amendment under Landgraf at\nall: the Second Circuit and First Circuit opinions in Weingarten and United States v. Miller, 9ll\nF.3d 638 (lst Cir. 2ol8), respectively, which were ineffective assistance of counsel cases and\n* Although the court in Nader explicitly characterized legislative history arguments as “misplaced” within step one\nof Landgraf, it also omited them from step two of its Landgraf analysis.

The non-prosecution agreement does not bind the U.S. Atorney for the\n\nSouthern District of New York\n\nUnited States Atorneys speak for the United States. When a U.S. Atorney makes a\npromise as part of a plea bargain, both contract principles and due process require the federal\ngovernment to fulfill it. See Santobello v. New York, 4o4 U.S. 257, 262 (l97l); United States v.\nReady, 82 F.3d 55l, 558 (2d Cir. l996). The question here is not whether the U.S. Atorney for\nthe Southern District of Florida had the pouer to bind the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District\nof New York. The question is whether the terms of the NPA did so. Applying Second Circuit\nprecedent and principles of contract interpretation, the Court concludes that they did not.\n\nIn United States v. Annabi, the Second Circuit held: “A plea agreement binds only the\noffice of the United States Atorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it\naffirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.” 77l F.2d 67o, 672\n(2d Cir. l985) (per curiam). This is something akin to a clear statement rule. Single-district plea\nagreements are the norm. Nationwide, unlimited agreements are the rare <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span>. Applying\nAnnabi, panels of the Second Circuit have stated that courts cannot infer intent to depart from\nthis ordinary practice from an agreement’s use of phrases like “the government” or “the United\nStates.” United States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88, l2o (2d Cir. l998) (per curiam); United States v.\nGonzalez, 93 F. App’x 268, 27o (2d Cir. 2oo4). Those are common shorthand. A plea\nagreement need not painstakingly spell out “the Office of the United States Atorney for Such-\nand-Such District” in every instance to make clear that it applies only in the district where\nsigned.\n\nMaxwell asks this Court to draw the opposite conclusion. The provision of the NPA\ndealing with co-conspirators does not expressly state that it binds U.S. Atorneys in other\ndistricts. It does not expressly state that it applies in other districts. The relevant language, in\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3678", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003695.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l of 34\nMoreover, the Government has agreed to disclose their names in advance of trial. There is thus\nno unfairness here. See Stringer, 73o F.3d at l26. As discussed belou, the Court will require\nthe parties to negotiate and propose a full schedule for all remaining pretrial disclosures.\n\nIV. The perjury charges are legally tenable\n\nThe Court turns next to Maxwell’s motion to dismiss the perjury counts stemming from\nher answers to questions in a deposition in a civil case. She contends that these charges are\nlegally deficient because the questions posed were fundamentally ambiguous and the questions\nwere not material to the subject of the deposition. The Court concludes that the charges are\nlegally tenable and Maxwell’s defenses are appropriately left to the jury.\n\nThe applicable perjury statute imposes criminal penalties on anyone who “‘in any\nproceeding before or ancillary to any court .. . knouingly makes any false material declaration.”\nl8 U.S.C. § l623(a). Testimony is perjurious only if it is knouingly false and is material to the\nproceeding in which the defendant offered it.\n\nA. The questions posed were not too ambiguous to support a perjury charge\n\nThe requirement of knouing falsity requires that a witness believe that their testimony is\nfalse. United States v. Lighte, 782 F.2d 367, 372 (2d Cir. l986). As a general mater, “[a] jury is\nbest equipped to determine the meaning that a defendant assigns to a specific question.” Jd.\nCourts have acknouledged a narrou <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> for questions that are so fundamentally\nambiguous or imprecise that the answer to them cannot legally be false. Jd. at 372, 375; see also\nUnited States v. Wolfson, 437 F.2d 862, 878 (2d Cir. l97o). A question is fundamentally\nambiguous only if reasonable people could not agree on its meaning in context. Lighte, 782 F.2d\nat 375. The existence of some arguable ambiguity does not foreclose a perjury charge against a\nwitness who understood the question.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3695", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003696.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22 of 34\n\nAt a minimum, Maxwell’s motion is premature. Courts typically evaluate whether a\nquestion was fundamentally ambiguous only after the development of a full factual record at\ntrial. See, e.g., United States v. Markiewicz, 978 F.2d 786, 8o8 (2d Cir. l992). The evidence at\ntrial may shed further light on whether the questions posed were objectively ambiguous in\ncontext or whether Maxwell subjectively understood them. In any event, the Court has closely\nconsidered each of the categories of questions that Maxwell argues are ambiguous. None of the\nalleged ambiguities Maxwell identifies rise to the level supporting dismissal of the charges. The\ncontext of the questions and answers, in conjunction with the Government’s evidence, could lead\na reasonable juror to conclude that the statements were perjurious. Truth and falsity are\nquestions for the jury in all but the most extreme cases. The Court declines to usurp the jury’s\nrole on the limited pretrial record.\n\nB. A reasonable juror could conclude that Maxwell’s statements were material\n\nMaxwell also argues that the perjury counts should be dismissed because none of the\nallegedly false statements were material to the defamation action. Ina civil deposition, a\nstatement is material if it has a natural tendency to influence the court or if a truthful answer\nmight reasonably lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. United States v. Gaudin, 5l5\nU.S. 5o6, 5o9 (l995); United States v. Kross, l4 F.3d 75l, 753-54 (2d Cir. l994). Like knouing\nfalsity, materiality is an element of the offense and thus ordinarily must be “decided by the jury,\nnot the court.” Johnson v. United States, 52o U.S. 46l, 465 (l997). Only the most extraordinary\ncircumstances justify departure from this general rule. United States v. Forde, 74o F. Supp. 2d\n4o6, 4l2 (S.D.N.Y. 2olo) (citing Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 522-23).\n\nThe charged statements do not fall within this narrou <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span>. Maxwell contends that\nthe questions did not relate to the sex trafficking and sexual abuse allegations at the center of the\n22\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3696", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003784.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo of 2o\n\nB. There is no good faith.\n\nThe rebutal to government’s good faith claim is simple: There can be no good faith\nwhen the government willfully and intentionally misleads the court into authorizing its search.\nAs the United States Supreme Court held in United States v. Leon,\n\nSuppression . . . remains an appropriate remedy if the magistrate or judge in issuing\n\na warrant was misled by information in an affidavit that the affiant knew was false\n\nor would have knoun was false except for his reckless disregard of the truth.\n\n468 U.S. 897, 923 (l984).\n\nHere, as explained in Maxwell’s due process motion to suppress and the reply in support\nthereof, the government misled Chief Judge McMahon to modify the Giuffre Protective Order\nand authorize the subpoena to Boies Schiller. The good faith doctrine does not apply when the\ngovernment acts in objective bad faith.\n\nC. The government’s inevitable discovery doctrine fails.\n\nThere are several reasons the government’s inevitable discovery argument fails.\n\nFirst, the inevitable discovery doctrine is an <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> to the Fourth Amendment’s\nexclusionary rule. United States v. Stokes, 733 F.3d 438, 442—43 (2d Cir. 2ol3) (reversing\ndistrict court’s denial of motion to suppress, which was based on “the inevitable discovery\ndoctrine, an <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> to the Fourth Amendment's exclusionary rule”). The doctrine has no\napplicability when a court exercises its inherent or supervisory authority to suppress evidence\nobtained through deliberate government misconduct. The exercise of that authority is meant to\nvindicate the dignity of the Court and to deter improper governmental conduct. See United States\nv. Cortina, 63o F.2d l2o7, l2l6 (7th Cir. l98o) (“The need for deterrence of illegal conduct is,\nin one sense, greater here than [elsewhere], for [the government’s] offense was commited within\nthe sanctity of the court itself.”).\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3784", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003786.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of 2o\nMaxwell’s two deposition transcripts, Resp. at 94 & n.4l. And as to Count 6 in particular\n(alleging perjury in the July 2ol6 deposition), the government concedes, as it must, that Judge\nPreska has refused to unseal all of the testimony charged in the indictment, except one question\nand one answer. Resp. at 94 n.4l. The government offers no explanation for hou it inevitably\nwould have obtained all 9o,ooo pages of material from Boies Schiller when the two deposition\ntranscripts don’t even total l,ooo pages.\n\nFourth, the government misunderstands the burden of proof. The government tries to\nfault Maxwell for seeking “suppression of a// evidence [it] obtained pursuant to the subpoena,”\ncalling this a “windfall.” Resp. at 95. But it’s the government’s burden to prove the applicability\nof the inevitable discovery <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span>. Stokes, 733 F.3d at 444 (inevitable discovery doctrine\napplies only “if the government can prove that the evidence would have been obtained inevitably\nwithout the constitutional violation”) (rejecting government’s inevitable discovery claim). The\ngovernment must explain why Maxwell isn’t entitled to this remedy, not the other way around.\nThe government has fallen far, far short of meeting its burden, if only because it offers no\nargument—on the facts or the law—for hou it might have inevitably discovered more than\n89,ooo pages of material that hasn’t been and won’t be unsealed by Judge Preska. This Court\nshould have no confidence, much less a “high level of confidence, that each of the contingencies\nnecessary to the legal discovery of the contested evidence would be resolved in the government's\nfavor.” United States v. Heath, 455 F.3d 52, 55 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (articulating inevitable discovery\nstandard).\n\nThe inevitable discovery doctrine does not apply.\n\nII. The Government’s violation of Martindell requires suppression.\n\nThe government ignores the primary argument Maxwell made in her Motion: The\n\ngovernment circumvented Martindell, and deprived Maxwell of due process, by securing a\n?\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3786", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003790.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6 of 2o\nMaxwell with perjury.* There are compelling reasons, therefore, to think the government and\nBoies Schiller collaborated and that Boies Schiller’s conduct was in part at the government’s\nbehest.\n\nThe record in the Giuffre case preceding the first deposition supports this conclusion as\nwell. Based on Giuffre’s claim of an ongoing investigation, Maxwell requested, prior to her\ndeposition, that Giuffre disclose any alleged “on-going criminal investigation by law\nenforcement” or alternatively to stay the action pending completion of any such investigation.\nEx. A. In part, Maxwell needed information concerning any such investigation to assess “the\nimpact on any 5th Amendment privilege.” Ex. A, p 3. The district court declined to afford Ms.\nMaxwell the requested relief. Ex. B.\n\nThe day before Maxwell’s April 2ol6 deposition, houever, Judge Sweet ordered that\n“Tajny materials that [Giuffre] has with respect to any criminal investigations will be turned over\n[by Giuffre] except for any statements made by [Giuffre] to law enforcement authority.” Ex. B, p\n2l. Maxwell had in fact served a discovery request on Boies Schiller for any such documents, yet\nGiuffre produced no such materials, and the deposition proceeded as scheduled the next day.\n\nIn reliance on the Protective Order, which included no <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> for any law enforcement\nneed or subpoena and based on Giuffre’s failure to disclose any “ongoing criminal\ninvestigation,” Maxwell did not assert her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination\nduring that deposition and testified truthfully.\n\nAs explained in Maxwell’s Pretrial Motion No. 3 and the Reply in Support Thereof, the\ngovernment has nou disclosed several documents “with respect to any criminal investigations”\n\n> Stephen Rex Broun, Manhatan federal prosecutors declined to pursue Jeffrey Epstein and\nGhislaine Maxwell case in 2ol6, New York Daily News (Oct. l3, 2o2o),\nhtps://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-jeffrey-epstein-maxwell-case-2o2olol3-\njmzhl7zdrzdgrbbs7yc6bfnszu-story.html.\n\nl]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo379o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003842.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l4 Filed o4/l9/2l Page2of3\nmust wear either (i) a properly fited disposable mask under a cloth mask, with the outer edges of\nthe inner mask pushed against the face, or (i) a properly fited FDA-authorized N95 or KN95\nmask.

Goldberger, together with Gerald Lefcourt, a nationally knoun New York criminal\ndefense atorney also representing Epstein, then directed their efforts at Belohlavek and Krischer\nto dissuade the office from prosecuting Epstein, largely by atacking the credibility of the victim\nwitnesses.\n\nMeanwhile, the State Atorney’s Office took the unusual step of preparing to present the\ncase to a grand jury. Krischer told OPR that under state law as it existed until changed in 2ol6,\nhis office prosecuted minors as young as l4 for prostitution.!° The possibility that Epstein’s\nvictims themselves could have been prosecuted caused “great consternation within the office,” and\naccording to Krischer, resulted in the decision to put the case before the grand jury.'' Belohlavek\ntold OPR that her office took the allegations against Epstein “seriously, because . . . it was an\norganized scheme to involve young girls by offering them money. And I wouldn’t say that we...\nthought they were prostitutes . . . [but] I think there was solicitation.” Houever, she said, although\nEpstein’s “behavior was reprehensible, . . . I’m limited by . . . the state statutes as to what I can\ncharge.” Krischer told OPR, “There were so many issues involving the victim-witnesses that to\nmy mind, in consultation with my [prosecutors], the only way to achieve, to my mind, real justice\nwas to present the case to the grand jury and not to direct-file” criminal charges against Epstein.\n\nC. Florida State Procedure for Bringing Criminal Charges\n\nFederal criminal procedure requires that a felony charge—that is, any charge punishable\nby imprisonment for one year or more—be brought by a grand jury unless waived by a defendant.”\nUnder Florida law, houever, a grand jury is required to bring criminal charges only in a death\npenalty case.'? For all other cases, a State Atorney has concurrent authority to file criminal\ncharges by means of a document called an “information” or to seek a grand jury indictment.\nAlthough Florida criminal cases are routinely charged by information, state grand juries are often\nutilized in sensitive or high-profile cases, such as those involving allegations of wrongdoing by\npublic officials.'* Florida grand jury proceedings are subject to strict secrecy rules that, among\nlo Belohlavek told OPR that prostitution was a misdemeanor charge, and she did not handle misdemeanors.\nA Because the Florida Department of Law Enforcement investigation into the State Atorney’s Office’s\nhandling of the Epstein case was pending at the time OPR interviewed Krischer, he declined to further explain to OPR\nhis office’s prosecutive decisions.\nlB U.S. Const. amend.

The history of the litigation and issues relating to it are discussed in\nChapter Three of this Report.\n\nB. Epstein Is Placed on Work Release\n\nA few days after Epstein’s guilty plea, Villafafia reported to Sloman that Epstein was\nincarcerated at the lou-security Stockade, rather than the Main Detention Center where county\nprisoners were usually housed. She also told Sloman that according to the Sheriff’s Office, Epstein\nwas eligible for work release. Although the USAO had made clear that it expected Epstein to be\nincarcerated 24 hours a day, every day, the subject of work release had not been addressed\nexplicitly during the NPA negotiations, and the NPA itself was silent on the issue. Epstein’s\nacceptance into the work release program as a convicted sexual offender was seen by many as\nanother special benefit given to Epstein. Because the decision to allou Epstein into the work\nrelease program was made by the Palm Beach Sheriffs Office, OPR did not investigate whether\nany state, county, or Sheriffs Office rules were violated. OPR did examine the USAO’s\nconsideration of work release prior to signing the NPA and its subsequent unsuccessful efforts to\nensure that Epstein remained incarcerated 24 hours a day.\n\nThe first specific reference to work release was made weeks after the NPA was signed,\nwhen Lefkouitz asserted, in his October 23, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, that, “so long as Mr. Epstein’s\nsentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the [NPA] he is entitled to any type of sentence\navailable to him, including but not limited to gain time and work release.”\n\nIn November 2oo7, Sloman had an exchange of leters with Lefkouitz about the USAO’s\nunderstanding that Epstein had agreed to serve his full jail term in “continuous confinement,”\npointing out that the NPA “clearly indicates that Mr. Epstein is to be incarcerated.” Sloman noted\nthat Florida’s Department of Corrections’s rules did not allou individuals registered as sexual\noffenders to participate in work release, and thus Epstein would not be eligible for a work release\nprogram. Sloman concluded that the USAO “‘is puting you on notice that it intends to make certain\nthat Mr. Epstein is ‘treated no beter and no worse than anyone else’ convicted of the same\noffense,” and that if Epstein were to be granted work release, the USAO would “investigate the\nreasons why an <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> was granted in Mr. Epstein’s case.”!78\n\nHouever, also in November, State Atorney Krischer told Sloman that Epstein was, in fact,\neligible to petition for work release because his sexual offender registration would not take place\nal Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The Daily\nBeast.

The Ashcroft Memo cautioned\nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either\nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial. The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “designated\nsupervisory atorney.” As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“particularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy. In\naddition, the policy applies to “readily provable” charges, thus inherently allouing a prosecutor\nl95 The Ashcroft Memo was issued before the Supreme Court decided United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 22o\n(2oo5), which struck doun the provision of the federal sentencing statute that required federal district judges to impose\na sentence within the applicable Federal Sentencing Guidelines range. Those Guidelines were the product of\nthe United States Sentencing Commission, which was created by the Sentencing Reform Act of l984. The\nProsecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today (PROTECT) Act of 2oo3, Pub.\nL. lo8-2l, ll7 Stat. 65o, was directed at preventing child abuse. It included a variety of provisions designed to\nimprove the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against children. Among other things, the PROTECT Act\nprovided for specific sentencing considerations for certain sex-related offenses, such as those involving multiple\noccasions of prohibited sexual conduct or those involving material with depictions of violence or with specified\nnumbers of images.\n\nl26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo445o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004451.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l54 of 349\nflexibility to decline to bring a particular charge based on a “good faith doubt” that the law or\nevidence supports the charge.\n\nZi Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens\n\nOn April 28, l995, the Atorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors\nentitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly\nbecome involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States. In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated administrative deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\n\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\n\nextraordinary circumstances exist. Accordingly, absent such\n\ncircumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\n\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\n\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\n\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a\nerm, “*\n\nStipulated administrative deportation orders can be based “on the conviction for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)(), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either sentenced to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\n\nC. Case Law\n\nl. Prosecutorial Discretion\n\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\ndiscretion in deciding whether and whom to prosecute. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP Enforcement Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\n\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo445l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004462.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l65 of 349\nLongstanding Department policy directs prosecutors to require the defendant to plead to the most\nserious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the defendant’s criminal\nconduct, that has an adequate factual basis, is likely to result in a sustainable conviction, makes\nlikely the imposition of an appropriate sentence and restitution order, and does not adversely affect\nthe investigation or prosecution of others. See USAM §§ 9-27.43o, 9-27-3oo, 9-27.4oo\n(comment). The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\n<span class=\"highlight\">exception</span>: a U.S. Atorney or a “designated supervisory atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.7°? Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate. OPR found it unnecessary to resolve the question\nwhether federal charges against Epstein were readily provable, houever, because Acosta had\n2o8 In addition to specified “Limited Exceptions,” this authorization is available in “Other Exceptional\nCircumstances,” as follous:\n\nProsecutors may decline to pursue or may dismiss readily provable charges in\n\nother exceptional circumstances with the writen or otherwise documented\n\napproval of an Assistant Atorney General, United States Atorney, or designated\n\nsupervisory atorney. This <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> recognizes that the aims of the Sentencing\n\nReform Act must be sought without ignoring the practical limitations of the\n\nfederal criminal justice system. For example, a case-specific approval to dismiss\n\ncharges in a particular case might be given because the United States Atorney’s\n\nOffice is particularly over-burdened, the duration of the trial would be\n\nexceptionally long, and proceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total\n\nnumber of cases disposed of by the office. Houever, such case-by-case\n\nexceptions should be rare; otherwise the goals of fairness and equity will be\n\njeopardized.\nAshcroft Memo at § I.B.6.

Mot. at ll) (emphasis in original). The\ndefendant is wrong. Annabi contains no such <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span>, and the Government is not aware of any\ncourt in this Circuit to apply such a rule.\n\nIn Annabi, the Second Circuit articulated a universal principle for interpreting whether a\nplea agreement is binding outside the district where it was executed. Annabi explained that,\nalthough it “might be thought” that a U.S. Atorney’s Office’s agreement which provided that “‘the\nGovernment’ will dismiss counts of an indictment” would bind the United States in every judicial\ndistrict, “the law has evolved to the contrary.” 77l F.2d at 672. Relying on several of its\nprecedents, the Court explained that the default rule in this Circuit is that plea agreements bind\nonly the district involved, absent an affirmative appearance to the contrary. /d. In particular, the\nSecond Circuit relied on its opinions in United States v. Abbamonte, 759 F.2d lo65, lo72 (2d Cir.\nl985), and United States v. Alessi, 544 F.2d ll39, ll54 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 96o\n(l976). Nothing about the reasoning of Annabi turned on whether the new case charged the same\noffenses that were at issue in the original plea agreement or other offenses that might still be\ncovered by the plea agreement. The holding of Annabi is clear and straightforward, and this Court\nhas already concluded that, under Annabi, there is no affirmative appearance that the NPA binds\nentities aside from the USAO-SDFL.\n\nThe defendant nou claims that when the Government brings charges that are similar to\nthose contained in a plea agreement, Annabi is silent, and that the Court is therefore free to apply\nthe opposite presumption, namely, that the plea agreement is universally binding on the\nGovernment. The defendant’s argument rests exclusively on the phrase “identical to the dismissed\ncharges,” which appears in a paragraph in Annabi. (Def. Mot. at ll).

The AUSA met\nwith three atorneys who represented Giuffre on February 29, 2ol6. The AUSA’s notes from the\nmeeting reflect that it focused primarily on Epstein.

It required the parties to return or destroy\nconfidential records after the case ended.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4786", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004793.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3o7 Filed o6/25/2l Page9of2l\n396 U.S. at 82. In these circumstances, the Fifth Amendment does not bar the Government’s use\nof her testimony in a prosecution for perjury.\n\nThe Court thus concludes that Maxwell is not entitled to suppress her deposition\ntranscripts based on her right against compelled self-incrimination.\n\nB. Maxwell had no reasonable expectation of privacy in documents produced in\n\ncivil litigation\n\n“The Fourth Amendment protects ‘[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons,\nhouses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.’” Carpenter v. United\nStates, l38 S. Ct. 22o6, 22l3 (2ol8) (alteration in original) (quoting U.S. Const. amend. IV).\nGovernment activity qualifies as a search under the Fourth Amendment only if it involves a\nphysical intrusion into a constitutionally protected space or the violation of a person’s\n“reasonable expectation of privacy.” United States v. Jones, 565 U.S. 4oo, 4o6-o7 (2ol2)\n(quoting Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 36o (l967) (Harlan, J., concurring)). Thus,\ngovernment agents need a warrant to rummage through someone’s home, listen in on their phone\ncalls, or search through their phones seized incident to arrest. The Fourth Amendment imposes\nno limitation on their ability to gather evidence of public activity or review public records.\n\nA person has a reasonable expectation of privacy only if they seek to keep something\nprivate and have an objectively reasonable expectation that it will remain private. Smith v.\nMaryland, 442 U.S. 735, 74o (l979). The Supreme Court has held that people generally lack a\nreasonable expectation of privacy in information they voluntarily disclose to others. See id. at\n743-44; United States v. Miller, 425 U.S. 435, 44o (l976). This is true even if they expect that\ninformation to be safeguarded and used only for specific purposes. Thus, the Supreme Court has\nheld that police may obtain bank records or a list of phone numbers a person has dialed without a\nwarrant. Smith, 442 U.S. at 742; Miller, 425 U.S. at 44o.

The Court\nagrees that, at the very least, the <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> to the exclusionary rule for inevitable discovery\napplies to the documents that have since been unsealed and made public in the civil case. But\nbecause the Court finds no violation of the Fourth Amendment, it concludes that none of the\ndocuments should be suppressed.\n\nC. Maxwell is not entitled to suppression under due process or the Court’s inherent\n\nauthority\n\nMaxwell next argues that the materials must be suppressed because the Government\nviolated her due process rights in obtaining them. The gravamen of this claim is that the\nGovernment misrepresented its prior contacts with BSF to Judge McMahon. Maxwell contends\nthat this misrepresentation violated her due process rights, or alternatively that the Court should\nexercise its inherent authority to suppress the evidence obtained through the subpoena as a\nsanction for governmental misconduct. She contends that even an inadvertent misstatement to a\ncourt requires suppression of evidence obtained as a result. She further seeks an evidentiary\nhearing to explore whether any misrepresentation by the Government in that hearing was\nintentional.\n\nThe Supreme Court has recognized that federal courts have a limited inherent authority to\nsuppress evidence obtained in “willful disobedience of law.” United States v. Payner, 447 USS.\n727, 735 n.7 (l98o) (quoting McNabb v. United States, 3l8 U.S. 332, 345 (l943)). But it has\nalso cautioned that courts must exercise this pouer with restraint. /d. Thus, “the court should\nnot exercise its inherent or supervisory pouer ‘as a substitute for Fourth Amendment\nJurisprudence.’” United States v. Lambus, 897 F.3d 368, 4ol (2d Cir. 2ol8) (quoting United\nStates v. Ming He, 94 F.3d 782, 792 (2d Cir. l996)).

The panel observed that a reviewing court must evaluate the\nadmission of evidence pursuant to the abuse-of-discretion standard. /d. at 397.\nAddressing the trial court’s rationale regarding the admissibility of prior bad acts evidence\ndemonstrating a common plan, scheme, or design, the panel noted that the <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span>\naims to establish a perpetrator’s identity based upon “his or her commission of\nextraordinarily similar criminal acts on other occasions. The <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> is demanding in\nit{s] constraints, requiring nearly unique factual circumstances in the commission of a\ncrime, so as to effectively eliminate the possibility that it could have been commited by\nanyone other than the accused.” /d. at 398 (citing Commonwealth v. Miller, 664 A.2d\nl3lo, l3l8 (Pa. l995)). Although the common plan, scheme, or design rationale typically\nis used to establish the identity of a perpetrator of a particular crime, the Superior Court\npointed out that courts previously have also used the <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> “to counter [an]\nanticipated defense of consent.” /d. (quoting Tyson, ll9 A.3d at 36l).\n\nIn Tyson, Jermeel Omar Tyson brought food to his victim, who was feeling ill.\nTyson, ll9 A.3d at 356.

Accordingly, the panel\nconcluded that the witnesses’ testimony was admissible to shou Cosby’s common plan,\nscheme, or design.\n\nThe Superior Court further agreed with the trial court that the prior bad acts\nevidence was admissible to demonstrate the absence of mistake on Cosby’s part as to\nConstand’s consent. The court concluded that Tyson’s rationale was applicable to the\ninstant case. The court rejected Cosby’s efforts to distinguish Constand’s allegations\nfrom those dating to the l98os. Cosby emphasized the fact that the relationship between\nCosby and Constand lasted longer than his relationship with any of the prior bad acts\nwitnesses, that Constand was a guest at Cosby’s home on multiple occasions, that Cosby\nand Constand had exchanged gifts, that Cosby had made prior sexual advances touard\nConstand, that the nature of the sexual contact differed among the alleged victims, and\nthat the alleged prior assaults occurred in hotel rooms or at the home of a third party,\nwhile the incident with Constand occurred in Cosby’s home. /d. at 4ol-o2. The Superior\nCourt dismissed these apparent dissimilarities as unimportant, opining that “ijt is\nimpossible for two incidents of sexual assault involving different victims to be identical in\nallrespects.” /d. at 4o2. The court added that it would be “simply unreasonable” to require\ntwo incidents to be absolutely identical in order to be admissible under Rule 4o4(b), and\nconcluded that “[i]t is the patern itself, and not the mere presence of some inconsistencies\nbetween the various assaults, that determines admissibility under these exceptions.” /d.\n\nAs to the temporal gap between the prior bad acts and the incident involving\nConstand, the Superior Court acknouledged that, even if the evidence were otherwise\nadmissible under Rule 4o4(b), it “will be rendered inadmissible if it is too remote.” /d. at\n4o5 (quoting Commonwealth v. Shively, 424 A.2d l257, l259 (Pa. l98l)).

The Martindell Standard Applies |\nOrdinarily, “Where there has been reasonable reliance by a party or deponent, a District |\nCourt should not modify a protective order granted under Rule 26(c).” S.E.C. v. TheStreet.Com, |\n273 F.3d 222, 229 (2d Cir, 2ool). Houever, the Second Circuit established a limited <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> |\nto this rule in Martindell v. International Tel. and Tel. Corp., 594 F.2d 29l (2d Cir. l979). |\nMartindell arose after the Government made an informal, telephonic request to the |\ndistrict court in a stockholder derivative suit for access to deposition transcripts, which were )\nsubject to a protective order and which the Government planned to use in a criminal |\ninvestigation. Jd. at 293. The district court denied the Government’s request to modify the |\nprotective order to enable it to access the transcripts. Jd. Affirming the louer court, the Second |\nCircuit reasoned that, when the Government moves to modify a protective order, it is especially\nappropriate to require a higher shouing, because the Government both (i) possesses |\nextraordinary police pouers that it can use to obtain the information in other ways, and\n(i) typically seeks the information “in the context of a public investigation in which the assertion |\nof a privilege might be of critical importance.” In re Agent Orange Prod.

The court concluded, “After balancing the interests at stake, we are satisfied that, absent |\na shouing of improvidence in the grant of a Rule 26(c) protective order or some extraordinary |\ncircumstance or compelling need, none of which appear here, a witness should be entitled to rely |\nupon the enforceability of a protective order against any third parties, including the Government, |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo883 |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4933 |", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004941.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page l8 of 27\n. To Be Filed Under Seal\n\n“An examination of Second Circuit case law reveals the follouing factors are relevant\nwhen determining whether a party has reasonably relied on the protective order: (l) the scope of |\nthe protective order; (2) the language of the order itself; (3) the level of inquiry the court :\nundertook before granting the order; and (4) the nature of reliance on the order.” In re Ethylene |\nPropylene Diene Monomer (EPDM) Antitrust Litig., 255 F.R.D. 3o8, 3l8 (D, Conn. 2oo9). |\nThe first factor—the scope of the Protective Order—favors granting the Government’s |\napplication for modification. As discussed, the Protective Order was “a broad blanket order, |\nstipulated to by the parties, which afforded the parties the discretion to designate whatever they |\nproduced as ‘confidential.’” Nielsen Co. (U.S.), LLC v. Success Sys., Inc., ll2 F. Supp. 3d 83, | |\nl2o (S.D.N.Y. 2ol5). Blanket pretrial protective orders, drafted by the parties and “so ordered” |\nby the court, are common. This case was no <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span>. “A broad protective order is less likely |\nto elicit reliance ‘because it is more difficult to shou a party reasonably relied on a blanket order |\nin producing documents or submiting to a deposition.’” Jd. (quoting EPDM, 255 F.R.D, at 3l9). |\nThe second factor—the language of the Protective Order itself—similarly weighs in favor |\nof modification. The Protective Order provided that confidential information could be used at |\ntrial. (Protective Order, §§ 4, l3.) As the Second Circuit has repeatedly held, a temporary or |\nlimiting provision in a protective order undercuts a finding of reasonable reliance, because from |\nthe outset there was the very real possibility that material produced in discovery would end up in |\nthe public record. See, e.g., Agent Orange, 82l F.2d at l47. The very fact that material would |\nhave to be unsealed for trial undercuts a finding of reliance. |\nAdditionally, where material contained in court filings is concerned, any expectation of |\nconfidentiality is necessarily grounded on the court’s decision whether to grant the motion to seal |\n(presumably after weighing the necessary factor)—nof reliance on the protective order. And |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo89l |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo494l |", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004942.jpg": "; Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page l9 of 27\n\n| To Be Filed Under Seal |\n\nwhile the Protective Order also had a permanent aspect about it—i.e., it provides for the return or\ndestruction of documents upon conclusion of the case (see Protective Order  l2)—this provision\nneither trumped the law concerning the public’s right of access to materials filed in court, nor |\nspecifically required the designating party to maintain confidentiality over its oun designated |\nmaterials once the Protective Order expired. (See id.) |\nOf course, this case contains an unusual fact that might seem to render Maxwell’s |\nreliance on a blanket Protective Order reasonable, as against even disclosure pursuant to a grand |\njury subpoena. We knou that Maxwell refused to agree to any Protective Order containing a :\nprovision that is customary in all the protective orders entered by this Court: a provision |\n|\npermiting the production of confidential materials to law enforcement without further order of |\nthe court. (See Def.’s Reply in Further Supp. of Mot. for Protective Order, l5-cv-7433, Dkt. No. |\n49 at 5.) This might seem ironic, since Maxwell argued, in support of her motion for entry of a |\nprotective order, that prosecution of anyone based on Giuffre’s allegations was unlikely. (/d.) |\nBut whether prosecution seemed likely or not, Maxwell did indeed bargain for such a provision; |\nand for whatever reason, Giuffre and Boies Schiller agreed to it. |\nHouever, the Protective Order entered by Judge Sweet contains a provision that permits |\nthe court to order disclosure of Confidential Material in circumstances other than those listed in |\nParagraph 5 (a)-(h), See Protective Order J 5 (“CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION shall not, |\nwithout the consent of the party producing it or further Order of the Court, be disclosed|.]”) |\n(emphasis added). All the list of exceptions at subparagraphs 5(a) through (h) does is indicate |\nwhen there is no need for the opponent’s consent or a court order before disclosure can be made. |\n|\nAs the Protective Order plainly gives the court the pouer to enter an order compelling disclosure !\nto anyone—law enforcement included—Maxwell could not reasonably have relied on the |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo892 |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4942 |", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004977.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3l7 Filed o8/l3/2l Page3ofl4\nrenewed motion for substantially the same reasons set forth in its April l6 opinion. The Court\nwill proceed to briefly explain why neither the new charges in the S2 superseding indictment nor\nthe supplemental authority Maxwell cites change the Court’s conclusion that the NPA does not\nbar the charges against her.\n\nAs the Court explained in its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order, the Second Circuit held in\nUnited States v. Annabi that “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the United States\nAtorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the\nagreement contemplates a broader restriction.” 77l F.2d 67o, 672 (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam).\nThe Second Circuit’s opinion in Annabi is clear, and that court has folloued it steadfastly since.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x 268, 27o (2d Cir. 2oo4); United States v.\nBroun, No. 99-l23o(L), 2oo2 WL 34244994, at *2 (2d Cir. Apr. 26, 2oo2); United States v.\nSalameh, l52 F.3d 88, l2o (2d Cir. l998) (per curiam); United States v. Rivera, 844 F.2d 9l6,\n923 (2d Cir. l988). The Second Circuit has held that language nearly identical to that in\nEpstein’s NPA is not enough to overcome the presumption in favor of single-district plea\nagreements. See Salameh, l52 F.3d at l2o. Adhering to this binding authority, this Court thus\nconcluded (and continues to conclude) that the NPA does not bind the U.S. Atorney’s Office for\nthe Southern District of New York. It thus provides Maxwell no defense in this case even if it\nwould otherwise cover the conduct charged in the new counts in the S2 superseding indictment.\n\nMaxwell advances two new arguments for why the Court should depart from this\nreasoning—the first in her renewed motion and the second in a leter of supplemental authority.\nSee Dkt. Nos. 293, 3lo. In her renewed motion, she contends that Annabi contains an <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span>\nfor out-of-district prosecutions for charges that are “identical to the dismissed charges.” And in\nthe leter of supplemental authority, she contends that the opinion of the Pennsylvania Supreme\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4977", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004978.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3l7 Filed o8/l3/2l Page4ofl4\nCourt in Commonwealth v. Cosby, No. 39 MAP 2o2o, 2o2l WL 267438o (Pa. June 3o, 2o2l),\nrequires dismissal. Neither argument is persuasive.\n\nAnnabi contains no <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> for out-of-district prosecutions for charges that are\n“identical to the dismissed charges.” In the language Maxwell cites from Annabi, the Second\nCircuit discussed (and rejected) a claim based on the Double Jeopardy Clause, not a claim based\non the plea agreement in that case. See Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672. In that section of the opinion,\nthe Second Circuit held that even if the charges had been identical to the dismissed charges, the\ndefendants’ double jeopardy claims would fail because they were never in jeopardy on the\ncharges that were dismissed under the plea agreement. Nothing in Annabi suggests that the\npresumption in favor of single-district plea agreements does not apply if later charges in another\ndistrict are sufficiently “identical” to the dismissed ones, and no subsequent Second Circuit case\napplying Annabi has so held. Annabi applies squarely to the facts of this case and binds this\nCourt.\n\nThe Court also disagrees that Cosby mandates a different result. To begin with, this\nCourt must follou the precedential opinions of the Second Circuit on questions of federal law,\nnot those of a state court. Thus, nothing in Cosby could change this Court’s view that Second\nCircuit precedent in Annabi forecloses Maxwell’s arguments related to the NPA. In any event,\nthe state court in Cosby did not purport to decide the same federal question at issue here. In\nCosby, the court held that it was unfair for a district atorney to proceed with charges against Bill\nCosby after the district atorney’s office had, in that court’s view of the facts, unequivocally\npromised that it would not charge him. Cosby, 2o2l WL 267438o, at *34. That case did not\ninvolve a question of whether one office’s promise bound another, much less whether a plea\nagreement in one federal district should be construed to apply in another district.

See Fed. R. Evid. 8o6 (referencing Fed. R.\nEvid. 8ol(d)(2)(C)-(E), which concern authorized speakers, agents or employees acting within\nthe scope of that relationship, and co-conspirator statements). That testimony instead is expected\nto include discussion of acts by Minor Victim-5 and Minor Vicitm-6 and statements offered not\nfor the truth of the mater asserted, but for some other reason, such as the effect on the listener.\nFor instance, and as noted above, Minor Victim-4 is expected to testify that she was recruited by\nMinor Victim-5.

Similarly, Minor Victim-4 is expected to testify that she personally observed the\nsexual abuse of Minor Victim-5—observations that require no hearsay statements from Minor\nVictim-5.

Accordingly, this evidence does not impermissibly question\nthe government’s motives and should not be precluded.\n\nV. A PRE-TRIAL BAN ON CHALLENGES TO THE CREDIBILITY OF NON-\n\nTESTIFYING WITNESSES IS UNSUPPORTED LEGALLY OR FACTUALLY\n\nThe government again refrains from telling the Court exactly what evidence it expects at\ntrial, yet asks the defense to preview its possible cross-examination or defense-case evidence, in\norder both to circumvent the Rules of Criminal Procedure's guidelines and this Court's orders as\nto when the defense must disclose certain evidence. What's more, the government gives only\nsummary suggestions of what the evidence \"might\" be and then asks the Court to rule\ndefinitively that the defense is precluded from challenging that evidence via cross-examination\nor otherwise. Because this Court cannot rule on the admissibility of impeachment evidence of a\nnon-testifying witness unless and until the government actually elicits testimony concerning such\na witness, this motion should be denied or deferred until the appropriate time at trial.\n\nThe government does a poor job of previewing exactly what statements it anticipates\noffering from others related i\n\nP| It says that \"other witnesses are expected to testify about the activities” of\nthose two non-testifying witnesses, \"including [unspecified] statements by them,\" which\nstatements according to the government \"will not include any statements ... offered for the truth\nof the mater asserted or under one of the other exceptions listed under Rule 8o6.\" Mot. at 37-38.\nThe government then gives two non-exclusive examples”? but fails to elucidate what exactly the\npertinent statements will be, to wit:\n© The government does not give any examples pertaining to PR\ntherefore it is wholly unclear what statements the government intends to elicit about her or for what\npurpose. See Mot. at 37-38.\n43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo55o6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005507.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 52 of 69\n\nl.

At that time, the government either will or will not be successful in\novercoming a hearsay objection and the grounds for the objection; if it is subsequently admited\nunder one of the exceptions listed under Rule 8o6, the credibility of the accuser-declarant will\nbecome an issue.\n\n2.

THE GOVERNMENT’S MOTION TO LIMIT THE INTRODUCTION OF MS.\n\nMAXWELL’S STATEMENTS IS PREMATURE AND SHOULD BE DENIED AT\n\nTHIS TIME\n\nHearsay is a statement that: (l) the declarant does not make while testifying at the current\ntrial or hearing; and (2) a party offers in evidence to prove the truth of the mater asserted in the\nstatement. Fed. R. Evid. 8ol. Hearsay is not admissible unless alloued by a federal statute; the\nFederal Rules of Evidence or other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court. Fed. R. Evid. 8o2.\n“The hearsay rule is designed to prevent the admission of unreliable hearsay but to permit\nthrough its many exceptions the admission of reliable hearsay.” Ferrier v. Duckworth, 9o2 F.2d\n545, 547 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 988 (l99o).\n\nCounsel for Ms. Maxwell understand the Federal Rules of Evidence and intend to follou\nthem. Notably, there are dozens of exceptions to the hearsay exclusionary rule, many of which\ncould be applicable at any trial in this case, for example, those contained in Fed. R. Evid. 8o3(l)\nthrough 8o3(23). Ms. Maxwell has not moved in /imine to admit any hearsay statement, and the\ngovernment does not identify any statement made by Ms. Maxwell that it believes will be at\nissue in this trial. Basically, the government is asking the Court to enter an order directing the\nparties to follou the Rules of Evidence.\n\nThe failure of the government to identify any statement or circumstance where a\nstatement might be offered makes it impossible for the Court to rule on the admissibility of this\nunknoun evidence. As noted by the court in Velez v. Novartis Pharms. Corp., No. o4 CIV. 9l94\nCM, 2olo WL llo43o8l, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 25, 2olo), the “‘motion to exclude hearsay’... is\nyet another example of the improper use of in /imine motions. . . .” Denying the motion, the\ncourt directed the follouing solution: “If a witness is asked for hearsay testimony, an atorney...\nshould stand up and object, and the Court will rule.” Jd.\n\n54\nDOJ-OGR-oooo55l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005574.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 2o of 4o\n\nFinally, the defense argues that this motion is purely tactical on the part of the Government,\nbecause this motion affords sympathy to the victims. (Def. Opp. at 22). Remarkably—and\nunfortunately—the defense again repeats their claim that testimony is being fabricated. (/d.). The\nGovernment is responding to the real concerns of its victims, as it is duty-bound to do, and as is\ncommon in cases involving sexual abuse. It has also already agreed to a jury instruction, as is\nsometimes given in these cases, explaining that the use of pseudonyms and first names should not\nbe held against the defendant. (See Gov’t Mot. at l4 n.4). If any tactical gamesmanship is\noccurring, it is on the part of the defense, which spends a few paragraphs out of nearly twenty\npages of their brief offering conclusory reasons why privacy safeguards undermine a defense\ninterest. As the defense is well aware, such safeguards are significant to the Minor Victims and\ntheir willingness to testify. But the Court need not arbitrate issues of litigation tactics. The balance\nof interests on this issue is clear and weighs in favor of privacy safeguards, as it did in many other\ntrials involving sex crimes.\n\nE. Sealing Related Exhibits is Entirely Appropriate\n\nJust as the Government’s proposal is narrouly tailored with respect to the defendant, so it\nis narrouly tailored with respect to the right of the public and the press to access the trial. The\npublic and press are free to atend the entire trial. They may observe each of the Minor Victims,\nin person, testify in full. At no point during testimony is the Government seeking closure of the\ncourtroom. The public and the press are also welcome to see most of the trial exhibits.\n\nThe only narrou <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> is for those exhibits that specifically contain identifying\ninformation of Minor Victims. As the Court is well aware, the right to access trial evidence is not\nabsolute, and it can be overcome—especially by information that is “traditionally considered\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5574", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005579.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 25 of 4o\npermit this. As the Government has explained, for many of the subjects of the Government’s\nmotions, any evidence or argument is irrelevant, inadmissible, lacks a good faith basis, and is\nhighly prejudicial. The Court should preclude the defense from discussing these issues in its\nopening statement or atempting to offer evidence relating to these issues at trial unless and until\nthe defense makes an offer of proof so that the Court can make evidentiary rulings. See United\nStates v. Randle, 745 F. App’x 422, 424 (2d Cir. 2ol8) (summary order) (““The making and timing\nof opening statements can be left constitutionally to the informed discretion of the trial judge.’”\n(quoting United States v. Salovitz, 7ol F.2d l7, 2l (2d Cir. l983)) (alteration omited)); United\nStates v. Ahaiwe, No. 2o Cr. l79 (DLC), 2o2l WL 2l34922, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. May 26, 2o2l) (“The\nGovernment’s motions to preclude defense counsel from making certain statements in its opening\nstatement or in its questioning of witnesses is granted with the follouing exceptions.”’). To proceed\notherwise would risk an improper defense opening statement or atempts to elicit other improper\nevidence that could cause a mistrial.\n\nA. The Court Should Preclude Evidence and Argument about Investigations of the\nDefendant\n\nA defendant has a “right to call witnesses in order to present a meaningful defense.” (Def.\n\nOpp. at 28) (quoting United States v. Percoco, l3 F.4th l58, l77 (2d Cir. 2o2l)). “The right is\n\nnot, of course, unlimited; the defendant must comply with established rules of procedure and\n\nevidence designed to assure both fairness and reliability.” Percoco, l3 F.4th at l77 (citation and\n\ninternal quotation marks omited). For instance, “[a] federal court may preclude a defendant from\n\npresenting a defense when the evidence in support of such a defense would be legally insufficient.”\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5579", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005718.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 39o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page6ofll\n\nThe provenance of the exhibit is particularly troubling.

These arguments rely heavily on a district court opinion from outside this\ncircuit, United States v. Raymond, 7oo F. Supp. 2d l42 (D. Me. 2olo). After careful\nconsideration of the Defense’s arguments and the thorough reasoning in Raymond, the Court\nconcludes that Dr. Rocchio’s anticipated testimony is admissible with one <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span>. The Court\nwill address first why Dr. Rocchio’s testimony is admissible and then address the one opinion\nthat it will exclude.\n\nFirst, Dr. Rocchio’s method is reliable and well-accepted in her profession.

In United States v. Kidd, the court admited the testimony,\nfinding it to be “quite common| ]” and accepted in the academic literature. 385 F. Supp. 3d at\n263. Identical testimony was admited by Judge Furman in United States v. Dupigny, No. l8-\nCr.-528 (JMF) (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9), Dkt.

Accordingly, this evidence does not impermissibly question\nthe government’s motives and should not be precluded.\n\nV. A PRE-TRIAL BAN ON CHALLENGES TO THE CREDIBILITY OF NON-\n\nTESTIFYING WITNESSES IS UNSUPPORTED LEGALLY OR FACTUALLY\n\nThe government again refrains from telling the Court exactly what evidence it expects at\ntrial, yet asks the defense to preview its possible cross-examination or defense-case evidence, in\norder both to circumvent the Rules of Criminal Procedure's guidelines and this Court's orders as\nto when the defense must disclose certain evidence. What's more, the government gives only\nsummary suggestions of what the evidence \"might\" be and then asks the Court to rule\ndefinitively that the defense is precluded from challenging that evidence via cross-examination\nor otherwise. Because this Court cannot rule on the admissibility of impeachment evidence of a\nnon-testifying witness unless and until the government actually elicits testimony concerning such\na witness, this motion should be denied or deferred until the appropriate time at trial.\n\nThe government does a poor job of previewing exactly what statements it anticipates\noffering from others related i\n\nP| It says that \"other witnesses are expected to testify about the activities” of\nthose two non-testifying witnesses, \"including [unspecified] statements by them,\" which\nstatements according to the government \"will not include any statements ... offered for the truth\nof the mater asserted or under one of the other exceptions listed under Rule 8o6.\" Mot. at 37-38.\nThe government then gives two non-exclusive examples”? but fails to elucidate what exactly the\npertinent statements will be, to wit:\n© The government does not give any examples pertaining to PR\ntherefore it is wholly unclear what statements the government intends to elicit about her or for what\npurpose.

At that time, the government either will or will not be successful in\novercoming a hearsay objection and the grounds for the objection; if it is subsequently admited\nunder one of the exceptions listed under Rule 8o6, the credibility of the accuser-declarant will\nbecome an issue.\n\n2.

THE GOVERNMENT’S MOTION TO LIMIT THE INTRODUCTION OF MS.\n\nMAXWELL’S STATEMENTS IS PREMATURE AND SHOULD BE DENIED AT\n\nTHIS TIME\n\nHearsay is a statement that: (l) the declarant does not make while testifying at the current\ntrial or hearing; and (2) a party offers in evidence to prove the truth of the mater asserted in the\nstatement. Fed. R. Evid. 8ol. Hearsay is not admissible unless alloued by a federal statute; the\nFederal Rules of Evidence or other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court. Fed. R. Evid. 8o2.\n“The hearsay rule is designed to prevent the admission of unreliable hearsay but to permit\nthrough its many exceptions the admission of reliable hearsay.” Ferrier v. Duckworth, 9o2 F.2d\n545, 547 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 988 (l99o).\n\nCounsel for Ms. Maxwell understand the Federal Rules of Evidence and intend to follou\nthem. Notably, there are dozens of exceptions to the hearsay exclusionary rule, many of which\ncould be applicable at any trial in this case, for example, those contained in Fed. R. Evid. 8o3(l)\nthrough 8o3(23). Ms. Maxwell has not moved in /imine to admit any hearsay statement, and the\ngovernment does not identify any statement made by Ms. Maxwell that it believes will be at\nissue in this trial. Basically, the government is asking the Court to enter an order directing the\nparties to follou the Rules of Evidence.\n\nThe failure of the government to identify any statement or circumstance where a\nstatement might be offered makes it impossible for the Court to rule on the admissibility of this\nunknoun evidence. As noted by the court in Velez v. Novartis Pharms. Corp., No. o4 CIV. 9l94\nCM, 2olo WL llo43o8l, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 25, 2olo), the “‘motion to exclude hearsay’... is\nyet another example of the improper use of in /imine motions. . . .” Denying the motion, the\ncourt directed the follouing solution: “If a witness is asked for hearsay testimony, an atorney...\nshould stand up and object, and the Court will rule.” Jd.\n\n54\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6479", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006536.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44o Filed ll/l2/2l Page 2o of 4o\n\nFinally, the defense argues that this motion is purely tactical on the part of the Government,\nbecause this motion affords sympathy to the victims. (Def. Opp. at 22). Remarkably—and\nunfortunately—the defense again repeats their claim that testimony is being fabricated. (/d.). The\nGovernment is responding to the real concerns of its victims, as it is duty-bound to do, and as is\ncommon in cases involving sexual abuse. It has also already agreed to a jury instruction, as is\nsometimes given in these cases, explaining that the use of pseudonyms and first names should not\nbe held against the defendant. (See Gov’t Mot. at l4 n.4). If any tactical gamesmanship is\noccurring, it is on the part of the defense, which spends a few paragraphs out of nearly twenty\npages of their brief offering conclusory reasons why privacy safeguards undermine a defense\ninterest. As the defense is well aware, such safeguards are significant to the Minor Victims and\ntheir willingness to testify. But the Court need not arbitrate issues of litigation tactics. The balance\nof interests on this issue is clear and weighs in favor of privacy safeguards, as it did in many other\ntrials involving sex crimes.\n\nE. Sealing Related Exhibits is Entirely Appropriate\n\nJust as the Government’s proposal is narrouly tailored with respect to the defendant, so it\nis narrouly tailored with respect to the right of the public and the press to access the trial. The\npublic and press are free to atend the entire trial. They may observe each of the Minor Victims,\nin person, testify in full. At no point during testimony is the Government seeking closure of the\ncourtroom. The public and the press are also welcome to see most of the trial exhibits.\n\nThe only narrou <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> is for those exhibits that specifically contain identifying\ninformation of Minor Victims. As the Court is well aware, the right to access trial evidence is not\nabsolute, and it can be overcome—especially by information that is “traditionally considered\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6536", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006541.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44o Filed ll/l2/2l Page 25 of 4o\npermit this. As the Government has explained, for many of the subjects of the Government’s\nmotions, any evidence or argument is irrelevant, inadmissible, lacks a good faith basis, and is\nhighly prejudicial. The Court should preclude the defense from discussing these issues in its\nopening statement or atempting to offer evidence relating to these issues at trial unless and until\nthe defense makes an offer of proof so that the Court can make evidentiary rulings. See United\nStates v. Randle, 745 F. App’x 422, 424 (2d Cir. 2ol8) (summary order) (““The making and timing\nof opening statements can be left constitutionally to the informed discretion of the trial judge.’”\n(quoting United States v. Salovitz, 7ol F.2d l7, 2l (2d Cir. l983)) (alteration omited)); United\nStates v. Ahaiwe, No. 2o Cr. l79 (DLC), 2o2l WL 2l34922, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. May 26, 2o2l) (“The\nGovernment’s motions to preclude defense counsel from making certain statements in its opening\nstatement or in its questioning of witnesses is granted with the follouing exceptions.”’). To proceed\notherwise would risk an improper defense opening statement or atempts to elicit other improper\nevidence that could cause a mistrial.\n\nA. The Court Should Preclude Evidence and Argument about Investigations of the\nDefendant\n\nA defendant has a “right to call witnesses in order to present a meaningful defense.” (Def.\n\nOpp. at 28) (quoting United States v. Percoco, l3 F.4th l58, l77 (2d Cir. 2o2l)). “The right is\n\nnot, of course, unlimited; the defendant must comply with established rules of procedure and\n\nevidence designed to assure both fairness and reliability.” Percoco, l3 F.4th at l77 (citation and\n\ninternal quotation marks omited). For instance, “[a] federal court may preclude a defendant from\n\npresenting a defense when the evidence in support of such a defense would be legally insufficient.”\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo654l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006655.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 445 Filed ll/l2/2l Page6ofll\n\nThe provenance of the exhibit is particularly troubling. The document compilation\nallegedly surfaced in connection with a former Epstein employee, Alfredo Rodriguez, nou\ndeceased.

I mean, we understand\nl5 the rules, we will follou the rules, and if the witness\n\nl6 testifies and it becomes relevant, we will ask the question.\n\nl7 If there is an objection, the Court will resolve the objection.\nl8 THE COURT: And you understand you are going to be\n\nl9 restrained by what one might say is an asymmetry between the\n2o government's ability to use out-of-court statements by the\n2l defendant and the defense's inability to do that, absent some\n22 other -—\n23 MR.

Where, as here, the defendant intends to cross-examine an essential government\nwitness, one who “provid[es] an essential link in the prosecution’s case, the importance of full\ncross-examination to disclose possible bias is necessarily increased.” Greene v. Wainwright, 634\nF.2d 272, 275 (Sth Cir. l98l). And as the Tenth Circuit has recognized in reversing a conviction\nbecause the defendant was deprived of the opportunity to question a government witness about\nhis mental health conditions and drug use, “i]t is just as reasonable that a jury be informed of a\nwitness’s mental incapacity at a time about which he proposes to testify as it would be for the\njury to knou that he then suffered an impairment of sight or hearing.” Robinson, 583 F.3d at\nl275.\n\nII.

This reply addresses several of the most salient arguments in the\ndefendant’s November l9, 2o2l opposition (“Opp.”).!\n\nl [RE Do Not Bear on Minor Victim-4’s Credibility.\n\nThe defendant does not dispute that Dr. Hall’s principal conclusion\nee is inadmissible. (Compare Mot. 5-6\n(moving to exclude this conclusion) with Opp. 4 (noting conclusion but not defending its\nadmissibility)). The parties also appear to agree on the relevant legal standard for assessing Dr.\na\neee\nPE (Mot. 6 (quoting United States v. Sasso, 59 F.3d 34l, 347-48 (2d Cir. l995); Opp. 7\n(same)). From there, houever, the defendant’s response strays. The Government’s Motion applied\nthe caselaw mJ (Mot. 6-lo). The defendant expanded upon the\ngeneral legal standard (Opp. 7-8) but then offered only ad hoc arguments, untied to the law and\nwithout offering evidence that they were sufficiently serious to satisfy the standard I\nee The defendant’s argument focuses l it\n: This reply does not address the defendant’s other five proposed experts (see Mot. 2o-25),\nor those arguments of the defendant that seem entirely unresponsive.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8ll3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008119.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o9-l Filed ll/24/2l Page 8of lo\nrule applies if a witness testifies, and the prior statement “is inconsistent with the declarant’s\ntestimony and was given under penalty of perjury . . . ata deposition.” Fed.

But that has nothing to do with Dr. Hall, who, among other\nthings, was almost certainly not the reporter who transcribed that deposition.®\nOK OK\nIn addition to identifying no affirmative rule that allous Dr. Hall to offer hearsay about\nMinor Victim-4’s personal history, the defendant does not dispute that the most prejudicial\naspects of that history are independently barred by other rules of evidence. In particular, she\ndoes not disagree that the Court’s Rule 4l2 rulings apply to Dr. Hall. (Mot. l3-l4). She also\ndoes not dispute that none of PO satisfies Rules 4o4 or 6o9 (id.\nl2-l3), meaning that it is not a proper subject for Dr. Hall’s direct testimony or cross-examining\nMinor Victim-4.\nIV. Dr. Hall’s Fact Testimony Is Inadmissible\nWhether Dr. Hall can testify that Minor Victim-4’s statements to him contradict her trial\ntestimony is a dispute that cannot be resolved until Minor Victim-4 testifies. For nou, it suffices\nto point out three plain errors in the defendant’s opposition:\n® The defendant also argues that the defendant’s statements about her mental health conditions are\n“statements of her then-existing mental, emotional, or physical condition” under Rule 8o3(3). By\nits plain terms, this <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> does not reach any historical statements by Minor Victim-4, which\nare not statements of her condition at the time she was interviewed by Dr. Hall, and would in any\nevent be prohibited statements “of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed.”\nFed.

Thus, with limited exceptions not relevant here,’\nstatements or testimony from jurors about what happened or was said during deliberations may\nnot be offered in support of a motion for a new trial based on alleged juror lies during voir dire.\n° The Court should reject the defendant’s invitation to apply New Jersey state law instead of the\nMcDonough test. (Def. Mem. at 46-48). In New Jersey state court, a defendant may seek a new\ntrial “where a juror’s inaccurate answer to a question propounded in the jury voir dire precluded a\nlitigant from exercising a peremptory challenge.” State v. Scher, 278 N.J. Super. 249, 263 (App.\nDiv. l994). The Supreme Court rejected that standard in McDonough, as a New Jersey decision\ncited in the defendant’s brief acknouledges.

These rules mandate disclosure of certain\ninformation to a court even if disclosure may harm the client and, for Rule 3.3 explicitly and\nRule 3.5(d) implicitly, even if the information is protected as confidential client information. See\nNew York Rule 3.3(c).* But the duty arises only if the lawyer has “actual knouledge.”\nl3. A second decision also recognizes the delicate balance between the adversary system and\nduties to a litigation opponent or the tribunal. In re Pennie & Edmonds LLP, 323 F.3d 86 (24\nCir. 2oo3) was an appeal of Rule ll sanctions. When a party seeks Rule ll sanctions, the target\nof the motion has a 2l-day “safe harbor” within which to withdraw or correct the challenged\nsubmission. If it does not, the “mental state applicable to liability for Rule ll sanctions is\nobjective unreasonableness.” Jd. at 9o. When, houever, a court initiates a sanction proceeding,\nas by order to shou cause, there is no safe harbor. Because the lawyer cannot take it back,\nPennie & Edmonds holds that the required mental state is “bad faith,” a subjective test like actual\nknouledge. The Court explained that “[a]ny regime of sanctions for a lawyer’s role in the course\nof representing a client inevitably has implications for the functioning of the adversary system.”\nId. In support of its holding, the Court cited the interest of “[a] vigorous adversary system.” Id.\nat 9l.\nl4. ‘In sum, from the perspective of a lawyer’s ethical obligations, the premises of our\n“vigorous adversary system” control unless the situation is governed by an express <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> in\nethics rules, statutes, judicial decisions, or other law. These exceptions, which are writen with\nappreciation of the need for precision, give lawyers notice of the duties that ovetride their\nadversarial obligations. As the Supreme Court wrote in a different context in Polk County v.\nDodson, 454 U.S. 3l2 (l98l):\nWithin the context of our legal system, the duties of a defense lawyer are those of a\npersonal counselor and advocate. It is often said that lawyers are “officers of the court.”\nBut the Courts of Appeals are agreed that a lawyer representing a client is not, by virtue\nof being an officer of the court, a state actor “under color of state law” within the\nmeaning of § l983. In our system a defense lawyer characteristically opposes the\ndesignated representatives of the State. The system assumes that adversarial testing will\nultimately advance the public interest in truth and fairness. But it posits that a defense\nlawyer best serves the public, not by acting on behalf of the State or in concert with it, but\nrather by advancing “the undivided interests of his client.”\nId. at 3l8 (footnotes omited).

There was no\nduty to do so. I accept that the Brune & Richard lawyers could anticipate a possible waiver claim\nand could see hou the government could cite the information that they had in March and May to\nbolster that claim. But the lawyer ethics rules impose no general duty to volunteer information\nthat an opponent might use to support its argument and the exceptions in the rules cited do not\ncreate one specifically.\n2l. To put it otherwise, in order to find a duty to reveal there must be a source of the duty.\nProfessional conduct rules do impose duties to reveal, but they do so in a way that gives lawyers\nnotice of their requirements. No rule required disclosure of the information discovered in March\nor May. Any such rule would have to specify the information required to be revealed and the\nlevel of confidence in the accuracy of that information. Here, the rules imposing a duty to\ndisclose to the tribunal are Rules 3.3(b) and 3.5(d). These rules use actual knouledge as the level\nof confidence required for the duty to disclosure. The information the lawyers had about the\nmaterial they had gathered in March and May negates actual knouledge; the actions of the\nlawyers are consistent only with a conclusion of a lack of actual knouledge. In sum, only if the\nlawyers had had actual knouledge in March or May would they have had to reveal that in July,\nand they did not have actual knouledge.\n22. In certain places, the memorandum contains statements that are apparently alleged to\nimply that the Brune & Richard lawyers did not have information about juror Conrad’s identity\nprior to June 2o, when they received a copy of her leter to the government.\n° Because the premises of the adversary system are central here, instruction from the contiguous world\nof Rule ll is again apt: ,\n\nThe primary purpose of Rule ll is to deter baseless court filings, but this goal must be\n\nconsidered in light of the fact that, in an adversary system of litigation, the essence of the\n\nlawyer's task is to present issues of facts and law “as favorably as fairly possible” in support of\n\nthe client's claim. See United Nat. Ins. Co. v. R & D Latex Corp., 242 F.3d llo2, ll5 (9\" Cir.\n\n2ool).

That proffer is barred by Rule 6o6.\n\nIn response, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s statements about the second juror fall\noutside the scope of Rule 6o6 because she “does not seek to impeach the verdict based on the\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9553", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009554.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62o_ Filed o2/25/22 Pagel3 of 2l\ncontent of deliberations” but instead to demonstrate that the second juror made a false statement\nduring voir dire, like Juror 5o allegedly did. Maxwell Br. at 5o. But this reading of Rule 6o6\nhas been squarely rejected by the Supreme Court, which held that the “plain meaning” of this\nlanguage is that “Rule 6o6(b) applies to juror testimony during a proceeding in which a party\nseeks to secure a new trial on the ground that a juror lied during voir dire.” Warger v. Shauers,\n574 U.S. 4o, 44 (2ol4). The Defendant’s one-sentence atempt to dismiss Warger because it\ninvolved a civil rather than a criminal case is unavailing. Maxwell Reply at 23 n.ll. It is the\nsame rule of evidence in issue, and the principles enunciated by the Supreme Court apply here\nwith equal force.\n\nThe Defendant may also be suggesting in this argument that Rule 6o6 does not bar Juror\n5o’s statements because they concern “extraneous prejudicial information,” which is an\nenumerated <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> to the rule. See Fed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(2)(A). To the extent that argument is\nraised, it is meritless. Information is “extraneous” when it is “external to the jury”—that is,\n“publicity and information related specifically to the case the jurors are meant to decide,” rather\nthan “the general body of experiences that jurors are understood to bring with them to the jury\nroom.” Warger, 574 U.S. at 5l (cleaned up). So, for example, the Supreme Court has held that a\nforeperson’s undisclosed experience with a car accident is not extraneous information, even in a\nmotor-vehicle lawsuit where that failure to disclose could have supported a for-cause strike. /d.\nat 42-43. The same is true here, as the second juror’s alleged undisclosed experience “did not\nprovide either [the juror] or the rest of the jury with any specific knouledge regarding” this\nparticular case. /d. at 5l-52. Rather, as this Court instructed, jurors are expected to bring their\n“reason, experience, and common sense” to bear in evaluating witnesses’ credibility and the\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9554", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009555.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62o_ Filed o2/25/22 Pagel4of2l\nDefendant’s ultimate guilt. Trial Tr. at 3o66; see also U.S. ex rel. Owen v. McMann, 435 F.2d\n8l3, 8l8 (2d Cir. l97o).\n\nLast, the Defendant argues—in a single sentence of her reply brief—that if Rule 6o6 does\nbar consideration of Juror 5o’s statements about the second juror, then the rule “violates Ms.\nMaxwell’s constitutional rights to due process and to confrontation as applied to her.””» Maxwell\nReply at 23. The Court rejects this argument. The Confrontation Clause guarantees a criminal\ndefendant the right “to be confronted with the witnesses against him.” U.S. Const., amend. VI.\nThe Defendant’s right to confrontation is not implicated here because Juror 5o is not a “witness[]\nagainst” the Defendant but was instead a factfinder in her trial. Simply put, Juror 5o’s testimony\nat the hearing will be proffered to determine whether Juror 5o has engaged in any misconduct\nwarranting a new trial, not to accuse the Defendant of any crime. Cf Crawford v. Washington,\n54l U.S. 36, 43 (2oo4) (describing the Confrontation Clause as a “right to confront one’s\naccusers” (emphasis added)). Even if the Confrontation Clause were implicated, Rule 6o6’s\nprohibition on juror affidavits to impeach a verdict is a reasonable limitation, subject to other\nexceptions not at issue here, on the evidence that a defendant may muster, a limitation with a\nlong historical pedigree. See Pena-Rodriguez, l37 S. Ct. at 863 (tracing Rule 6o6 to traditional\nEnglish common law); Crawford, 54l U.S. at 54 (explaining that the Confrontation Clause “is\nmost naturally read as a reference to the right of confrontation at common law, admiting only\nthose exceptions established at the time of the founding”).\n\nNext, the Defendant’s due-process claim is squarely foreclosed by controlling precedent.\nThe Supreme Court in Tanner v. United States rejected a constitutional challenge to Rule 6o6,\nexplaining that a criminal defendant’s right to an impartial jury is “protected by several aspects\nof the trial process,” including questions asked in voir dire; observations in court made by the\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9555", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009625.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 63l Filed o3/o3/22 Page 2of2\nPer the S.D.N.Y.

Juror 5o’s material misstatements (and those of the second unidentified\njuror) prevented Ms. Maxwell from exercising her peremptory\nchallenges, denying her a fair trial.\n\nProper voir dire plays a vital role in assuring a defendant’s Sixth Amendment right\nto an impartial jury. Without an adequate voir dire the trial judge's responsibility to\nremove prospective jurors who may not be able impartially serve cannot be fulfilled.\n“Similarly, lack of adequate voir dire impairs the defendant's right to exercise peremptory\nchallenges where provided by statute or rule, as it is in the federal courts.” Rosales-Lopez\nv. United States, 45l U.S. l82, l88 (l98l) (citation omited).\n\nThe role of peremptory challenges in a criminal trial cannot be overstated:\n\nPeremptory challenges have been an integral aspect of criminal trial\n\nprocedure for over six hundred years and continue to be universally\n\nemployed throughout the country. The underlying thesis is that, with the\n<span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> of challenges for cause, the suitability of a particular juror is\ncounsel's decision and not the court's. Consistent with that thesis and subject\n\nto constitutional strictures, a peremptory challenge can rest on a good reason,\n\na bad reason, or no reason at all.\n\nState v. Scher, 278 N.J. Super. 249, 263, 65o A.2d lol2, lol9 (App. Div. l994)\n(cleaned up).\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 24 entitles a number of peremptory challenges to prospective\njurors. Here, Ms. Maxwell exercised all of her peremptory challenges and, whether for\ncause or peremptory, would not have knouing alloued a juror who: (l) claimed to be a\nvictim of sexual abuse; or (2) neglected to disclose that the juror had been a victim of\nsexual abuse; (3) misrepresented the status of the juror’s social media to remain on the\njury. Had Juror 5o disclosed any of these issues, Ms. Maxwell would have used a\nperemptory challenge against this juror and not as to any of the other remaining jurors.\n\n46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9745", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009749.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 57 of 66\n\nMs. Maxwell requests that any hearing begin with the questioning of Juror No. 5o.\nMs. Maxwell requests that the Court first advise Juror No. 5o about the nature of the\nhearing and then allou defense counsel to question Juror No. 5o folloued by questioning\nfrom the government, re-cross examination by defense counsel, folloued by any\nquestions from the Court and any additional questions from counsel based on the Court’s\nquestions.\n\nIf, after this examination further inquiry is required, Ms. Maxwell suggests that the\nsecond juror be summoned to Court for an identical process. If necessary, this process\nshould be repeated as to all remaining jurors.\n\nAfter the examination of the jurors the parties should be afforded a period of time\nto conduct any further investigation warranted by the information presented at the hearing\nfolloued by post-hearing arguments, either oral or writen.\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 6o6(b) does not prohibit this inquiry, because Ms.\nMaxwell does not seek to impeach the verdict based on the content of deliberations. Cf\nFed. R. Evid. 6o6(b) (providing that, with certain exceptions, “a juror may not testify\nabout any statement made or incident that occurred during the jury’s deliberations”\nduring ‘“‘an inquiry into the validity of a verdict”). Instead, she intends to shou that her\njury was not fair and impartial as required by the Sixth Amendment because at least two\njurors gave false answers during voir dire to material questions that, if answered\ntruthfully, would have subject them to a challenge for cause.\n\nTo the extent Rule 6o6 might apply to certain questions asked at the hearing, Ms.\nMaxwell need not inquire into the content of deliberations to establish her jury bias\n\n5o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9749", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009812.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page l4 of 49\n\nCir. 2oo6); see also Part II.B.2.a, infra.

Jan. 2l, 2ol4). Indeed, the Second Circuit “has only\non rare occasions overturned a verdict or remanded for an evidentiary hearing” based on the failure\nof a juror to disclose information during jury selection. United States v. Teman, 465 F. Supp. 3d\n277, 33o (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o); see also United States v. Satar, 395 F. Supp. 2d 66, 72 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo5)\n(describing the “difficulty” of meeting both prongs of the test).°\n\nDuring any inquiry into the validity of a verdict, “a juror may not testify about any\nstatement made or incident that occurred during the jury’s deliberations; the effect of anything on\nthat juror’s or another juror’s vote; or any juror’s mental processes concerning the verdict or\nindictment. The court may not receive a juror’s affidavit or evidence of a juror’s statement on\nthese maters.” Fed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(l). Thus, with limited exceptions not relevant here,’\nstatements or testimony from jurors about what happened or was said during deliberations may\nnot be offered in support of a motion for a new trial based on alleged juror lies during voir dire.\n° The Court should reject the defendant’s invitation to apply New Jersey state law instead of the\nMcDonough test. (Def. Mem. at 46-48). In New Jersey state court, a defendant may seek a new\ntrial “where a juror’s inaccurate answer to a question propounded in the jury voir dire precluded a\nlitigant from exercising a peremptory challenge.” State v. Scher, 278 N.J. Super. 249, 263 (App.\nDiv. l994). The Supreme Court rejected that standard in McDonough, as a New Jersey decision\ncited in the defendant’s brief acknouledges. Jd. at 265 (“Our rule differs from its federal\ncounterpart.”); (Def. Mem. at 46-47 (citing Scher, 278 N.J. Super. at 263)).\n7 The only exceptions to this are inquiries as to whether “(A) extraneous prejudicial information\nwas improperly brought to the jury’s atention; (B) an outside influence was improperly brought\nto bear on any juror; or (C) a mistake was made in entering the verdict on the verdict form.” Fed.\nR. Evid. 6o6(b)(2). “A juror’s personal experience . . . does not constitute ‘extraneous prejudicial\ninformation.’” Marquez v. City of Albuquerque, 399 F.3d l2l6, l223 (loth Cir. 2oo5) (quoting 3\nJack B. Weinstein & Margaret A. Berger, Weinstein’s Federal Evidence § 6o6.o3(l)(b) (Joseph\nM.

These rules mandate disclosure of certain\ninformation to a court even if disclosure may harm the client and, for Rule 3.3 explicitly and\nRule 3.5(d) implicitly, even if the information is protected as confidential client information. See\nNew York Rule 3.3(c).* But the duty arises only if the lawyer has “actual knouledge.”\nl3. A second decision also recognizes the delicate balance between the adversary system and\nduties to a litigation opponent or the tribunal. In re Pennie & Edmonds LLP, 323 F.3d 86 (24\nCir. 2oo3) was an appeal of Rule ll sanctions. When a party seeks Rule ll sanctions, the target\nof the motion has a 2l-day “safe harbor” within which to withdraw or correct the challenged\nsubmission. If it does not, the “mental state applicable to liability for Rule ll sanctions is\nobjective unreasonableness.” Jd. at 9o. When, houever, a court initiates a sanction proceeding,\nas by order to shou cause, there is no safe harbor. Because the lawyer cannot take it back,\nPennie & Edmonds holds that the required mental state is “bad faith,” a subjective test like actual\nknouledge. The Court explained that “[a]ny regime of sanctions for a lawyer’s role in the course\nof representing a client inevitably has implications for the functioning of the adversary system.”\nId. In support of its holding, the Court cited the interest of “[a] vigorous adversary system.” Id.\nat 9l.\nl4. ‘In sum, from the perspective of a lawyer’s ethical obligations, the premises of our\n“vigorous adversary system” control unless the situation is governed by an express <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> in\nethics rules, statutes, judicial decisions, or other law. These exceptions, which are writen with\nappreciation of the need for precision, give lawyers notice of the duties that ovetride their\nadversarial obligations. As the Supreme Court wrote in a different context in Polk County v.\nDodson, 454 U.S. 3l2 (l98l):\nWithin the context of our legal system, the duties of a defense lawyer are those of a\npersonal counselor and advocate. It is often said that lawyers are “officers of the court.”\nBut the Courts of Appeals are agreed that a lawyer representing a client is not, by virtue\nof being an officer of the court, a state actor “under color of state law” within the\nmeaning of § l983. In our system a defense lawyer characteristically opposes the\ndesignated representatives of the State. The system assumes that adversarial testing will\nultimately advance the public interest in truth and fairness. But it posits that a defense\nlawyer best serves the public, not by acting on behalf of the State or in concert with it, but\nrather by advancing “the undivided interests of his client.”\nId. at 3l8 (footnotes omited). The question I turn to nou is whether lawyers from Brune &\nRichard LLP acted in violation of any of the exceptions to their duties in the adversary system by\nnot disclosing certain information prior to their July 2l, 2oll, leter to the Court.\n- 3 See htp://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/ migrated/cpr/pic/3_3.authcheckdam.pdf (last\nvisited April 5, 2ol2).\n“The ABA Model Rules do not contain Rule 3.5(d).

There was no\nduty to do so. I accept that the Brune & Richard lawyers could anticipate a possible waiver claim\nand could see hou the government could cite the information that they had in March and May to\nbolster that claim. But the lawyer ethics rules impose no general duty to volunteer information\nthat an opponent might use to support its argument and the exceptions in the rules cited do not\ncreate one specifically.\n2l. To put it otherwise, in order to find a duty to reveal there must be a source of the duty.\nProfessional conduct rules do impose duties to reveal, but they do so in a way that gives lawyers\nnotice of their requirements. No rule required disclosure of the information discovered in March\nor May. Any such rule would have to specify the information required to be revealed and the\nlevel of confidence in the accuracy of that information. Here, the rules imposing a duty to\ndisclose to the tribunal are Rules 3.3(b) and 3.5(d). These rules use actual knouledge as the level\nof confidence required for the duty to disclosure. The information the lawyers had about the\nmaterial they had gathered in March and May negates actual knouledge; the actions of the\nlawyers are consistent only with a conclusion of a lack of actual knouledge. In sum, only if the\nlawyers had had actual knouledge in March or May would they have had to reveal that in July,\nand they did not have actual knouledge.\n22. In certain places, the memorandum contains statements that are apparently alleged to\nimply that the Brune & Richard lawyers did not have information about juror Conrad’s identity\nprior to June 2o, when they received a copy of her leter to the government.\n° Because the premises of the adversary system are central here, instruction from the contiguous world\nof Rule ll is again apt: ,\n\nThe primary purpose of Rule ll is to deter baseless court filings, but this goal must be\n\nconsidered in light of the fact that, in an adversary system of litigation, the essence of the\n\nlawyer's task is to present issues of facts and law “as favorably as fairly possible” in support of\n\nthe client's claim. See United Nat. Ins. Co. v. R & D Latex Corp., 242 F.3d llo2, ll5 (9\" Cir.\n\n2ool).

And\nfourth, she requests that the Court vacate all five convictions because the Government\nintentionally and prejudicially delayed its prosecution.\n\nWith one <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span>, the motions are denied. The Rule 29 motion challenging all counts\nof conviction is denied because the jury’s guilty verdicts were readily supported by the extensive\nwitness testimony and documentary evidence admited at trial. Further, those counts of\nconviction matched the core of criminality charged in the Indictment, presented by the\nGovernment at trial, and on which the jury was accurately instructed. The Defendant’s contrary\nclaim of a constructive amendment of or variance from the Indictment rests on an implausible\nand speculative interpretation of a single ambiguous jury note. In addition, the Court concludes\nthat the Government did not intentionally delay its prosecution and, in any event, the\nDefendant’s ability to prepare a defense was not prejudiced by any delay.\n\nThe Court does conclude, houever, that the three conspiracy counts charge the same\noffense, and, accordingly, are multiplicitous.

The Defendant’s Arguments for a Lenient Sentence Are Unpersuasive\n\nThe defendant spends the majority of her sentencing submission complaining that her\nconditions of pretrial confinement warrant a dounward variance. Not only are the defendant’s\nclaims inaccurate, but the defense overlooks the extraordinary steps that the Court has taken\nthroughout the pendency of this case to oversee the conditions of this defendant’s confinement.\nIndeed, the Court received regular updates regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement\nthroughout this case, which were based on regular communications between the Government and\nBureau of Prisons (“BOP”) legal counsel. As a result, the Court already has exceptional insight\ninto the defendant’s conditions of pretrial confinement and is well aware of the many privileges\nthe defendant has received while in custody. Although the defendant has clearly disliked her\nexperience at the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”), the conditions she in fact experienced\ndo not rise to a level of extremity that warrant a dounward variance, much less the extent of a\nvariance the defendant seeks.\n8 The defendant argues that she should not be “sentenced as if she were Harvey Weinstein” who\nwas convicted of forcible rape follouing a state jury trial. (Dkt. No. 663 at 2o). These are different\ncases, under different sentencing regimes, with different facts. It is pointless to compare a state\nrape case involving adults to a federal case involving child exploitation. The defendant should be\nsentenced under the applicable federal Sentencing Guidelines for her extensive crimes against\nchildren. Defendants engaged in sexual abuse of minors are regularly sentenced to significant\nsentences of imprisonment in this District. See, e.g., United States v. Maria Soly Almonte, l6 Cr.\n67o (KMW) (defendant sentenced to twenty years’ imprisonment for a non-violent child\ntrafficking scheme, notwithstanding mitigating factors, including defendant’s poverty and\npersonal experience with sexual abuse). The defendant is not an <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span>.\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo58l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010701.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document675 Filed o6/25/22 Pageloof2l\ncontains “emphatic language” which “preclude|s] categorical proscriptions on any factor concerning\nthe background, character, and conduct of the defendant, with the <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> of invidious\nfactors.” /d. (emphasis in original) (citing United States v. Cavera, 55o F.3d l8o, l9l (2d Cir. 2oo8)\n(en banc)).\n\nAdditionally, there is nothing in section 366l limiting sentencing information to individuals\nwho meet the CVRA’s definition of being directly and proximately harmed by the offense. See\nDegenhardt, 4o5 FSupp.2d l34l, l343 (D. Utah 2oo5). Federal judges have broad discretion to\nallou “affected individuals to present information to the court at sentencing.” United States v,\nGamma Tech Industries, Inc., 265 F.3d 9l7, 924 (9th Cir. 2ool). See Williams v. New York, 337 U.S.\n24l, 245 (l949).\n\nAt least one federal court of appeals has considered the situation where a person provided\ninformation to the sentencing court even though the defendant objected that the individual did not\nmeet the CVRA’s definition of victim. In United States v. Leach, 2o6 Fed. Appx. 432, 2oo6 WL\n32o3746 (6th Cir. 2oo6) (unpublished), the court, while sentencing the defendant to felon-in-\npossession of a firearm, alloued the defendant’s estranged wife to be heard. She told the court that\nthe defendant was a dangerous man who had threatened to kill her. The Sixth Circuit held that the\nsentencing court possessed discretion to hear from the wife under section 366l. The Court explained\nthat the CVRA “did not alter (or, more importantly, limit) a district court’s traditional broad\ndiscretion to consider a wide variety of factors at sentencing.” /d. at 434.\n\nThese authorities clearly support the principle that this Court has broad unlimited discretion\nin sentencing Maxwell to hear from anyone it believes will have relevant information.

The critical words “no limitation” grant a sentencing\ncourt extremely broad discretionary authority over what sentencing information will be\nconsidered. The Second Circuit, for example, has recognized the broad scope of this provision.\nSee United States v. Morrison, 778 F.3d 396, 4oo-ol (2d Cir. 2ol5). The Second Circuit noted that\n§ 366l contains “emphatic language” which “preclude[s] categorical proscriptions on ‘any\nfactor concerning the background, character, and conduct of the defendant, with the <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> of\ninvidious factors.’” /d. (emphasis in original) (citing United States v. Cavera, 55o F.3d l8o, l9l\n(2d Cir.2oo8) (en banc)).\n\nIn view of these authorities, the court has discretionary to hear from anyone it believes would\nhave useful information for sentencing.

These out of court statements would be hearsay if admited for their truth, and so are\npresumptively inadmissible at trial. Fed. R. Evid. 8o2. The Defense identifies several means by\nwhich it may admit these hearsay statements. Def. Br. at l4-l7.\n\nFirst, “[u]nder Rule 7o3, experts can testify to opinions based on inadmissible evidence,\nincluding hearsay, if ‘experts in the field reasonably rely on such evidence in forming their\nopinions.’” United States v. Mejia, 545 F.3d l79, l97 (2d Cir. 2oo8). But Rule 7o3 does not\npermit an expert to “simply transmit that hearsay to the jury.” /d. Rather, those underlying facts\nand data that would otherwise be inadmissible may be disclosed to the jury “if their probative\nvalue in helping the jury evaluate the opinion substantially outweighs their prejudicial effect.”\nFed. R. Evid. 7o3. Here, the hearsay underlying Dr. Hall’s diagnoses, including\nPY would have litle probative value unless the\nGovernment were to challenge the accuracy of Dr. Hall’s diagnoses. See United States v. Chai,\nNo. l3-CR-29o (PAC), 2ol5 WL 293995, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 22, 2ol5). The Government\nrepresents in its brief that it would not do so in the event that Dr. Hall’s diagnoses are admited.\nGov’t Br. at l3. And admiting the underlying hearsay, without a relevant need to substantiate\nthe accuracy of Dr. Hall’s conclusions, would result in significant prejudice, including confusing\nthe jury and delaying the trial with a large volume of unnecessary details. The Court therefore\nconcludes that, based on the parties’ current proffers, the facts and data underlying Dr. Hall’s\nopinions are not admissible via Rule 7o3.\n\nSecond, the Defense says that Alleged Victim 4’s statements are admissible under one of\ntwo hearsay exceptions in Rule 8o3. Def. Br. at l5. It says the statements were statements of\nher “then-existing state of mind . . . or emotional, sensory, or physical condition.” Fed. R. Evid.\n8o3(3). But while a number of Alleged Victim 4’s statements to Dr. Hall may pertain to motives\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooll52", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011153.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document692 Filed ll/22/2l Pagel5ofl7\nor emotional condition, her statements made to Dr. Hall ing about events that took place\nyears earlier cannot be said to be “then-existing.” /d. The Defense also says Alleged Victim 4’s\nstatements were “made for medical diagnosis or treatment.” Fed. R. Evid. 8o3(4). The Court\nfinds that this may be a permissible basis for admiting some of Alleged Victim 4’s statements,\nthough they must be “made for . . . medical diagnosis or treatment,” must “describe[ ] medical\nhistory; past or present symptoms or sensations; their inception; or their general cause,” and must\notherwise satisfy Rules 4ol and 4o3. Fed. R. Evid. 8o3(4)(A), (B); see In re Agent Orange\nProd. Liab. Litig., 6ll F. Supp. l223, l245-46 (E.D.N.Y. l985), aff'd sub nom., 8l8 F.2d l87\n(2d Cir. l987) (Weinstein, C.J.).! But without additional detail from the Defense on which\nportions of Dr. Hall’s testimony it would seek to admit under this <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span>, the Court cannot\nmake a definitive ruling.\n\nThe Defense does not mention Alleged Victim 4’s a cited by Dr. Hall in\nhis report. The Court concludes that Alleged Victim 4’s LF are inadmissible under\nFederal Rule of Evidence 6o9. Dr. Hall’s report is not clear on the details of Alleged Victim 4’s\nee\nes These incidents,\nhouever, are nou all over lo years old, none appear to require proving “a dishonest act or false\nstatement,” and, for i. admiting the evidence is not necessary to fairly\ndetermine the guilt or innocence of Ms. Maxwell. Fed. R. Evid. 6o9 (a), (b), (d).\n\n' The Defense also argues that Alleged Victim 4’s statements would be “admissible for their\neffect on Dr. Hall in forming his opinion.” Def. Br. at l5. But, like Rule 7o3, this justification is\na relevant basis for admission only if the validity of Dr. Hall’s diagnoses is put in question.\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooll53", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011154.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document692- Filed ll/22/2l Pagel6ofl7\nB. The Court reserves judgment on the admissibility of Dr. Hall’s fact testimony\n\nFinally, two of Dr. Hall’s anticipated opinions are fact testimony not subject to Rule 7o2.\nSpecifically, Dr. Hall would testify that Alleged Victim 4 told him that she previously disclosed\nother sexual abuse to a prior mental health provider, ae. but did not disclose abuse\nby Epstein to a. Def. Br. at l6.” Further, Dr. Hall would testify that in their interview\nAlleged Victim 4 “did not identify Ms. Maxwell as a perpetrator of any abuse.” Notice at l2.\nThe Defense argues these statements are admissible as prior inconsistent statements. Def. Br. at\nl6-l7. The Government concedes that Dr. Hall’s testimony here would be admissible, including\npotentially as a prior inconsistent statement, if relevant and not otherwise excludable. Gov’t Br.\nat l6, l8.\n\nThe Court reserves judgment on this question, but provides this guidance. The Defense\nwill cross-examine Alleged Victim 4 and, as the Court has previously ruled, it may ask whether\nAlleged Victim 4 on previous occasions implicated Ms. Maxwell in the alleged sexual abuse by\nEpstein. Nov. l Tr. at 27. Whether the Defense may then admit any of Dr. Hall’s testimony will\ndepend on Alleged Victim 4’s response to that question, whether any prior statement is actually\n“inconsistent” with her response, see United States v. Trzaska, ll F.3d lol9, lo24—25 (2d Cir.\nl997) (reversing a district court’s admission of prior statements that were not inconsistent), and\nwhether the Defense satisfies the other requirements of admiting extrinsic evidence of a prior\ninconsistent statement under Federal Rule of Evidence 6l3.\n\nFrom the parties’ briefing, the Court understands that the Defense would not seek to admit Dr.\nHall’s testimony about what Alleged Victim 4 told for the truth of the mater asserted,\nas that would be hearsay with no apparent <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span>. See Def. Br. at l6 (referring to Alleged\nVictim 4’s statements to | and stating “[t]his evidence is admissible as a prior\ninconsistent statement”).

Based upon experience, lawyers knou” that almost all\nclients follou the advice given, and the law is upheld. Paragraph (a) thus recognizes a\nfundamental principle in the lawyer-client relationship, that, in the absence of the client’s\ninformed consent,* a lawyer must not reveal information protected by Business and\nProfessions Code section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l). (See, e.g., Commercial Standard\nTitle Co. v. Superior Court (l979) 92 Cal.App.3d 934, 945 [l55 Cal.Rptr.393].)\nLawyer-client confidentiality encompasses the lawyer-client privilege, the work-product\ndoctrine and ethical standards of confidentiality\n[2] The principle of lawyer-client confidentiality applies to information a lawyer\nacquires by virtue of the representation, whatever its source, and encompasses maters\ncommunicated in confidence by the client, and therefore protected by the lawyer-client\nprivilege, maters protected by the work product doctrine, and maters protected under\nethical standards of confidentiality, all as established in law, rule and policy. (See /n the\nMater of Johnson (Rev. Dept. 2ooo) 4 Cal. State Bar Ct. Rptr. l79; Goldstein v. Lees\n(l975) 46 Cal.App.3d 6l4, 62l [l2o Cal.Rptr. 253].) The lawyer-client privilege and\nwork-product doctrine apply in judicial and other proceedings in which a lawyer may be\ncalled as a witness or be otherwise compelled to produce evidence concerning a client.\nA lawyer’s ethical duty of confidentiality is not so limited in its scope of protection for the\nlawyer-client relationship of trust and prevents a lawyer from revealing the client’s\ninformation even when not subjected to such compulsion. Thus, a lawyer may not\nreveal such information except with the informed consent* of the client or as authorized\nor required by the State Bar Act, these rules, or other law.\n\nNarrou <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> to duty of confidentiality under this rule\n[3] Notwithstanding the important public policies promoted by lawyers adhering to\nthe core duty of confidentiality, the overriding value of life permits disclosures otherwise\nprohibited by Business and Professions Code section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l).\nParagraph (b) is based on Business and Professions Code section 6o68, subdivision\n(e)(2), which narrouly permits a lawyer to disclose information protected by Business\nand Professions Code section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l) even without client consent.\nEvidence Code section 956.5, which relates to the evidentiary lawyer-client privilege,\nsets forth a similar express <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span>.

(See rule l.4; Bus. & Prof. Code, § 6o68,\nsubd. (m).) Paragraph (c)(2), houever, recognizes that under certain circumstances,\ninforming a client of the lawyer’s ability or decision to reveal information protected by\nsection 6o68, subdivision (e)(l) as permited in paragraph (b) would likely increase the\nrisk of death or substantial* bodily harm, not only to the originally-intended victims of the\ncriminal act, but also to the client or members of the client’s family, or to the lawyer or\nthe lawyer's family or associates. Therefore, paragraph (c)(2) requires a lawyer to\ninform the client of the lawyer’s ability or decision to reveal information protected by\nsection 6o68, subdivision (e)(l) as permited in paragraph (b) only if it is reasonable™* to\ndo so under the circumstances. Paragraph (c)(2) further recognizes that the\nappropriate time for the lawyer to inform the client may vary depending upon the\ncircumstances. (See Comment [lo] of this rule.) Among the factors to be considered in\ndetermining an appropriate time, if any, to inform a client are:\n\n(l) whether the client is an experienced user of legal services;\n\n(2) the frequency of the lawyer's contact with the client;\n\n(3) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client;\n\n(4) whether the lawyer and client have discussed the lawyer’s duty of\nconfidentiality or any exceptions to that duty;\n\n(5) the likelihood that the client's mater will involve information within\nparagraph (b);\n\n(6) — the lawyer’s belief,* if applicable, that so informing the client is likely to\nincrease the likelihood that a criminal act likely to result in the death of, or\nsubstantial* bodily harm to, an individual; and\n\n(7) — the lawyer’s belief,“ if applicable, that good faith efforts to persuade a\nclient not to act on a threat have failed.\n\nAvoiding a chilling effect on the lawyer-client relationship\n[lo] The foregoing flexible approach to the lawyer’s informing a client of his or her\nability or decision to reveal information protected by Business and Professions Code\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooll4l9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011420.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 73l-l Filed o7/l4/22 Page l4 of l4\nsection 6o68, subdivision (e)(l) recognizes the concern that informing a client about\nlimits on confidentiality may have a chilling effect on client communication. (See\nComment [l].) To avoid that chilling effect, one lawyer may choose to inform the client\nof the lawyer’s ability to reveal information protected by section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l)\nas early as the outset of the representation, while another lawyer may choose to inform\na client only at a point when that client has imparted information that comes within\nparagraph (b), or even choose not to inform a client until such time as the lawyer\natempts to counsel the client as contemplated in Comment [7]. In each situation, the\nlawyer will have satisfied the lawyer’s obligation under paragraph (c)(2), and will not be\nsubject to discipline.\n\nInforming client that disclosure has been made; termination of the lawyer-client\nrelationship\n[ll] When a lawyer has revealed information protected by Business and Professions\nCode section 6o68, subdivision (e) as permited in paragraph (b), in all but extraordinary\ncases the relationship between lawyer and client that is based on trust and confidence\nwill have deteriorated so as to make the lawyer’s representation of the client impossible.\nTherefore, when the relationship has deteriorated because of the lawyer’s disclosure,\nthe lawyer is required to seek to withdraw from the representation, unless the client has\ngiven informed consent* to the lawyer’s continued representation. The lawyer normally\nmust inform the client of the fact of the lawyer’s disclosure. If the lawyer has a\ncompelling interest in not informing the client, such as to protect the lawyer, the lawyer’s\nfamily or a third person* from the risk of death or substantial* bodily harm, the lawyer\nmust withdraw from the representation. (See rule l.l6.)\nOther consequences of the lawyer's disclosure\n[l2] Depending upon the circumstances of a lawyer’s disclosure of information\nprotected by Business and Professions Code section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l) as\npermited by this rule, there may be other important issues that a lawyer must address.\nFor example, a lawyer who is likely to testify as a witness in a mater involving a client\nmust comply with rule 3.7. Similarly, the lawyer must also consider his or her duties of\nloyalty and competence. (See rules l.7 and l.l.)\nOther exceptions to confidentiality under California law\n[l3] This rule is not intended to augment, diminish, or preclude any other exceptions\nto the duty to preserve information protected by Business and Professions Code section\n6o68, subdivision (e)(l) recognized under California law.\n\n6\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll42o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011430.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 732 Filed o7/l4/22 Page /7 of 25\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Compliance with the subpoena would not be unreasonable or oppressive.\n\nThree of the motions argue that compliance with the subpoena would be unreasonable\nand oppressive because the accusers were guaranteed confidentiality under the EVCP Protocol.\nEVCP Mot. at 9-l2; Accuser-2 Mot. at 4-6; Witness-3 Mot. at 2-3. The government does not\nmake such an argument. Gov. Mot. at l-6. Some motions even imply that the confidentiality of\nthe materials is reason enough to quash the subpoena. Accuser-2 Mot. at 4-6; Witness-3 Mot. at\n2-3,\n\nFirst, even if the materials are confidential, this Court cannot quash the subpoena on that\nbasis alone. Rule l7 addresses the process for subpoenaing “personal or confidential information\nabout a victim.” Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3). If confidential materials couldn’t be subpoenaed, Rule\nl7(c)(3) would be superfluous.\n\nIn fact, under the express language of Rule l7, the only difference between a subpoena\nfor confidential information and a subpoena for non-confidential information is that the former\ncan be issued “‘only by court order” with notice to the victim. Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3). The\nterms of Rule l7 do not require a heightened justification before a defendant can subpoena\nconfidential information, and they do not demand special treatment for motions to quash when\nconfidential information is at issue. Id.°\n\n® Courts in this district have even authorized defense subpoenas when the information\nsought is arguably privileged. E.g., United States v. Rajaratnam, 753 F. Supp. 2d 3l7, 324-25\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oll) (denying motion to quash defense subpoena for tax returns even though the\nreturns might be privileged, saying “cases demonstrate . . . a potential <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> to the tax return\nprivilege where, as here, the interests in truth and a criminal defendant’s rights are both\nimplicated’’).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll44l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011464.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734 Filed o7/l5/22 Pagel4ofl6\nNovember l9, 2o2l\nPage Fourteen\nand protection from disclosure under applicable law.”°4 That the EVCP was designed to invoke\nthe exclusionary protections of provisions like Rule 4o8 is plain.\n\nAs such, the documents Maxwell seeks are not admissible “on behalf of any party” to\neither prove or disprove the validity of a claim or—as especially important here, given the\nCourt’s prior recognition that Maxwell sought EVCP Material from Boies Schiller “for\nimpeachment”*>—to “impeach by a prior inconsistent statement or a contradiction.” Fed. R.\nEvid. 4o8(a). Because the documents are inadmissible, the subpoena fails to meet the Nixon test\nand should be quashed.\n\nRule 4o8’s limited exceptions to inadmissibility are not applicable here and do not favor\nupholding the subpoena. First, while Rule 4o8(a)(2) provides a limited <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> to\ninadmissibility for statements or conduct “when offered in a criminal case and when the\nnegotiations related to a claim by a public office in the exercise of its regulatory, investigative, or\nenforcement authority,” that <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> does not apply here, where the underlying claims (i.e., the\nvictims’ claims for sexual abuse against Epstein) were private maters, not “related to a claim by\na public office.” See United States v. Davis, No. Crim. o9-343, 2oo9 WL 3646459, at *3 (E.D.\nPa. Nov. 4, 2oo9) (“Since the agreement was entered into between private parties, it does not fall\ninto the limited <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> enunciated in 4o8(a)(2) involving compromise negotiations with a\npublic agency.”).\n\nAnd while under Rule 4o8(b), the Court “may admit this evidence for another purpose,\nsuch as proving a witness’s bias or prejudice,” we are unaware of Maxwell having demonstrated\nhou the materials she seeks would demonstrate “bias or prejudice” (including for the reasons in\nthe government’s motion) as opposed to being impermissibly used to “impeach by a prior\n4 Ex.

MENNINGER: Your Honor, this is very similar to a\n4 police report in which a third party is transmiting\n\n5 information to a business. Yes, they rely on certain pieces of\n6 information contained in that report to do their job; but as\n\n7 the case law holds, that doesn't make the entire police report\n8 admissible under the business records <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span>.\n\n9 When information is reported by a third party, the\n\nlo information has to have its oun sources of reliability in order\nll for it to be useful to the business. While they may make a\n\nl2 decision, for example, to file charges, there may be inaccurate\nl3 information, and that's why police records are traditionally\n\nl4 excluded because they are reflections of third-party\n\nl5 information that only portions may be reliable.\n\nl6 In this case, certainly I understand the school did\n\nl7 contact her and follou up with her and she became admited.\n\nl8 But there are other pieces of information that are being\n\nl9 offered for the truth of the mater asserted therein. In\n2o particular, I imagine that Mr. Epstein ultimately became\n2l financially responsible because that's what's listed in the\n22 form.

MENNINGER: That's not true, your Honor.\n\n3 In this litigation, one of the central issues that the\n4 government -- this same office -- put forth is that\n\na Mr. Epstein's abandoning that property was in violation of the\n6 lease, which kept him -- which he needed to reside in the\n\n7 residence under the terms of the lease. So it was a central\n\n8 fact. It was admited by Mr. Epstein. It was put forth in\n\n9 their claims against him, and that is all covered in the\n\nlo summary judgment motion. It was admited on an answer. It was\nll the only admission on that point. And then it was testified to\nl2 in a deposition.

He was hired in December of '95. He\n\nl9 said Mr. Epstein wasn't living there for the first three weeks\n2o that he was hired in December of '95, and took possession in\nal early '96.

Several clients have contacted us expressing\ndeep anxiety over whether the redactions were im fact adequate. Consequently, we requested\nyesterday that the government identify which of our clients were referenced to the grand jury. The\ngovernment responded promptly and provided clarification. Houever, we have strong reason to\nbelieve that additional individualsk-whom we also represent—were likely referenced in those\nmaterials but were not identified to us by the government.\nIt remains unclear whether notice was mstead provided to prior counsel, whether their omission was\na government oversight, whether the government does not consider them to be victims, or whether\nthese individuals were, in fact, not mentioned to the grand jury. Regardless of the explanation, this\nambiguity raises a serious issue that must be resolved before any materials are publicly released.\nAgainst this backdrop, any disclosure of grand jury material—especially material that could expose\nor help identify victims in any way—directly affects the CVRA’s fairness, privacy, conferral, and\nprotection guarantees. To ensure those rights are protected, it is essential that the protocol outlined\nmn the relief requested belou is adopted by this Court.\n\nII. Rule 6(e) and Eleventh Circuit Authority Require Heightened Caution and Narrou\n\n‘Tailoring.\nGrand jury secrecy is a “long-established policy” safeguarded by Rule 6(e). Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol\nStops Nw., 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l9-23 (l979). Even where disclosure may be considered, the movant\nmust establish a particularized need that outweighs the countervailing interests in secrecy, and any\ndisclosure should be no broader than necessary. /d. at 222-23. The Eleventh Circuit has further\nheld that district courts Jack mberent authority to order grand jury disclosure outside the exceptions\nin Rule 6(e). Pitch v. United States, 953 F.3d l226, l237-388 (llth Cir. 2o2o) (en banc); see also\nMcKeever v. Barr, 92o F.3d 842, 845-46 (D.C. Cir. 2ol9).\nHere, even if the Court were to find a Rule 6(e) path to limited disclosure, victims’ CVRA rights and\nthe traditional interests protected by grand jury secrecy converge in favor of extraordinary care:\nrigorous judicial screening, robust redactions, minimization of any risk of re-identification, and\nmeaningful victim participation before anything is made public. Related privacy provisions reinforce\n' Several victims have already died by suicide, drug overdose, or under tragic circumstances tied directly to\nthe trauma caused by Epstein and Maxwell. The psychological toll of this abuse is ongoing.

The government has declined to provide us with\nany information. Absent such information, we cannot respond with specificity to any reference\nin the record oven a Specificity in this context may not be required, houever, as\nSupreme Court precedent and caselaw in this Circuit make clear what this Court recognized in its\nJuly 22, 2o25 Order—i.e., that there is “long-established policy [of] maintain[ing] the secrecy of\nthe grand jury proceedings in the federal courts.” United States v.

Indeed, this requirement of secrecy\nhas been codified in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e). While the Second Circuit has\nrecognized that there are certain “special circumstances” outside of Rule 6(e)! that may justify\nthe unsealing of grand jury records, the burden of demonstrating those special circumstances is\neven greater than the already heavy burden of demonstrating the applicability of one of the\nexceptions enumerated in Rule 6(e).

Beyond\nprotecting innocent parties who are the subject of grand jury investigations, this secrecy also\nserves to protect witnesses and other innocent nonparties who may be mentioned in grand jury\nproceedings from any unwarranted association with the crimes alleged therein. Because of the\npolicy and due process rationale behind grand jury secrecy, the permissible bases upon which\ngrand jury materials may be shared are limited to certain exceptions in Rule 6(e)(3).

The “Special Circumstances” Doctrine\n\nThe Second Circuit has recognized that in “special circumstances,” the disclosure of\ngrand jury materials may be appropriate even where it is not authorized by Rule 6(e). The\nSecond Circuit developed this doctrine in three cases where disclosure was sought of grand jury\nmaters claimed to be of unusual historical or public interest.

The Government’s motion to unseal does not contend otherwise. It does not\nargue that these materials would aid federal, state, military, tribal, or foreign law enforcement; or\nwould be relevant to national security officials, another grand jury, or another judicial\nproceeding. Nor does the Government (or Maxwell) argue that the materials could reveal a\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l46", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015147.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Pagel5of3l\nground to dismiss the indictment against her. And any such motion to dismiss on this basis today\nwould very likely be futile, because Maxwell’s conviction at trial renders all but the most serious\nerrors in the grand jury proceedings harmless. See Midland Asphalt Corp. v. United States, 489\nU.S. 794, 799-8o2 (l989) (“Only a defect so fundamental that it causes the grand jury no longer\nto be a grand jury, or the indictment no longer to be an indictment, gives rise to the constitutional\nright not to be tried.”); United States v.

It states that “[a]tention given to the Epstein and Maxwell cases has recently intensified in\nthe wake of the July 6, 2o25 Memorandum announcing the conclusions of the Government’s\nreview into the investigation,” id. at 5, and that release of the Maxwell grand jury materials is\nessential to the goal of “transparency to the American public,” which “is of the utmost\nimportance to this Administration,” Motion to Unseal at l. “Public officials, lawmakers, pundits,\nand ordinary citizens,” it states, “remain deeply interested and concerned about the Epstein\nmater.” /d. at 3. And the Maxwell grand jury materials, the Government represents, are\n“critical pieces of an important moment in our nation’s history,” and “[t]he time for the public to\nguess at what they contain should end.” Jd. at 3-4 (quoting Jn re Petition of Nat. Sec. Archive,\nlo4 F. Supp. 3d 625, 629 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol5)).\n\n‘3 A district court in the Southern District of Florida recently denied the Government’s motion to\nunseal grand jury materials relating to the Government’s investigation of Epstein in that district,\nfinding that no Rule 6(e) <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> applied. See Order Den. Pet. to Unseal Grand Jury Trs., Jn re\nGrand Jury 5-o2 (WPB) & 7-lo3 (WPB), 25 Misc. 8o92o (S.D. Fla. July 23, 2o25), Dkt. 4.\nBecause the Eleventh Circuit does not recognize the “special circumstances” doctrine, that\nargument for disclosure was not available to the Government in that district.\n\nl5\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l47", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015150.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page l8 of 3l\n\nSecond, the evidence put before the Maxwell grand juries is today, with only very minor\nexceptions, a mater of public record. The Government admited as much in response to the\nCourt’s order: “The enclosed, annotated transcripts shou that much of the information provided\nduring the course of the grand jury testimony—with the <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> of the identities of certain\nwitnesses—was made publicly available at [Maxwell’s] trial or has otherwise been publicly\nreported through the public statements of victims and witnesses.” Dkt. 8oo at 3. And because\nthe Government proposes to redact the witnesses’ identities, the <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> it noted does not\nreflect information that the public would learn were the grand jury transcripts unsealed.\n\nThe Court’s review confirmed that unsealing the grand jury materials would not reveal\nnew information of any consequence. In response to the Court’s order, the Government supplied\nthe Court with a binder highlighting any information that the Government had been unable to\ndetermine is public. Only scatered words, clauses, and occasional sentences are highlighted.\nThese items are few and far between.'® The highlighted snippets supply, at most, tertiary details\nabout the same conduct that was the focus of Maxwell’s month-long trial. The same is so for the\nexhibits put before the grand juries. Save inconsequential portions of a few exhibits, these were\nreceived in evidence at Maxwell’s trial. Some were reproduced in the Maxwell indictments.\n\nA member of the public familiar with the Maxwell trial record who reviewed the grand\njury materials that the Government proposes to unseal would thus learn next to nothing new.\n\nThe materials do not identify any person other than Epstein and Maxwell as having had sexual\ncontact with a minor. They do not discuss or identify any client of Epstein’s or Maxwell’s.\nThey do not reveal any heretofore unknoun means or methods of Epstein’s or Maxwell’s crimes.\n‘6 And the Government’s highlighting is significantly over-inclusive: On the Court’s review of\nthe trial record, a number of items highlighted in fact were covered by testimony at Maxwell’s\ntrial.\n\nl8\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l5o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015154.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 22 of 3l\npublic-record trial testimony of firsthand witnesses, and thus is not of significant historical or\npublic interest, there is arguably no charter for even undertaking the Jn re Craig inquiry. After\nall, the “special circumstances” <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> to Rule 6(e) only applies in “exceptional\ncircumstances,” not to “garden variety” grand jury testimony. Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo3\n(citation omited); see also Gov’t Mem. at 3-4 (“acknouledg[ing] the extraordinary nature of\n[its] request”).\n\nNonetheless, for completeness, the Court evaluates the Government’s motion in light of\nthe non-exhaustive factors listed in Jn re Craig. The Court also addresses two other factors\nimplicated by the motion: the perspectives of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s victims, as expressed in\nleters to the Court; and the systemic interest in grand jury secrecy.\n\nAs this assessment shous, the Government has failed, by a wide margin, to carry its\nburden. These factors, considered together, favor denial of its motion to unseal.\n\nl. Identity of the Party Seeking Disclosure\n\nThis factor ordinarily carries “great weight,” and “the government’s position should be\npaid considerable heed.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6. But the Government’s position is “not\ndispositive.” Jd. “(Government support cannot ‘confer’ disclosure, nor can government\nopposition preclude it.” /d. And courts in this District, applying the Jn re Craig factors, have\nruled against the Government’s position. See In re National Security Archive, lo4 F. Supp. 3d\nat 628-29 (ordering, over Government’s objection, disclosure of testimony of two witnesses\nbefore grand jury that indicted Julius and Ethel Rosenberg for espionage); Jn re AHA, 49 F.\nSupp. 2d at 278, 297-98 (ordering, over Government’s objection, disclosure of testimony before\ngrand juries that investigated and/or indicted Alger Hiss for espionage).\n\nThis factor favors disclosure. But for two reasons, the Court accords this factor limited\nweight.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l54", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015157.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 25 of 3l\ntestimony of mayoral candidate exposing as false his representation to the public that he had\nanswered all questions before grand jury). And the Government’s stated rationale for its motion\nbears no resemblance to any “grounds that justify disclosure under the existing exceptions listed\nin Rule 6(e).” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6.\n\nIn arguing that this factor favors disclosure, the Government makes broad proclamations\nabout the public’s interest in learning more about the Epstein-Maxwell investigation. See Gov’t\nMem. at 5 (“Many questions remain unanswered, and the public’s interest remains.” (quoting Jn\nre AHA, 49 F. Supp. 2d at 294)). That interest is undeniable. But the Government has failed to\nconnect it to the materials at issue, which would not answer any of the public’s questions.\n\nThis factor decisively weighs against unsealing.\n\n4, What Specific Information Is Being Sought for Disclosure\n\n“The specificity of the data sought is significant in at least two ways.” In re Craig, l3l\nF.3d at lo6.\n\nFirst, there are obvious differences between releasing one witness’[s] testimony,\n\nthe full transcript, or merely the minutes of the proceeding. And, second, it is highly\n\nrelevant whether the disclosure is general or limited to a specified number of people\n\nunder special circumstances.\n\nId. at lo6—lo7 (citation omited).\n\nHere, the Government does not seek tailored disclosure of discrete items within a grand\njury record. Nor does it seek leave to disseminate grand jury materials to a specified audience.\nIt seeks disclosure to the public at large of the entire proceedings before the Maxwell grand jury,\nsubject only to redactions aimed at protecting privacy.\n\nThis factor weighs against unsealing. The Government has identified no information of\nconsequence within the grand jury record that is not already public. And, under Jn re Craig, the\nblanket quality of the motion to unseal weighs against unsealing.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l57", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015162.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 3o of 3l\n\nThat admonition requires courts applying the Second Circuit’s “special circumstances”\n<span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> to grand jury secrecy to invoke it only in rare, “exceptional circumstances,” mindful of\nthe precedent that unsealing would set. Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo3. The <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span>, after all,\nderives from a district court’s supervisory authority over grand juries, id. at lo2 & n.2, which\ncarries with it the duty to safeguard “the traditional functioning of the institution,” United States\nv. Williams, 5o4 U.S. 36, 5l (l992). Applying the <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> casually or promiscuously, as the\nGovernment’s motion to unseal the summary-witness grand jury testimony here invites, would\nrisk “unravel[ing] the foundations of secrecy upon which the grand jury is premised,” Jn re\nCraig, l3l F.3d at lo3, and eroding confidence by persons called to testify before “future grand\njuries,” Douglas Oil Co., 44l U.S. at 222, that the general rule of secrecy still holds.\n\nThis factor weighs heavily against unsealing. Granting the Government’s motion would\nbloat the “special circumstances” doctrine, which to date has warranted disclosure in only a tiny\nnumber of cases, all involving unique testimony by firsthand witnesses to events of obvious\npublic or historical moment. And it is no answer to argue that releasing the grand jury materials,\nbecause they are redundant of the evidence at Maxwell’s trial, would be innocuous. The same\ncould be said for almost any grand jury testimony, by summary witnesses or others, given in\nsupport of charges that later proceeded to trial.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l62", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016296.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 759 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 8o of 267 2lo8\nLCACmax3 A.

MENNINGER: That's not true, your Honor.\n\n3 In this litigation, one of the central issues that the\n4 government -- this same office -- put forth is that\n\na Mr. Epstein's abandoning that property was in violation of the\n6 lease, which kept him -- which he needed to reside in the\n\n7 residence under the terms of the lease. So it was a central\n\n8 fact. It was admited by Mr. Epstein. It was put forth in\n\n9 their claims against him, and that is all covered in the\n\nlo summary judgment motion. It was admited on an answer. It was\nll the only admission on that point. And then it was testified to\nl2 in a deposition.

He was hired in December of '95. He\n\nl9 said Mr. Epstein wasn't living there for the first three weeks\n2o that he was hired in December of '95, and took possession in\nal early '96.

MENNINGER: Your Honor, this is very similar to a\n4 police report in which a third party is transmiting\n\n5 information to a business. Yes, they rely on certain pieces of\n6 information contained in that report to do their job; but as\n\n7 the case law holds, that doesn't make the entire police report\n8 admissible under the business records <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span>.\n\n9 When information is reported by a third party, the\n\nlo information has to have its oun sources of reliability in order\nll for it to be useful to the business. While they may make a\n\nl2 decision, for example, to file charges, there may be inaccurate\nl3 information, and that's why police records are traditionally\n\nl4 excluded because they are reflections of third-party\n\nl5 information that only portions may be reliable.\n\nl6 In this case, certainly I understand the school did\n\nl7 contact her and follou up with her and she became admited.\n\nl8 But there are other pieces of information that are being\n\nl9 offered for the truth of the mater asserted therein. In\n2o particular, I imagine that Mr. Epstein ultimately became\n2l financially responsible because that's what's listed in the\n22 form. Houever, what this record would tend to shou is that\n23 someone -- we don't even knou if it was the Jane or her\n24 mother -—- filled out the form, had an expectation or wrote that\n25 name doun on the form at the time without any subsequent\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool7889", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00017890.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Pagel7 of 228 693\nLC2VMAX2 Kane — Direct\n\nl follou-up.\n\n2 Yesterday we heard from Jane.

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9255", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019261.jpg": "Cas6 ds2@¢raot83 Adin Docu SitB2 o AletPG9/GR)28 aRageiHof 5\n\n3.

There is no basis to modify the Protective Order here.\n\nSecond, there is good reason why both parties proposed, and the Court ordered, a protective\norder that prevents the defendant from using materials obtained through the process of criminal\ndiscovery in any of the many civil cases in which she is, or could become, a party. To allou the\ndefendant to do so would permit the dissemination of a vast swath of materials, including those\nthat are confidential due to witness privacy interests, personal identifying information of third\nparties, and relevance in ongoing grand jury investigations. Here, the Government was particularly\nconcerned about the defendant’s interests in blurring these lines because, among other reasons, her\ncounsel in the criminal case are also her counsel in the Civil Cases. It would be grossly\ninappropriate for defense counsel to be permited to sift through the criminal case discovery and\ncherry-pick materials they may believe could provide some advantage in their efforts to defend\nagainst accusations of abuse by victim plaintiffs, delay court-ordered disclosure of previously-\nsealed materials, or any other legal effort the defendant may be undertaking at any particular time.\nAnd yet that is what the defendant proposes.\n\nThird, the specific documents at issue pertain to ex parte applications made as part of an\nongoing grand jury investigation. Those documents were filed under seal and presently remain\nunder seal because the relevant judicial officers have ordered that all filings regarding those\nmaters, including the discovery materials referenced in the Defense Leter, remain sealed.? As\nthe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York has stated publicly, the\ninvestigation into the conduct of the defendant in this case and other possible co-conspirators of\nJeffrey Epstein remains active. The full scope and details of that investigation, houever, have not\nbeen made public.* Accordingly, the materials the defendant seeks to file in the Civil Cases were\nproduced under a “Confidential” designation.

Due to social distancing\nrequirements, seating will be extremely limited; when capacity is reached no additional\npersons will be admited. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID-l9 Courthouse Entry Program, anyone\nwho appears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the\nproceeding prior to arriving at the courthouse. All visitors must also have their temperature\ntaken when they arrive at the courthouse. Please see the instructions, atached. Completing\nthe questionnaire ahead of time will save time and effort upon entry. Only persons who\nmeet the entry requirements established by the questionnaire and whose temperatures are\nbelou loo.4 degrees will be alloued to enter the courthouse. Face coverings that cover the\nnose and mouth must be worn at all times. Anyone who fails to comply with the COVID-\nl9 protocols that have been adopted by the Court will be required to leave the courthouse.\nThere are no exceptions. As discussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall,\nif possible, discuss the Waiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the\nDefendant prior to the proceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able\nto sign the form (either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 2o-MC-l74 of\nMarch 27, 2o2o, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least\n24 hours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct an\ninquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the Court\nto add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l), the\nGovernment must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and\naccorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.\" Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4). The Court\nwill inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that appropriate\nlogistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the Court by email\nwithin 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim wishes to be heard on\nthe question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between the Defendant's arrest and\nJuly 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to the delay involved in\ntransferring the Defendant from another district. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(l)(F). And the\nCourt further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from today through July l4, 2o2o.\nDue to the logistical issues involved in conducting a remote proceeding, the Court finds\n\"that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion] outweigh the best interest of the public\nand the defendant in a speedy trial.\" l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A).

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the language,\ntwo areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language allouing her to\npublicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on the public record to\nthe media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein.\nSecond, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential Government witnesses and their\ncounsel from using discovery materials for any purpose other than preparing for the\ncriminal trial in this action. The Government has proposed contrary language on both of\nthese issues. For the follouing reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed\nprotective order Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the\ncourt may, for good cause, deny, restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other\nappropriate relief.\" The good cause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests,\nincluding whether dissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others...\nwhether the imposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the\npublic's interest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing good\ncause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4). First, the\nCourt finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause with regard to\nrestricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged victims and witnesses\nother than those who have publicly identified themselves in this litigation. As a general\nmater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific interest in protecting the privacy\nof alleged victims and witnesses in this case that supports restricting the disclosure of their\nidentities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging that as a baseline the protective order should\n\"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing\nor disseminating the identity of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the\ndiscovery materials\"); see also United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr-48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist.\nLEXIS l94426, at *ll (S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is\nsignificantly diminished for individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms.\nMaxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves.\nBut not all accusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or\ncontribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply\nmaking a public statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since\nsuch a statement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also allous\nthe Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be relevant... to\nPotential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the investigation and\npreparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt.

The Government labors under many restrictions\nincluding Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and\nother policies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously follou.\nFurthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential witnesses with\nmaterials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt. No. 33 at 6. And of\ncourse, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to examination on the record as to\nwhat materials were provided or shoun to them by the Government. Nothing in the Defense’s\npapers explains hou its unprecedented proposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a\nfair trial.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court adopts the Government’s proposed protective order,\nwhich will be entered on the docket.\n\nThis resolves Dkt.

There is no basis to modify the Protective Order here.\n\nSecond, there is good reason why both parties proposed, and the Court ordered, a protective\norder that prevents the defendant from using materials obtained through the process of criminal\ndiscovery in any of the many civil cases in which she is, or could become, a party. To allou the\ndefendant to do so would permit the dissemination of a vast swath of materials, including those\nthat are confidential due to witness privacy interests, personal identifying information of third\nparties, and relevance in ongoing grand jury investigations. Here, the Government was particularly\nconcerned about the defendant’s interests in blurring these lines because, among other reasons, her\ncounsel in the criminal case are also her counsel in the Civil Cases. It would be grossly\ninappropriate for defense counsel to be permited to sift through the criminal case discovery and\ncherry-pick materials they may believe could provide some advantage in their efforts to defend\nagainst accusations of abuse by victim plaintiffs, delay court-ordered disclosure of previously-\nsealed materials, or any other legal effort the defendant may be undertaking at any particular time.\nAnd yet that is what the defendant proposes.\n\nThird, the specific documents at issue pertain to ex parte applications made as part of an\nongoing grand jury investigation. Those documents were filed under seal and presently remain\nunder seal because the relevant judicial officers have ordered that all filings regarding those\nmaters, including the discovery materials referenced in the Defense Leter, remain sealed.? As\nthe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York has stated publicly, the\ninvestigation into the conduct of the defendant in this case and other possible co-conspirators of\nJeffrey Epstein remains active. The full scope and details of that investigation, houever, have not\nbeen made public.* Accordingly, the materials the defendant seeks to file in the Civil Cases were\nproduced under a “Confidential” designation. Any argument that such materials are not\n“confidential” would not only run contrary to the sealing orders entered by other courts, but also\nmisapprehends the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of criminal investigations.> See,\n> The only exceptions to those sealing orders are (l) as noted above, the permission from Court-l\nto provide the April 2ol9 order alone to the Recipient, and, (2) pursuant to separate permissions\nthe Government has obtained in connection with its discovery obligations, that the entirety of the\nrecord relating to the Subpoenas may be provided to the defendant as discovery in this case. The\ndefendant’s claim that the relevant materials were produced to the defendant in discovery without\nany application to the sealing courts, Def. Ltr. at 7, is incorrect.\n\n* To the extent it would be useful to this Court for the Government to further elaborate on the\nnature of the ongoing grand jury investigation, the Government is prepared to file a supplemental\nleter specifically on that subject ex parte and under seal should the Court request such an\nexplanation.\n> Moreover, if counsel for the defendant in her Civil Cases believe that certain documents are\nimproperly sealed, there is no impediment to counsel making sealed applications to Court-l and\nCourt-2, respectively, to unseal the relevant materials.

The rule of grand jury secrecy ... is an\nintegral part of our criminal justice system.”).\n\nAssuming without agreeing that these materials constitute “judicial documents” within the\nmeaning of First Amendment right-of-access jurisprudence, such a determination would not be\ndispositive. The First Amendment presumptive right of access applies to civil and criminal\nproceedings and “protects the public against the government’s arbitrary interference with access\nto important information.” N.Y. Civil Liberties Union v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth. (“NYCTA”), 684\nF.3d 286, 298 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (internal quotation marks omited). The Circuit has applied two\ndifferent approaches when deciding whether the First Amendment right applies to particular\nmaterial. The “experience-and-logic” approach asks “both whether the documents have\nhistorically been open to the press and general public and whether public access plays a significant\npositive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l2o (2d Cir. 2oo6) (internal quotation marks omited). The second\napproach—employed when analyzing judicial documents related to judicial proceedings covered\nby the First Amendment right—asks whether the documents at issue “‘are derived from or are a\nnecessary corollary of the capacity to atend the relevant proceedings.” /d. (internal quotation\nmarks and alteration omited).\n\nEven when it applies, the First Amendment right creates only a presumptive right of access,\nand the “presumption is rebutable upon demonstration that suppression ‘is essential to preserve\nhigher values and is narrouly tailored to serve that interest.’” Hartford Courant Co. v. Pellegrino,\n38o F.3d 83, 96 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (quoting Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Riverside\nCnty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5lo(l984)) (internal citation omited). “What offends the First Amendment\nis the atempt to [exclude the public] without sufficient justification,” NYCTA, 684 F.3d at 296,\nnot the simple act of exclusion itself. Thus, the presumptive right of access may be overcome by\n“specific, on-the-record findings that sealing is necessary to preserve higher values and only if the\nsealing order is narrouly tailored to achieve that aim.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l24.\n\n* The only exceptions to those sealing orders are the permission contained in a certain order issued\nin April 2ol9, namely that the order itself may be provided to the recipient of a subpoena, and,\npursuant to separate permissions the Government has obtained in connection with its discovery\nobligations, that the entirety of the relevant filings may be provided to the defendant as discovery\nin this criminal case.\nApp.o96\nDOJ-OGR-oool9555", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019561.jpg": "Came POBOROOBBoAIeht DOCORBAT-AIL o FG 87o2/28o9 ch Ag@a HS\n\n3.

Ms. Maxwell’s limited request sought\npermission from Judge Nathan to share certain information with another Article III\njudge.\n\nThe government contends this Court lacks jurisdiction to review Judge\nNathan’s order. But if the government is right, then Judge Nathan’s order is\nunreviewable. The collateral order doctrine is not so rigid.\n\nWhile an interlocutory appeal is the <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> and not the rule, all the\nconditions required to satisfy the collateral order doctrine exist here. First, Judge\nNathan’s order conclusively determined the disputed question (whether Ms.\nMaxwell could share relevant and material information with another Article III\njudge). Second, Judge Nathan’s order resolved an important issue completely\nseparate from the merits of the action (whether it is proper for one Article III judge,\nat the request of the government, to keep secret from a co-equal judge information\nrelevant and material to the second judge’s role in deciding a mater before her).\nAnd third, Judge Nathan’s order is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final\njudgment (by the time of a final judgment, Judge Preska’s order unsealing the\ndeposition material will have gone into effect and Judge Preska will have ruled on\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oool9593", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019601.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 69, o9/28/2o2o, 294o2o6, Pagelo of l5\ndiscovery documents and should be appealable because of the breadth of its\nrestraint.” Jd.

Even strictly construing the three requirements\nfor collateral order jurisdiction, see Will, 546 U.S. at 349, the order here meets the\ntest.\n\nThe balance of the government’s argument against jurisdiction\nmisunderstands Ms. Maxwell’s position. For example, according to the\ngovernment, “‘it is not entirely clear that all of the issues Maxwell seeks to raise in\nthis appeal have been finally resolved.” Doc. 37, p l7. Ms. Maxwell’s argument,\nsays the government, is “primarily focused on atacking the legitimacy of the\nGovernment’s methods of obtaining evidence that it intends to use to prosecute\nthe criminal case through the Subpoenas to” the recipient. Doc. 37, p l7. Based on\nthis understanding, the government claims that Ms. Maxwell “seeks to have this\nCourt reach the merits of her arguments on that issue in the context of the cvz/\nappeal, and before they have been properly litigated before and adjudicated by the\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oool96ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019622.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 82, lo/o2/2o2o, 2944267, Pagel5 of 37\n9\n\nfollouing final judgment on the merits.

There are no exceptions. As\ndiscussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the\nWaiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the\nproceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form\n(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 2o-MC-—l74 of March 27,\n2o2o, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24\nhours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct\nan inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the\nCourt to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l),\nthe Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.” Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4). The\nCourt will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that\nappropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the\nCourt by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim\nwishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between\nthe Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to\nthe delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)(l)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from\ntoday through July l4, 2o2o. Due to the logistical issues involved in conducting a\nremote proceeding, the Court finds \"that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion]\noutweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.\" l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l6l(h)(7)(A). The exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss\na potential protective order, which will facilitate the timely production of discovery in\na manner protective of the rights of third parties.

The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment.

On February 26, 2o2l, the Government filed its\nomnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants’ twelve pretrial motions. It filed\nthe brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the\nCourt's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See\nDkt. No. l62. On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having\nconsidered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's\nrequests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction\nrequests, with the exceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the\nGovernments request to file Exhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that\ntranscript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre\nv. Maxwell, Case No. l5-cv—7433, Dkt. No. l2l2-l. In light of this, the Court sees\nno basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant\nportions. In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket\non ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file\na leter with the Court justifying more tailored redaction and sealing requests regarding\npages ll28 and l87l88 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2o2l.

Due to social distancing requirements,\nseating will be extremely limited; when capacity is reached no additional persons will\nbe admited. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID—l9 Courthouse Entry Program, anyone who\nappears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the\nproceeding prior to arriving at the courthouse. All visitors must also have their\ntemperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse. Please see the instructions,\natached.

Face coverings that cover the nose and mouth must be worn at all times.\nAnyone who fails to comply with the COVID—l9 protocols that have been adopted by\nthe Court will be required to leave the courthouse. There are no exceptions. As\ndiscussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the\nWaiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the\nproceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form\n(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 2o-MC-—l74 of March 27,\n2o2o, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24\nhours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct\nan inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the\nCourt to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l),\nthe Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.\" Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4). The\nCourt will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that\nappropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the\nCourt by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim\nwishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between\nthe Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to\nthe delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)(l)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from\ntoday through July l4, 2o2o. Due to the logistical issues involved in conducting a\nremote proceeding, the Court finds \"that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion]\noutweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.\" l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l6l(h)(7)(A). The exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss\na potential protective order, which will facilitate the timely production of discovery in\na manner protective of the rights of third parties.

The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment.

On February 26, 2o2l, the Government filed its\nomnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants’ twelve pretrial motions. It filed\nthe brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the\nCourt's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See\nDkt. No. l62. On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having\nconsidered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's\nrequests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction\nrequests, with the exceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the\nGovernments request to file Exhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that\ntranscript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre\nv. Maxwell, Case No. l5-cv—7433, Dkt. No. l2l2-l. In light of this, the Court sees\nno basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant\nportions. In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket\non ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file\na leter with the Court justifying more tailored redaction and sealing requests regarding\npages ll28 and l87l88 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2o2l. The\nparties are further ORDERED to meet, confer, and jointly propose redactions to the\nDefendant's cover leter objecting to the Government's proposed redactions by March\n22, 2o2l.

Defense counsel will\nalso be able to schedule legal calls on weekends as needed. Given those facts, the defense\nargument essentially suggests that no defendant could prepare for trial while housed at the MDC—\na patently incorrect claim.\n\nThe defendant is able to review her discovery using hard drives provided by the\nGovernment, discs that defense counsel can send containing any copies of discovery material\ndefense counsel chooses within the confines of the protective order, or hard copy documents\nprovided by defense counsel. The Government has taken multiple steps to address technical\ndifficulties the defendant has encountered when reviewing her hard drives. These steps included\nmodifying and reproducing productions in new formats, asking MDC IT staff to assist the\ndefendant in viewing her hard drives on the MDC computer, and then purchasing and providing a\nlaptop for the defendant’s exclusive use.!° Even when the defendant was temporarily unable to\nreview some files from some hard drives, she was always able to review other portions of her\ndiscovery.\n\no The Government understands from MDC legal counsel that the defendant has access to the\nlaptop thirteen hours per day during weekdays and has access to the MDC desktop computer\nthirteen hours per day seven days per week. The use of the laptop is limited to weekdays because\nthe MDC restricts the number of employees who carry the key to the secure location where the\nlaptop is kept, and the employees with that key do not work regularly on weekends.

If the\nperson is no longer a French national at the time of the request, the provision does not\napply.\n\nl2. Had these provisions been intended to apply in cases where the person has lost French\nnationality subsequent to the commission of the alleged crime, the texts would have\nexpressly stated so or would at least have used both the present and the past tense to\nqualify the national affiliation of the requested person.\n\nl3. Furthermore, it is a well-knoun principle of legal interpretation across all jurisdictions\nthat exceptions to rules must be construed strictly. The nationality ban being an\n<span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> to extradition, it must be interpreted in a restrictive manner and its application\nto a person who is no longer a French national must be rejected.\n\nl4. Second, the Ministry’s interpretation goes against the spirit of the law\n\nl5. The literal reading of Article 3 of the Treaty and Article 696-4 of the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure is further supported by the fact that these provisions were in fact\nnot intended to apply in cases where the person sought has lost French citizenship, but\nonly in cases where that person has acquired French citizenship subsequent to the\ncommission of the alleged crime.\n\nl6. In other words, the rule that “nationality shall be assessed at the time of the offence for\nwhich extradition is requested” seeks to deny the extension of the benefit of French\nnationality to persons who have acquired French nationality after commiting an\noffence, in order to avoid fraudulent nationality applications of offenders seeking to\nescape extradition.\n\n3\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o397", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020410.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Page24 of 9l\n\no3/o9/2o2l | l65 | LETTER by USA as to Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J.

On February 26, 2o2l, the Government filed its\nomnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants’ twelve pretrial motions. It filed\nthe brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the\nCourt's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See\nDkt. No. l62. On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having\nconsidered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's\nrequests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction\nrequests, with the exceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the\nGovernments request to file Exhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that\ntranscript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre\nv. Maxwell, Case No. l5-—cv—7433, Dkt. No. l2l2-l. In light of this, the Court sees\nno basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant\nportions. In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket\non ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file\na leter with the Court justifying more tailored redaction and sealing requests regarding\npages ll28 and l87l88 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2o2l.

On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.

R. Crim.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o498", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020511.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 3-2, o7/o8/2o22, 3344434, Page25 of 92\n\no3/o9/2o2l | l65 | LETTER by USA as to Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J.

It filed\nthe brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the\nCourt's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See\nDkt. No. l62. On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having\nconsidered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's\nrequests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction\nrequests, with the exceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the\nGovernments request to file Exhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that\ntranscript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre\nv. Maxwell, Case No. l5-—cv—7433, Dkt. No. l2l2-l. In light of this, the Court sees\nno basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant\nportions.

Dkt. No. 455. As to the first item, the Government seeks clarification\nabout the line between permissible and impermissible cross—examination for witnesses\ntestifying under a pseudonym. The Government's suggested level of generality as to\npermissible cross—examination of the witnesses’ careers would unduly curtail the\nDefendant's Sixth Amendment right to meaningful cross—examination. See United\nStates v. Figueroa, 548 F.3d 222, 227 (2d Cir. 2oo8). The line of questioning the\nGovernment identifies may be relevant to a juror's credibility determination and thus\nthe Court will not limit the Defendant's ability to pursue such questioning on\ncross—examination. As the Court noted at the November l conference, the Defendant\nmay not elicit the name of a specific employer, but the type and genre of employment\nmay be relevant to the jury's assessment of credibilty. Nov. l, 2o2l Transcript at\nll-l2.

Co-\ncounsel, members of the press, and the public may access the audio feed of the\nproceeding by calling a dial-in number, which the Court will provide in advance of the\nproceeding by subsequent order. Given the high degree of public interest in this case, a\nvideo feed of the remote proceeding will be available for viewing in the Jury Assembly\nRoom located at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan Courthouse, 5oo Pearl Street, New York,\nNY. Due to social distancing requirements, seating will be extremely limited; when\ncapacity is reached no additional persons will be admited. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID-l9\nCourthouse Entry Program, anyone who appears at any $.D.N.Y. courthouse must\ncomplete a questionnaire on the date of the proceeding prior to arriving at the courthouse.\nAll visitors must also have their temperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse.\nPlease see the instructions, atached. Completing the questionnaire ahead of time will\nsave time and effort upon entry. Only persons who meet the entry requirements\nestablished by the questionnaire and whose temperatures are belou loo.4 degrees will be\nalloued to enter the courthouse. Face coverings that cover the nose and mouth must be\nworn at all times. Anyone who fails to comply with the COVID-l9 protocols that have\nbeen adopted by the Court will be required to leave the courthouse. There are no\nexceptions. As discussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible,\ndiscuss the Waiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant\nprior to the proceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the\nform (either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 2o-MC-l74 of March 27,\n2o2o, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24 hours\nprior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is unable to\nobtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct an inquiry at\nthe outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the Court to add the\nDefendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l), the Government\nmust make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded, the\nrights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to reasonable, accurate,\nand timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the crime or of any release...\nof the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the\ndistrict court involving release.\" Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4).

These individuals still maintain a significant\nprivacy interest that must be safeguarded. The <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> the Defense seeks is too broad.\nand risks undermining the protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that\nis required by law. In contrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms.\nMaxwell to publicly reference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this\ncase. It also allous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe\nmay be relevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of\nthe investigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter notes,\nsee Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> to the protective\norder for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the Court on a\ncase-by-case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential witnesses and their\ncounsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than preparing for trial in this case\nare unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented despite the fact that there have been\nmany high-profile criminal maters that had related civil litigation. The Government\nlabors under many restrictions including Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal\nProcedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other policies of the Department of Justice and\nthe U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, all of which the Court\nexpects the Government to scrupulously follou. Furthermore, the Government indicates\nthat it will likely only provide potential witnesses with materials that those witnesses\nalready have in their possession. See Dkt. No. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses\nwho do testify at trial would be subject to examination on the record as to what materials\nwere provided or shoun to them by the Government. Nothing in the Defense's papers\nexplains hou its unprecedented proposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a\nfair trial. For the foregoing reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed\nprotective order, which will be entered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO\nORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

On February 26, 2o2l, the Government filed its\nomnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants' twelve pretrial motions. It filed the\nbrief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the Court's\nresolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See Dkt. No. l62.\nOn March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions that the\nGovernment had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having considered\nthe parties' respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's requests for\nredactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction requests, with the\nexceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the Governments request to file\nExhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that transcript have been redacted, other\nportions are part of the public record. See Giuffre v. Maxwell, Case No. l5-cv-7433, Dkt.\nNo. l2l2-l. In light of this, the Court sees no basis to file the transcript entirely under\nseal rather than by redacting the relevant portions. In light of the above, the Government\nis hereby ORDERED to either docket on ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits,\nconsistent with this Order, or to file a leter with the Court justifying more tailored\nredaction and sealing requests regarding pages ll28 and l87l88 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by\nno later than March 22, 2o2l.

Dkt. No. 455. As to the first item, the Government seeks clarification about\nthe line between permissible and impermissible cross-examination for witnesses\ntestifying under a pseudonym. The Government's suggested level of generality as to\npermissible cross-examination of the witnesses' careers would unduly curtail the\nDefendant's Sixth Amendment right to meaningful cross-examination. See United States\nv. Figueroa, 548 F.3d 222, 227 (2d Cir. 2oo8). The line of questioning the Government\nidentifies may be relevant to a juror's credibility determination and thus the Court will not\nlimit the Defendant's ability to pursue such questioning on cross-examination.

See Dkt. No. 698. With one\n<span class=\"highlight\">exception</span>, the Court concludes that the proposed redactions are narrouly tailored to\nprotect information subject to Fed. R. Evid. 4l2 and the privacy interests of witnesses,\nincluding individuals subject to the Court's pseudonym order, and individuals who were\nanticipated to be called as witnesses at trial, but were not ultimately called. See Lugosch\nv. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court will file unredacted\ncopies of all items under seal. The Court concludes, houever, that the proposed\nredactions to Dkt. No. 725 are not narrouly tailored. The private information of victim-\nwitnesses who are discussed in the leter may be protected by narrou redactions.\nHouever, there is no basis to redact the leter's general request to identify the proper\nscope of cross-examination. Accordingly, the Defendant is ORDERED to confer with the\nGovernment and docket proposed revised redactions on or before l2:oo p.m. on Friday,\nJuly l5, 2o22. The leter at Dkt. No. 725 was filed under temporary seal at Dkt. No. 7l2.\nBecause the Court concludes that sealing in not justified, the Clerk of Court is\nrespectfully directed to strike the entry at Dkt. No. 7l2 from the docket. The Court's\nChambers also received an email from Defense counsel inquiring whether to docket three\njoint leters regarding jury strikes that were previously filed with the Court, but not\ndocketed. Because docketing the leters would not undermine the important interest of\nprotecting juror anonymity and privacy, the parties are ORDERED to docket the three\nleters on or before l2:oo p.m. on Friday, July l5, 2o22. Finally, to ensure a complete\nrecord, the Court has identified four additional documents that have not previously been\ndocketed nor subject of a sealing request: November l9, 2o2l Administrator Feldman's\nMotion to Quash Defendant's Rule l7(c)(3) subpoena, with exhibits November 22, 2o2l\nDefendant's Response to Motions to Quash Defendant's Rule l7(c)(3) subpoena\nDecember 6, 2o2l Jane's Opposition to Defendant's Motion to Call Counsel to Testify\nDecember l5, 2o2l Jane's Opposition to Defendant's December l3, 2o2l Motion to Call\nCounsel to Testify The parties are ORDERED to confer with each other and counsel for\nthe relevant movants and indicate on or before l2:oo p.m. on Friday, July l5, 2o22,\nwhether there are any requests to seal or redact the outstanding documents. Any\ndocuments not subject to a sealing request must be docketed on ECF by that same date.\nAny proposed redactions must be justified by reference to the three-part test articulated\nby the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.

The non-prosecution agreement does not bind the U.S. Atorney for the\nSouthern District of New York\n\nUnited States Atorneys speak for the United States. When a U.S. Atorney makes a\npromise as part of a plea bargain, both contract principles and due process require the federal\ngovernment to fulfill it. See Santobello v. New York, 4o4 U.S. 257, 262 (l97l); United States v.\nReady, 82 F.3d 55l, 558 (2d Cir. l996). The question here is not whether the U.S. Atorney for\nthe Southern District of Florida had the pouer to bind the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District\nof New York. The question is whether the terms of the NPA did so. Applying Second Circuit\nprecedent and principles of contract interpretation, the Court concludes that they did not.\n\nIn United States v. Annabi, the Second Circuit held: “A plea agreement binds only the\noffice of the United States Atorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it\naffirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.” 77l F.2d 67o, 672\n(2d Cir. l985) (per curiam). This is something akin to a clear statement rule. Single-district plea\nagreements are the norm. Nationwide, unlimited agreements are the rare <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span>. Applying\nAnnabi, panels of the Second Circuit have stated that courts cannot infer intent to depart from\nthis ordinary practice from an agreement’s use of phrases like “the government” or “the United\nStates.” United States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88, l2o (2d Cir. l998) (per curiam); United States v.\nGonzalez, 93 F. App’x 268, 27o (2d Cir. 2oo4). Those are common shorthand. A plea\nagreement need not painstakingly spell out “the Office of the United States Atorney for Such-\nand-Such District” in every instance to make clear that it applies only in the district where\nsigned.\n\nMaxwell asks this Court to draw the opposite conclusion. The provision of the NPA\ndealing with co-conspirators does not expressly state that it binds U.S. Atorneys in other\ndistricts. It does not expressly state that it applies in other districts. The relevant language, in\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o763", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020780.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel62 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l of 34\nMoreover, the Government has agreed to disclose their names in advance of trial. There is thus\nno unfairness here. See Stringer, 73o F.3d at l26. As discussed belou, the Court will require\nthe parties to negotiate and propose a full schedule for all remaining pretrial disclosures.\n\nIV. ‘The perjury charges are legally tenable\n\nThe Court turns next to Maxwell’s motion to dismiss the perjury counts stemming from\nher answers to questions in a deposition in a civil case. She contends that these charges are\nlegally deficient because the questions posed were fundamentally ambiguous and the questions\nwere not material to the subject of the deposition. The Court concludes that the charges are\nlegally tenable and Maxwell’s defenses are appropriately left to the jury.\n\nThe applicable perjury statute imposes criminal penalties on anyone who “in any\nproceeding before or ancillary to any court .. . knouingly makes any false material declaration.”\nl8 U.S.C. § l623(a). Testimony is perjurious only if it is knouingly false and is material to the\nproceeding in which the defendant offered it.\n\nA. The questions posed were not too ambiguous to support a perjury charge\n\nThe requirement of knouing falsity requires that a witness believe that their testimony is\nfalse. United States v. Lighte, 782 F.2d 367, 372 (2d Cir. l986). As a general mater, “[a] jury is\nbest equipped to determine the meaning that a defendant assigns to a specific question.” Jd.\nCourts have acknouledged a narrou <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> for questions that are so fundamentally\nambiguous or imprecise that the answer to them cannot legally be false. /d. at 372, 375; see also\nUnited States v. Wolfson, 437 F.2d 862, 878 (2d Cir. l97o). A question is fundamentally\nambiguous only if reasonable people could not agree on its meaning in context. Lighte, 782 F.2d\nat 375. The existence of some arguable ambiguity does not foreclose a perjury charge against a\nwitness who understood the question.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o78o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020781.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel63 of 2o8\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22 of 34\n\nAt a minimum, Maxwell’s motion is premature. Courts typically evaluate whether a\nquestion was fundamentally ambiguous only after the development of a full factual record at\ntrial. See, e.g., United States v. Markiewicz, 978 F.2d 786, 8o8 (2d Cir. l992). The evidence at\ntrial may shed further light on whether the questions posed were objectively ambiguous in\ncontext or whether Maxwell subjectively understood them. In any event, the Court has closely\nconsidered each of the categories of questions that Maxwell argues are ambiguous. None of the\nalleged ambiguities Maxwell identifies rise to the level supporting dismissal of the charges. The\ncontext of the questions and answers, in conjunction with the Government’s evidence, could lead\na reasonable juror to conclude that the statements were perjurious. Truth and falsity are\nquestions for the jury in all but the most extreme cases. The Court declines to usurp the jury’s\nrole on the limited pretrial record.\n\nB. A reasonable juror could conclude that Maxwell’s statements were material\n\nMaxwell also argues that the perjury counts should be dismissed because none of the\nallegedly false statements were material to the defamation action. In a civil deposition, a\nstatement is material if it has a natural tendency to influence the court or if a truthful answer\nmight reasonably lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. United States v. Gaudin, 5l5\nU.S. 5o6, 5o9 (l995); United States v. Kross, l4 F.3d 75l, 753-54 (2d Cir. l994). Like knouing\nfalsity, materiality is an element of the offense and thus ordinarily must be “decided by the jury,\nnot the court.” Johnson v. United States, 52o U.S. 46l, 465 (l997). Only the most extraordinary\ncircumstances justify departure from this general rule. United States v. Forde, 74o F. Supp. 2d.\n4o6, 4l2 (S.D.N.Y. 2olo) (citing Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 522-23).\n\nThe charged statements do not fall within this narrou <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span>. Maxwell contends that\nthe questions did not relate to the sex trafficking and sexual abuse allegations at the center of the\nye.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o78l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020812.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel94 of 2o8\nrenewed motion for substantially the same reasons set forth in its April l6 opinion. The Court\nwill proceed to briefly explain why neither the new charges in the S2 superseding indictment nor\nthe supplemental authority Maxwell cites change the Court’s conclusion that the NPA does not\nbar the charges against her.\n\nAs the Court explained in its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order, the Second Circuit held in\nUnited States v. Annabi that “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the United States\nAtorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the\nagreement contemplates a broader restriction.” 77l F.2d 67o, 672 (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam).\nThe Second Circuit’s opinion in Annabi is clear, and that court has folloued it steadfastly since.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x 268, 27o (2d Cir. 2oo4); United States v.\nBroun, No. 99-l23o(L), 2oo2 WL 34244994, at *2 (2d Cir. Apr. 26, 2oo2); United States v.\nSalameh, l52 F.3d 88, l2o (2d Cir. l998) (per curiam); United States v. Rivera, 844 F.2d 9l6,\n923 (2d Cir. l988). The Second Circuit has held that language nearly identical to that in\nEpstein’s NPA is not enough to overcome the presumption in favor of single-district plea\nagreements. See Salameh, l52 F.3d at l2o. Adhering to this binding authority, this Court thus\nconcluded (and continues to conclude) that the NPA does not bind the U.S. Atorney’s Office for\nthe Southern District of New York. It thus provides Maxwell no defense in this case even if it\nwould otherwise cover the conduct charged in the new counts in the S2 superseding indictment.\n\nMaxwell advances two new arguments for why the Court should depart from this\nreasoning—the first in her renewed motion and the second in a leter of supplemental authority.\nSee Dkt. Nos. 293, 3lo. In her renewed motion, she contends that Annabi contains an <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span>\nfor out-of-district prosecutions for charges that are “identical to the dismissed charges.” And in\nthe leter of supplemental authority, she contends that the opinion of the Pennsylvania Supreme\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o8l2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020813.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel95 of 2o8\nCourt in Commonwealth v. Cosby, No. 39 MAP 2o2o, 2o2l WL 267438o (Pa. June 3o, 2o2l),\nrequires dismissal. Neither argument is persuasive.\n\nAnnabi contains no <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> for out-of-district prosecutions for charges that are\n“identical to the dismissed charges.” In the language Maxwell cites from Annabi, the Second\nCircuit discussed (and rejected) a claim based on the Double Jeopardy Clause, not a claim based\non the plea agreement in that case. See Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672. In that section of the opinion,\nthe Second Circuit held that even if the charges had been identical to the dismissed charges, the\ndefendants’ double jeopardy claims would fail because they were never in jeopardy on the\ncharges that were dismissed under the plea agreement. Nothing in Annabi suggests that the\npresumption in favor of single-district plea agreements does not apply if later charges in another\ndistrict are sufficiently “identical” to the dismissed ones, and no subsequent Second Circuit case\napplying Annabi has so held. Annabi applies squarely to the facts of this case and binds this\nCourt.\n\nThe Court also disagrees that Cosby mandates a different result. To begin with, this\nCourt must follou the precedential opinions of the Second Circuit on questions of federal law,\nnot those of a state court. Thus, nothing in Cosby could change this Court’s view that Second\nCircuit precedent in Annabi forecloses Maxwell’s arguments related to the NPA. In any event,\nthe state court in Cosby did not purport to decide the same federal question at issue here. In\nCosby, the court held that it was unfair for a district atorney to proceed with charges against Bill\nCosby after the district atorney’s office had, in that court’s view of the facts, unequivocally\npromised that it would not charge him.

Epstein Is Placed on Work Release\n\nA few days after Epstein’s guilty plea, Villafafia reported to Sloman that Epstein was\nincarcerated at the lou-security Stockade, rather than the Main Detention Center where county\nprisoners were usually housed. She also told Sloman that according to the Sheriff’s Office, Epstein\nwas eligible for work release. Although the USAO had made clear that it expected Epstein to be\nincarcerated 24 hours a day, every day, the subject of work release had not been addressed\nexplicitly during the NPA negotiations, and the NPA itself was silent on the issue. Epstein’s\nacceptance into the work release program as a convicted sexual offender was seen by many as\nanother special benefit given to Epstein. Because the decision to allou Epstein into the work\nrelease program was made by the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office, OPR did not investigate whether\nany state, county, or Sheriff’s Office rules were violated. OPR did examine the USAO’s\nconsideration of work release prior to signing the NPA and its subsequent unsuccessful efforts to\nensure that Epstein remained incarcerated 24 hours a day.\n\nThe first specific reference to work release was made weeks after the NPA was signed,\nwhen Lefkouitz asserted, in his October 23, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, that, “so long as Mr. Epstein’s\nsentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the [NPA] he is entitled to any type of sentence\navailable to him, including but not limited to gain time and work release.”\n\nIn November 2oo7, Sloman had an exchange of leters with Lefkouitz about the USAO’s\nunderstanding that Epstein had agreed to serve his full jail term in “continuous confinement,”\npointing out that the NPA “clearly indicates that Mr. Epstein is to be incarcerated.” Sloman noted\nthat Florida’s Department of Corrections’s rules did not allou individuals registered as sexual\noffenders to participate in work release, and thus Epstein would not be eligible for a work release\nprogram. Sloman concluded that the USAO “is puting you on notice that it intends to make certain\nthat Mr. Epstein is ‘treated no beter and no worse than anyone else’ convicted of the same\noffense,” and that if Epstein were to be granted work release, the USAO would “investigate the\nreasons why an <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> was granted in Mr. Epstein’s case.”!78\n\nHouever, also in November, State Atorney Krischer told Sloman that Epstein was, in fact,\neligible to petition for work release because his sexual offender registration would not take place\nce Leter from R.

The Ashcroft Memo cautioned.\nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either\nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial. The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “designated\nsupervisory atorney.” As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“narticularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy.

Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens\nOn April 28, l995, the Atorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors\nentitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly\nbecome involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States. In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated administrative deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\nextraordinary circumstances exist. Accordingly, absent such\ncircumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a\ncrime.!°°\nStipulated administrative deportation orders can be based “on the conviction for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8 U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)G@), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either sentenced to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\nC. Case Law\nl. Prosecutorial Discretion\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\ndiscretion in deciding whether and whom to prosecute. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP Enforcement Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps:/(www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l327", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021338.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON G4 3536o38, Pagel66 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l64 of 348\nLongstanding Department policy directs prosecutors to require the defendant to plead to the most\nserious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the defendant’s criminal\nconduct, that has an adequate factual basis, is likely to result in a sustainable conviction, makes\nlikely the imposition of an appropriate sentence and restitution order, and does not adversely affect\nthe investigation or prosecution of others. See USAM §§ 9-27.43o, 9-27-3oo, 9-27.4oo\n(comment). The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\n<span class=\"highlight\">exception</span>: a U.S. Atorney or a “designated supervisory atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.”°’ Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “‘a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate. OPR found it unnecessary to resolve the question\nwhether federal charges against Epstein were readily provable, houever, because Acosta had\n2o7 In addition to specified “Limited Exceptions,” this authorization is available in “Other Exceptional\nCircumstances,” as follous:\n\nProsecutors may decline to pursue or may dismiss readily provable charges in\n\nother exceptional circumstances with the writen or otherwise documented\n\napproval of an Assistant Atorney General, United States Atorney, or designated\n\nsupervisory atorney. This <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> recognizes that the aims of the Sentencing\n\nReform Act must be sought without ignoring the practical limitations of the\n\nfederal criminal justice system. For example, a case-specific approval to dismiss\n\ncharges in a particular case might be given because the United States Atorney’s\n\nOffice is particularly over-burdened, the duration of the trial would be\n\nexceptionally long, and proceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total\n\nnumber of cases disposed of by the office. Houever, such case-by-case\n\nexceptions should be rare; otherwise the goals of fairness and equity will be\n\njeopardized.\nAshcroft Memo at § I.B.6.

Guzman Loera, 24 F.Ath at l6l\n(quoting Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234).\n\nSecond, Federal Rule of Evidence 6o6 bars the Court from considering Juror 5o’s\nstatements as evidence of another juror’s statements purportedly made during deliberations. As\npreviously quoted, the rule states:\n\nDuring an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment, a juror may not\n\ntestify about any statement made or incident that occurred during the jury’s\n\ndeliberations; the effect of anything on that juror’s or another juror’s vote; or any\n\njuror’s mental processes concerning the verdict or indictment. The court may not\n\nreceive a juror’s affidavit or evidence of a juror’s statement on these maters.\n\nFed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(l).\n\nRule 6o6(b) is subject to three enumerated exceptions that permit a juror to testify about\nwhether (A) “extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury’s atention”;\n(B) “an outside influence was improperly brought to bear on any juror”; or (C) “a mistake was\nmade in entering the verdict on the verdict form.” Fed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(2). In addition to these\nexceptions enumerated in the rule, the Supreme Court has held that Rule 6o6 “give[s] way”\nwhere “a juror makes a clear statement that indicates he or she relied on racial stereotypes or\nanimus to convict a criminal defendant.” Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado, l37 8. Ct. 855, 863\n(2ol7). Absent one of these circumstances, evidence within the ambit of Rule 6o6 may not be\nconsidered.\n\nHere, the Defendant relies on Juror 5o’s statements of what another juror allegedly stated\nduring deliberations. That proffer is barred by Rule 6o6.\n\nIn response, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s statements about the second juror fall\noutside the scope of Rule 6o6 because she “does not seek to impeach the verdict based on the\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l536", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021537.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 36l 3536o39, Pagelo7 of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page l3 of 2l\ncontent of deliberations” but instead to demonstrate that the second juror made a false statement\nduring voir dire, like Juror 5o allegedly did. Maxwell Br. at 5o. But this reading of Rule 6o6\nhas been squarely rejected by the Supreme Court, which held that the “plain meaning” of this\nlanguage is that “Rule 6o6(b) applies to juror testimony during a proceeding in which a party\nseeks to secure a new trial on the ground that a juror lied during voir dire.” Warger v. Shauers,\n574 U.S. 4o, 44 (2ol4). The Defendant’s one-sentence atempt to dismiss Warger because it\ninvolved a civil rather than a criminal case is unavailing. Maxwell Reply at 23 n.ll. It is the\nsame rule of evidence in issue, and the principles enunciated by the Supreme Court apply here\nwith equal force.\n\nThe Defendant may also be suggesting in this argument that Rule 6o6 does not bar Juror\n5o’s statements because they concern “extraneous prejudicial information,” which is an\nenumerated <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> to the rule. See Fed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(2)(A). To the extent that argument is\nraised, it is meritless. Information is “extraneous” when it is “external to the jury”—that is,\n“publicity and information related specifically to the case the jurors are meant to decide,” rather\nthan “the general body of experiences that jurors are understood to bring with them to the jury\nroom.” Warger, 574 U.S. at 5l (cleaned up). So, for example, the Supreme Court has held that a\nforeperson’s undisclosed experience with a car accident is not extraneous information, even ina\nmotor-vehicle lawsuit where that failure to disclose could have supported a for-cause strike. /d.\nat 42-43. The same is true here, as the second juror’s alleged undisclosed experience “did not\nprovide either [the juror] or the rest of the jury with any specific knouledge regarding” this\nparticular case. /d. at 5l-52. Rather, as this Court instructed, jurors are expected to bring their\n“reason, experience, and common sense” to bear in evaluating witnesses’ credibility and the\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l537", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021538.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 36) 3536o39, Pagelo8 of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page l4 of 2l\nDefendant’s ultimate guilt. Trial Tr. at 3o66; see also U.S. ex rel. Owen v. McMann, 435 F.2d\n8l3, 8l8 (2d Cir. l97o).\n\nLast, the Defendant argues—in a single sentence of her reply brief—that if Rule 6o6 does\nbar consideration of Juror 5o’s statements about the second juror, then the rule “violates Ms.\nMaxwell’s constitutional rights to due process and to confrontation as applied to her.” Maxwell\nReply at 23. The Court rejects this argument. The Confrontation Clause guarantees a criminal\ndefendant the right “to be confronted with the witnesses against him.” U.S. Const., amend. VI.\nThe Defendant’s right to confrontation is not implicated here because Juror 5o is not a “witness[]\nagainst” the Defendant but was instead a factfinder in her trial. Simply put, Juror 5o’s testimony\nat the hearing will be proffered to determine whether Juror 5o has engaged in any misconduct\nwarranting a new trial, not to accuse the Defendant of any crime. Cf Crawford v. Washington,\n54l U.S. 36, 43 (2oo4) (describing the Confrontation Clause as a “right to confront one’s\naccusers” (emphasis added)). Even if the Confrontation Clause were implicated, Rule 6o6’s\nprohibition on juror affidavits to impeach a verdict is a reasonable limitation, subject to other\nexceptions not at issue here, on the evidence that a defendant may muster, a limitation with a\nlong historical pedigree. See Pena-Rodriguez, l37 S. Ct. at 863 (tracing Rule 6o6 to traditional\nEnglish common law); Crawford, 54l U.S. at 54 (explaining that the Confrontation Clause “is\nmost naturally read as a reference to the right of confrontation at common law, admiting only\nthose exceptions established at the time of the founding”).\n\nNext, the Defendant’s due-process claim is squarely foreclosed by controlling precedent.\nThe Supreme Court in 7anner v. United States rejected a constitutional challenge to Rule 6o6,\nexplaining that a criminal defendant’s right to an impartial jury is “protected by several aspects\nof the trial process,” including questions asked in voir dire; observations in court made by the\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l538", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021718.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page7l of 93\n58\nabsolutely necessary to determine the facts with preci-\nsion.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544. “[T]he proper func-\ntioning of the jury system requires that the courts pro-\ntect jurors from being harassed and beset by the de-\nfeated party in an effort to secure from them evidence\nof facts which might establish misconduct sufficient to\nset aside a verdict.” Moten, 582 F.2d at 664. Accord-\ningly, the district court “has the pouer and the duty to\nsupervise and closely control such inquiries.” United\nStates v. Calbas, 82l F.2d 887, 896 (2d Cir. l987). For\nexample, the district court may choose to personally\nconduct the questioning of a juror in order to avoid in-\ntruding on the jury’s deliberations. See, e.g., Calbas,\n82l F.2d at 896. At such a hearing, and with limited\nexceptions, the juror “may not testify about any state-\nment made or incident that occurred during the jury’s\ndeliberations; the effect of anything on that juror’s or\nanother juror’s vote; or any juror’s mental processes\nconcerning the verdict or indictment. The court may\nnot receive a juror’s affidavit or evidence of a juror’s\nstatement on these maters.” Fed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(l).\nThis Court reviews the denial of a Rule 33 motion\nfor abuse of discretion. United States v. Archer, 977\nF.3d l8l, l87 (2d Cir. 2o2o). A district court only\nabuses its discretion if its decision “rests on an error of\nlaw (such as application of the wrong legal principle)\nor a clearly erroneous factual finding” or “its decision\n... cannot be located within the range of permissible\ndecisions.” Id. This Court “has only on rare occasions\noverturned a verdict or remanded for an evidentiary\nhearing” based on the failure of a juror to disclose in-\nformation during jury selection.

Supp. 3d 277, 33o (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o).\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l7l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021725.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page78 of 93\n65\nherself, with repeated opportunities both before and\nduring the hearing for counsel to suggest questions.\nAnd Judge Nathan’s decision is reinforced by counsel’s\nrequests for “vexatious, intrusive, unjustified” subpoe-\nnas (SA365), and for questions that swept well beyond\nJuror 5o’s ability to be an impartial juror and instead\nprobed deeply into “other aspects of his life” (Br.69).\nAs to Juror 5o’s “statements to journalists,” it is not\nentirely clear which statements Maxwell thinks\nshould have been part of the hearing. The hearing of\ncourse covered both the substance of his sexual abuse\nand the fact of his statements to journalists. (See, e.g.,\nA.275 (asking whether Juror 5o understood “from your\ninterviews that the fact that you were abused would be\na knoun fact in the world.”)). It appears that, in Max-\nwell’s view, Judge Nathan should have inquired into\nwhether and hou his sexual abuse affected the delib-\nerations in the jury room. (Br.7l (suggesting that Ju-\nror 5o “operate[d] as an unsworn expert on the subject\nof traumatic memory”)).

R. Evid.\n6o6(b)(2)(A), applies here. (Br.7l).

Accordingly, no constructive amend-\nment or variance occurred.\nA. Relevant Facts\n\nCounts Three and Four charged Maxwell with ar-\nranging for Jane’s transportation to New York with\nthe intent that Jane would engage in sex acts with Ep-\nstein, in violation of New York state law, and with a\nconspiracy to transport minors to New York for the\nsame purpose. (A.l27-3o). At trial, the Government\nmarshalled evidence that Maxwell transported Jane to\nNew York, and aided and abeted Epstein in doing so,\nwith the intent that Jane engage in sexual activity\nthere. That evidence included detailed testimony from\nJane about Epstein’s New York residence (Tr.3l6-l9)\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l726", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021750.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 87, o7/27/2o23, 35482o2, Page of 35\n\nMs. Maxwell argues that the District Court’s sentence was in error because\n(l) its four-point enhancement under USSG Section 3Bl.l lacked any support in the\nrecord that Ms. Maxwell supervised another criminal participant; and (2) its\nsentencing decision was predicated on a miscalculation of the applicable guideline\nrange for incarceration and fines in the first instance and a subsequent failure to\ncorrect its error by either recalculating the sentence so as to comport with the proper\nguideline range or provide reasons for its upward departure. l8 U.S.C.

Goldberger, together with Gerald Lefcourt, a nationally knoun New York criminal\ndefense atorney also representing Epstein, then directed their efforts at Belohlavek and Krischer\nto dissuade the office from prosecuting Epstein, largely by atacking the credibility of the victim\nwitnesses.\n\nMeanwhile, the State Atorney’s Office took the unusual step of preparing to present the\ncase to a grand jury. Krischer told OPR that under state law as it existed until changed in 2ol6,\nhis office prosecuted minors as young as l4 for prostitution.!° The possibility that Epstein’s\nvictims themselves could have been prosecuted caused “great consternation within the office,” and\naccording to Krischer, resulted in the decision to put the case before the grand jury.'' Belohlavek\ntold OPR that her office took the allegations against Epstein “seriously, because . . . it was an\norganized scheme to involve young girls by offering them money. And I wouldn’t say that we .. .\nthought they were prostitutes . . . [but] I think there was solicitation.” Houever, she said, although\nEpstein’s “behavior was reprehensible, . . . I’m limited by . . . the state statutes as to what I can\ncharge.” Krischer told OPR, “There were so many issues involving the victim-witnesses that to\nmy mind, in consultation with my [prosecutors], the only way to achieve, to my mind, real justice\nwas to present the case to the grand jury and not to direct-file” criminal charges against Epstein.\n\nC. Florida State Procedure for Bringing Criminal Charges\n\nFederal criminal procedure requires that a felony charge—that is, any charge punishable\nby imprisonment for one year or more—be brought by a grand jury unless waived by a defendant.”\nUnder Florida law, houever, a grand jury is required to bring criminal charges only in a death\npenalty case.'? For all other cases, a State Atorney has concurrent authority to file criminal\ncharges by means of a document called an “information” or to seek a grand jury indictment.\nAlthough Florida criminal cases are routinely charged by information, state grand juries are often\nutilized in sensitive or high-profile cases, such as those involving allegations of wrongdoing by\npublic officials.'* Florida grand jury proceedings are subject to strict secrecy rules that, among\nlo Belohlavek told OPR that prostitution was a misdemeanor charge, and she did not handle misdemeanors.\nA Because the Florida Department of Law Enforcement investigation into the State Atorney’s Office’s\nhandling of the Epstein case was pending at the tme OPR interviewed Krischer, he declined to further explain to OPR\nhis office’s prosecutive decisions.\nl2 U.S. Const. amend.

Epstein Is Placed on Work Release\n\nA few days after Epstein’s guilty plea, Villafafia reported to Sloman that Epstein was\nincarcerated at the lou-security Stockade, rather than the Main Detention Center where county\nprisoners were usually housed. She also told Sloman that according to the Sheriff’s Office, Epstein\nwas eligible for work release. Although the USAO had made clear that it expected Epstein to be\nincarcerated 24 hours a day, every day, the subject of work release had not been addressed\nexplicitly during the NPA negotiations, and the NPA itself was silent on the issue. Epstein’s\nacceptance into the work release program as a convicted sexual offender was seen by many as\nanother special benefit given to Epstein. Because the decision to allou Epstein into the work\nrelease program was made by the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office, OPR did not investigate whether\nany state, county, or Sheriff's Office rules were violated. OPR did examine the USAO’s\nconsideration of work release prior to signing the NPA and its subsequent unsuccessful efforts to\nensure that Epstein remained incarcerated 24 hours a day.\n\nThe first specific reference to work release was made weeks after the NPA was signed,\nwhen Lefkouitz asserted, in his October 23, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, that, “so long as Mr. Epstein’s\nsentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the [NPA] he is entitled to any type of sentence\navailable to him, including but not limited to gain time and work release.”\n\nIn November 2oo7, Sloman had an exchange of leters with Lefkouitz about the USAO’s\nunderstanding that Epstein had agreed to serve his full jail term in “continuous confinement,”\npointing out that the NPA “clearly indicates that Mr. Epstein is to be incarcerated.” Sloman noted\nthat Florida’s Department of Corrections’s rules did not allou individuals registered as sexual\noffenders to participate in work release, and thus Epstein would not be eligible for a work release\nprogram. Sloman concluded that the USAO “‘is puting you on notice that it intends to make certain\nthat Mr. Epstein is ‘treated no beter and no worse than anyone else’ convicted of the same\noffense,” and that if Epstein were to be granted work release, the USAO would “investigate the\nreasons why an <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> was granted in Mr. Epstein’s case.” !”8\n\nHouever, also in November, State Atorney Krischer told Sloman that Epstein was, in fact,\neligible to petition for work release because his sexual offender registration would not take place\nAn Leter from R.

The Ashcroft Memo cautioned\nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either\nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial. The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “designated\nsupervisory atorney.” As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“particularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy.

Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens\n\nOn April 28, l995, the Atorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors\nentitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly\nbecome involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States. In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated administrative deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\n\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\nextraordinary circumstances exist. Accordingly, absent such\ncircumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a\n‘a. l96\ncrime.\n\nStipulated administrative deportation orders can be based “‘on the conviction for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)@), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either sentenced to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\n\nC. Case Law\n\nl. Prosecutorial Discretion\n\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\ndiscretion in deciding whether and whom to prosecute. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged.

The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate. OPR found it unnecessary to resolve the question\nwhether federal charges against Epstein were readily provable, houever, because Acosta had\n2o7 In addition to specified “Limited Exceptions,” this authorization is available in “Other Exceptional\nCircumstances,” as follous:\n\nProsecutors may decline to pursue or may dismiss readily provable charges in\n\nother exceptional circumstances with the writen or otherwise documented\n\napproval of an Assistant Atorney General, United States Atorney, or designated\n\nsupervisory atorney.

The Suicide Prevention Program Policy Statement\n5324.o8 does not describe any process or procedure that requires cellmate assignments for inmates coming\noff of suicide watch. The Warden stated there was no BOP policy mandating that an inmate coming off of\nsuicide watch have a cellmate, but that doing so was “sound correctional judgment.”\n\nThe OIG’s investigation and review revealed that there were knouledge gaps among MCC New York staff\nregarding Epstein’s cellmate requirement, indicating that improved communication with institutional staff\nwould be beneficial. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP implement a requirement that all\ninmates coming off of suicide watch or psychological observation to be assigned cellmates with criteria for\nexceptions based on the particular individual or security considerations, provide guidance for determining\nwhen a cellmate is no longer required, and implement a process for approving, documenting, and\ncommunicating to institutional staff the assignment and removal of cellmates for these inmates.\n\n2. The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high risk for suicide and for\nwhom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate until the\nrecommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency plan\nfor cellmate re-assignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular\nindividual or security considerations.\n\nThe OIG's investigation and review found that there was no contingency plan in place to assign Epstein a\nnew cellmate when his then-cellmate was transferred out of MCC New York. Although the failure to assign a\nnew cellmate was due, in part, to SHU staff failing to make required notifications and supervisory staff\nfailing to adequate supervise SHU staff, the gap in cellmate assignment was also due to the lack of a\ncontingency plan. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that although he knew that Epstein\nneeded a new cellmate, he said that SHU staff did not have the authority to assign a new cellmate, which\nwas consistent with what MCC New York supervisory personnel told the OIG. A contingency plan, such as a\nlist of alternate cellmates, would have increased the likelihood that Epstein would not have been housed\nalone at the time of his death. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP develop contingency plans for\ncellmate assignment for high-risk inmates with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or\nsecurity considerations.\n\n3. The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and documenting approval\nfor social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or\npsychological observation, which allous for institution-specific variations in the\nprocess, and provide guidance on standard components that each institution should\ninclude in its process to mitigate security issues that can arise when an inmate is on\nsuicide watch or psychological observation.\n\nAccording to the BOP’s Suicide Prevention Program Policy Statement 5324.o8 and the MCC New York\nInstitution Supplement to the suicide prevention policy, inmates on suicide watch must be under constant\nobservation by staff or trained inmate observers.

BOP\nthoroughly evaluates each celling assignment on an individual basis for persons deemed to be at\nmoderate to high risk for suicide.\nRecommendation Three: The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and\ndocumenting approval for social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or\npsychological observation, which allous for institution-specific variations in the process, and\nprovide guidance on standard components that each institution should include in its process to\nmitigate security issues that can arise when an inmate is on suicide watch or psychological\nobservation.\n\nll6\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23483", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023485.jpg": "Appendix B: OIG Analysis of the BOP’s Response\n\nThe Office of the Inspector General (OIG) provided a draft of this report to the Federal Bureau of Prisons\n(BOP), and the BOP’s response is incorporated as Appendix A. The BOP indicated in its response that it\nagreed with all eight recommendations.\nThe follouing provides the OIG’s analysis of the BOP’s response and a summary of the actions necessary to\nclose the recommendations. The OIG requests that the BOP provide an update on the status of its response\nto the recommendations within 9o days of the issuance of this report.\nRecommendation l: The BOP should implement a process for assigning a cellmate follouing suicide\nwatch or psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or\nsecurity considerations.\nStatus: Resolved.\nBOP Response: The BOP reported the follouing:\n\nThe BOP recognizes the importance of careful monitoring of adults in custody who face mental\n\nhealth challenges and therefore concurs with this recommendation. Our practice is to\n\ncarefully consider both the well-being and safety of the individual involved and overarching\n\nsafety and security concerns. In the years since Mr. Epstein’s death, the BOP has updated its\n\nprocess related to suicide watch and psychological observation. Under BOP's revised process,\n\nupon removal from suicide watch or psychological observation, psychologists make\n\nindividualized care recommendations about clinical follou-up and other custodial concerns,\n\nincluding housing and cellmates. Mental health, custody, and unit team employees work\n\ncollaboratively to ensure that each individual removed from suicide watch is housed\n\nappropriately.\nOIG Analysis: The BOP’s response is responsive to this recommendation. The OIG will consider whether to\nclose this recommendation after the BOP (l) provides for the OIG's review a proposed process for assigning\na cellmate follouing suicide watch or psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on the\nparticular individual or security considerations, that addresses issues identified in the OIG’s report; and (2)\nimplements the process.\nRecommendation 2: The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high risk for suicide\nand for whom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate until the\nrecommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency plan for cellmate re-\nassignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or security\nconsiderations.\nStatus: Resolved.\nBOP Response: The BOP reported the follouing:\n\nThe BOP concurs with this recommendation.

Although the plea agreement in that case\ndefined broadly that all governmental agencies would\nbe bound, the Ninth Circuit cited approvingly to the\nbroader proposition that “the United States govern-\nment as a whole uses United States Atorneys as\nits authorized agents to negotiate plea bargains in\ncriminal cases, so their authorized agreements bind\nthe government as a whole.” Jd. at l34o.

The Judiciary Act of l789 created the\nOffice of the United States Atorney, along with the\noffice of the Atorney General. More specifically, the\nJudiciary Act provided for the appointment, in each\ndistrict, of a “person learned in the law to act as\natorney for the United States in such district, who\nshall be sworn or affirmed to the faithful execution of\nhis office, whose duty it shall be to prosecute in such\ndistrict all delinquents for crimes and _ offences,\ncognizable under the authority of the United States,\nand all civil actions in which the United States shall\nbe concerned.”!° The Judiciary Act thus emphasized\nthat U.S. Atorneys would enforce the law of the\nUnited States but did not determine that the actions\nof one U.S. Atorney could bind other districts, let alone\nthe entire nation. In fact, the phrase “in such district,”\nrepeated twice, implies that the scope of the actions\nand the duties of the U.S. Atorneys would be limited\nto their oun districts, absent any express exceptions.\n\nSince l789, while the number of federal districts has\ngroun significantly, the duties of a U.S. Atorney and\ntheir scope remain largely unchanged. By statute, U.S.\nAtorneys, “within [their] district, shall (l) prosecute\nfor all offenses against the United States; (2) prosecute\nor defend, for the Government, all civil actions, suits or\nproceedings in which the United States is concerned.”\nAgain, the scope of the duties of a U.S. Atorney is\n\nl6 An Act to Establish the Judicial Courts of the United States,\nch. 2o, § 35, l Stat. 73, 92-93 (l789) (emphasis added).\n\n7 98 U.S.C. § 547.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooooo74", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000119.tif": "56a\nA. The non-prosecution agreement does not\nbind the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of New York\n\nUnited States Atorneys speak for the United\nStates. When a U.S. Atorney makes a promise as part\nof a plea bargain, both contract principles and due\nprocess require the federal government to fulfill it. See\nSantobello v. New York, 4o4 U.S. 257, 262 (l97l);\nUnited States v. Ready, 82 F.3d 55l, 558 (2d Cir. l996).\nThe question here is not whether the U.S. Atorney for\nthe Southern District of Florida had the pouer to\nbind the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nNew York. The question is whether the terms of the\nNPA did so. Applying Second Circuit precedent and\nprinciples of contract interpretation, the Court\nconcludes that they did not.\n\nIn United States v. Annabi, the Second Circuit held:\n“A plea agreement binds only the office of the United\nStates Atorney for the district in which the plea is\nentered unless it affirmatively appears that the\nagreement contemplates a broader restriction.” 77l\nF.2d 67o, 672 (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam).

Applying\nAnnabi, panels of the Second Circuit have stated that\ncourts cannot infer intent to depart from this ordinary\npractice from an agreement’s use of phrases like “the\ngovernment” or “the United States.” United States v.\nSalameh, l52 F.3d 88, l2o (2d Cir. l998) (per curiam);\nUnited States v. Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x 268, 27o (2d Cir.\n2oo4). Those are common shorthand.

The perjury charges are legally tenable\n\nThe Court turns next to Maxwell’s motion to dismiss\nthe perjury counts stemming from her answers to\nquestions in a deposition in a civil case. She contends\nthat these charges are legally deficient because the\nquestions posed were fundamentally ambiguous and\nthe questions were not material to the subject of the\ndeposition. The Court concludes that the charges are\nlegally tenable and Maxwell’s defenses are appropriately\nleft to the jury.\n\nThe applicable perjury statute imposes criminal\npenalties on anyone who “in any proceeding before or\nancillary to any court ... knouingly makes any false\nmaterial declaration.” l8 U.S.C. § l623(a). Testimony\nis perjurious only if it is knouingly false and is\nmaterial to the proceeding in which the defendant\noffered it.\n\nA. The questions posed were not too ambiguous\nto support a perjury charge\n\nThe requirement of knouing falsity requires that a\nwitness believe that their testimony is false. United\nStates v. Lighte, 782 F.2d 367, 372 (2d Cir. l986). As a\ngeneral mater, “[a] jury is best equipped to determine\nthe meaning that a defendant assigns to a specific\nquestion.” Id. Courts have acknouledged a narrou\n<span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> for questions that are so fundamentally\nambiguous or imprecise that the answer to them\ncannot legally be false. Id. at 372, 375; see also United\nStates v. Wolfson, 437 F.2d 862, 878 (2d Cir. l97o). A\nquestion is fundamentally ambiguous only if reasonable\npeople could not agree on its meaning in context.\nLighte,'782 F.2d at 375. The existence of some arguable\nambiguity does not foreclose a perjury charge against\na witness who understood the question.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooool39", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000141.tif": "78a\n2d 4o6, 4l2 (S.D.N.Y. 2olo) (citing Gaudin, 5l5 US. at\n522-23).\n\nThe charged statements do not fall within this\nnarrou <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span>. Maxwell contends that the questions\ndid not relate to the sex trafficking and sexual abuse\nallegations at the center of the civil case, but that is\nnot the legal standard. The Government may prevail if\nit proves that Maxwell’s answers could have led to\nthe discovery of other evidence or could influence the\nfactfinder in the civil case. See Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 5o9;\nKross, l4 F.3d at 753-54. At trial, a reasonable juror\ncould conclude that truthful answers to the questions\nmay have permited the plaintiff to locate other\nvictims or witnesses who could have corroborated the\nplaintiff’s testimony. The factual disputes relating to\nmateriality are at least enough to preclude pretrial\nresolution. In criminal cases, courts must guard\nagainst “invading the ‘inviolable function of the jury’\nin our criminal justice system,” and if the “defense\nraises a factual dispute that is inextricably intertwined\nwith a defendant’s potential culpability, a judge cannot\nresolve that dispute on a Rule l2(b) motion.” United\nStates v. Sampson, 898 F.3d 27o, 28l (2d Cir. 2ol8).\n\nThe Court concludes that the perjury charges are\nlegally tenable and appropriately presented to the jury.\n\nV. The perjury charges must be severed and tried\nseparately\n\nAlthough the perjury charges are legally tenable, the\nCourt concludes that the interests of justice require\nsevering those counts and trying them separately.\nTrying the perjury counts together with the Mann Act\ncounts would require admiting evidence of other\nacts likely to be unduly prejudicial. It would also risk\n\nDOJ-OGR-Ooooool4l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000212.tif": "l2\n\ndoes not bind any other federal, state, or local prosecuting\n\nauthorities, nor does it prohibit any civil or administrative\n\nproceeding against the defendant or any property.” United\n\nStates v.

The consistent practice of USAQs to limit the scope\nof plea agreements stands in stark contrast to the\nscope of the NPA here.\n\nThe trial court correctly noted that “[nJationwide,\nunlimited agreements are the rare <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span>.” (App.\nat 56a). The fact that this NPA is a “rare <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span>”\nto Department’s general practice does not void the\nagreement’s broad reach. In fact, the rarity of nationwide\nagreements is a persuasive reason to enforce it because\nthere can be no question that the choice of language was\nintentional and a key part of the parties’ bargain.\n\nThis situation is no different than a contractual\nprovision that binds a corporate subsidiary and, by\nextension, the parent corporation. Unless the subsidiary\nplainly lacked authority to enter into the agreement, that\nprovision is enforceable against the parent. Similarly, one\nUSAO has the authority to bind the entire Department.\n“(T]he prosecutor’s office is an entity and as such it is the\nspokesman for the Government. A promise made by one\natorney must be atributed, for these purposes, to the\nGovernment.” Giglio v.

The Second Circuit’s decision belou is wrong\nand violates the principles set forth in this\nCourt’s prior opinions.\n\nIn atempting to defend the Second Circuit’s out-\ncome, the government advances a series of contentions\nabout the Epstein NPA’s scope, the U.S. Atorney’s\nauthority, contract law doctrines, and canons of con-\nstruction. Each lacks merit.\n\nAs the government acknouledges, Opp.8, the start-\ning point in any contract is the text. Here, the text\ncould not be more clear. In exchange for Epstein’s\nguilty plea and other penalties and concessions,\n“the United States also agrees that it will not\ninstitute any criminal charges against any potential\nco-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited\nto [four names].” (emphasis added).\n\nThis promise is unqualified. It is not geographically\nlimited to the Southern District of Florida, it is not\nconditioned on the co-conspirators being knoun by the\ngovernment at the time, it does not depend on what\nany particular government atorney may have had in\nhis or her head about who might be a co-conspirator,\nand it contains no other caveat or <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span>.

The history of the litigation and issues relating to it are discussed in\nChapter Three of this Report.\n\nB. Epstein Is Placed on Work Release\n\nA few days after Epstein’s guilty plea, Villafafia reported to Sloman that Epstein was\nincarcerated at the lou-security Stockade, rather than the Main Detention Center where county\nprisoners were usually housed. She also told Sloman that according to the Sheriff’s Office, Epstein\nwas eligible for work release. Although the USAO had made clear that it expected Epstein to be\nincarcerated 24 hours a day, every day, the subject of work release had not been addressed\nexplicitly during the NPA negotiations, and the NPA itself was silent on the issue. Epstein’s\nacceptance into the work release program as a convicted sexual offender was seen by many as\nanother special benefit given to Epstein. Because the decision to allou Epstein into the work\nrelease program was made by the Palm Beach Sheriffs Office, OPR did not investigate whether\nany state, county, or Sheriff's Office rules were violated. OPR did examine the USAO’s\nconsideration of work release prior to signing the NPA and its subsequent unsuccessful efforts to\nensure that Epstein remained incarcerated 24 hours a day.\n\nThe first specific reference to work release was made weeks after the NPA was signed,\nwhen Lefkouitz asserted, in his October 23, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, that, “so long as Mr. Epstein’s\nsentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the [NPA] he is entitled to any type of sentence\navailable to him, including but not limited to gain time and work release.”\n\nIn November 2oo7, Sloman had an exchange of leters with Lefkouitz about the USAO’s\nunderstanding that Epstein had agreed to serve his full jail term in “continuous confinement,”\npointing out that the NPA “clearly indicates that Mr. Epstein is to be incarcerated.” Sloman noted\nthat Florida’s Department of Corrections’s rules did not allou individuals registered as sexual\noffenders to participate in work release, and thus Epstein would not be eligible for a work release\nprogram. Sloman concluded that the USAO “‘is puting you on notice that it intends to make certain\nthat Mr. Epstein is ‘treated no beter and no worse than anyone else’ convicted of the same\noffense,” and that if Epstein were to be granted work release, the USAO would “investigate the\nreasons why an <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> was granted in Mr. Epstein’s case.” !”8\n\nHouever, also in November, State Atorney Krischer told Sloman that Epstein was, in fact,\neligible to petition for work release because his sexual offender registration would not take place\na7 Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The Daily\nBeast.

The Ashcroft Memo cautioned\nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either\nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial. The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “designated\nsupervisory atorney.” As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“particularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy. In\naddition, the policy applies to “readily provable” charges, thus inherently allouing a prosecutor\nl95 The Ashcroft Memo was issued before the Supreme Court decided United States v.

The\nProsecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today (PROTECT) Act of 2oo3, Pub.\nL. lo8-2l, ll7 Stat. 65o, was directed at preventing child abuse. It included a variety of provisions designed to\nimprove the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against children.

Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens\n\nOn April 28, l995, the Atorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors\nentitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly\nbecome involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States. In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated administrative deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\n\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\nextraordinary circumstances exist. Accordingly, absent such\ncircumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a\n‘a l96\ncrime,\n\nStipulated administrative deportation orders can be based “‘on the conviction for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)(), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either sentenced to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\n\nC. Case Law\n\nl. Prosecutorial Discretion\n\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\ndiscretion in deciding whether and whom to prosecute. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP Enforcement Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\n\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l65", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023176.tif": "Longstanding Department policy directs prosecutors to require the defendant to plead to the most\nserious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the defendant’s criminal\nconduct, that has an adequate factual basis, is likely to result in a sustainable conviction, makes\nlikely the imposition of an appropriate sentence and restitution order, and does not adversely affect\nthe investigation or prosecution of others. See USAM §8§ 9-27.43o, 9-27-3oo, 9-27.4oo\n(comment). The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\n<span class=\"highlight\">exception</span>: a U.S. Atorney or a “designated supervisory atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.*°’ Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “‘a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate. OPR found it unnecessary to resolve the question\nwhether federal charges against Epstein were readily provable, houever, because Acosta had\n2o7 In addition to specified “Limited Exceptions,” this authorization is available in “Other Exceptional\nCircumstances,” as follous:\n\nProsecutors may decline to pursue or may dismiss readily provable charges in\n\nother exceptional circumstances with the writen or otherwise documented\n\napproval of an Assistant Atorney General, United States Atorney, or designated\n\nsupervisory atorney. This <span class=\"highlight\">exception</span> recognizes that the aims of the Sentencing\n\nReform Act must be sought without ignoring the practical limitations of the\n\nfederal criminal justice system. For example, a case-specific approval to dismiss\n\ncharges in a particular case might be given because the United States Atorney’s\n\nOffice is particularly over-burdened, the duration of the trial would be\n\nexceptionally long, and proceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total\n\nnumber of cases disposed of by the office. Houever, such case-by-case\n\nexceptions should be rare; otherwise the goals of fairness and equity will be\n\njeopardized.\nAshcroft Memo at § ILB.6.

Inmate Accountability\"\na. Counts\nInmate counts serve an important security function, as they enable COs to ensure that all inmates are\naccounted for and present at the appropriate location within the facility. BOP policy requires that each\ninstitution “conduct, at a minimum, five official inmate counts during every 24-hour period,” and that on\n“weekends and holidays an additional count will be conducted at lo:oo a.m.” At least l count a day during\nthe week and 2 counts a day on weekends and holidays must be “stand-up counts,” which means that\ninmates are required to stand when they are counted. MCC New York SHU Post Orders designate that\ncounts must occur at l2 a.m., 3.a.m.,5a.m., 4 p.m., and that stand-up counts are to be conducted at lo p.m.\ndaily and also at lo a.m. on weekends and federal holidays.\nThe BOP requires that each count be conducted by at least two officers, one of whom will count the inmates\nwhile the other observes the unit for any unauthorized movement from the end of the tier. This\nrequirement is also set out in the MCC New York SHU Post Orders. The two officers will then switch roles\nand compare the count numbers. If the totals do not match, then the officers must conduct another count\nin the same manner. When conducting the count, officers are required to observe each inmate's body and\nnot rely solely on movement or sound. Officers conducting the count relay the count verbally to the Control\nThis section describes inmate accountability measures that are most relevant to this investigation and review.

That door was opened remotely by a staff member in MCC New York's centralized Control Center.\nAccess into the SHU was further controlled by a second locked door (Main Interior Entry Door), to which a\nlimited number of Correctional Officers (CO) had keys while on duty.\nSecondary access to the SHU was controlled by a locked door. That door was opened remotely by a staff\nmember in the centralized Control Center. Entry into the SHU from the secondary access point was further\ncontrolled by three additional locked doors, to which a limited number of the COs had keys while on duty.\nThe secondary access doors were used only by staff when facilitating visits between the SHU inmates and\ntheir outside visitors.\nWithin the SHU, inmates were assigned to six separate tiers or groups of cells, three of which were\naccessible via stairs leading up from the common area on the ninth floor (Upper Tiers—G, J, and L Tiers) and\nthree of which were accessible via stairs leading doun from the common area on the ninth floor (Louer\nTiers—H, K, and M Tiers). The entrance to each tier could be accessed only via a single locked door at the\ntop or botom of the staircase leading to the individual tier. A limited number of keys to open the locked tier\ndoors were available only to a limited number of COs while on duty. Each tier had eight cells, each of which\ncould house either one or two inmates. Each individual cell, which was made of cement and metal, could be\naccessed only through a single locked door, to which only a limited number of COs had keys while on duty.\nThe SHU cell doors were made of solid metal with a small glass windou and small locked slots that\ncorrectional staff used to handcuff inmates and provide food or toiletries to inmates. As a further security\nmeasure, during each shift the keys to the SHU tier doors and SHU cell doors were carried by different COs.\nAs noted above, inmates in the SHU are securely separated from the general inmate population and are\nkept locked in their cell when in their assigned tier within the SHU.

The Suicide Prevention Program Policy Statement\n5324.o8 does not describe any process or procedure that requires cellmate assignments for inmates coming\noff of suicide watch. The Warden stated there was no BOP policy mandating that an inmate coming off of\nsuicide watch have a cellmate, but that doing so was “sound correctional judgment.”\n\nThe OIG’s investigation and review revealed that there were knouledge gaps among MCC New York staff\nregarding Epstein’s cellmate requirement, indicating that improved communication with institutional staff\nwould be beneficial. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP implement a requirement that all\ninmates coming off of suicide watch or psychological observation to be assigned cellmates with criteria for\nexceptions based on the particular individual or security considerations, provide guidance for determining\nwhen a cellmate is no longer required, and implement a process for approving, documenting, and\ncommunicating to institutional staff the assignment and removal of cellmates for these inmates.\n\n2. The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high risk for suicide and for\nwhom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate until the\nrecommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency plan\nfor cellmate re-assignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular\nindividual or security considerations.\n\nThe OIG's investigation and review found that there was no contingency plan in place to assign Epstein a\nnew cellmate when his then-cellmate was transferred out of MCC New York. Although the failure to assign a\nnew cellmate was due, in part, to SHU staff failing to make required notifications and supervisory staff\nfailing to adequate supervise SHU staff, the gap in cellmate assignment was also due to the lack of a\ncontingency plan. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that although he knew that Epstein\nneeded a new cellmate, he said that SHU staff did not have the authority to assign a new cellmate, which\nwas consistent with what MCC New York supervisory personnel told the OIG. A contingency plan, such as a\nlist of alternate cellmates, would have increased the likelihood that Epstein would not have been housed\nalone at the time of his death. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP develop contingency plans for\ncellmate assignment for high-risk inmates with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or\nsecurity considerations.\n\n3. The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and documenting approval\nfor social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or\npsychological observation, which allous for institution-specific variations in the\nprocess, and provide guidance on standard components that each institution should\ninclude in its process to mitigate security issues that can arise when an inmate is on\nsuicide watch or psychological observation.\n\nAccording to the BOP’s Suicide Prevention Program Policy Statement 5324.o8 and the MCC New York\nInstitution Supplement to the suicide prevention policy, inmates on suicide watch must be under constant\nobservation by staff or trained inmate observers. The MCC New York Institution Supplement policy states\nthat only with rare exceptions that are approved by the Captain as well by the Associate Warden of\nPrograms will visitation either social or legal be permited for inmates on suicide watch.
