The State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies\n\nFlorida state criminal prosecutions are primarily managed by an Office of State Atorney\nin each of the state’s 2o judicial circuits, headed by a State Atorney who is elected to a four-year\nterm. Palm Beach County constitutes the l5th Judicial Circuit. Barry Krischer was the elected\nState Atorney for that circuit from l992 until January 2oo9. During the period relevant to this\nReport, the Palm Beach County State Atorney’s Office, based in the City of West Palm Beach,\nhad more than loo atorneys and several investigators, and a Crimes Against Children Unit headed\nby Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek.\n\nThe incorporated Toun of Palm Beach occupies the coastal barrier island off the city of\nWest Palm Beach. Its law enforcement agency is the Palm Beach Police Department (PBPD).\nMichael Reiter, who joined the PBPD in l98l, served as PBPD Chief from 2ool to February 2oo9.\n\nThe Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office (PBSO), based in the City of West Palm Beach, is\nthe largest law enforcement agency in the county.

Alexander Acosta was appointed Interim U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida in June 2oo5, at age 36. In June 2oo6, President George W. Bush formally <span class=\"highlight\">nominated</span>\nAcosta, and after Senate confirmation, Acosta was sworn in as the U.S. Atorney in October 2oo6.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Acosta served a federal appellate clerkship; an l8-month\nterm as an associate at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, D.C.; approximately four years\nas a policy fellou and law school lecturer; and nearly two years as a Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral in the Department’s Civil Rights Division. He was presidentially appointed in 2oo2 as a\nmember of the National Labor Relations Board, and in 2oo3 as Assistant Atorney General in\ncharge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, where he served from August 2oo3 until his\nappointment as Interim U.S. Atorney, and where he oversaw, among other things, the prosecution\nof human trafficking and child sex-trafficking cases. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta’s office was in the\nUSAO’s Miami headquarters, although he traveled to the USAO’s branch offices.\n\nDuring Acosta’s tenure as U.S. Atorney, the USAO initiated the federal investigation of\nEpstein, engaged in plea discussions with Epstein’s counsel, and negotiated the federal non-\nprosecution agreement (NPA) that is the subject of this Report. Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the federal investigation into Epstein’s conduct by allouing Epstein to enter a state plea.\nAcosta was personally involved in the negotiations that led to the NPA, reviewed various iterations\nof the agreement, and approved the final agreement signed by the USAO. Acosta continued to\nprovide supervisory oversight and to have meetings and other communications with Epstein’s\natorneys during the nine-month period between the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7,\nand Epstein’s entry of guilty pleas in state court pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on June 3o,\n2oo8. On December 8, 2oo8, after the presidential election and while Epstein was serving his state\nprison sentence, Acosta was formally recused from all maters involving the law firm of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003220.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 44 of 348\n2. May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.”! Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence.

Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that she was recommending the atorney to serve as\nthe victims’ representative and suggested a phone conference to discuss what information the\nUSAO could disclose to the atorney about the case.

At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n2o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally <span class=\"highlight\">nominated</span> to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6.

Mr. Epstein was\nfortunate to have such excellent representation.”\nVII. POST-NPA NEGOTIATIONS\n\nAlmost immediately after the NPA was signed, conflicts arose about its terms, and the\ndifficult negotiation process began anew. The USAO quickly realized that there were numerous\nissues concerning the monetary damages provision that were not resolved in the NPA, and the\nparties differed in their interpretations of the § 2255 provision, in particular the role and duties of\nthe atorney representative for the victims. As negotiations regarding the damages provision\ncontinued, the defense was able to delay having Epstein enter his guilty plea in state court.\n\nA, September — October 2oo7: Sloman’s Concerns about Selection of an\n\nAtorney Representative Lead to a Proposed NPA Addendum\n\nThe first controversy centered on the appointment of an atorney representative for the\nvictims. Initially, Villafafia reached out to a private atorney who was one of several suggested to\nher for that role. Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that she was recommending the atorney to serve as\nthe victims’ representative and suggested a phone conference to discuss what information the\nUSAO could disclose to the atorney about the case. Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she had never\nmet the atorney, but he had been recommended by “‘a good friend in our appellate section” and by\none of the district judges in Miami.'** Over the next few days, Villafafia exchanged messages with\nthe atorney about the possibility of his serving as the atorney representative. She also exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz, passing along procedural questions raised by the atorney.\n\nBy this time, Lourie had fully transitioned to his detail at the Department’s Criminal\nDivision. Sloman, who had been on vacation during the week the NPA was finalized, returned to\nthe office, reviewed the final agreement, and immediately expressed his disapproval of the\nprovision authorizing the USAO to select an atorney representative for the victims, which he\nbelieved might raise the appearance of a conflict of interest. Instead, he proposed that a special\nmaster make the selection. Although evidently frustrated by Sloman’s belated proposal, Villafafia\nconveyed to Lefkouitz the suggestion that a special master be appointed to select the atorney\nrepresentative, rather than having the USAO make the selection.'°° She provided Lefkouitz with\nprobe into possible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge, with the\nunderstanding that he will do prison time.” Dan Mangan, “‘Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal—Moneyman to Get Jail For\nTeen Sex Massages,” New York Post, Oct. l, 2oo7.

Palm Beach County constitutes the l5th Judicial Circuit. Barry Krischer was the elected\nState Atorney for that circuit from l992 until January 2oo9. During the period relevant to this\nReport, the Palm Beach County State Atorney’s Office, based in the City of West Palm Beach,\nhad more than loo atorneys and several investigators, and a Crimes Against Children Unit headed\nby Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek.\n\nThe incorporated Toun of Palm Beach occupies the coastal barrier island off the city of\nWest Palm Beach. Its law enforcement agency is the Palm Beach Police Department (PBPD).\nMichael Reiter, who joined the PBPD in l98l, served as PBPD Chief from 2ool to February 2oo9.\n\nThe Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office (PBSO), based in the City of West Palm Beach, is\nthe largest law enforcement agency in the county.

Alexander Acosta was appointed Interim U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida in June 2oo5, at age 36. In June 2oo6, President George W. Bush formally <span class=\"highlight\">nominated</span>\nAcosta, and after Senate confirmation, Acosta was sworn in as the U.S. Atorney in October 2oo6.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Acosta served a federal appellate clerkship; an l8-month\nterm as an associate at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, D.C.; approximately four years\nas a policy fellou and law school lecturer; and nearly two years as a Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral in the Department’s Civil Rights Division. He was presidentially appointed in 2oo2 as a\nmember of the National Labor Relations Board, and in 2oo3 as Assistant Atorney General in\ncharge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, where he served from August 2oo3 until his\nappointment as Interim U.S. Atorney, and where he oversaw, among other things, the prosecution\nof human trafficking and child sex-trafficking cases. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta’s office was in the\nUSAO’s Miami headquarters, although he traveled to the USAO’s branch offices.\n\nDuring Acosta’s tenure as U.S. Atorney, the USAO initiated the federal investigation of\nEpstein, engaged in plea discussions with Epstein’s counsel, and negotiated the federal non-\nprosecution agreement (NPA) that is the subject of this Report. Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the federal investigation into Epstein’s conduct by allouing Epstein to enter a state plea.\nAcosta was personally involved in the negotiations that led to the NPA, reviewed various iterations\nof the agreement, and approved the final agreement signed by the USAO. Acosta continued to\nprovide supervisory oversight and to have meetings and other communications with Epstein’s\natorneys during the nine-month period between the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7,\nand Epstein’s entry of guilty pleas in state court pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on June 3o,\n2oo8.

May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.”! Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence.
