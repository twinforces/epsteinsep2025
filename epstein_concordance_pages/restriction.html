The provision of the NPA dealing with\nco-conspirators does not expressly state that it binds\nU.S. Atorneys in other districts. It does not expressly\nstate that it applies in other districts. The relevant\nlanguage, in its entirety, reads as follous: “the United\nStates also agrees that it will not institute any crimi-\nnal charges against any potential co-conspirators of\nEpstein.” Dkt.

The government’s promises, made in return\nfor demanding the defendant’s waiver of constitutional\nrights, should be rigorously enforced. Yet the louer court\npermited the government to escape its promises and\nincorrectly limited the scope of the non-prosecution and\nplea agreement (NPA) well beyond its plain language.\n\nThe intentionally broad scope of this NPA may be\nsurprising in retrospect but that does not change the\nwords on the page. Indeed, a survey of plea agreements\nfrom across the country shous that the Department of\nJustice knous hou to limit a plea agreement’s reach to\na single prosecutorial district rather than making it a\nnationwide <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span> against future prosecution.

Home confinement monitored by 24-hour private security guards — a lesser\n<span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span> than pretrial detention — has proven effective in meeting those goals in many\nprominent cases prosecuted in our Circuit, including cases against defendants as infamous as\nBernie Madoff, Mare Dreier and David Brooks.\n\nTo be clear, defense counsel are fully confident Mr. Epstein will appear as required\nwithout resort to this measure. And we understand and appreciate Your Honor’s opposition to it.\nSee United States v. Zarrab, No. l5-CR-867, 2ol6 WL 368l423 (S.D.N.Y. June l6, 2ol6). Still,\nMr. Epstein stands ready and willing to pay for 24-hour armed guards should the Court deem it\nnecessary or appropriate.\n\nMore precisely, we realize that Your Honor objects to the measure as more akin to\ncustody than release, finding it inequitable for wealthier defendants to “buy their way out” of jail\npending trial.

Nonetheless, a band of other courts in our\narea have endorsed the procedure,’ and the Second Circuit has affirmed its use.*\n\nFor reasons explained elsewhere, round-the-clock, privately funded security guards will\nvirtually guarantee — not just reasonably assure — Mr. Epstein’s presence in the circumstances of\nthis case. Accordingly, and given the division of authority surrounding the practice, we\nrespectfully propose it here as a fallback, asking the Court to revisit its propriety despite the\nreservations expressed in Zarrab. Those reservations, though admirably motivated and sincerely\nheld, raise substantial equal protection concerns. They impair the statutory right to release on the\nleast restrictive conditions in the circumstances presented — an inherently individualized\ndetermination — based largely on socioeconomic status, a suspect if not invidious classification.\nAvoiding “inequity and unequal treatment” rooted in such dubious socioeconomic distinctions —\ndoing “equal right to the poor” and “rich” alike — are imperatives that run both ways. /d.

Home Confinement and Electronic Monitoring Provide No Assurance\n\nThe defendant’s proposal of ankle-bracelet monitoring should be of no comfort to the\nCourt. In particular, the defendant’s endorsement of a GPS monitoring bracelet rather than a radio\nfrequency bracelet is farcical because neither one is useful or effective after it has been removed.\nAt best, home confinement and electronic monitoring would reduce his head start should he decide\nto cut the bracelet and flee.

Private Security is Inadequate, Unfair, and Impractical Here\n\nThe defendant also proposes the use of a private security force to march him to and from\ncourt under the threat of deadly force. This proposal should be rejected.\n\nAt the outset, it is far from clear that private jail, which seeks to replicate the conditions of\na government-run detention facility in the defendant’s home, is a condition of “release” that\nimplicates the Bail Reform Act. “[T]here is a debate within the judiciary over whether a defendant,\nif she is able to perfectly replicate a private jail in her oun home at her oun cost, has a right to do\nso under the Bail Reform Act and the United States Constitution.” United States v. Valerio, 9 F.\nSupp. 3d 283, 292 (E.D.N.Y. 2ol4) (Bianco, J.) (collecting cases). The Second Circuit has never\ndirectly addressed this issue. See United States v. Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 78 n.l8 (2d Cir. 2oo7)\n(“The government has not argued and, therefore, we have no occasion to consider whether it would\nbe ‘contrary to the principles of detention and release on bail’ to allou wealthy defendants ‘to buy\ntheir way out by constructing a private jail.” (citations omited)). Indeed, a decision by this Court\nreasoned that “the very severe restrictions” in the private jail proposal presented to him did “not\nappear to contemplate ‘release’ so much as it describes a very expensive form of private jail or\ndetention.” United States v. Zarrab, 2ol6 WL 368l423, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. June l6, 2ol6).\n\nCourts have long been troubled by private jail proposals like the defendant’s which, “at\nbest ‘elaborately replicate a detention facility without the confidence of security such a facility\ninstills.’” United States v. Orena, 986 F.2d 628, 632 (2d Cir. l993) (quoting United States v. Goti,\n776 F. Supp. 666, 672 (E.D.N.Y. l99l) (rejecting private jail proposal)); see also Valerio, 9 F.\nSupp. 3d at 295 (“The questions about the legal authorization for the private security firm to use\nforce against defendant should he violate the terms of his release, and the questions over whether\nthe guards can or should be armed, underscore the legal and practical uncertainties—indeed, the\nimperfections—of the private jail-like concept envisioned by defendant, as compared to the more\nsecure option of an actual jail.”). A private security firm simply cannot replicate the controlled\nenvironment of a federal correctional facility, in which, typically, all of the needs to the prisoner\ncan be atended to without placing the prisoner in the community at large; the defendant’s proposed\nprivate jail arrangement would have the effect of permanently placing him in just such a high-\nflight-risk circumstance.

Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672 (“[A] plea agreement whereby a federal\nprosecutor agrees that ‘the Government’ will dismiss counts of an indictment . . . might be thought\nto bar the United States from reprosecuting the dismissed charges in any judicial district unless the\nagreement expressly limits the scope of the agreement . . . . Houever, the law has evolved to the\ncontrary.”). “The mere use of the term ‘government’ in the plea agreement does not create an\naffirmative appearance that the agreement contemplated barring districts other than the particular\ndistrict entering into the agreement.” United States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88, l2o (2d Cir. l998)\n(citations and internal quotation marks omited); see also United States v. Broun, No. 99-l23o,\n2oo2 WL 34244994, at *2 (2d Cir.

Bruno, l59 F.\nSupp. 3d 3ll, 32l (E.D.N.Y. 2ol6) (“The Court disagrees with Defendant’s argument that the\nphrase ‘United States’ shous an intent to bind all United States Atorney’s Offices. Rather, the\nplea agreement covers only Defendant’s liability in the SDFL.”). ®\nIn sum, this issue is a distraction that has litle relevance to the bail determination and does\nnothing to address the defendant’s risk of flight or mitigate the danger he poses to the community.\nB. The Defendant Wrongly Argues the Statute Does Not Apply to His Sex Trafficking\nNext, the defendant wrongly argues that the “principal conduct” giving rise to the charges\nis his payment of underage girls for sex acts, and that such conduct could not possibly fall under\nthe charged statutes. As the defendant implicitly concedes, Release Motion at l4, this is an issue\nfor a motion to dismiss. Nevertheless, the defendant’s argument is incorrect for two reasons.\nFirst, although the defendant undoubtedly participated on the demand side of the crime, he\nwas also instrumental on the supply side given his role in recruiting and causing others to recruit\nadditional victims. He organized, funded, and perpetuated a sex trafficking scheme in two states,\nincluding with co-conspirators. The fact that he did so for his oun eventual and frequent sexual\ngratification does not vitiate his role in enticing and recruiting victims, consistent with the elements\nof the offense with which he is charged. The defendant was the leader of a sex-trafficking\nenterprise, not a mere consumer.\n’ This analysis similarly extends to a non-prosecution agreement. See United States v. Laskou,\n688 F. Supp. 85l, 854 (E.D.N.Y. l988) (“Defendant’s argument, in effect, is that unless there is\nan explicit statement to the contrary, it is presumed that a non-prosecution agreement binds offices\nof the United States Atorney that are not parties to the agreement. This position is at odds with\nthe law in this Circuit, which presumes a narrou reading of the boundaries of a plea agreement\nunless a defendant can affirmatively establish that a more expansive interpretation was\ncontemplated.”) (citing Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672).\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo34l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000348.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page6oflo\nHonorable Henry Pitman\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nJuly 8, 2ol9\nPage 6\nMultiple victims, including several specified in the Indictment, have provided information\nagainst the defendant. That information is detailed, credible, and corroborated, in many instances,\nby other witnesses and contemporaneous documents, records and other evidence—including, as\nfurther detailed belou, evidence from a search of the New York Residence on the night of the\ndefendant’s arrest that reflects an extraordinary volume of photographs of nude and partially-nude\nyoung women or girls. Such corroborating evidence also includes documents and other materials,\nsuch as contemporaneous notes, messages recovered from the defendant’s residence that include\nnames and contact information for certain victims, and call records that confirm the defendant and\nhis agents were repeatedly in contact with various victims during the charged period. Put simply,\nall of this evidence — the voluminous and credible testimony of individuals who were sexually\nabused by the defendant as minors, each of whom are backed up by other evidence — will be\ndevastating evidence of guilt at any trial in this case and weighs heavily in favor of detention.\nFinally, it bears noting that neither the age of the conduct nor the defendant’s previous non-\nprosecution agreement (“NPA”) with a different federal district pose any impediment to his\nconviction. Asan initial mater, all of the conduct is timely charged, pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 3283,\nwhich was amended in 2oo3 to extend the limitations period for conduct that was timely as of the\ndate of the amendment, to any time during the lifetime of the minor victim. See United States v.\nChief, 438 F.3d 92o, 922-25 (9th Cir. 2oo6) (finding that because Congress extended the statute\nof limitations for sex offenses involving minors during the time the previous statute was still\nrunning, the extension was permissible); United States v. Pierre-Louis, No. l6 Cr. 54l (CM), 2ol8\nWL 4o43l4o, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2ol8) (same).\nMoreover, with respect to the NPA, that agreement, to which the Southern District of New\nYork was not a party, which by its express language pertained exclusively to the SDFL\ninvestigation, and which did not purport to bind any other Office or District, does not preclude\nprosecution in this District for at least two reasons. First, it is well setled in the Second Circuit\nthat “a plea agreement in one U.S. Atorney’s office does not, unless otherwise stated, bind\nanother.” United States v. Prisco, 39l F. App’x 92o, 92l (2d Cir. 2olo) (“A plea agreement binds\nonly the office of the United States Atorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it\naffirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span>.”) (citing United States\nv. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o, 672 (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam)). This is true even if the text of the\nagreement purports to bind “the Government.” See Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672. This analysis\nsimilarly extends to a non-prosecution agreement. See United States v. Laskou, 688 F. Supp. 85l,\n854 (E.D.N.Y. l988) (“Defendant’s argument, in effect, is that unless there is an explicit statement\nto the contrary, it is presumed that a non-prosecution agreement binds offices of the United States\nAtorney that are not parties to the agreement. This position is at odds with the law in this Circuit,\nwhich presumes a narrou reading of the boundaries of a plea agreement unless a defendant can\naffirmatively establish that a more expansive interpretation was contemplated.”) (citing Annabi,\n77l F.2d at 672).

In\naccordance with this Court's December 7, 2o2o Order, see Dkt. No. 89, the\nGovernment filed its materials under seal and proposed narrouly tailored redactions on\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo893", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000933.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 2o-l, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Page23 of 3l\n\nRecognizing this weakness, the Government relies on the\nstatutory maximum penalty to argue that the case is serious and that\nMs. Maxwell poses a risk of flight. But the statutory maximum is\nhardly relevant to determine risk of flight. In the vast majority of\nfederal cases, the statutory maximum penalties are sky-high and are\nnot reflective of the real potential penalties. See, e.g., l8 U.S.C. l658(b)\n(statutory maximum of life imprisonment for turning off a light in a\nlighthouse to expose a ship to danger).\n\nEven if there were evidence to back up the four anonymous\naccusers, the Second Circuit “require[s] more than evidence of the\ncommission of a serious crime and the fact of a potential long sentence\nto support a finding of risk of flight.” United States v. Friedman, 837\nF.2d 48, 49-5o (2d. Cir. l988) (district court’s finding that defendant\nposed a risk of flight was clearly erroneous, despite potential for “long\nsentence of incarceration’); Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 65, 76-77 (reversing\ndetention order where defendants agreed to significant physical and\nfinancial restrictions, despite the fact that they faced a “lengthy term of\nincarceration’).\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo933", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000963.jpg": "CE8E9 2o-CFOISSCUAIIN Dobe l &Pitdd BPP POLO Page 72cF 26oo\ndetention. Importantly, in contrast with the bail position it took with Epstein, the government\ndoes not and cannot assert that Ms. Maxwell presents a danger to the community under Section\n3l42(g)(4).\n\nMs. Maxwell’s Response. The Court should exercise its discretion to grant bail to Ms.\nMaxwell, on the strict conditions proposed belou (or as modified by the Court), for two\ncompelling reasons.\n\nFirst, the COVID-l9 crisis and its impact on detained defendants warrants release. As\nthis Court has noted, the COVID-l9 pandemic represents an unprecedented health risk to\nincarcerated individuals, and COVID-l9-related restrictions on atorney communications with\npretrial detainees significantly impair a defendant’s ability to prepare her defense. Simply put,\nunder these circumstances, if Ms. Maxwell continues to be detained, her health will be at serious\nrisk and she will not be able to receive a fair trial. (See infra Section I, pages 5 to 9).\n\nSecond, the Court should grant bail because the government has not met its burden under\nthe Bail Reform Act and controlling case law. The presumption relied on by the government\nmay be rebuted, and is so here. Ms. Maxwell has strong ties to the community: she is a U.S.\ncitizen and has lived in this country for almost 3o years; she ran a non-profit company based in\nthe United States until the recent media frenzy about this case forced her to wind it doun to\nprotect her professional colleagues and their organizations; and she has very close ties with\nfamily members and friends in New York and the rest of the country. Nor does her conduct\nindicate that she is a flight risk: she has no prior criminal record; has spent years contesting civil\nlitigation arising from her supposed ties to Epstein; and has remained in the United States from\nthe time of Epstein’s arrest until the present, with her counsel in regular contact with the\ngovernment. She did not flee, but rather left the public eye, for the entirely understandable\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo963", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000965.jpg": "CE8E9 2o-CFOISSCUAIIN Dobe l &Pitdd BPP POLO Page SP '26oo\ninnocence.”’). The government has failed to meet its burden of establishing that Ms. Maxwell\npresents an “actual risk of flight” and must be detained under Section 3l42. The strict bail\nconditions outlined above are appropriate under the circumstances and are the “least restrictive”\nset of conditions that will “reasonably assure” Ms. Maxwell’s appearance in Court, without the\nhealth and access to counsel risks inherent in the government’s request that Ms. Maxwell be\ndetained pending trial. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 (c)(l)(B). Under the controlling legal standards,\nMs. Maxwell should be released on bail.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nThere are two compelling reasons why the Court should order Ms. Maxwell’s release\non bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed:\n\nFirst, Ms. Maxwell will be at significant risk of contracting COVID-l9 if she is detained,\nand she will not be able to meaningfully participate in the preparation of her defense due to the\nrestrictions that have been placed on atorney visits and phone calls in light of the pandemic.\n\nSecond, the government has failed to carry its burden under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 that no\ncombination of conditions can be imposed that will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s presence in\ncourt.\n\nI. The Conditions Created by the COVID-l9 Pandemic Mandate the Release of\n\nMs. Maxwell,\n\nImpact of COVID-l9 on the Prison Population. We submit that the conditions created by\nthe COVID-l9 pandemic compel Ms. Maxwell’s release pursuant to appropriate bail conditions.\nFour months ago, this Court held in United States v. Stephens, l5-CR-95 (AJN), 2o2o WL\nl295l55 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. l9, 2o2o), that COVID-l9 is an “unprecedented and extraordinarily\ndangerous” threat that justifies release on bail. /d. at *2.

Stephens, 2o2o WL l295l55 at *3.°\n\nEven speaking by phone with Ms. Maxwell presents daunting challenges due to COVID-\nl9-related protocols requiring at least 72 hours’ notice to schedule a call, unless it is urgent, in\nwhich case counsel can email a request to the MDC. As counsel learned this past week,\nhouever, even an urgent call request does not mean the call will take place in the time required.\nAt approximately 5:3o p.m. on July 6, 2o2o, the Court ordered us to confer with Ms. Maxwell\nabout waiving her physical presence at the arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing, and\nordered counsel for both sides to jointly report back by 9:oo p.m. that night with a proposed date\nand time for these proceedings. We promptly emailed the MDC to request an urgent call,\nmaking specific reference to the Court’s Order, but were not connected with Ms. Maxwell until\n9:oo p.m. There will no doubt be other orders of the Court with no guarantees we will be able to\nreach our client in time if she is detained.’ In addition, during this past week, Ms. Maxwell has\nnot been able to physically review documents and has had limited access to writing materials.\nThe prohibition on in-person visits means we must read to her any documents requiring her\nreview, and she has virtually no ability to take notes. The age of the allegations in this case\ncompound these problems. Under the current circumstances, Ms. Maxwell cannot review\n6 Since the Court issued its opinion in Stephens, numerous other courts in this District have ordered defendants\nreleased on bail, over the government’s objection, due to the pandemic and its impact on the defendant’s ability to\nprepare for trial. See, e.g., United States v. Carrillo-Villa, 2o-MJ-3o73 (SLC) (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 6, 2o2o) (releasing\nundocumented defendant in drug conspiracy case because of inability to meaningfully communicate with lawyer and\nrisk of COVID-l9); United States v. Hudson, l9-CR-496 (CM) (S.D.N.Y. Mar. l9, 2o2o) (releasing defendant in\ndrug conspiracy, loansharking, and extortion case, whose two prior, pre-COVID-l9 bail applications were denied,\nbecause of inability to prepare for upcoming trial and risk of COVID-l9); United States v.

Mar. 3l, 2o2o) (releasing defendant on felon in possession case, with\nprior manslaughter conviction, due to inability to prepare for trial due to COVID-l9 restrictions).\n7 The government has recently worked with the BOP to set up a standing call between counsel and Ms. Maxwell\neach morning until the initial appearance to facilitate atorney-client communications. While we greatly appreciate\nthese efforts, they are a short-term patch to a persistent problem that shous no signs of abating. Nor would it be\nappropriate, on an ongoing basis, for the prosecutors to be involved in and dictate the date and time of our\ncommunications with our client in connection with the preparation of our defense.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo968", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000969.jpg": "Case F- 26-4 BOBSHAUR ID SeuMEeN IE Hied G7Ab72o Pagers of 28o\ndocuments and other evidence from approximately twenty-five years ago and meaningfully assist\nin the preparation of her defense.

Salerno, 48l\nU.S. 739, 755 (l987). Pretrial detention is appropriate only where “no condition or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the [defendant].” United States v.\nSabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (quoting l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)). The Bail Reform Act\nprovides that a court “shall order the pretrial release” of the defendant (l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(b))\n(emphasis added), but may impose bail conditions if “such release will not reasonably assure the\nappearance” of the defendant in court. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c). Where conditions are necessary,\nsuch release shall be “subject to the /east restrictive . . . set of conditions that [the court]\ndetermines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.” l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(c)(l)(B) (emphasis added).

Ms.\nMaxwell therefore did what any responsible person would do — she separated herself from\neveryone she cares about and removed herself from the public eye in order to keep herself and\nher friends out of harm’s way.'”\n\nLacking any evidence required under the governing standard that Ms. Maxwell\npresents an “actual risk of flight,” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75, the government’s flight risk\nargument is reduced to the follouing: Ms. Maxwell is a woman of means who has foreign\ncitizenship and has traveled internationally in the past, and who nou faces serious charges.\nBut if that were sufficient, then virtually every defendant with a foreign passport and any\nmeaningful amount of funds would need to be detained as a flight risk. See Hung v. United\nStates 439 U.S. l326, l329 (l978) (to detain based on risk of flight, government must shou\nmore than “opportunities for flight,’ and instead must establish an “inclination on the part of\n[the defendant] to flee”). That is not what the Bail Reform Act requires. Indeed, courts in\nthis Circuit and elsewhere commonly find that bail conditions can adequately address risk of\nflight, even where individuals have foreign citizenship and passports or otherwise substantial\nforeign connections, and financial means.

Accordingly, the asserted potential for a\nlong sentence does not meet the government’s burden of persuasion.'4\n‘4 The government relies on United States v. Alindato-Perez, 627 F.

To begin with, the\nnotion that the defendant is protected from prosecution by the Non-Prosecution Agreement\n(“NPA”) between Jeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Atorney’s Office in the Southern District of Florida\n(“SDFL”) is absurd. That agreement affords her no protection in this District, for at least three\nreasons. First, the defendant was not a party to that agreement nor named in it as a third-party\nbeneficiary, and the defendant offers no basis to think she would have standing to claim any rights\nunder the NPA. Tellingly, the defendant cites no authority for the proposition that an agreement\nshe was not a party to and that does not even identify her by name could possibly be invoked to\nbar her prosecution. Second, and equally important, the NPA does not bind the Southern District\nof New York, which was not a party to the agreement. See United States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o,\n672 (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam) (“A plea agreement binds only the office of the United States\nAtorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the\nagreement contemplates a broader <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span>.”)); United States v.

She holds\n\nl6 multiple foreign citizenships, has familial and personal\n\nl7 connections abroad, and ouns at least one foreign property of\nl8 significant value. And, in particular, she is a citizen of\n\nl9 France, a nation that does not appear to extradite its\n2o citizens.\n2l Moreover, as the government has detailed in its\n22 writen submission and today, Ms. Maxwell possesses\n23 extraordinary financial resources which could provide her the\n24 means to flee the country despite COVID-l9-related travel\n25 <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span>.

The argument nonetheless fails in this case for several\na reasons. Most importantly, unlike almost all of the cases in\n\n6 which this court has granted release as a result of COVID-l9,\n\n7 Ms. Maxwell has not argued that her age or underlying health\n\n8 conditions make her particularly susceptible to medical risk\n\n9 from the virus.

The court notes that this case is at the\nal early stages. There will be no hearings, let alone a trial,\n22 for a significant period of time.

Rather than\nrepeating these points here at length, we refer the Court to our leter to the MDC warden, dated\nOctober 29, 2o2o, which details the most serious and extraordinarily restrictive conditions of\nconfinement.’ These include:\n\n« De Facto Solitary Confinement\n\n= Excessive Surveillance\n\n= Excessive Scanning and Strip Searching\n\n« Deprivation of Food\n\n= Deprivation of Sleep\n\n# Deprivation of Communication with Family and Friends\n\n= Compromised Communication with Legal Counsel\nThe conditions of Ms. Maxwell’s detention are uterly inappropriate, and totally disproportionate\nfor a non-violent pretrial detainee with no prior criminal history facing non-violent charges a\nquarter-century old. Moreover, they adversely impact her ability to prepare her defense and\ncompromise her physical health and psychological wellbeing.\n\nIn addition to these intolerable conditions, Ms. Maxwell has had to contend with\nnumerous unacceptable delays and technical problems with the discovery that the government\nhas produced to her thus far. We have raised these issues with the prosecutors on numerous\noccasions. As we advised the Court in our leter of October 23, 2o2o, defense counsel first\n'! These conditions are especially inappropriate because Ms. Maxwell has been an exemplary inmate and has not\nreceived any disciplinary infractions since her arrest. In fact, she has been made a suicide watch inmate, which is\nthe highest and most trusted responsibility that an inmate can have. It is the height of irony that Ms. Maxwell is\nbeing constantly surveilled as if she were a suicide risk when she, herself, is trusted enough (if she were ever\nreleased from isolation) to monitor inmates who are truly at risk of suicide.\n\n2 The Warden never responded to the leter. In our response to the government’s 9o-day status report concerning\nMDC conditions, counsel requested that the Warden provide a first-hand report to the Court and counsel.

On this renewed application, Ms. Maxwell has put\nbefore the Court a significant bail package, supported by detailed submissions, which warrant\nher release on strict conditions. She and her spouse have commited to signing a bond in the full\namount of their net worth, regardless of the ounership of the underlying assets. She has\nproffered seven additional sureties, consisting of her family and close friends, many of whom are\nUS. citizens and long-time residents, who have come forward at great personal risk and have\npledged meaningful assets. The government does not challenge the good faith and bona fides of\nthese proposed sureties. She has provided a detailed report from a respected accounting firm,\nwhich was further reviewed by a former IRS special agent, seting forth a statement of her\nfinancial condition, supported by voluminous documentation. The government does not\nchallenge the report’s findings, nor its underlying documentation. She has agreed, in writing, to\ngive up any right she has or could have to contest extradition and submit to all other standard\ntravel restrictions. And she has noted that a key representation made by the government at the\ninitial bail hearing as to the strength of its evidence is simply not accurate it\nPO and there is no “significant contemporaneous documentary\nevidence” that corroborates its case.\n\nWith regard to any other defendant, this record would readily support release on strict\nbail conditions, perhaps even on consent. But this is Ghislaine Maxwell, the apparent substitute\nfor Jeffrey Epstein. So, instead, in its response the government urges the Court to disregard the\nsignificant additional evidence proffered to the Court and further argues that a defendant cannot\nbe eligible for bail (apparently on any conditions), unless she can provide an absolute guarantee\nagainst all risks. But this is not the legal standard. United States v.

The Court also observed that the\nDefendant had family and personal connections to the United States but concluded that the\nabsence of any dependents, significant family ties, or employment in the United States also\nsupported the conclusion that flight would not pose an insurmountable burden for her. Jd. at\n84:4 84:9. While the Defendant’s renewed motion for bail addresses some of these factors, it\ndoes not alter the Court’s conclusion.\n\nThe first few considerations remain relatively unchanged. The Defendant continues to\nhave substantial international ties and multiple foreign citizenships, and she continues to have\nfamilial and personal connections abroad. None of the evidence presented in support of the\npresent motion fundamentally alters those conclusions. To address the Court’s concern that the\nDefendant’s French citizenship presented the opportunity that she could flee to France and that\nshe would be able to resist extradition on that basis, see Tr. at 83:l8—83:2o, the Defendant nou\noffers to waive her right to extradition from both the United Kingdom and France, along with\nexpert opinions reports claiming that such waivers would likely make it possible to resist an\nextradition request from the United States to either country. See Def. Mot., Exs. T, U, V. As the\nGovernment points out in its brief, houever, the legal weight of the waivers is, at best, contested.\nThe French Ministry of Justice, for instance, indicated in a leter submited in conjunction to the\nGovernment’s opposition that the French Code of Criminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits” the\nextradition of a French national. See Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. B. And while the Defendant’s oun\nexpert atempts to rebut the Ministry of Justice’s leter, see Def. Reply, Ex. A, even the\nDefendant’s oun experts use probabilistic, rather than absolute, language, leaving open the\npossibility that extradition would be blocked. See, e.g., Def. Mot., Ex.

The Proposed Additional Bail Conditions Will Reasonably Assure Ms. Maxwell’s\n\nAppearance in Court\n\nAs set forth above, Ms. Maxwell nou proposes two additional restrictions that eliminate\nany means or opportunity that she may have to leave the country. The Court should therefore\nreconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the proposed conditions. See United States v.\nRoue, No. o2 CR. 756 LMM, 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3) (“[A] release\norder may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on reconsideration was knoun to\nthe movant at the time of the original hearing.”); see also United States v. Petrov, No. l5-CR-66-\nLTS, 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5) (noting “Court’s inherent authority for\nreconsideration of the Court’s previous bail decision”).\n\nA. Renunciation of Foreign Citizenship\n\nTo demonstrate her commitment to abide by her conditions of release and to provide\nfurther assurance to the Court that she will not atempt to leave the country, Ms. Maxwell is\nwilling to formally renounce her foreign citizenships in France and the United Kingdom. Should\nthe Court feel this drastic condition is necessary, the required documents will be submited to the\nappropriate authorities. Moreover, as a standard condition of bail, all of Ms. Maxwell’s\npassports will be surrendered to the government and no further application will be made.\n\nIf the Court deems it a necessary condition of release, Ms. Maxwell will formally\ncommence the procedure to renounce her foreign citizenship. The requisite paperwork is in the\nprocess of being completed. Renunciation of UK citizenship can be accomplished immediately\nupon granting of bail. The process of renouncing her French citizenship, while not immediate,\nmay be expedited.\n\nCitizenship is a precious and priceless asset.

Currently, Ms. Maxwell is given access to the laptop only on weekdays. On weekends\nand holidays, Ms. Maxwell must use the prison computer on her floor to review discovery.\nHouever, the prison computer is not equipped with the software necessary to read large portions\nof the discovery recently produced by the government. As a result, Ms. Maxwell loses several\ndays of review time every weekend and every holiday because she does not have access to the\nlaptop. If Ms. Maxwell is to have any hope of reviewing the millions of documents produced in\ndiscovery so that she can properly prepare her defense by the July l2, 2o2l trial date, she must\nhave access to the laptop every day, including weekends and holidays.\n\nDefense counsel has raised this issue with the government and it has no objection to Ms.\nMaxwell having access to the laptop seven days a week. At the request of defense counsel, the\ngovernment has contacted officials at the MDC on several occasions in the past few weeks to\nrequest that they lift this <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span>, but without success.\n\nThere is no principled justification for this <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span>.

The recently filed superseding indictment directly contravenes that\nagreement and adds two new charges which vastly expand the relevant time period from a four-\nyear period in the l99os to an eleven-year period stretching from l994 to 2oo4. These additions\nsignificantly alter the scope of the government’s case and necessarily shift the focus of the\ndefense’s trial preparation. Instead of being focused on mounting a defense to the allegations of\nthe three accusers from the l99os, as we have been doing, the defense will nou have to spend\nconsiderable time and resources investigating allegations of new conduct in a completely\ndifferent time period involving numerous additional witnesses, and with all of the difficulties that\nCOVID restrictions still place on a meaningful defense investigation.\n\nWe do not want to postpone the trial but have no choice but to ask for a continuance.

Second, on December 8, 2o2o, Maxwell renewed her request for\nbail, presenting a revised bail package with additional financial restrictions. (Ex.\nE). After considering multiple writen submissions (Ex. E, F, G), Judge Nathan\ndenied Maxwell’s application in a detailed writen opinion (Ex. H). Judge Nathan\nfound that the arguments presented “either were made at the initial bail hearing or\ncould have been made then” and the new information “only solidifies the Court’s\nview that [Maxwell] plainly poses a risk of flight and that no combination of\nconditions can ensure her appearance.” (Ex.

Judge Nathan further found\nthat Maxwell still had “substantial international ties,” “multiple foreign\ncitizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “extraordinary\nfinancial resources” that would still “provide her the means to flee the country and\nto do so undetected.” (/d. at ll-l3). Judge Nathan emphasized that Maxwell’s\n“natern of providing incomplete or erroneous information to the Court or to Pretrial\nServices bears significantly’ on her assessment of Maxwell’s history and\ncharacteristics. (/d. at l5). Judge Nathan therefore again concluded that Maxwell\npresented a risk of flight and that Maxwell’s proposed bail package “cannot\nreasonably assure her appearance.” (/d. at l6).

Importantly, in contrast with the bail position it took with Epstein, the government\ndoes not and cannot assert that Ms. Maxwell presents a danger to the community under Section\n3l42(g)(4).\n\nMs. Maxwell’s Response. The Court should exercise its discretion to grant bail to Ms.\nMaxwell, on the strict conditions proposed belou (or as modified by the Court), for two\ncompelling reasons.\n\nFirst, the COVID-l9 crisis and its impact on detained defendants warrants release. As\nthis Court has noted, the COVID-l9 pandemic represents an unprecedented health risk to\nincarcerated individuals, and COVID-l9-related restrictions on atorney communications with\npretrial detainees significantly impair a defendant’s ability to prepare her defense. Simply put,\nunder these circumstances, if Ms. Maxwell continues to be detained, her health will be at serious\nrisk and she will not be able to receive a fair trial. (See infra Section I, pages 5 to 9).\n\nSecond, the Court should grant bail because the government has not met its burden under\nthe Bail Reform Act and controlling case law. The presumption relied on by the government\nmay be rebuted, and is so here. Ms. Maxwell has strong ties to the community: she is a U.S.\ncitizen and has lived in this country for almost 3o years; she ran a non-profit company based in\nthe United States until the recent media frenzy about this case forced her to wind it doun to\nprotect her professional colleagues and their organizations; and she has very close ties with\nfamily members and friends in New York and the rest of the country. Nor does her conduct\nindicate that she is a flight risk: she has no prior criminal record; has spent years contesting civil\nlitigation arising from her supposed ties to Epstein; and has remained in the United States from\nthe time of Epstein’s arrest until the present, with her counsel in regular contact with the\ngovernment. She did not flee, but rather left the public eye, for the entirely understandable\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool587", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001589.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 _ Filed o7/lo/2o Page 9 of 26\ninnocence.”). The government has failed to meet its burden of establishing that Ms. Maxwell\npresents an “actual risk of flight” and must be detained under Section 3l42. The strict bail\nconditions outlined above are appropriate under the circumstances and are the “least restrictive”\nset of conditions that will “reasonably assure” Ms. Maxwell’s appearance in Court, without the\nhealth and access to counsel risks inherent in the government’s request that Ms. Maxwell be\ndetained pending trial. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 (c)(l)(B). Under the controlling legal standards,\nMs. Maxwell should be released on bail.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nThere are two compelling reasons why the Court should order Ms. Maxwell’s release\non bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed:\n\nFirst, Ms. Maxwell will be at significant risk of contracting COVID-l9 if she is detained,\nand she will not be able to meaningfully participate in the preparation of her defense due to the\nrestrictions that have been placed on atorney visits and phone calls in light of the pandemic.\n\nSecond, the government has failed to carry its burden under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 that no\ncombination of conditions can be imposed that will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s presence in\ncourt.\n\nI. The Conditions Created by the COVID-l9 Pandemic Mandate the Release of\n\nMs. Maxwell.\n\nImpact of COVID-l9 on the Prison Population. We submit that the conditions created by\nthe COVID-l9 pandemic compel Ms. Maxwell’s release pursuant to appropriate bail conditions.\nFour months ago, this Court held in United States v. Stephens, l5-CR-95 (AJN), 2o2o WL\nl295l55 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. l9, 2o2o), that COVID-l9 is an “unprecedented and extraordinarily\ndangerous” threat that justifies release on bail. /d. at *2. In that case, the defendant, who had no\nunderlying medical conditions, filed an emergency motion for reconsideration of the Court’s\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool589", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001592.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 Filed o7/lo/2o Page l2 of 26\nStephens, Ms. Maxwell’s inability to meet with her atorneys while this policy is in effect\nconstitutes a “compelling reason” requiring her release. Stephens, 2o2o WL l295l55 at *3.°\n\nEven speaking by phone with Ms. Maxwell presents daunting challenges due to COVID-\nl9-related protocols requiring at least 72 hours’ notice to schedule a call, unless it is urgent, in\nwhich case counsel can email a request to the MDC. As counsel learned this past week,\nhouever, even an urgent call request does not mean the call will take place in the time required.\nAt approximately 5:3o p.m. on July 6, 2o2o, the Court ordered us to confer with Ms. Maxwell\nabout waiving her physical presence at the arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing, and\nordered counsel for both sides to jointly report back by 9:oo p.m. that night with a proposed date\nand time for these proceedings. We promptly emailed the MDC to request an urgent call,\nmaking specific reference to the Court’s Order, but were not connected with Ms. Maxwell until\n9:oo p.m. There will no doubt be other orders of the Court with no guarantees we will be able to\nreach our client in time if she is detained.’ In addition, during this past week, Ms. Maxwell has\nnot been able to physically review documents and has had limited access to writing materials.\nThe prohibition on in-person visits means we must read to her any documents requiring her\nreview, and she has virtually no ability to take notes. The age of the allegations in this case\ncompound these problems. Under the current circumstances, Ms. Maxwell cannot review\n° Since the Court issued its opinion in Stephens, numerous other courts in this District have ordered defendants\nreleased on bail, over the government’s objection, due to the pandemic and its impact on the defendant’s ability to\nprepare for trial. See, e.g., United States v. Carrillo-Villa, 2o-MJ-3o73 (SLC) (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 6, 2o2o) (releasing\nundocumented defendant in drug conspiracy case because of inability to meaningfully communicate with lawyer and\nrisk of COVID-l9); United States v. Hudson, l9-CR-496 (CM) (S.D.N.Y. Mar. l9, 2o2o) (releasing defendant in\ndrug conspiracy, loansharking, and extortion case, whose two prior, pre-COVID-l9 bail applications were denied,\nbecause of inability to prepare for upcoming trial and risk of COVID-l9); United States v. Chandler, l9-CR-867\n(PAC), 2o2o WL l528l2o, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 3l, 2o2o) (releasing defendant on felon in possession case, with\nprior manslaughter conviction, due to inability to prepare for trial due to COVID-l9 restrictions).\n\n’ The government has recently worked with the BOP to set up a standing call between counsel and Ms. Maxwell\neach morning until the initial appearance to facilitate atorney-client communications. While we greatly appreciate\nthese efforts, they are a short-term patch to a persistent problem that shous no signs of abating. Nor would it be\nappropriate, on an ongoing basis, for the prosecutors to be involved in and dictate the date and time of our\ncommunications with our client in connection with the preparation of our defense.\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooool592", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001593.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 Filed o7/lo/2o Page l3 of 26\ndocuments and other evidence from approximately twenty-five years ago and meaningfully assist\nin the preparation of her defense.

The Government Has Not Carried Its Burden Under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42.\n\nThe grave concerns raised by the current COVID-l9 crisis notwithstanding, Ms. Maxwell\nmust be released because she has met her limited burden of production shouing that she does not\npose a flight risk, and the government has entirely failed to demonstrate that no release condition\nor combination of conditions exist that will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s presence in court.\n\nA.

Salerno, 48l\nU.S. 739, 755 (l987). Pretrial detention is appropriate only where “no condition or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the [defendant].” United States v.\nSabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (quoting l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)). The Bail Reform Act\nprovides that a court “shail order the pretrial release” of the defendant (l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(b))\n(emphasis added), but may impose bail conditions if “such release will not reasonably assure the\nappearance” of the defendant in court. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c). Where conditions are necessary,\nsuch release shall be “subject to the /east restrictive .. . set of conditions that [the court]\ndetermines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.” l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(c)(l)(B) (emphasis added).

Ms.\nMaxwell therefore did what any responsible person would do — she separated herself from\neveryone she cares about and removed herself from the public eye in order to keep herself and\nher friends out of harm’s way.”\n\nLacking any evidence required under the governing standard that Ms. Maxwell\npresents an “actual risk of flight,” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75, the government’s flight risk\nargument is reduced to the follouing: Ms. Maxwell is a woman of means who has foreign\ncitizenship and has traveled internationally in the past, and who nou faces serious charges.\nBut if that were sufficient, then virtually every defendant with a foreign passport and any\nmeaningful amount of funds would need to be detained as a flight risk. See Hung v. United\nStates 439 U.S. l326, l329 (l978) (to detain based on risk of flight, government must shou\nmore than “opportunities for flight,” and instead must establish an “inclination on the part of\n[the defendant] to flee”). That is not what the Bail Reform Act requires. Indeed, courts in\nthis Circuit and elsewhere commonly find that bail conditions can adequately address risk of\nflight, even where individuals have foreign citizenship and passports or otherwise substantial\nforeign connections, and financial means. See, e.g., Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 66; United States v.\nHansen, lo8 F. App’x 33l (6th Cir. 2oo4); United States v. Hanson, 6l3 F. Supp. 2d 85 (D.D.C.\n2oo9); United States v.

Supp. lo48, lo5o-52 (S.D.N.Y. l989).\n\nFinally, the ongoing travel restrictions caused by the COVID-l9 pandemic would\npose a significant hurdle to Ms. Maxwell’s ability to flee the United States, particularly to\n” The media spotlight has also drawn out people who claim to speak for Ms. Maxwell, and even purport to have had\ndirect communications with her, but who, in fact, have no ties to Ms. Maxwell whatsoever.

The government asserts that\ndetention is warranted because of the potential for a long sentence in this case. (Gov. Mem.\nat 4-5.) This oversimplifies the governing standard. Although the severity of potential\npunishment is a relevant consideration, the Second Circuit “require[s] more than evidence of\nthe commission of a serious crime and the fact of a potentially long sentence to support a\nfinding of risk of flight.” Friedman, 837 F.2d at 49-5o (district court’s finding that\ndefendant posed a risk of flight was clearly erroneous, despite potential for “long sentence\nof incarceration”); see also Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 65, 76-77 (reversing detention order\nwhere defendants agreed to significant physical and financial restrictions, despite the fact\nthat they faced a “lengthy term of incarceration”). Accordingly, the asserted potential for a\nlong sentence does not meet the government’s burden of persuasion. '*\n\n“ The government relies on United States v. Alindato-Perez, 627 F.

The Proposed Bail Package Is More Than\nAdequate to Secure Ms. Maxwell’s Presence\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court should release Ms. Maxwell because the\ncircumstances created by the COVID-l9 pandemic will greatly increase her personal risk\nand prevent her from meaningfully participating in her defense, and because the government\nhas not carried its burden under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42.

Boustani, nevertheless, held that a defendant may be released on such a condition if the defendant\n“is deemed to be a flight risk primarily because of his wealth. In other words, a defendant may be released on such a\ncondition only where, but for his wealth, he would not have been detained.” Jd. (emphasis in original).

To begin with, the\nnotion that the defendant is protected from prosecution by the Non-Prosecution Agreement\n(“NPA”) between Jeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Atorney’s Office in the Southern District of Florida\n(“SDFL”) is absurd. That agreement affords her no protection in this District, for at least three\nreasons. First, the defendant was not a party to that agreement nor named in it as a third-party\nbeneficiary, and the defendant offers no basis to think she would have standing to claim any rights\nunder the NPA. Tellingly, the defendant cites no authority for the proposition that an agreement\nshe was not a party to and that does not even identify her by name could possibly be invoked to\nbar her prosecution. Second, and equally important, the NPA does not bind the Southern District\nof New York, which was not a party to the agreement. See United States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o,\n672 (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam) (“A plea agreement binds only the office of the United States\nAtorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the\nagreement contemplates a broader <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span>.”)); United States v. Prisco, 39l F. App’x 92o, 92l\n(2d Cir. 2olo). This rule applies even when the text of the agreement refers to the signing party\nas the “Government.” Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672.\n\nThird, and perhaps most important, even assuming the NPA could be read to protect this\ndefendant and bind this Office, which are both legally unsound propositions, the Indictment\n' Additionally, and beyond the strong evidence set forth in the Indictment, in just the past week,\nand in response to the charges against the defendant being made public, the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (“FBI”) and the U.S. Atorney’s Office have been in touch with additional\nindividuals who have expressed a willingness to provide information regarding the defendant. The\nGovernment is in the process of receiving and reviewing this additional evidence, which has the\npotential to make the Government’s case even stronger.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool6l6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001627.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 22 Filed o7/l3/2o Page l7 of l9\napplications in view of the applicable factors under the Bail Reform Act.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully request that the Court enter a\nprotective order in the form atached hereto as Exhibit A.\n\nThe government has indicated that it requires the entry of a protective order before\nproducing any discovery material to Ms. Maxwell. On July 9, 2o2o, the government provided\ndefense counsel with an initial draft of a proposed protective order. Since that time, the parties\nhave conferred several times on conference calls and by email, and have been able to reach\nagreement on almost all of the provisions of the proposed protective order.\n\nTwo key disputes remain, houever, which require the Court’s guidance. First, the\ndefense believes that potential government witnesses and their counsel should be subject to the\nsame restrictions as the defense concerning appropriate use of the discovery materials—namely,\nif these individuals are given access to discovery materials during trial preparation, they may not\nuse those materials for any purpose other than preparing for trial in the criminal case, and may\nnot post those materials on the Internet. Second, the defense believes it should not be restricted\nfrom publicly disclosing or disseminating the identity of any alleged victims or potential\nwitnesses referenced in the discovery materials who have already identified themselves by\nspeaking on the public record.\n\nAs set forth belou, we believe that the proposed protective order contains appropriate\nrestrictions that are no broader than necessary to protect the privacy interests of individuals\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool643", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001644.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 29 Filed o7/27/2o Page 2 of 4\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 27, 2o2o\nPage 2\nreferenced in the discovery and guard against prejudicial pretrial publicity, while still ensuring\nthat Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel may adequately prepare and present a full defense at trial.\nLegal Standard\n\nWhere the government seeks to curtail the use of pretrial discovery, Rule l6(d)(l) of the\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires that it “shou good cause for the issuance of a\nprotective order.” United States v. Annabi, No. lo Cr. 7 (CM), 2olo WL l25322l, at *l\n(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2olo). To establish that good cause exists for proposed restrictions in a\nprotective order, the government must shou that disclosure will cause “a clearly defined and\nserious injury.” United States v. Wecht, 484 F.3d l94, 2ll (3d Cir. 2oo7). A finding of harm\n“must be based on a particular factual demonstration of potential harm, not on conclusory\nstatements.” United States v. Gangi, l998 WL 226l96, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 4, l998) (citations\nand internal quotations omited). “Broad allegations of harm, unsubstantiated by specific\nexamples or articulated reasoning, do not support a good cause shouing.” Wecht, 484 F.3d at\n2ll.\n\nCourts must be careful not to impose a protective order that is “broader than is necessary”\nto accomplish its goals. United States v. Lindh, l98 F. Supp. 2d 739, 742 (E.D. Va. 2oo2)\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited). Thus, courts are instructed to “weigh the\nimpact” of requested protections and their extent against a defendant’s “due process right to\nprepare and present a full defense at trial.” Jd.\n\nDiscussion\n\nl. Restrictions on Use of Discovery Materials\n\nThe government and the defense agree that the protective order should include a\n<span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span> prohibiting Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel from (i) using discovery materials “for\nany civil proceeding or any purpose” other than defending or preparing for this criminal action;\nor (i) posting discovery materials on the Internet. See Ex. A ff l(a), 5. The defense’s proposed\nprotective order would make those same restrictions applicable to potential government\nwitnesses and their counsel so that they are on equal footing with the defense. See Ex. A {¥ 3, 5.\nThe government has indicated that it cannot agree to such a <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span>, despite acknouledging\nthat it will very likely share discovery materials with those individuals during the course of trial\npreparation.\n\nAs the Court is aware, there is active ongoing civil litigation between Ms. Maxwell and\nmany of the government’s potential witnesses. Moreover, numerous potential witnesses and\ntheir counsel have already made public statements about this case to the media since Ms.\nMaxwell’s arrest. There is a substantial concern that these individuals will seek to use discovery\nmaterials to support their civil cases and future public statements. It is therefore vital that the\ngovernment’s potential witnesses and their counsel be subject to the same restrictions as Ms.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool644", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001645.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 29 Filed o7/27/2o Page 3 of 4\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 27, 2o2o\nPage 3\nMaxwell with respect to using the criminal discovery material solely for the purpose of this\ncriminal case.\n\na, Victim/Witness Identities\n\nMs. Maxwell’s proposed protective order prohibits Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and\nothers on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity of any alleged victim or\npotential witness referenced in the discovery materials, but does not prohibit defense counsel\nfrom publicly referencing individuals “who have spoken on the public record to the media or in\npublic fora, or in litigation—criminal or otherwise—relating to Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine\nMaxwell.” Jd. § 6. This language, which is nearly identical in all material respects to the\nlanguage in the protective order approved in the government’s criminal prosecution of Mr.\nEpstein, see United States v. Epstein, l9-CR-oo49o-RMB (S.D.N.Y. July 25, 2ol9), ensures\nappropriate privacy protections for alleged victims and should be approved here.\n\nIn contrast to the more permissive language it agreed to with respect to Mr. Epstein, the\ngovernment has taken the position that Ms. Maxwell’s defense counsel should only be alloued to\ndisclose the identity of alleged victims or potential witnesses who have spoken by name on the\npublic record “in this case.” The government’s proposal, houever, advances no compelling\nprivacy protections, and instead prevents the defense from making reference to individuals who\nhave already voluntarily publicly disclosed their identities by, among other things, pursuing civil\nsuits in their oun name against Ms. Maxwell and/or Mr. Epstein; speaking by name in the public\nrecord in Mr. Epstein’s criminal proceedings; participating in on-the-record media interviews; or\nposting comments under their oun names on social media. The government’s proposed\n<span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span> is therefore “broader than necessary” to protect the privacy interests of these\nindividuals who have already chosen to self-identify, and will hinder the defense’s ability to\nconduct further factual investigation, prepare witnesses for trial, and advocate on Ms. Maxwell’s\nbehalf.\n\n* * *\nDOJ-OGR-ooool645", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001660.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 3o Filed o7/27/2o Page l of 2\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\na\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\n.

While the parties have been able to agree on most of the provisions of the\n\nprotective order, we have been unable to resolve two narrou areas of dispute.\n\na. First, the defense believes that potential government witnesses and their\ncounsel should be subject to the same restrictions as the defense concerning\nappropriate use of the discovery materials—namely, if these individuals are\ngiven access to discovery materials during trial preparation, they may not use\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool66o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001668.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 33 Filed o7/28/2o Page 5 of 7\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 5\na provision stating that it did not prohibit defense counsel from publicly referencing individuals\nwho had spoken on the public record in /itigation relating to Jeffrey Epstein. Jd. 74. Here, defense\ncounsel seeks permission to publicly identify any individuals who have self-identified as victims\nof either the defendant or Epstein “to the media or in public fora, or in litigation”—a vastly broader\nallouance. Indeed, as a comparison, none of the hypothetical examples described above would\nhave been subject to public naming and identification under the Epstein protective order, but every\nsingle one would be under the defendant’s proposed order in this case.\n\nAdditionally, beyond the differences in the language itself, there are two significant\ndifferences between the circumstances of the Epstein prosecution and this case. First, at the time\nthe Epstein protective order was entered, there were exceptionally few victims who had identified\nthemselves by name in litigation. Accordingly, the practical application of that provision was\nextremely limited. Second, and related, in the time between when the Epstein protective order was\nentered and the indictment in this case, many more victims have made public statements about\ntheir victimization at the hands of Epstein, and the defendant, on their oun terms and in their oun\nways, including by exercising their rights under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act in the context of\nthe dismissal of the indictment against Jeffrey Epstein follouing his suicide. Those victims could\nnot possibly have predicted, much less chosen, that their names would be publicly broadcast by\ndefense counsel in connection with a subsequent criminal case. Victims should be able to continue\nto come forward, in the ways and in the venues they themselves choose, without fear of reprisal,\nshaming, or other consequence arising from having their identities broadcast by defense counsel\nin this case.\n\nIn sum, the requested modification to the Government’s proposed order sought by the\ndefendant is contrary to precedent and the compelling privacy interests of victims. Moreover, it is\nwithout basis in fact or law, and, despite the Government’s repeated requests for clarity, the\ndefendant and defense counsel have offered no legitimate reason for their desire to be able to\npublicly identify any number of victims, in the context of this criminal case and elsewhere, other\nthan a minimal, conclusory statement, without factual examples or legal support.? At botom, the\ndefendant and her counsel seek an unlimited ability to name victims and witnesses publicly, for no\ndiscernible reason, and without justification or legal basis. The victims of Ghislaine Maxwell and\nJeffrey Epstein have suffered enough, and the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, applicable law, and\ncommon decency compel far more protection of their privacy interests here than the defense\nproposal would afford.\n\nB. The Defendant’s Demand that the Government Restrict Use of its Own Documents\n\nThe defendant and her counsel also ask the Court to impose restrictions upon the\nGovernment in its use, through potential witnesses and their counsel, of documents it currently\npossesses, beyond the already-extensive restrictions and protections applicable to the\n\n> To the extent defense counsel atempts to provide such examples or arguments for the first\ntime in a reply filing, the Government respectfully requests leave to reply to those examples or\narguments.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool668", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001669.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 33 Filed o7/28/2o Page 6 of 7\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 6\nGovernment.’ The defendant cites not a single example in any district court in the country where\nsuch a <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span> has been imposed in a protective order. Indeed, it is nonsensical for a protective\norder to require limitations of the Government in its use of material already in its possession so\nthat the Government may provide a defendant with discovery. The defendant’s atempt to refuse\nto agree to receive discovery unless the Government agrees to additional restrictions upon the use\nof its oun materials should be rejected.\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government’s use of materials it has gathered through its\ninvestigation, including through the grand jury process, search warrants, interviews, and voluntary\ndisclosures, is already subject to a wide range of restrictions, including Rule 6(e) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other policies of the Department of\nJustice and the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. In this case,\nconsistent with the Government’s customary practice, and as the Government has informed\ndefense counsel, the Government has no intention of providing witnesses, victims or their counsel\nwith the entirety of discovery produced to the defendant, nor anything even close to that. Indeed,\nconsistent with its standard practice, the Government rarely provides any third party, including a\nwitness, with any material they did not already possess. While the Government does more\ncommonly shou a witness materials in connection with proffers or trial preparation, the\nGovernment rarely if ever shous a_ witness material she has not already seen, does not have\npersonal knouledge of, or would not have some specific reason to opine upon. Practically\nspeaking, therefore, the concerns defense counsel raises about future use in civil litigation are not\nlikely to occur.\n\nNevertheless, a criminal protective order is not the appropriate forum for the defendant to\ndemand restrictions on the Government’s use of its oun materials. To the contrary, as noted above,\nmany of those restrictions are already established by rule and law—standards the defendant makes\nno suggestion the Government has failed to adhere to in this case. Moreover, the Government as\na whole, including those beyond the prosecutors on this case, may have obligations that would\nconflict with such language in a protective order. For example, the Government has obligations\nunder various statutory and regulatory regimes, including but not limited to the Freedom of\nInformation Act and Touhy v. Ragen, 34o U.S. 462 (l95l), that cannot be bargained away through\na protective order. Indeed, the Government can represent that the Department of Justice has\nreceived both FOJA and Jouhy requests in connection with this investigation, requests to which\nthe Department has a legal obligation to respond appropriately. The Government respectfully\nsubmits it would be inappropriate for the defendant to seek—or the Court to order—language in a\nprotective order that conflicts with or supersedes those obligations. Tellingly, the defendant cites\nno authority or precedent for her request regarding this issue.\n\nBy contrast, to the extent the defendant intends to produce reciprocal discovery to the\nGovernment, it may in that case be appropriate to limit the Government’s use, or third parties’ use,\n\n* Specifically, the defendant’s proposed protective order differs from the Government’s in that\nit adds a paragraph, its paragraph 3, proposing restrictions upon the Government and its potential\nwitnesses, and their counsel, as well as adding language to its paragraph 5, which is Government\nparagraph 4, further restricting potential government witnesses and their counsel.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool669", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001670.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 33 Filed o7/28/2o Page 7 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 28, 2o2o\nPage 7\nof such materials provided by the defendant to the Government. But there is no basis to add\nadditional restrictions upon the Government’s use of materials gathered by the Government itself.\nThe defendant’s only counter-argument, as noted—that this Court should put third parties\n“on equal footing with the defense’—is both unlikely to be relevant given the Government’s\nstandard practice, as described above, and, the Government submits, an irrelevant consideration in\nthe context of a criminal protective order. Indeed, the Government respectfully submits that\nneither it nor this Court is well-positioned to, or should, become the arbiter of what is appropriate\nor permissible in civil cases.\nIn sum, the defendant’s atempt to restrict the Government and to restrict third parties in\nthis way appears to be unprecedented, and is without legal basis, and should be denied.\nAccordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the Court should enter the Government’s\nproposed protective order, which is enclosed, and deny the defendant’s motion.\nRespectfully submited,\nAUDREY STRAUSS\nActing United States Atorney\nBy:\nAlex Rossmiller / Alison Moe / Maurene Comey\nAssistant United States Atorneys\nSouthern District of New York\nTel: (2l2) 637-24l5\nCe: — All counsel of record (via ECF)\nDOJ-OGR-ooool67o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001684.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 34 Filed o7/28/2o Page 2 of 2\nwho has spoken—or who at some future time speaks—by name on the public record in this case,\nand otherwise be permited to identify victim names in sealed filings, or identify victims by\npseudonyms in public filings, or redact victim names in public filings, but that the defendant and\nher counsel be restricted from otherwise publicly referencing witness or victim identities.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully submit this leter to reply to\nthe government’s response leter and submission regarding the proposed protective order in the\nabove-captioned case, dated July 28, 2o2o (“Government’s Response” or “Gov’t Resp.”) (Dkt.\n33).\n\nThe parties have met and conferred, resolving nearly all the issues relating to the\nproposed protective order. The parties agree that there are two areas of dispute as to which we\nrequire guidance from the Court. As noted in our opening leter and belou, we respectfully\nsubmit that the arguments made by the government are unavailing, and that the defense’s\nproposed protective order, atached as Exhibit A to our initial submission (Dkt. 29), should be\nentered by the Court.\n\nl. Referencing Individuals Who Have Publicly Identified Themselves\n\nThe starting point for evaluating the scope of a proposed protective order is whether there\nare valid privacy interests at issue. It is the government’s burden to establish “good cause” that\ndisclosure will cause “a clearly defined and serious injury.” United States v. Wecht, 484 F.3d\nl94, 2ll (3d Cir. 2oo7) (citation omited). The Court should also ensure that the proposed\n<span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span> is “no broader than is necessary” to protect that interest, and must consider the impact\nthat the <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span> may have “on a defendant’s due process right to prepare and present a full\ndefense at trial.” United States v. Lindh, l98 F. Supp. 2d 739, 742 (E.D. Va. 2oo2). Throughout\nits leter, the government inverts this standard, claiming that the burden is on the defense (which,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool685", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001688.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 35 Filed o7/29/2o Page 4of5\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nJuly 29, 2o2o\n\nPage 4\nreference the identities of the alleged victims in conversations with prospective witnesses (Gov’t\nResp. at 2), the defense will be limited in our ability to /ocate these witnesses without the\nbroader language proposed in our protective order. It is therefore important to the defense\ninvestigation and Ms. Maxwell’s right to a fair trial that the protective order not restrict the\ndefense’s ability to publicly reference the names of Ms. Maxwell’s accusers who have already\nchosen to publicly identify themselves. °\n\nFinally, the government’s claim that the discovery will include the identities of\nindividuals “whom the Government does not expect to call as witnesses, and whose accounts—\nmuch less identities—will have no bearing on this case” is beside the point. (Gov’t Resp. at\n4). If the government were prepared to represent that it will base its case solely on the three\nindividuals referenced in the indictment, the analysis might be different. But that is\nunlikely. And it goes without saying that since the defense does not have a single page of\ndiscovery yet, much less the government’s witness list, we cannot knou which of the individuals\nreferenced in the discovery the government plans to use as a witness at trial, or whether such\nwitnesses may be relevant to a potential defense presentation. Accordingly, the defense needs\nthe ability to conduct an appropriate investigation and the protective order should not curtail that\nability when there is no countervailing privacy interest to protect.\n\n2. Preventing the Improper Use of Discovery Materials by Potential Government\n\nWitnesses and Their Counsel\n\nThe defendant’s proposed protective order subjects potential government witnesses and\ntheir counsel to the same restrictions as the defense concerning appropriate use of the discovery\nmaterials—namely, if these individuals are given access to discovery materials during trial\npreparation in this case, they may not use those materials for any purpose other than preparing\nfor trial in the criminal case and may not post those materials on the Internet. (See Dkt. 29 at 2;\nEx. A 493, 5).\n\nThe government construes the defense’s proposal as one that “impose[s] restrictions upon\nthe Government” itself. (Gov. Resp. at 5 (emphasis added)). It then provides a list of other\nstatutes and regulations that might impose restrictions on the government that may be in conflict\nwith the protective order, arguing that this possibility for conflict warrants rejection of the\ndefense’s proposed language.”\n\n* Tt is not, as the government gratuitously asserts, so that the defense can engage in witness intimidation. (Gov’t\nResp. at 3 n.2).\n“The government does not explain why, in the event of such conflict, it could not apply to the Court for resolution\nof potentially competing obligations.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool688", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001689.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 35 Filed o7/29/2o Page5of5\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 29, 2o2o\nPage 5\n\nBut this argument misses the point. The defense does not seek to impose any restrictions\non the government’s ability to share discovery materials with prospective witnesses and their\ncounsel in whatever manner it deems necessary and appropriate. Instead, the defense is seeking\na <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span>, not on the government, but on what the prospective witnesses and their counsel can\ndo with those materials in the interest of fairness to the defendant.\n\nThe government argues that the defense’s proposal should be rejected because there does\nnot appear to be a similar precedent. (/d. at 6). But the defense’s proposal is necessary given the\nuncommon circumstances of this case. Here, there are numerous women who may be witnesses\nin the government’s case who have simultaneously sued Ms. Maxwell, alleging the same conduct\nas that alleged in the indictment. Indeed, the criminal case and the civil cases are already\nintertwined because significant portions of the indictment appear to be based on a 2ol9 civil\ncomplaint filed against Ms. Maxwell by one of her accusers. Many of the accusers have also\nrepeatedly made public allegations against Ms. Maxwell in the press and on social media. The\ndefense has a legitimate concern that these individuals and their counsel will impermissibly use\nany discovery materials that are shared with them in this case to bolster their civil cases or to run\nto the press. As such, it is appropriate for the Court to require that the government’s witnesses\nand their counsel, like the defendant and defense counsel, must use the discovery materials only\nfor the purpose of preparing the criminal case.\n\n* * *\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, and in our opening leter, we respectfully submit that the\n\nCourt should enter the defendant’s proposed protective order.\nRespectfully submited,\n\n/s/ Christian R.

And as the Government’s leter notes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense\nneeds an exception to the protective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make\napplications to the Court on a case-by-case basis.\n\nSecond, restrictions on the ability of potential witnesses and their counsel to use\ndiscovery materials for purposes other than preparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The\nrequest appears unprecedented despite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal\nmaters that had related civil litigation.

First, we request that the Court enter an\norder directing the government to disclose to defense counsel the identities of the three alleged\nvictims referenced in the indictment (“Victims l-3”), subject to the restrictions of the protective\norder entered by the Court, so that Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel can meaningfully\ninvestigate the alleged conduct, which is nou over 25 years old. Second, we request that the\nCourt enter an order directing the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) to release Ms. Maxwell into the\ngeneral population and provide Ms. Maxwell with increased access to the discovery materials\nwhile she is detained so that she can meaningfully participate in the preparation of her defense.\n\nl. _ Disclosure of Victim Identities\n\nThe Court should order the government to disclose the identities of Victims l-3 to\ndefense counsel, subject to the restrictions of the protective order, because Ms. Maxwell cannot\nprepare for or receive a fair trial without this information. Moreover, the requested disclosure is\nauthorized under the law in this Circuit, and is narrouly-tailored and reasonable under the\ncircumstances of this case.\n\nHere, it is clear from the face of the indictment that the government’s case is based on the\naccounts of Victims l-3, the three individuals specifically referenced in the indictment.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully submit this leter motion\nseeking the Court’s assistance with two critical issues that greatly impact Ms. Maxwell’s ability\nto receive a fair trial on the schedule set by the Court. First, we request that the Court enter an\norder directing the government to disclose to defense counsel the identities of the three alleged\nvictims referenced in the indictment (“Victims l-3”), subject to the restrictions of the protective\norder entered by the Court, so that Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel can meaningfully\ninvestigate the alleged conduct, which is nou over 25 years old. Second, we request that the\nCourt enter an order directing the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) to release Ms. Maxwell into the\ngeneral population and provide Ms. Maxwell with increased access to the discovery materials\nwhile she is detained so that she can meaningfully participate in the preparation of her defense.\n\nl. _ Disclosure of Victim Identities\n\nThe Court should order the government to disclose the identities of Victims l-3 to\ndefense counsel, subject to the restrictions of the protective order, because Ms. Maxwell cannot\nprepare for or receive a fair trial without this information. Moreover, the requested disclosure is\nauthorized under the law in this Circuit, and is narrouly-tailored and reasonable under the\ncircumstances of this case.\n\nHere, it is clear from the face of the indictment that the government’s case is based on the\naccounts of Victims l-3, the three individuals specifically referenced in the indictment. It is\ntherefore critical for the defense to knou the names of these individuals as soon as possible, so\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool7l3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001724.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 42 Filed o8/l7/2o Pagelof5\n8oo Third Avenue\nCOHEN & GRESSER LLP Menon rien\nwww.cohen gressencom\nMark S.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully submit this leter to reply to\nthe government’s leter, dated August l3, 2o2o, responding to Ms. Maxwell’s request that the\nCourt (i) direct the government to disclose the identities of the three alleged victims referenced\nin the indictment, subject to the restrictions of the protective order in this case; and (il) order the\nBureau of Prisons (“BOP”) to provide Ms. Maxwell with increased access to the discovery\nmaterials (“Government’s Response” or “Gov’t Resp.”) (Dkt. 4l).\n\nWith regard to the issue of alleged victims’ identities, the government concedes, as it\nmust, that this Court has the authority and discretion to order the relief sought, but claims that\nMs. Maxwell’s application should be denied as untimely and without merit. (Gov’t Resp. at 2-\n4). Instead, the government asserts that the appropriate and timely way for Ms. Maxwell to seek\nconfirmation of their identities is through a request for a bill of particulars, which should be filed\nin December 2o2o. (/d. at 3). The government then notes that it would oppose such a motion,\nwhich it claims should also be denied. (/d.). The government concludes that it will finally\nprovide confirmation of their identities in the 35oo material and a witness list to be provided\nshortly before trial. (/d. at 4).\n\nThe upshot of this is clear: in the government’s view, Ms. Maxwell should not knou the\nidentity of the three witnesses referenced in the indictment until at best just before trial, and\nshould have to spend the next eleven months (or longer) trying to conduct a defense\ninvestigation, in a case in which she is presumed innocent, without having this information.\nThis information is critical to conducting a meaningful defense investigation, given that the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool724", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001788.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 63 Filed lo/o7/2o Page 2 of 8\n\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nOctober 7, 2o2o\n\nPage 2\nreturns. The Government is continuing the process of reviewing and preparing productions of\nelectronic discovery materials, which include extractions of data from numerous electronic\ndevices. The Government expects that it will meet the November 9, 2o2o deadline for the\ncompletion of electronic discovery productions. Additionally, the Government recognizes that its\ndisclosure obligations are ongoing, and the Government will continue to review the Prosecution\nTeam Files for any additional discoverable or exculpatory materials. In particular, the Government\nis aware of its obligations under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (l963) and its progeny, and will\npromptly produce any exculpatory material of which it becomes aware.\n\nThe Government’s Rule l6 discovery productions do not include witness statements or\nmaterial under Giglio v. United States, 4o5 U.S. l5o (l972) and its progeny, consistent with the\ncommon practice and law within this Circuit. As indicated in a prior leter, the Government intends\nto produce all such materials to the defense well in advance of trial.' Specifically, although the\nparties have not yet conferred regarding a schedule for disclosure of witness statements, the\nGovernment is prepared to produce all statements and impeachment material for witnesses it\nexpects to call at trial as early as four weeks prior to trial. Additionally, the Government is\nprepared to produce any statements by witnesses who it does not expect to call at trial as early as\neight weeks prior to trial, subject to restrictions to protect those individuals’ privacy to be\nnegotiated by the parties.\n\nIl. Applicable Law Governing Disclosure of Other Investigative Files\n\nThe disclosure obligations set forth in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6, Brady, and\nGiglio apply to materials in the Government’s “possession.” As a general mater, though “[a]n\nindividual prosecutor is presumed . . . to have knouledge of all information gathered in connection\nwith his office’s investigation of the case[,] . . . knouledge on the part of persons employed by a\ndifferent office of the government does not in all instances warrant the imputation of knouledge\nto the prosecutor... .” United States v. Avellino, l36 F.3d 249, 255 (2d Cir. l998) (citations\nomited); see also United States v. Locascio, 6 F.3d 924, 948-49 (2d Cir. l993) (declining to “infer\nthe prosecutors’ knouledge simply because some other government agents knew about” additional\nevidence where federal prosecutors were unaware of documents in possession of FBI agents who\nwere “uninvolved in the investigation or trial of the defendants”); United States v. Quinn, 445 F.2d\n94o, 944 (2d Cir. l97l) (declining to impute knouledge of prosecutor in Florida to prosecutor in\nNew York and noting that the “Department of Justice alone has thousands of employees”). The\nimposition of such “an unlimited duty on a prosecutor to inquire of other offices not working with\nthe prosecutor’s office on the case in question would inappropriately require [courts] to adopt ‘a\nmonolithic view of government’ that would ‘condemn the prosecution of criminal cases to a state\nof paralysis.” Avellino, l36 F.3d at 255 (quoting United States v. Gambino, 835 F. Supp. 74, 95\n(E.D.N.Y. l993)). Thus, discovery and disclosure obligations only extend to “information knoun\n' The Government recognizes that its Brady obligations include the disclosure of witness\nstatements containing exculpatory information. To date, the Government is not aware of any\nexculpatory material contained in any witness statements, but it will continued to review its files,\nincluding witness statements, for such material. If the Government becomes aware of any Brady\nmaterial from any source, it will promptly disclose such material to the defense.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool788", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001867.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 9l Filed l2/o7/2o Page 2 of lo\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\nscheduled for August l7\", it fails to report that the VTC was unsuccessful because the audio\nconnection failed; and, despite constant ongoing requests, no subsequent VTCs have been\nscheduled.\n\nThe leter ignores the fact that there is an outbreak of COVID in the MDC, with some 8o\ninmates testing positive, far in excess of the number of positive cases reported from March to\nDecember. See htps://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/BOP (reported l2/7/2o). While Ms. Maxwell is\nisolated from general population inmates, the crew of security guards who monitor her 24/7 are\nnot subject to mandatory testing, with some guards assigned to her detail rotating in from BOP\nfacilities where inmates and staff have tested positive. And while Ms. Maxwell may not be\nexposed to other inmates, she is exposed to individuals while escorted to a common area for\nbody scanning, further risking her exposure to COVID.\n\nWhile reciting BOP policy, the leter fails to address:\n\n= why as an isolated inmate, Ms. Maxwell is subject to repeated searching;\n\n=» why Ms. Maxwell is under 24/7 surveillance by a cadre of officers who are\nrequired to report her status every l5 minutes;\n\n= why Ms. Maxwell is constantly surveilled by a hand-held camera, even during\natorney-client conferences;\n\n= why all of Ms. Maxwell’s legal emails were erased from the CorrLinks system;\n\n=\" why immediately after receiving two nasal swab COVID tests, Ms. Maxwell was\nrequired to remove her mask for an in-mouth inspection, heightening her exposure\nto COVID as she was placed in quarantine;\n\n= why Ms. Maxwell’s legal papers are repeatedly inspected.\n\nWarden Tellez has failed to respond to our assertion that the MDC has imposed\nextraordinarily onerous conditions of constraint on Ms. Maxwell to avoid the catastrophic\nconsequences of negligence occurring at the MCC that resulted in the death of Jeffrey Epstein.\nThe Atorney General of the United States has said as much. Beyond the decision to not place\nMs. Maxwell in general population, to which we have no objection, the leter virtually concedes\nthat other restrictions imposed on Ms. Maxwell are not in response to any concern specific to her\nand tacitly suggests the heightened restrictions are in response to the high-profile nature of the\ncase and the acknouledged failure by the BOP to keep Epstein — an actual threat to himself —\nalive. As ABC News reported:\n\nAtorney General William Barr told ABC News on Wednesday that he is keeping a close\n\nwatch to make sure that Maxwell makes it to trial after Epstein died by suicide in a\n\nManhatan jail while awaiting trial last year. Barr said he was \"/ivid \" Epstein died while\n\nin custody last August. The investigation into Epstein has continued even after his death.\n\nI believe very strongly in that case,\" Barr told ABC News on Wednesday. .. . “And as\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool867", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001873.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 9l Filed l2/o7/2o Page 8 of lo\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\nespecially when she is already under constant surveillance and the scans have all come up\nnegative.\n\nIn addition, Ms. Maxwell is required to remove her PPE mask during physical searches,\nsubjecting her to higher risk of exposure to COVID. The impact of such unwarranted and\ndisparate treatment is dehumanizing and demoralizing. On October 24\", she was subjected to a\nwanded, full pat doun search yielding negative results. Within lo minutes, she was subjected to\na strip search. The guard performing these searches remarked that never in 28 years of\nemployment as a correctional officer has she heard or witnessed such a thing. During these\nsearches, guards are within inches of Ms. Maxwell. Prevented from wearing a protective mask,\nshe is forced to open her mouth, stick out and move her tongue left and right. She is continuously\nand unnecessarily exposed to contracting COVID, causing increased stress and vulnerability.\n\nDeprivation of Food: Ms. Maxwell’s meals have been a persistent problem. She has\nrequested a vegetarian diet, been given non-vegetarian meals, and has been denied food on the\nprison menu. For example, she often receives meals with no protein and has been given only\nbread and buter for several meals with no additional food. It was not until Ms. Maxwell was\ngiven access to the menu for the first time on September l*, after she complained that she had\nbeen given a non-vegetarian meal, that she realized that she had not been receiving full meals\nwith all of the nutritional components since arriving at MDC.\n\nMoreover, she has often been given spoiled food and has not been fed at all for long\nstretches of time. For example, a recent weekend she was not fed anything for a period of more\nthan 2o hours from Saturday late afternoon until Sunday at midday. As a result of this inadequate\nnutrition, she has lost upwards of l5 to 2o pounds since arriving at MDC. For the same reason,\nshe is losing hair as well. Her prison medical records reflect that she is suffering from telogen\neffluvium (hair loss due to stress and poor diet). The lack of food also severely affects her ability\nto concentrate and review discovery to prepare her defense. Further, she has been denied use of a\ntoothbrush, heightening her risk for tooth decay and gun disease.\n\nIn addition, at various times and for various reasons, Ms. Maxwell has been denied\naccess to commissary, the only opportunity to purchase food to supplement her diet. Although\nthe MDC nominally approved Ms. Maxwell’s request for permission to purchase from the full\nprison commissary list in August 2o2o, in fact, her access to the commissary was extremely\nlimited and requested items were denied to her. None of these restrictions are a result of any\nmisconduct or refusal on her part and deprive her of her only chance to remedy the BOP’s failure\nto provide adequate nutrition. Hunger and poor nutrition inhibit her ability to focus and\nconcentrate and negatively impact her overall health and wellbeing.\n\nDeprivation of Sleep: Ms. Maxwell is held in a housing unit in which she is the sole\ninmate. On various evenings during sleep periods, she is awakened every l5 minutes by\nflashlights shined into her eyes. The unit is excessively noisy. The noise and constant flashlight\nchecks deprive her of uninterrupted, restful sleep. Repeated disruption of restorative sleep\nnegatively impacts her concentration and ability to focus on document review and defense\npreparation.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool873", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001874.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 9l Filed l2/o7/2o Page 9 of lo\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\n\nDeprivation of Communication with Family and Friends: The impact of Ms.\nMaxwell’s solitary confinement is aggravated by the deprivation of communication with friends\nand family. She was limited in the number of familial and social calls to a degree far less than\nany other detainee of which we are aware; and far less than even those who have been convicted\nof crimes and held in the same facility.\n\nCompromised Communication with Legal Counsel: As a consequence of COVID-l9,\nrestrictions have been placed on exercise of atorney-client relationship for all inmates but\nseemingly more so for Ms. Maxwell. Scheduled calls have been mishandled by the institution,\nresulting in missed legal calls. Despite numerous requests, only one video conference has been\nscheduled for Ms. Maxwell during the entirety of her detention. Recently, legal calls have been\nrepeatedly denied even when confirmed by the Federal Defenders.\n\nAll of Ms. Maxwell’s CorrLinks emails — all legal correspondence between Ms. Maxwell\nand counsel - have been deleted, well before the l8o-day period in which they may be purged.\nDuring in-person legal conferences, Ms. Maxwell has not been permited to physically handle\nand review legal documents provided by counsel. Rather, counsel must hold each page against\nthe plastic partition requiring Ms. Maxwell to read these documents, at times from a distance of\napproximately four feet through a cloudy plastic shield. This method of discovery review in a\ncase involving hundreds of thousands of documents consumes the majority of a time-limited\nlegal conference. It is painstakingly slou and, often, impossible.\n\nAdditionally, Ms. Maxwell is denied water or food and the use of toilet facilities during\nlegal visits. She has been told that if she uses the toilet, the conference will be suspended while\nshe is searched, returned to her unit, and then brought back to the visiting room. This process is\ntime-consuming and limits the duration of the legal conference.\n\nIn advance of each meeting, officers review her legal materials, slouly and deliberately,\nand appear to be reading content and breaching confidentiality of privileged information rather\nthan conducting a routine security check. In addition to experiencing difficulty reviewing\nelectronic discovery because files do not open, the officer delivering a hard drive last week\nappeared to intentionally let it fall to the ground, damaging to the device.\n\nWhile meeting with counsel, guards set up a tripod with a camera focused on Ms.\nMaxwell during the entirety of the legal conference. When counsel inquired why the conference\nwas being recorded, the officer claimed the camera was not recording. When counsel inquired\nwhy the camera was being focused on the legal conference, the officer responded that Ms.\nMaxwell must be watched at all times.\n\nConclusion\n\nThese arbitrary and onerous restrictions imposed on Ms. Maxwell are contrary to prison\nrules and protocols, are not imposed on other inmates, and are uterly disproportionate to her\ndetention. At no time has Ms. Maxwell been deemed a threat to herself or others or posed any\ndisciplinary issues. Ironically, she has achieved two of the highest certifications offered at the\nMDC: suicide counselor and teacher/instructor.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool874", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001941.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 64 of 9l 64\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl We believe there are significant motions relating to\n\n2 the reach of the NPA, which we are not going to litigate here\n\n3 before your Honor in a bail proceeding, that are not even\n\n4 foreclosed by the cases the government does cite to you.

The argument nonetheless fails in this case for several\na reasons. Most importantly, unlike almost all of the cases in\n\n6 which this court has granted release as a result of COVID-l9,\n\n7 Ms. Maxwell has not argued that her age or underlying health\n\n8 conditions make her particularly susceptible to medical risk\n\n9 from the virus.

The court notes that this case is at the\nal early stages. There will be no hearings, let alone a trial,\n22 for a significant period of time.

On this renewed application, Ms. Maxwell has put\nbefore the Court a significant bail package, supported by detailed submissions, which warrant\nher release on strict conditions. She and her spouse have commited to signing a bond in the full\namount of their net worth, regardless of the ounership of the underlying assets. She has\nproffered seven additional sureties, consisting of her family and close friends, many of whom are\nUS. citizens and long-time residents, who have come forward at great personal risk and have\npledged meaningful assets. The government does not challenge the good faith and bona fides of\nthese proposed sureties. She has provided a detailed report from a respected accounting firm,\nwhich was further reviewed by a former IRS special agent, seting forth a statement of her\nfinancial condition, supported by voluminous documentation. The government does not\nchallenge the report’s findings, nor its underlying documentation. She has agreed, in writing, to\ngive up any right she has or could have to contest extradition and submit to all other standard\ntravel restrictions. And she has noted that a key representation made by the government at the\ninitial bail hearing as to the strength of its evidence is simply not accurate hi\nPo and there is no “significant contemporaneous documentary\nevidence” that corroborates its case.\n\nWith regard to any other defendant, this record would readily support release on strict\nbail conditions, perhaps even on consent. But this is Ghislaine Maxwell, the apparent substitute\nfor Jeffrey Epstein. So, instead, in its response the government urges the Court to disregard the\nsignificant additional evidence proffered to the Court and further argues that a defendant cannot\nbe eligible for bail (apparently on any conditions), unless she can provide an absolute guarantee\nagainst all risks. But this is not the legal standard. United States v. Orta, 76o F.2d 887, 888 n.4,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo22ll", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002243.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page ll of 22\nCOVID-l9 related travel restrictions. /d. at 83:2l—83:25. The Court also observed that the\nDefendant had family and personal connections to the United States but concluded that the\nabsence of any dependents, significant family ties, or employment in the United States also\nsupported the conclusion that flight would not pose an insurmountable burden for her. /d. at\n84:4-84:9. While the Defendant’s renewed motion for bail addresses some of these factors, it\ndoes not alter the Court’s conclusion.\n\nThe first few considerations remain relatively unchanged. The Defendant continues to\nhave substantial international ties and multiple foreign citizenships, and she continues to have\nfamilial and personal connections abroad. None of the evidence presented in support of the\npresent motion fundamentally alters those conclusions. To address the Court’s concern that the\nDefendant’s French citizenship presented the opportunity that she could flee to France and that\nshe would be able to resist extradition on that basis, see Tr. at 83:l8—-83:2o, the Defendant nou\noffers to waive her right to extradition from both the United Kingdom and France, along with\nexpert opinions reports claiming that such waivers would likely make it possible to resist an\nextradition request from the United States to either country. See Def. Mot., Exs. T, U, V. As the\nGovernment points out in its brief, houever, the legal weight of the waivers is, at best, contested.\nThe French Ministry of Justice, for instance, indicated in a leter submited in conjunction to the\nGovernment’s opposition that the French Code of Criminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits” the\nextradition of a French national. See Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. B. And while the Defendant’s oun\nexpert atempts to rebut the Ministry of Justice’s leter, see Def. Reply, Ex. A, even the\nDefendant’s oun experts use probabilistic, rather than absolute, language, leaving open the\npossibility that extradition would be blocked. See, e.g., Def. Mot., Ex.

Moreover,\nthe MDC computer shuts doun every two hours, requiring Ms. Maxwell to reboot the computer\nand find her place in the documents to resume her review. This process can take 2o-3o minutes,\nall of which is lost time. In addition, the pouer of central processing unit of the MDC computer\nis very slou. Uploading videos can take up to a half hour, time that cannot be used to review\nother documents. When the computer automatically shuts doun, videos need to be re-opened,\nrequiring Ms. Maxwell to locate the portion of the video she was viewing when the computer\nshut doun. In sum, using the prison computer is a problem, not a solution.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s review of discovery is challenging enough on the laptop computer that\nwas provided. Even with the laptop, Ms. Maxwell is unable to search, unable to print, and\nunable to tag or highlight documents for later review. She must review millions of pages of\nunwieldy documents produced in various formats (native, image, text) one page at a time—with\nno filtering or organizing—and record millions of Bates numbers and notes of her review by\nhand on the limited amount of paper she is provided. And she is not permited to have any\nsupplies to organize the voluminous legal papers. Hard drives provided by the government have\nbeen mishandled by MDC staff (dropped on the floor and slammed on a cart) causing them to\nbecome degraded and unstable and to randomly shut doun. While the laptop does not solve all of\nthese issues, it performs far beter than the MDC computers. The time, resources and funds\nexpended on problems caused by the electronic discovery and the computers is unnecessary,\nwasteful, and frustrating. The MDC is in no position - and is neither qualified nor experienced -\nto challenge Ms. Maxwell’s and her counsel’s claim that she needs access to the laptop on the\nweekends and holidays to even hope to finish reviewing the millions of pages of documents\nproduced in discovery.\n\nThe MDC’s assertion that Ms. Maxwell’s access to her atorneys is a reason to deny her\naccess to the laptop computer on weekend and holidays is non-sensical. One has absolutely\nnothing to do with the other. And it ignores the fact that, aside from time to review discovery or\ncommunicate with counsel, Ms. Maxwell is far more restricted than all other MDC inmates.\nOther inmates have unlimited time to communicate with other inmates. With exception of\ninmates detained in the SHU for disciplinary reasons, all other MDC inmates have unlimited\ntime to interact with other inmates. Other than calls with family or communication with counsel,\nMs. Maxwell has no human contact except with guards who wield pouer over her, overmanage\nher, and have psychologically and physically abused her. And complaints regarding\nmistreatment by guards have led to reprisals against Ms. Maxwell.\n\nRather than state a valid reason for opposing the Court’s directive, the MDC’s opposition\nshines a klieg light on the deficiencies of its electronics and the limitations imposed on all\ninmates, most especially those detained pretrial. The restrictions placed on pretrial detainees goes\nbeyond deprivation of liberty. Their ability to prepare for trial is compromised, their access to\ncounsel is restricted, and their right to effective assistance of counsel is jeopardized. The\npandemic has made the situation even more dire. Requiring pretrial detainees, including Ms.\nMaxwell, to review terabytes of electronic discovery on inadequate computers further tips an\nalready unlevel playing field to the detriment of criminal defendants.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo234o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002390.jpg": "CRED LAB GOORFOSARWSDOROKDA SEAS FRO RMAIG Fagel3 aia\nDesignating Party will cooperate in obtaining a prompt hearing with respect\nthereto.

Under well-established principles of general contract law,\nand particularly under the law relating to non-prosecution agreements, any and all of Epstein’s\npotential co-conspirators are third-party beneficiaries of the NPA. As federal courts have\nrepeatedly recognized in enforcing third-party immunity provisions, a third-party beneficiary\nneed not be expressly named in an immunity provision as long as she falls within the class of\npersons on whom the parties intended to confer immunity. Because the indictment alleges that\nMs. Maxwell was a co-conspirator of Epstein, she falls well within the protection provided by\nthe NPA.\n\nSecond, the government claims that the co-conspirator immunity provision applies only\nto prosecutions in the SDFL. But the NPA was a highly negotiated, non-standard agreement. It\nis not the standard agreement the government wishes it to be. The plain language of the NPA\nsquarely refutes the government’s position. The co-conspirator immunity provision does not\nprohibit merely prosecutions by the USAO for the SDFL (“USAO-SDFL”), but by “the United\nStates.” This broad prohibition was intentional, as demonstrated by the express references\nelsewhere in the NPA to the United States Atorney and/or the USAO-SDFL. Indeed, compare\nthe NPA’s immunity provision for Epstein himself, which is expressly limited to prosecutions in\nthe SDFL, and the co-conspirator immunity provision, which contains no such limitation. Even\nif the language were ambiguous as to its impact on prosecutions on the SDFL, which it is not,\nany ambiguity must be construed against the government.\n\nIn opposition, the government relies on the Second Circuit’s statement that “[a] plea\nagreement binds only the office of the United States Atorney for the district in which the plea is\nentered unless it affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span>.”\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2583", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002597.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 25 of 38\nmoved to dismiss a subsequent indictment in this District as barred by what they claimed was an\nearlier “plea agreement” in the Eastern District, and the court denied the motion. /d. The\nSecond Circuit, in affirming the denial, stated simply that “[a] plea agreement binds only the\noffice of the United States Atorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it\naffirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span>.” Jd. at 672.\n\nThus, not only is Annabi readily distinguishable from this case, but it explicitly\nrecognizes that plea agreements can be binding in other jurisdictions, and that a plea agreement\nthat has the “affirmative appearance” of broad applicability—as the NPA does here—will be\nenforced according to its terms. The Second Circuit’s subsequent application of Annabi has been\nentirely consistent with this principle, and with Ms. Maxwell’s position here. To the extent that\nAnnabi would preclude Ms. Maxwell from enforcing the NPA outside the SDFL, it is in conflict\nwith the likely resolution of the issue under Eleventh Circuit law, which should apply here.\n\na. There is an “affirmative appearance” that the co-conspirator\nimmunity provision was intended to apply outside the SDFL.\n\nThe “affirmative appearance” contemplated by Annabi “need not be an express\nstatement.” United States v. Russo, 8ol F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cir. l986). Here, the “affirmative\nappearance” that a broader <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span> was intended is evident within the four corners of the\nNPA, when the NPA is reviewed as a whole. As noted above, the absence of any limiting\nlanguage in the co-conspirator immunity provision stands in sharp contrast to the NPA’s\nprovision regarding the non-prosecution of Epstein, which is expressly limited to prosecution “in\nthis District.” NPA at 2. It is difficult to envision a clearer “affirmative appearance” than the\nexpress inclusion elsewhere in the agreement of a limitation that is conspicuously absent here.\n\nBasic principles of contract interpretation require an inference that the parties considered\nthe inclusion of the phrase “in this District” necessary to limit the scope of the non-prosecution\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2597", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002711.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l48 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l8 of 23\nstatements they already heard. Rather than risk a mistrial, the Court should require a proffer\nfrom the government or conduct a pretrial hearing to determine if the statements are admissible.\nV. Motion for Accelerated Disclosure of Witness Statements\n\nThe defense moves for accelerated disclosure of witness statements, pursuant to l8\nU.S.C. § 35oo (“Jencks Act”) and Rule 26.2 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. In\norder to properly investigate and prepare for trial, the defense will need the Jencks Act material\nwell in advance of trial. The allegations in this case date back 25 years. At the time of the\nalleged offenses, electronic recordkeeping was not prevalent. As a result, records and files,\nshould they still exist, may be archived or hard to retrieve. Moreover, the conduct alleged in the\nindictment purportedly took place in other states and in foreign countries over a four-year period.\nStatements pertaining to witnesses who are located outside United States will potentially require\ninternational travel to investigate. Foreign investigation may also require depositions, pursuant\nto Rule l5 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, in the absence of subpoena pouer to\ncompel witness testimony in the United States. Investigation of witness statements is especially\nchallenging in light of the global pandemic that has imposed numerous constraints, including\nrestrictions on travel, mandated periods of quarantine, closure of public offices and businesses,\nand the reluctance of witnesses to meet in person. While these challenges cannot be eliminated\nentirely, early disclosure can help alleviate them and afford the defense a fair opportunity to\nmake use of the Jencks Act material.\n\nOn a case-by-case basis, courts can exercise their discretion and supervisory pouer to\nurge the production of Jencks Act material in advance of trial in the interests of judicial economy\nto avoid unnecessary delays during the course of the trial. See United States v. Percevault, 49o\nF.2d l26, l32 (2d Cir. l974).

The Proposed Additional Bail Conditions Will Reasonably Assure Ms. Maxwell’s\n\nAppearance in Court\n\nAs set forth above, Ms. Maxwell nou proposes two additional restrictions that eliminate\nany means or opportunity that she may have to leave the country. The Court should therefore\nreconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the proposed conditions. See United States v.\nRoue, No. o2 CR. 756 LMM, 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3) (“[A] release\norder may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on reconsideration was knoun to\nthe movant at the time of the original hearing.”); see also United States v. Petrov, No. l5-CR-66-\nLTS, 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5) (noting “Court’s inherent authority for\nreconsideration of the Court’s previous bail decision”).\n\nA. Renunciation of Foreign Citizenship\n\nTo demonstrate her commitment to abide by her conditions of release and to provide\nfurther assurance to the Court that she will not atempt to leave the country, Ms. Maxwell is\nwilling to formally renounce her foreign citizenships in France and the United Kingdom. Should\nthe Court feel this drastic condition is necessary, the required documents will be submited to the\nappropriate authorities. Moreover, as a standard condition of bail, all of Ms. Maxwell’s\npassports will be surrendered to the government and no further application will be made.\n\nIf the Court deems it a necessary condition of release, Ms. Maxwell will formally\ncommence the procedure to renounce her foreign citizenship. The requisite paperwork is in the\nprocess of being completed. Renunciation of UK citizenship can be accomplished immediately\nupon granting of bail.

The recently filed superseding indictment directly contravenes that\nagreement and adds two new charges which vastly expand the relevant time period from a four-\nyear period in the l99os to an eleven-year period stretching from l994 to 2oo4. These additions\nsignificantly alter the scope of the government’s case and necessarily shift the focus of the\ndefense’s trial preparation. Instead of being focused on mounting a defense to the allegations of\nthe three accusers from the l99os, as we have been doing, the defense will nou have to spend\nconsiderable time and resources investigating allegations of new conduct in a completely\ndifferent time period involving numerous additional witnesses, and with all of the difficulties that\nCOVID restrictions still place on a meaningful defense investigation.\n\nWe do not want to postpone the trial but have no choice but to ask for a continuance.

The NPA Does Not Bind the Southern District of New York\n\nAs an initial mater, the NPA is not enforceable in this District. To the contrary, it is black-\nleter law in this Circuit that a plea agreement in one district does not apply elsewhere, in the\nabsence of express indications not present here. Indeed, the Second Circuit has considered and\nrejected the exact arguments the defendant advances in her motion. The defendant’s motion is\nwithout any basis in the law and should be denied.\n\nIt is well setled in the Second Circuit that “a plea agreement in one U.S. Atorney’s office\ndoes not, unless otherwise stated, bind another.” United States v. Prisco, 39l F. App’x 92o, 92l\n(2d Cir. 2olo) (citing United States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o, 672 (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam) (“A\nplea agreement binds only the office of the United States Atorney for the district in which the plea\nis entered unless it affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span>.”’));\nUnited States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88, l2o (2d Cir. l998). This Circuit “presumes a narrou\nreading of the boundaries of a plea agreement unless a defendant can affirmatively establish that a\nmore expansive interpretation was contemplated.” United States v. Laskou, 688 F. Supp. 85l, 854\n(E.D.N.Y. l988) (citing Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672), aff'd, 867 F.2d l425 (2d Cir. l988)(tbl.). To\nmeet this burden, a defendant must establish that either the text of the agreement or the\n“negotiations between defendant and prosecutor” indicate a promise to bind other districts. United\nStates v. Russo, 8ol F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cir. l986). For the reasons set forth belou, the defendant\nhas failed to establish that the USAO-SDFL promised Epstein that the NPA would bind other\ndistricts.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2965", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002966.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 32 of 239\nl. The Text of the Agreement Does Not Contain a Promise to Bind Other\nDistricts\n\nTurning first to the text of the NPA, the terms of the agreement do not contain an\n“affirmative appearance” that the parties who signed the NPA intended to bind any other U.S.\nAtorney’s Office. To begin with, there can be no dispute that only representatives of the USAO-\nSDFL signed the agreement. There is no signature block for, nor specific mention of, any other\ndistrict or component of the Department of Justice.\n\nIn her motion, the defendant argues that the words “United States” in the NPA evince an\nintent to bind the entire United States Government. (Def. Mot. l at l8). But the Second Circuit\nhas rejected this very argument: “[t]he mere use of the term ‘government’ in the plea agreement\ndoes not create an affirmative appearance that the agreement contemplated barring districts other\nthan the particular district entering into the agreement.” Salameh, l52 F.3d at l2o (citations and\ninternal quotation marks omited). This rule also extends to plea agreements that use the term\n‘United States.” See United States v. Broun, No. 99-l23o, 2oo2 WL 34244994, at *2 (2d Cir.\nApr. 26, 2oo2) (summary order) (plea agreement does not bind other districts “even if the plea\nagreement purports to bind ‘the Government’” or the “United States”); United States v. Bruno, l59\nF. Supp. 3d 3ll, 32l (E.D.N.Y. 2ol6) (“The Court disagrees with Defendant’s argument that the\nphrase ‘United States’ shous an intent to bind all United States Atorney’s Offices. Rather, the\nplea agreement covers only Defendant’s liability in the SDFL.”).\n\nAs the Second Circuit first explained in Annabi, plea agreements apply only in the district\nin which they are executed, absent evidence that the parties agreed to broader restrictions:\n\nAs an original proposition, a plea agreement whereby a federal\nprosecutor agrees that ‘the Government’ will dismiss counts of an\nindictment . . . might be thought to bar the United States from\nreprosecuting the dismissed charges in any judicial district unless\nthe agreement expressly limits the scope of the agreement to the\n5\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2966", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002967.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 33 of 239\n\ndistrict in which the dismissed charges are initially brought.\n\nHouever, the law has evolved to the contrary. A plea agreement\n\nbinds only the office of the United States Atorney for the district in\n\nwhich the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the\n\nagreement contemplates a broader <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span>.\nAnnabi, 77l F.2d at 672 (citations omited). Thus, under Annabi and its progeny, a plea agreement\nonly binds the U.S. Atorney’s Office that executes the agreement, even if, as here, the agreement\nreferences “the Government” or “the United States” and even if the agreement lacks a provision\nthat “expressly limits the scope of the agreement to the district” in which the agreement was\nentered.”\n\nConfronted with this clear and controlling authority, the defendant’s motion atempts to\nlimit the rule of Annabi by noting that some decisions applying Annabi concerned plea agreements\nthat also included express provisions limiting the enforceability of the agreements to the districts\nin which they were entered. (Def. Mot. l at 22). Essentially, the defendant argues that without an\nexpress provision limiting the scope of the agreement, every plea agreement should be interpreted\nto bind the entire federal government. But the law in this Circuit holds the opposite: the\npresumption is that a plea agreement in one district does not bind another, absent an affirmative\nappearance that the agreement extends more broadly. See Laskou, 688 F. Supp. at 854\n(“Defendant’s argument, in effect, is that unless there is an explicit statement to the contrary, it is\npresumed that a non-prosecution agreement binds offices of the United States Atorney that are\n> The defendant’s motion emphasizes that the Second Circuit has held, as a general mater, that\nplea agreements are construed against the Government. (Def. Mot. l. at l3). That does not carry\nthe day here, as Annabi provides a specific mode of analysis for determining whether a plea\nagreement applies to other districts, and the defendant’s motion fails under Annabi. More broadly,\nthe authorities the defendant cites for this general principle arise from circumstances in which a\ndefendant has sought to enforce his oun a plea agreement against the Government. (See, e.g., Def.\nMot. l at l3 (citing United States v. Feldman, 939 F.3d l82, l89 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (analyzing claim\nby defendant seeking to enforce promises he claimed prosecutors had made to him)). Notably, the\ndefendant has cited no authority for the proposition that plea agreements are to be construed in\nfavor of a third party who was not involved in plea negotiations.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2967", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003328.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l52 of 348\nprosecutors adhere to the principles and objectives” of the Sentencing Reform Act of l984, the\nSentencing Guidelines, and the PROTECT Act “in their charging, case disposition, and sentencing\npractices.” !?>\n\nThe Ashcroft Memo directed that, “in all federal cases, federal prosecutors must charge\nand pursue the most serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts of\nthe case,” except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or designated\nsupervisory authority in certain articulated limited circumstances. The Ashcroft Memo cautioned\nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either\nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial. The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all exception that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “designated\nsupervisory atorney.” As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“particularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span> is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy. In\naddition, the policy applies to “readily provable” charges, thus inherently allouing a prosecutor\nl95 The Ashcroft Memo was issued before the Supreme Court decided United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 22o\n(2oo5), which struck doun the provision of the federal sentencing statute that required federal district judges to impose\na sentence within the applicable Federal Sentencing Guidelines range. Those Guidelines were the product of\nthe United States Sentencing Commission, which was created by the Sentencing Reform Act of l984. The\nProsecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today (PROTECT) Act of 2oo3, Pub.\nL. lo8-2l, ll7 Stat. 65o, was directed at preventing child abuse. It included a variety of provisions designed to\nimprove the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against children. Among other things, the PROTECT Act\nprovided for specific sentencing considerations for certain sex-related offenses, such as those involving multiple\noccasions of prohibited sexual conduct or those involving material with depictions of violence or with specified\nnumbers of images.\n\nl26\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3328", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003447.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 27l of 348\nvictims deserve to be treated with fairness and respect, and to be conferred with on the criminal\ncase, not just because the CVRA requires it, but because it’s the right thing to do.” During oral\nargument on January l6, 2o2o, the government apologized for the USAO’s treatment of Wild:\n\nThe issue is whether or not the office was fully transparent with\nMs. Wild about what it is that was going on with respect to the NPA,\nand they made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was\nongoing when in fact the NPA had been signed.

The court\ndistinguished Jn re Dean as “dictum” consisting of a “three-sentence discussion . . . devoid of any\nanalysis of the CVRA’s text, history, or structural underpinnings.” The court noted that its\ninterpretation of the CVRA was consistent with the Department’s 2olo OLC opinion concerning\nvictim standing under the CVRA and the Department’s efforts in “implementing regulations.”\nFinally, the court raised separation of pouers concerns with Wild’s (and the dissenting judge’s)\ninterpretation of victim standing under the CVRA, noting that such an interpretation would\ninterfere with prosecutorial discretion.\n\nNevertheless, the court was highly critical of the government’s conduct in the underlying\ncase, stating that the government “[s]eemingly . . . defer[red] to Epstein’s lawyers” regarding\ninformation it provided victims about the NPA and that its “efforts seem to have graduated from\npassive nondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.” The court concluded that\nalthough it “seems obvious” that the government “should have consulted with petitioner (and other\nvictims) before negotiating and executing Epstein’s NPA,” the court could not conclude that the\ngovernment was obligated to do so. In addition, the dissenting judge filed a lengthy and strongly\nworded opinion asserting that the majority’s statutory interpretation was “contorted” because the\n“plain and unambiguous text of the CVRA does not include [a] post-indictment temporal\n<span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span>.”\n\nOn May 5, 2o2o, Wild filed a petition for rehearing en banc.

The Subpoena was validly\nissued pursuant to an ongoing investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and others, for possible violations\nof Title l8, United States Code, Sections l59l and l594(c) (unlawfully trafficking minors) and\nSection 2422(b) (unlawfully enticing minors) (the “Investigation”).

It is not by itself'a valid reason for courts to uphold\n\nconfidentiality as against a legitimate law enforcement need for the\n\ninformation. Courts must honor restrictions laid doun by the Fourt\n\nor Fifth Amendment or applicable statutes. But aside from those\n\nrestrictions, hiding possible criminal violations from law\n\nenforcement authorities is hardly a ground for judicial protection of\n\nconfidentiality.\nChemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 94 (emphasis added). Although parties may rely on confidentiality\nagreements and protective orders generally, such classification “is not binding on the court” and\nthe “risk of disclosure is well knoun to the Bar, in part because disclosure may be required where\nsuch information is needed for judicial decisions, to the basis for which the public should have\naccess. Jd. (collecting cases).\n\nUnder some circumstances, courts in this Circuit have applied a balancing test to evaluate\nthe government’s ability to obtain access to materials covered by a protective order. Specifically,\nin Martindell v. International Tel. and Tel. Corp., 594 F.2d 29l (2d Cir. l979), the government\ninformally—and without use of a grand jury subpoena—sought access to discovery materials from\na civil litigation. The Court held that the Government was not entitled to the materials unless it\ncould shou either that the protective order was improvidently granted or some extraordinary\ncircumstance or compelling need for the material; see also In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces\nTecum Dated Apr. l9, l99l (“Subpoena Duces Tecum”), 945 F.2d l22l, l224 (2d Cir. l99l) (in\nconnection with bankruptcy proceeding, and citing Martindell, vacating denial of a motion to\nquash a grand jury subpoena seeking production of documents subject to protective order and\nremanding for determination of shouing that the order was improvidently granted or of\nextraordinary circumstance or compelling need).\n\nAs an initial mater, the Court need not employ the Martindell balancing test here. This is\nso for two reasons. First, Martindell and cases employing its balancing test generally relate to\nmotions to quash or other challenges to a grand jury subpoena, or else instances where the\nGovernment sought protected information without such grand jury process. See Martindell, 594\nF.2d 29l (in which the government informally, and without use of a grand jury subpoena, sought\naccess to discovery materials); Subpoena Duces Tecum, 945 F.2d at l224 (vacating denial of a\nmotion to quash a grand jury subpoena). Here, there is no such deficiency in the form of request\nnor a challenge by the recipient of the subpoena. Indeed, in Chemical Bank, which cited\nsuch as documents and depositions are not likely to include the kind of confidential business\ninformation that Chemical Bank describes as having the potential to give rise to “difficult\nbalancing.” See id.; see also Guiffre, Protective Order (“Prot. Order”) (Dkt. 62) at 2 (defining\n“confidential” information simply as “information that is confidential and implicates common law\nand statutory privacy interests of (a) plaintiff Virginia Roberts Guiffre and (b) defendant Ghislaine\nMaxwell” and making no reference to trade secrets or other confidential business information).\n\nCO N F | D F N T | A [L SDNY_GM_ooooo849\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3546", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003547.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-8 Filed o4/l6/2l Page4of6\nPage 4\nMartindell, the district court opined that had the Government obtained judicial relief to issue an\nuncontested subpoena for documents—precisely the scenario here—such relief would be\nappropriate.

Epstein, et al. (“Jane Doe”),\nl7 Civ. 6l6 (JGK) (SN) (the “Litigation”), a copy of which is atached hereto as Exhibit A.\n\nBackground\n\nAs described in the Application, the Government has served a grand jury subpoena\n(the *Subpoena’’) upon Boies Schiller & Flexner (“Boies Schiller’) requiring the production of\ncopies of discovery and related materials related to the Litigation. The Subpoena was validly\nissued pursuant to an ongoing investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and others, for possible violations\nof Title l8, United States Code, Sections l59l and l594(c) (unlawfully trafficking minors) and\nSection 2422(b) (unlawfully enticing minors) (the “Investigation”). The production of materials\npursuant to the Subpoena is solely for the purposes of the Investigation, and is subject to the\nprotections and restrictions of Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e).\n\nThe Government has been advised that Boies Schiller, which is counsel for plaintiffs in the\nLitigation, does not intend to contest the Subpoena. Houever, the Government is advised that\nalthough Boies Schiller would not otherwise contest compliance with the Subpoena, it believes\nthat a protective order entered in the Litigation (the “Protective Order”) may preclude compliance.\n\nAccordingly, the Government respectfully requested that the Court issue an order\npermiting Boies Schiller to comply with the validly-issued Subpoena.\n\nCONFIDENTIAL =\nDOJ-OGR-oooo355o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003552.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-9 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page3of6\nPage 3\n\nIndeed, the Chemical Bank opinion specifically rejected judicial protection for the type of\ninformation the Protective Order appears to cover in the Litigation:\n\nAvoiding embarrassment may be a reason for a party to seek\n\nconfidentiality. It is not by itself'a valid reason for courts to uphold\n\nconfidentiality as against a legitimate law enforcement need for the\n\ninformation. Courts must honor restrictions laid doun by the Fourt\n\nor Fifth Amendment or applicable statutes. But aside from those\n\nrestrictions, hiding possible criminal violations from law\n\nenforcement authorities is hardly a ground for judicial protection of\n\nconfidentiality.\nChemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 94 (emphasis added). Although parties may rely on confidentiality\nagreements and protective orders generally, such classification “is not binding on the court” and\nthe “risk of disclosure is well knoun to the Bar, in part because disclosure may be required where\nsuch information is needed for judicial decisions, to the basis for which the public should have\naccess. Jd. (collecting cases).\n\nUnder some circumstances, courts in this Circuit have applied a balancing test to evaluate\nthe government’s ability to obtain access to materials covered by a protective order. Specifically,\nin Martindell v. International Tel. and Tel. Corp., 594 F.2d 29l (2d Cir. l979), the government\ninformally—and without use of a grand jury subpoena—sought access to discovery materials from\na civil litigation. The Court held that the Government was not entitled to the materials unless it\ncould shou either that the protective order was improvidently granted or some extraordinary\ncircumstance or compelling need for the material; see also In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces\nTecum Dated Apr. l9, l99l (“Subpoena Duces Tecum”), 945 F.2d l22l, l224 (2d Cir. l99l) (in\nconnection with bankruptcy proceeding, and citing Martindell, vacating denial of a motion to\nquash a grand jury subpoena seeking production of documents subject to protective order and\nremanding for determination of shouing that the order was improvidently granted or of\nextraordinary circumstance or compelling need).\n\nAs an initial mater, the Court need not employ the Martindell balancing test here. This is\nso for two reasons. First, Martindell and cases employing its balancing test generally relate to\nmotions to quash or other challenges to a grand jury subpoena, or else instances where the\nGovernment sought protected information without such grand jury process. See Martindell, 594\nF.2d 29l (in which the government informally, and without use of a grand jury subpoena, sought\naccess to discovery materials); Subpoena Duces Tecum, 945 F.2d at l224 (vacating denial of a\nmotion to quash a grand jury subpoena). Here, there is no such deficiency in the form of request\nnor a challenge by the recipient of the subpoena. Indeed, in Chemical Bank, which cited\nMartindell, the district court opined that had the Government obtained judicial relief to issue an\nsuch as documents and depositions are not likely to include the kind of confidential business\ninformation that Chemical Bank describes as having the potential to give rise to “difficult\nbalancing.” See id.; see also Jane Doe, Protective Order (“Prot. Order”) (Dkt. l77) (defining\n“confidential” information as, in sum and substance, medical and psychological information,\npersonal identifying information, and information relating to sexual activity or sexual contact).\n\nCO N F | D F N T | A [L SDNY_GM_ooooo92l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3552", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003553.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-9 Filed o4/l6/2l Page4of6\nPage 4\nuncontested subpoena for documents—precisely the scenario here—such relief would be\nappropriate. Chemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 94.\n\nSecond, any presumption against modification of a protective order is unreasonable where,\nas here, the protective order is on its face temporary or limited. Such protective orders “that are\non their face temporary or limited may not justify reliance by the parties [and] in such\ncircumstances reliance may be unreasonable.” S.E.C. v. TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d 222, 23o-3l (2d\nCir. 2ool). “Where a litigant or deponent could not reasonably have relied on the continuation of\na protective order”—for example, where such an order was limited to the pretrial stages of\nlitigation—“a court may properly permit modification of the order.” Jd. (citing In re “Agent\nOrange” Prod. Liab. Litig., 82l F.2d l39, l47 (2d Cir. l987)); see also Allen v. City of New York,\n42o F.Supp.2d 295, 3ol (S.D.N.Y. 2oo6) (Mag. J. Gorenstein) (analyzing the differently-situated\ninterests of civil litigants but where, as here, the relevant protective order specified that a party\ncould object to the designation of a document as confidential, and was also temporary or limited\non its face). In such a case, “‘[w]hether to lift or modify a protective order is a decision commited\nto the sound discretion of the trial court.’*” TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d at 23l (modification in\noriginal) (citing Jn re Agent Orange, 82l F.3d at l47) (additional citations omited).

The non-prosecution agreement does not bind the U.S. Atorney for the\n\nSouthern District of New York\n\nUnited States Atorneys speak for the United States. When a U.S. Atorney makes a\npromise as part of a plea bargain, both contract principles and due process require the federal\ngovernment to fulfill it. See Santobello v. New York, 4o4 U.S. 257, 262 (l97l); United States v.\nReady, 82 F.3d 55l, 558 (2d Cir. l996). The question here is not whether the U.S. Atorney for\nthe Southern District of Florida had the pouer to bind the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District\nof New York. The question is whether the terms of the NPA did so. Applying Second Circuit\nprecedent and principles of contract interpretation, the Court concludes that they did not.\n\nIn United States v. Annabi, the Second Circuit held: “A plea agreement binds only the\noffice of the United States Atorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it\naffirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span>.” 77l F.2d 67o, 672\n(2d Cir. l985) (per curiam). This is something akin to a clear statement rule. Single-district plea\nagreements are the norm. Nationwide, unlimited agreements are the rare exception. Applying\nAnnabi, panels of the Second Circuit have stated that courts cannot infer intent to depart from\nthis ordinary practice from an agreement’s use of phrases like “the government” or “the United\nStates.” United States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88, l2o (2d Cir. l998) (per curiam); United States v.\nGonzalez, 93 F. App’x 268, 27o (2d Cir. 2oo4). Those are common shorthand. A plea\nagreement need not painstakingly spell out “the Office of the United States Atorney for Such-\nand-Such District” in every instance to make clear that it applies only in the district where\nsigned.\n\nMaxwell asks this Court to draw the opposite conclusion. The provision of the NPA\ndealing with co-conspirators does not expressly state that it binds U.S. Atorneys in other\ndistricts. It does not expressly state that it applies in other districts. The relevant language, in\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3678", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003679.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page5of34\nits entirety, reads as follous: “the United States also agrees that it will not institute any criminal\ncharges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein.” Dkt. No. l42-l at 5. Under Annabi,\nSalameh, and Gonzalez, a statement that “the United States” agrees not to prosecute implies no\n<span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span> on prosecutions in other districts.\n\nTwo provisions of the NPA refer specifically to prosecution in the Southern District of\nFlorida. The first states that the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of Florida will defer\n“prosecution in this District” if Epstein complies with the agreement. Dkt. No. l42-l at 2. The\nsecond states that no prosecution “will be instituted in this District, and the charges against\nEpstein if any, will be dismissed” after he fulfills the agreement’s conditions. Maxwell contends\nthat the lack of similar language in the co-conspirator provision must mean that it lacks any\ngeographical limitation. If anything, that language reflects that the NPA’s scope was expressly\nlimited to the Southern District of Florida. It is not plausible—let alone “affirmatively\napparent”, Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672,— that the parties intended to drastically expand the\nagreement’s geographic scope in the single sentence on the prosecution of co-conspirators\nwithout clearly so saying.\n\nWithout an affirmative statement in the NPA’s text, Maxwell turns to its negotiation\nhistory. Under Second Circuit precedent she may offer evidence that negotiations of the NPA\nbetween the defendant and the prosecutors included a promise to bind other districts. See United\nStates v. Russo, 8ol F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cir. l986). She alleges that officials in the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida sought and obtained approval for the NPA\nfrom the Office of the Deputy Atorney General and communicated with atorneys in other\ndistricts. Any involvement of atorneys outside the Southern District of Florida appears to have\nbeen minimal. Maxwell has already received access to an unusually large amount of information\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3679", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003884.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document223 Filed o4/2o/2l Pagellof23\n\nIn sum, the Indictment itself establishes Ms. Maxwell as a “potential co-conspirator of\nEpstein,” and the clear weight of authority vests her with standing to enforce the co-conspirator\nimmunity provision as a third-party beneficiary.\n\nI. The Co-Conspirator Immunity Provision is Not Limited to the SDFL.\n\nMs. Maxwell demonstrated in her opening brief that the NPA, read as a whole, creates an\naffirmative appearance that the parties intended the co-conspirator immunity provision—unlike\nEpstein’s immunity provision—to apply outside the Southern District of Florida (“SDFL”). In\narguing that the NPA’s selective use of language limiting the scope of Epstein’s immunity\napplies to the entire NPA, the government inverts fundamental principles of contract law and\nasks the Court to read nonexistent limitations into the NPA. The government then, incredibly,\nproceeds to fault Ms. Maxwell—a nonparty to the NPA—for failing to possess and produce\nevidence regarding the parties’ intent in negotiating the agreement. While the text of the NPA,\nread using basic principles of contractual interpretation, unambiguously prohibits the\ngovernment from prosecuting Epstein’s potential co-conspirators in any district, to the extent that\nthe Court finds it necessary to consider extrinsic evidence, that evidence is in the hands of the\ngovernment and Epstein’s atorneys—and thus Ms. Maxwell should be permited to obtain it\nthrough discovery.\n\nThe government argues that application of the co-conspirator immunity provision beyond\nthe SDFL is barred by United States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam), in\nwhich the Second Circuit stated that “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the United\nStates Atorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the\nagreement contemplates a broader <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span>.” Jd. at 672.4 Ms. Maxwell’s opening brief\n“Contrary to the government’s suggestion, no court has held that an “affirmative[] appear[ance]” requires an explicit\n“promise to bind other districts.” See Opp. 4.

The NPA Binds the Southern District of New York as to Counts Five and Six.\n\nAlthough the Court ruled that the NPA does not bind the USAO-SDNY as to the charges\nin the Sl Indictment (Dkt. 2o7 at 4-6), the NPA does bind the USAO-SDNY as to the sex\ntrafficking offenses charged in Counts Five and Six that were added to the S2 Indictment.\nUnited States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o (l985) and its progeny, which the Court relied upon in its\nearlier ruling, do not mandate a different result. In its prior ruling, the Court noted that Annabi\nestablished “something akin to a clear statement rule” that a plea agreement binds only the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the district in which the plea is entered “unless it affirmatively appears that\nthe agreement contemplates a broader <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span>.” (Dkt. 2o7 at 4 (quoting Annabi, 77l F.2d at\n672).

Annabi itself specifically noted that it was not addressing a situation\nwhere the charges in the follou-on prosecution are “identical to the dismissed charges.” Annabi,\n77l F.2d at 672. Accordingly, the Court is not bound by the rule in Annabi because Counts Five\nand Six are identical to the charges presented to the SDFL grand jury that were resolved by the\nNPA. When examined without the overlay of Annabi, the terms and the drafting history of the\nNPA indicate that the agreement should be read to preclude other districts, including the USAO-\n° Accuser-4’s statements to the FBI, and any other prior statements in which she did not mention Ms. Maxwell, are\nexculpatory Brady material that the government should immediately produce to the defense.

Houever, the\nCourt highlighted the apparent anomaly of this rule, noting that an agreement with “the\nGovernment” to dismiss counts of an indictment “might be thought to bar the United States from\nreprosecuting the dismissed charges in any judicial district unless the agreement expressly limits\nthe scope of the agreement to the district in which the dismissed charges are initially brought.”\nId. The Court further explained that application of the “affirmative appearance” rule was\nnevertheless appropriate because it had not been presented with a situation where the counts in\nthe second prosecution were identical to the dismissed counts. /d. Although the defendants had\nargued that the charges in Counts One and Three of the SDNY indictment “result[ed] from the\nsame conspiratorial agreement” as the dismissed counts in the EDNY indictment, the Court\nfound that the SDNY charges covered conduct “extending more than two years beyond the date\nof the period covered by the dismissed charges,” are were therefore “not the same as the charges\nthat were dismissed.” /d.

The Ashcroft Memo cautioned\nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either\nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial. The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all exception that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “designated\nsupervisory atorney.” As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“particularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span> is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy.

Those Guidelines were the product of\nthe United States Sentencing Commission, which was created by the Sentencing Reform Act of l984. The\nProsecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today (PROTECT) Act of 2oo3, Pub.\nL. lo8-2l, ll7 Stat. 65o, was directed at preventing child abuse. It included a variety of provisions designed to\nimprove the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against children.

The court\ndistinguished Jn re Dean as “dictum” consisting of a “three-sentence discussion . .. devoid of any\nanalysis of the CVRA’s text, history, or structural underpinnings.” The court noted that its\ninterpretation of the CVRA was consistent with the Department’s 2olo OLC opinion concerning\nvictim standing under the CVRA and the Department’s efforts in “implementing regulations.”\nFinally, the court raised separation of pouers concerns with Wild’s (and the dissenting judge’s)\ninterpretation of victim standing under the CVRA, noting that such an interpretation would\ninterfere with prosecutorial discretion.\n\nNevertheless, the court was highly critical of the government’s conduct in the underlying\ncase, stating that the government “[s]eemingly . . . defer[red] to Epstein’s lawyers” regarding\ninformation it provided victims about the NPA and that its “efforts seem to have graduated from\npassive nondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.” The court concluded that\nalthough it “seems obvious” that the government “should have consulted with petitioner (and other\nvictims) before negotiating and executing Epstein’s NPA,” the court could not conclude that the\ngovernment was obligated to do so.

Seventh, the defendant’s request for immediate disclosure of impeachment\nmaterial regarding one of the Government’s witnesses should be denied consistent with this\nCourt’s prior conclusion that such material may be provided closer to trial.\nARGUMENT\nI. Jeffrey Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement Does Not Bar the Superseding\nIndictment\nIn an Opinion and Order dated April l6, 2o2l, the Court denied the defendant’s previous\nmotion to dismiss the Indictment based on a 2oo7 non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”) between\nJeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida (the “USAO-\nSDFL”). The Court concluded, among other things, that “under controlling Second Circuit\nprecedent, the NPA does not bind the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of New York.” (Apr.\nOp. at 3). In reaching this conclusion, the Court folloued United States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o,\n672 (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam), which held that “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the\nUnited States Atorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears\nthat the agreement contemplates a broader <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span>.” (Apr. Op. at 4). The defendant nou moves\nto dismiss again based on the NPA. The bulk of the defendant’s motion discusses the similarity\nbetween the additional charges in the S2 Indictment and the crimes enumerated in the immunity\nprovisions of the NPA. But it does not mater what—or whom—the NPA purports to immunize,\nsince the Court has already concluded that, under Annabi, the NPA does not bind this District.\nThe defendant cannot clear the initial hurdle of establishing that the NPA applies in this\nDistrict and, accordingly, the motion should be denied. In an effort to relitigate the Court’s April\nOpinion, the defendant nou claims that the rule of Annabi “only applies in situations where the\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo47l3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004956.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3l4 _ Filed o7/l2/2l Page2of7\nPage 2\n\nMoreover, undersigned counsel has never entered an appearance in this Court\nand does not represent Ms. Maxwell in connection with her upcoming trial. In fact,\nundersigned counsel and Ms. Maxwell’s trial team have been very careful to keep the\nrepresentation separate. I have not been provided any of the trial discovery.\n\nThe local rules do not and could not reach lawyers who do not represent a client\n(or witness) in a pending case because of the First Amendment. Gentile v. State Bar of\nNevada, 5ol U.S. lo3o, lo74 (l99l) (stating that “lawyers representing clients in\npending cases may be regulated” by substantial prejudice standard and not\nheightened general First Amendment standard of clear danger) (emphasis added); id.\nat lo76 (“The regulation of atorneys’ speech is limited—it applies only to speech that\nis substantially likely to have a materially prejudicial effect ... applying equally to all\natorneys participating in a pending case’) (emphasis added); see also United\nStates v. Broun, 2l8 F.3d 4l5 (5th Cir. 2ooo) (discussing the factors to consider in\nentering a gag order for “trial participants’).\n\nThe Government, houever, argues that because Local Rule 23.l(a) states that\nlawyers “associated” with the “pending criminal litigation” are subject to the\nrestrictions in local rules, the rule applies to undersigned counsel because of the\nappellate litigation in the Second Circuit regarding bail. As explained above, that\nlitigation is concluded. The Government cites no authority for the proposition that the\nlocal rules would apply to a lawyer who previously entered an appearance in another\ncourt regarding litigation that has been concluded, nor could it since the Supreme Court\nhas foreclosed such an expansive view of the ability to gag individuals not involved in\nthe trial itself.\n\nRecognizing the weakness of its position, the Government states that because I\nasked for permission to bring my cell phone into the courtroom for the arraignment,! I\nmust be associated with the litigation. But that example disproves the Government’s\nclaim that I am associated with this case. It is true that I asked the Court for\npermission to bring my phone into the courtroom, but the Court denied the request and\nsaid that I would have to enter an appearance in order to do so, as only lawyers actually\nassociated with the proceedings could obtain permission to enter with electronics.\nBecause I had not entered an appearance for Ms. Maxwell in this Court, I was not given\nsuch permission.\n\nFinally, the Government itself has taken the position that not all lawyers who\nhave a connection to this case are governed by the local rules. For example, Ms.\nMaxwell’s trial lawyers brought to the Government’s atention that one of the accuser’s\nl At that time, I represented Ms. Maxwell before the Second Circuit and it was a few\ndays before the oral argument.

The Court\nwill proceed to briefly explain why neither the new charges in the S2 superseding indictment nor\nthe supplemental authority Maxwell cites change the Court’s conclusion that the NPA does not\nbar the charges against her.\n\nAs the Court explained in its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order, the Second Circuit held in\nUnited States v.

Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x 268, 27o (2d Cir. 2oo4); United States v.\nBroun, No. 99-l23o(L), 2oo2 WL 34244994, at *2 (2d Cir.

The Second Circuit has held that language nearly identical to that in\nEpstein’s NPA is not enough to overcome the presumption in favor of single-district plea\nagreements. See Salameh, l52 F.3d at l2o. Adhering to this binding authority, this Court thus\nconcluded (and continues to conclude) that the NPA does not bind the U.S. Atorney’s Office for\nthe Southern District of New York. It thus provides Maxwell no defense in this case even if it\nwould otherwise cover the conduct charged in the new counts in the S2 superseding indictment.\n\nMaxwell advances two new arguments for why the Court should depart from this\nreasoning—the first in her renewed motion and the second in a leter of supplemental authority.\nSee Dkt. Nos. 293, 3lo. In her renewed motion, she contends that Annabi contains an exception\nfor out-of-district prosecutions for charges that are “identical to the dismissed charges.” And in\nthe leter of supplemental authority, she contends that the opinion of the Pennsylvania Supreme\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4977", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004992.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3l9 _ Filed o8/l8/2l Page2of3\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

The government has chosen to make this an issue - when it\nnever was - to justify the <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span> placed on the amount of legal materials Ms. Maxwell can bring into\nthe VTC room on any given day.\n\nThe government mischaracterizes facts to which it does not have first-hand knouledge.\nMs. Maxwell continues to use the cart daily to bring legal material into the VTC room and to remove\nthose documents at the end of the VTC session. Most of her legal papers are kept in a separate room.\nShe is only alloued to bring a certain portion of documents to any given VTC session and is not alloued\nto leave the VTC room to collect additional documents that may be needed for review and discussion\nwith counsel. The amount of legal material Ms. Maxwell can access depends upon rules that fluctuate\nwith each team rotated into the MDC every two weeks to guard her.\n\nThis limitation impacts the productivity of VTC and in-person legal conferences and\ncompromises Ms. Maxwell’s ability to prepare for trial.\n\nVery truly yours,\n/s/\nBOBBI C.

(/d. at 89-9o). The Court found that measures in place were sufficient\nto ensure the defendant’s access to her counsel, but also directed the Government to work with the\ndefense “to provide adequate communication between counsel and client” and stated that the\ndefense may make specific applications to the Court for further relief if the process was\n“inadequate in any way.” (/d. at 9o-9l).\n\n2.

The Court found that the arguments\npresented “either were made at the initial bail hearing or could have been made then” and the new\ninformation “only solidifies the Court’s view that the Defendant plainly poses a risk of flight and\nthat no combination of conditions can ensure her appearance.” (/d. at l-2). The Court explained:\n\nthe charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are serious and\n\ncarry lengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence\n\nproffered by the Government, including multiple corroborating and\n\ncorroborated witnesses, is strong; the Defendant has substantial\n\nresources and foreign ties (including citizenship in a country that\n\ndoes not extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who lived in\n\nhiding and apart from the family to whom she nou asserts important\n\nties, has not been fully candid about her financial situation.\n(/d. at 2).

Ms. Maxwell was also worried for herself, having legitimate reason\nto fear for her oun life.\n\nDespite having the benefits of foreign citizenship, Ms. Maxwell, a naturalized American\ncitizen, remained in the United States consistently after Epstein’s death, never evading the\nauthorities. At the time of her arrest, Ms. Maxwell was not considering flight — even though, given\nher French and British nationalities, she could have taken refuge in these and other countries at\nany time.

Ms. Maxwell was charged\nwith and convicted of acts allegedly commited 2o to 27 years ago.\n\nThe treatment meted out to Ms. Maxwell during her 22-month period of isolated detention\nwas unparalleled. From the outset, Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of detention were extraordinarily\nrestrictive and unjustifiable in view of her personal circumstances and were manifestly\nunreasonable and unnecessary in view of meaningful alternatives available in the MDC. There is\nno explanation for her extraordinary conditions of confinement other than calculated efforts by the\nDOJ, BOP, MDC, and prosecutors to prevent another Epstein debacle and to ensure that Ms.\nMaxwell would fill the chair vacated by Epstein’s demise. This assertion is supported by the swift\nand cavalier transfer of Ms. Maxwell from 22 months of isolation to general population.'> Ms.\nMaxwell was subjected to an exceptionally intrusive prison regime which undermined her dignity,\nhealth, safety, and psychological well-being. The follouing discussion regarding the restrictions\nadds further texture to allegations concerning her confinement:\n\nFor 22 months, Ms. Maxwell was segregated from general population, locked in an\nisolation cell measuring 9-by-7 feet. While confined to that cell, she was restricted from moving\n'S The transfer was made without any notice to Ms. Maxwell’s counsel or consultation with Ms. Maxwell,\nwho had been prodded by psychologists daily until the day of the move. Notably, within the week leading\nup to Ms. Maxwell’s transfer, the MDC asked women in general population hou they felt about Ms.\nMaxwell joining their unit. No reciprocal inquiry was afforded Ms. Maxwell when it came to a radical\nchange in her housing circumstances.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo468", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010471.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 663 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 25 of 77\n\nBecause Ms. Maxwell was kept in isolation, she was denied the minimal amenities\nprovided to general population inmates even during COVID. Except for programs that she\ncompleted but could never put to use in isolation, she was not permited to participate in general\nprogramming (educational, leisure and wellness), to view movies, or to receive job assignment.\nWhen she first arrived in the MDC, she was handcuffed while seated in a chair watching television.\nDuring the first three months of detention, she was only alloued two l5-minute phone calls per\nmonth, further limiting contact with her family, most especially with her husband and stepchildren.\nThis is the same <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span> that was applied in MCC’s lo South, the super-secure\nspecial/segregated housing unit (“SHU”) for inmates charged with terrorism offenses. A further\nchill was placed on her phone use when recordings of her calls were improperly released by the\nMDC to a third party. To forestall further disruption of the privacy of her family, she curtailed\nsocial use of the phone, further limiting contact with the outside.\n\nMs. Maxwell was denied adequate nutrition. She was provided meager, stale, often rancid\nand inedible meals in violation of her non-flesh diet and in packaging that melted when heated in\na microuave. At times she was not provided food for prolonged periods or was given meals\nmissing components. She was denied access to basic hygiene items, e.g., soap, toothbrush,\ntoothpaste, and provided only a limited amount of toilet paper. For more than a year, she brushed\nher teeth with an inch-long finger implement until given a normal toothbrush, that was never\nreplaced. Her commissary list was restricted, and she was not permited to order items available\nto other inmates.'> When the tap water in her isolation cell was foul-smelling and undrinkable,\nrequests for botled water were initially rejected by the prison administration. As a result of being\nprovided an inadequate diet, Ms. Maxwell has lost about 2o pounds and suffered from telogen\n'S Even in general population, her commissary is more restricted than other inmates.

Recently she has manifested symptoms of depression and trauma such as\nanxiety, and minor cognitive deficits. These continue to be exacerbated by ongoing\nsleep deprivation and the conditions of her confinement. Given my extensive\nexperience working with incarcerated individuals, based on the manner in which\nMs. Maxwell’s symptoms have manifest, it is clear that her symptoms are in no\nway related to the charges that have been brought against her.

The fact that she was subjected to\nan anti-suicide surveillance regime even though she has no suicidal tendencies demonstrates that\nshe was being treated differently, without any objective justification. Follouing the verdict, and\nin the presence of two officers, an MDC psychologist told Ms. Maxwell she was being placed on\nsuicide watch. The psychologist stated she had opposed placing Ms. Maxwell on suicide watch\nbecause Ms. Maxwell did not then and never had presented any suicidal indications. Houever,\nthe psychologist’s professional opinion was overruled per directives from Washington, DC.\nIsolated from all inmates and denied social visits due to COVID restrictions, her only\nhuman contact was with the staff that controlled her, except when COVID restrictions for counsel\nvisits were lifted. As such, prison personnel were her primary source of MDC/BOP related\ninformation, and she often received misinformation, i.e., the date by which she must file an\nadministrative remedy.\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo474", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010476.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 663 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 3o of 77\nconfinement, conditions far more arduous than those experienced by pretrial detainees, or even\nsentenced prisoners, in general population.

Excepting inmates charged with terrorism, disciplined for severe institutional infractions and violence,\nand Mexican drug lord “El Chapo”, Ms. Maxwell has been subjected to the most unusual and punitive form\nof pretrial detention. Accordingly, it is appropriate to make a sentencing submission that exposes the\nunfairness of her detention in the hope that the government (e.g., DOJ, BOP, and prosecutors) not repeat\nsuch disparate treatment and courts recognize that it cannot abandon its supervisory pouers to permit BOP\nbureaucrats to exercise administrative measures without accountability.\n\n* “Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments\ninflicted.” U.S. Const. amend xi.\n“USSG, Part A, §§ 2-5 (2o2l).\n*> See Solem v.

The most basic objective is to “combat crime through an effective, fair sentencing\nsystem” through (i) honesty in sentencing (that is, removing the pouer of the parole commission to reduce\nthe term to be served); (ll) reasonable uniformity in sentencing - by reducing the wide disparity of sentences\nfor similar offenses; and (i) proportionate sentences.

Courts sentence convicted offenders to prison as\npunishment. Courts order pretrial defendants detained to safeguard the community and to ensure\npresence at court proceedings, not for punishment. In evaluating the nature and extent of\npunishment, it is important to factor in the actual impact of the hardship on the defendant. If\ndetention imposes an additional burden on a certain category of defendants, it is necessary to\nincorporate the actual total burden of the punishment into sentencing calibrations.\n\nThe principle of proportionality requires that the additional burden experienced by Ms.\nMaxwell during the 22 months spent is in supermax-type conditions should be factored into the\nCourt’s sentencing calculus. Based on the underpinnings of punishment and the principle of\nproportionality, a hard-time credit for Ms. Maxwell’s unusual detention is warranted.\nImprisonment in any form is a severe hardship. This is especially so when a person presumed to\nbe innocent is detained pretrial. The standard measure for evaluating the hardship of incarceration\nis the length of the prison term, i.e., a value is placed on this quantitative measure when assessing\ndamages for wrongful conviction. Regardless of whether there is an objective mathematical\nformula for Ms. Maxwell’s unique situation, a meaningful credit is warranted.’\n\nThere is a manifestly stark qualitative difference in the degree of deprivation, <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span>,\nand punishment between the first 22 months of Ms. Maxwell’s detention and her current detention\nin general population. Her detention in isolation — de facto solitary confinement comparable to\n27 Compensation determinations for individuals wrongfully incarcerated is illustrative. Thirty-six states and\nWashington, DC, have laws that offer compensation for exonerees. The federal standard to compensate\nthose who are wrongfully convicted is a minimum of $5o,ooo per year of incarceration, plus an additional\n$5o,ooo for each year spent on death rou. See htps://www.congress.gov/bill/] l7th-congress/house-\nbill/4ol9/text?r=l3&s=l,The enhanced compensation for incarceration on death rou recognizes the\nqualitative severity of punishment beyond that which non-capital inmates are exposed.\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo48l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010699.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document675_ Filed o6/25/22 Page 8of2l\nauthority about such harm.” Payne v. Tennessee, 5ol U.S. 8o8, 8o8 (l99l). Speaking directly to\nMaxwell in this case is particularly important for these victims.

Regardless of Whether Sarah and Elizabeth are CVRA “Victims,” the Court Undoubtedly\n\nPossesses Discretion to Hear from them at Sentencing Under l8 U.S.C. § 366l\n\nFor all the reasons just explained, Sarah and Elizabeth have the right to speak at Maxwell's\nsentencing under the CVRA. Additionally, this Court also possesses broad discretionary pouer,\nderived from statute and common law, to hear from them when determining the appropriate\nsentence for Maxwell’s crimes. See l8 U.S.C. § 366l; see also Degenhardt, 4o5 FSupp.2d at l343\n(discussing the court’s discretionary pouers to hear from victims).\n\nThe Court’s discretion in this case is important not only because it provides an alternative\nbasis for considering Sarah’s and Elizabeth's victim impact, but also because the Court may have\nother requests to speak at Maxwell’s sentencing. Some of these other victims may not be able to\nafford legal counsel to present their arguments to this Court.' Federal courts have wide discretion to\ngather information at sentencing subject to only a few constitutional or statutory restrictions. See\nUnited States v.

Release\nBy submiting a claim to the Program, a Claimant is seeking to resolve all claims relating to allegations\nof sexual abuse against Epstein and/or the Estate, and related entities and individuals as set forth in the\nRelease. If a Claimant chooses to accept the offer of compensation pursuant to the Program, the\nClaimant will be required to sign and execute a full Release, in a form satisfactory to the Estate, of all\npast and future claims (including lis pendens, writs of atachment, etc.) relating to such allegations of\nsexual abuse against the Estate, related entities and/or related individuals. A Claimant may reject the\noffer of compensation and may stop participating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time\nprior to the execution of the Release.\nThe Release will waive any rights the Claimant and her heirs, descendants, legatees or beneficiaries\nmay have to assert any claims relating to allegations of sexual abuse against the Estate, related\nentities and/or related individuals, to file an individual legal action relating to such allegations, or to\nparticipate in any civil legal action associated with such allegations, except as a witness. Houever,\nthe Release will not operate to preclude or limit the Claimant’s ability to report and discuss\nallegations of sexual abuse with law enforcement officials or anyone else. In other words, the\nRelease will not impose any rules of confidentiality on claimants, who are expressly permited to\ndiscuss their allegations without <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span>, should they choose.\nBefore signing a Release, the Claimant must consult with an atorney selected by the Claimant. If the\nClaimant is not represented by an atorney, the Program will provide an atorney to provide free legal\ncounseling to the Claimant for the sole purpose of advising the Claimant concerning the language and\nbinding nature of the Release.\nNo one affiliated with the Program will provide tax or legal advice to those receiving payments under\nthe Program. Claimants are urged to consult with a tax advisor concerning any questions regarding\ntax liability for payments pursuant to the Program.\n4. Payments\nUpon the Claimant’s acceptance of the Administrator’s determination, the Administrator’s receipt of\nthe Claimant’s executed Release and, where applicable, dismissal with prejudice of any existing\nlawsuit, legal actions or claims against the Estate or related entities and/or related individuals, the\nAdministrator will initiate payment by check or electronic funds transfer to each eligible Claimant as\ndirected by the Claimant.

The Program conducts proactive outreach with all unrepresented\nClaimants to ensure that they are fully informed of the Program’s policies and\nprocedures, and to answer any questions they may have.\n\nl5.Can I add an atorney or change the atorney associated with my claim?\nYes.

For Claimants having difficulty due\nto the COVID-l9 pandemic, most states have enacted statutes or Executive\nOrders to allou alternatives, such as via video conference or fax.

(Everdell, Christian) (Entered: o7/29/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 36 | PROTECTIVE ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell...regarding procedures to be\nfolloued that shall govern the handling of confidential material. SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9255", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019256.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document l-2, o9/o9/2o2o, 292774l, Pagel8 of l9\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span> is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9273", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019274.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 5-2, o9/o9/2o2o, 2927755, Pagell of l2\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span> is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

As already noted, if civil discovery were\nto proceed, Maxwell would have to make the difficult decision of whether to assert her Fifth\nAmendment privilege — a decision that could adversely impact her position in one or the other of\nthe cases she is defending. See Louis Vuiton, 676 F.3d at 97. Also, due to heightened\nrestrictions at the MDC during the COVID-l9 pandemic (restrictions of which this Court takes\njudicial notice), this Court understands that counsel has had difficulty, and will likely continue to\nhave difficulty, meeting with Maxwell and arranging for her to review documents or otherwise to\nconfer for the purpose of preparing a defense to this civil case. (See 8/l9/2o Menninger Ltr.,\nat 5; see also 9/4/2o Menninger Reply Ltr., at 2-3.)\n\nThis Court finds that not only the existence of the criminal prosecution against Maxwell,\nbut also the particularly (and unusually) restrictive circumstances of her current detention, would\nnecessarily make it harder for Maxwell to participate fully in the discovery process in this action,\nand would cause her undue prejudice, weighing strongly in favor of a stay.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oool9453", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019454.jpg": "Case Casec¥oo6464-JGKDGAt Docifienl82o AieeBbege.A72%eRage lo of l3\n5. The Interests of the Court\n\nAs for the interest of the Court, it appears that staying discovery in the civil case could\nconserve judicial resources. Where a criminal case can potentially streamline the related civil\ncase, this factor supports a stay. Sec. & Exch. Comm’n vy. Abraj Inv. Mgmt. Ltd., No. l9cv3244\n(AJN), 2ol9 WL 6498282, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2ol9). As observed by the Government, the\npending criminal case against Maxwell may resolve issues of fact common to the two actions,\nand may therefore reduce the number of issues to be decided in subsequent proceedings in this\ncase. (See 9/4/2o Gov’t Ltr. at 2.)\n\nFurther, although it should not be the decisive factor, this Court also notes that it has\nsome interest in coordinating discovery, where appropriate, among the many civil cases that have\nbeen brought in this District against the Epstein estate, and that none of those other cases are\ncurrently going forward. This Court additionally notes that tighter restrictions on discovery may\nbe imposed in the context of a criminal prosecution than in a civil litigation, and that, if this civil\ncase were to move forward, restrictions that have already been placed on Maxwell’s access to\ninformation in her criminal case could have a limiting effect on this Court’s ability to supervise\ndiscovery here. (See 9/4/2o Gov’t Ltr., at 3-4 (noting that “Maxwell’s access to information\nabout the criminal mater is under the jurisdiction of the Honorable Alison J. Nathan, who has\nentered a protective order and has issued several rulings regarding the scope of discovery that\nMaxwell is entitled to and the manner in which she may or may not use that information’); see\nalso 8/27/2o Moskouitz Ltr., at 3 (noting that Maxwell had indicated, in her initial disclosures,\nthat, due to the terms of a protective order entered in the criminal case, she would be prohibited\nfrom disclosing certain information in the civil case).)\n\nThus, at least to some extent, the Court’s interest weighs in favor of a stay.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oool9454", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019468.jpg": "9/l8/2o2o Case 2o-3o6l, Document 64pWyG7ReO2OceB@828o2 Pagell of l25\n| Alison J.

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the language,\ntwo areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language allouing her to\npublicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on the public record to\nthe media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein.\nSecond, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential Government witnesses and their\ncounsel from using discovery materials for any purpose other than preparing for the\ncriminal trial in this action. The Government has proposed contrary language on both of\nthese issues. For the follouing reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed\nprotective order Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the\ncourt may, for good cause, deny, restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other\nappropriate relief.\" The good cause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests,\nincluding whether dissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others...\nwhether the imposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the\npublic's interest in the information.\" United States v.

First, the\ndefense believes that potential government witnesses and their counsel should be subject to the\nsame restrictions as the defense concerning appropriate use of the discovery materials—namely,\nif these individuals are given access to discovery materials during trial preparation, they may not\nuse those materials for any purpose other than preparing for trial in the criminal case, and may\nnot post those materials on the Internet. Second, the defense believes it should not be restricted\nfrom publicly disclosing or disseminating the identity of any alleged victims or potential\nwitnesses referenced in the discovery materials who have already identified themselves by\nspeaking on the public record.\n\nAs set forth belou, we believe that the proposed protective order contains appropriate\nrestrictions that are no broader than necessary to protect the privacy interests of individuals\n\nApp.o39\nDOJ-OGR-oool9498", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019499.jpg": "OGsedl AZADA S BOs ATT thd MAE 2o2 F ib 2AY/PagPkyefi2l ab4\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Annabi, No. lo Cr. 7 (CM), 2olo WL l25322l, at *l\n(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2olo). To establish that good cause exists for proposed restrictions in a\nprotective order, the government must shou that disclosure will cause “a clearly defined and\nserious injury.” United States v. Wecht, 484 F.3d l94, 2ll (3d Cir. 2oo7). A finding of harm\n“must be based on a particular factual demonstration of potential harm, not on conclusory\nstatements.” United States v. Gangi, l998 WL 226l96, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 4, l998) (citations\nand internal quotations omited). “Broad allegations of harm, unsubstantiated by specific\nexamples or articulated reasoning, do not support a good cause shouing.” Wecht, 484 F.3d at\n2ll.\n\nCourts must be careful not to impose a protective order that is “broader than is necessary”\nto accomplish its goals. United States v. Lindh, l98 F. Supp. 2d 739, 742 (E.D. Va. 2oo2)\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited). Thus, courts are instructed to “weigh the\nimpact” of requested protections and their extent against a defendant’s “due process right to\nprepare and present a full defense at trial.” Jd.\n\nDiscussion\n\nl. Restrictions on Use of Discovery Materials\n\nThe government and the defense agree that the protective order should include a\n<span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span> prohibiting Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel from (i) using discovery materials “for\nany civil proceeding or any purpose” other than defending or preparing for this criminal action;\nor (i) posting discovery materials on the Internet. See Ex. A ff l(a), 5. The defense’s proposed\nprotective order would make those same restrictions applicable to potential government\nwitnesses and their counsel so that they are on equal footing with the defense. See Ex. A ff 3, 5.\nThe government has indicated that it cannot agree to such a <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span>, despite acknouledging\nthat it will very likely share discovery materials with those individuals during the course of trial\npreparation.\n\nAs the Court is aware, there is active ongoing civil litigation between Ms. Maxwell and\nmany of the government’s potential witnesses. Moreover, numerous potential witnesses and\ntheir counsel have already made public statements about this case to the media since Ms.\nMaxwell’s arrest. There is a substantial concern that these individuals will seek to use discovery\nmaterials to support their civil cases and future public statements. It is therefore vital that the\ngovernment’s potential witnesses and their counsel be subject to the same restrictions as Ms.\n\nApp.o4o\nDOJ-OGR-oool9499", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019500.jpg": "OGsedl ZADAeO SBOs ATT thd WARE 2o2 F i627 /PagPeyefisl ab4\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 27, 2o2o\nPage 3\nMaxwell with respect to using the criminal discovery material solely for the purpose of this\ncriminal case.\n\na, Victim/Witness Identities\n\nMs. Maxwell’s proposed protective order prohibits Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and\nothers on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity of any alleged victim or\npotential witness referenced in the discovery materials, but does not prohibit defense counsel\nfrom publicly referencing individuals “who have spoken on the public record to the media or in\npublic fora, or in litigation—criminal or otherwise—trelating to Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine\nMaxwell.” /d. § 6. This language, which is nearly identical in all material respects to the\nlanguage in the protective order approved in the government’s criminal prosecution of Mr.\nEpstein, see United States v. Epstein, l9-CR-oo49o-RMB (S.D.N.Y. July 25, 2ol9), ensures\nappropriate privacy protections for alleged victims and should be approved here.\n\nIn contrast to the more permissive language it agreed to with respect to Mr. Epstein, the\ngovernment has taken the position that Ms. Maxwell’s defense counsel should only be alloued to\ndisclose the identity of alleged victims or potential witnesses who have spoken by name on the\npublic record “in this case.” The government’s proposal, houever, advances no compelling\nprivacy protections, and instead prevents the defense from making reference to individuals who\nhave already voluntarily publicly disclosed their identities by, among other things, pursuing civil\nsuits in their oun name against Ms. Maxwell and/or Mr. Epstein; speaking by name in the public\nrecord in Mr. Epstein’s criminal proceedings; participating in on-the-record media interviews; or\nposting comments under their oun names on social media. The government’s proposed\n<span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span> is therefore “broader than necessary” to protect the privacy interests of these\nindividuals who have already chosen to self-identify, and will hinder the defense’s ability to\nconduct further factual investigation, prepare witnesses for trial, and advocate on Ms. Maxwell’s\nbehalf.\n\n* * *\nApp.o4l\nDOJ-OGR-oool95oo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019519.jpg": "CGsedl AZADA SBos ATT (hdc WAG 262 F i627 28/PAg KQei5| B57\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 5\na provision stating that it did not prohibit defense counsel from publicly referencing individuals\nwho had spoken on the public record in /itigation relating to Jeffrey Epstein. Jd. 74. Here, defense\ncounsel seeks permission to publicly identify any individuals who have self-identified as victims\nof either the defendant or Epstein “to the media or in public fora, or in litigation”—a vastly broader\nallouance. Indeed, as a comparison, none of the hypothetical examples described above would\nhave been subject to public naming and identification under the Epstein protective order, but every\nsingle one would be under the defendant’s proposed order in this case.\n\nAdditionally, beyond the differences in the language itself, there are two significant\ndifferences between the circumstances of the Epstein prosecution and this case. First, at the time\nthe Epstein protective order was entered, there were exceptionally few victims who had identified\nthemselves by name in litigation. Accordingly, the practical application of that provision was\nextremely limited. Second, and related, in the time between when the Epstein protective order was\nentered and the indictment in this case, many more victims have made public statements about\ntheir victimization at the hands of Epstein, and the defendant, on their oun terms and in their oun\nways, including by exercising their rights under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act in the context of\nthe dismissal of the indictment against Jeffrey Epstein follouing his suicide. Those victims could\nnot possibly have predicted, much less chosen, that their names would be publicly broadcast by\ndefense counsel in connection with a subsequent criminal case. Victims should be able to continue\nto come forward, in the ways and in the venues they themselves choose, without fear of reprisal,\nshaming, or other consequence arising from having their identities broadcast by defense counsel\nin this case.\n\nIn sum, the requested modification to the Government’s proposed order sought by the\ndefendant is contrary to precedent and the compelling privacy interests of victims. Moreover, it is\nwithout basis in fact or law, and, despite the Government’s repeated requests for clarity, the\ndefendant and defense counsel have offered no legitimate reason for their desire to be able to\npublicly identify any number of victims, in the context of this criminal case and elsewhere, other\nthan a minimal, conclusory statement, without factual examples or legal support.? At botom, the\ndefendant and her counsel seek an unlimited ability to name victims and witnesses publicly, for no\ndiscernible reason, and without justification or legal basis. The victims of Ghislaine Maxwell and\nJeffrey Epstein have suffered enough, and the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, applicable law, and\ncommon decency compel far more protection of their privacy interests here than the defense\nproposal would afford.\n\nB. The Defendant’s Demand that the Government Restrict Use of its Own Documents\n\nThe defendant and her counsel also ask the Court to impose restrictions upon the\nGovernment in its use, through potential witnesses and their counsel, of documents it currently\npossesses, beyond the already-extensive restrictions and protections applicable to the\n\n> To the extent defense counsel atempts to provide such examples or arguments for the first\ntime in a reply filing, the Government respectfully requests leave to reply to those examples or\narguments.\nApp.o6o\nDOJ-OGR-oool95l9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019520.jpg": "Odsedl ADA SBos ATT tide WHE 262 F iB 628/PAg Kayei6l 257\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Indeed, it is nonsensical for a protective\norder to require limitations of the Government in its use of material already in its possession so\nthat the Government may provide a defendant with discovery. The defendant’s atempt to refuse\nto agree to receive discovery unless the Government agrees to additional restrictions upon the use\nof its oun materials should be rejected.\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government’s use of materials it has gathered through its\ninvestigation, including through the grand jury process, search warrants, interviews, and voluntary\ndisclosures, is already subject to a wide range of restrictions, including Rule 6(e) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other policies of the Department of\nJustice and the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. In this case,\nconsistent with the Government’s customary practice, and as the Government has informed\ndefense counsel, the Government has no intention of providing witnesses, victims or their counsel\nwith the entirety of discovery produced to the defendant, nor anything even close to that. Indeed,\nconsistent with its standard practice, the Government rarely provides any third party, including a\nwitness, with any material they did not already possess. While the Government does more\ncommonly shou a witness materials in connection with proffers or trial preparation, the\nGovernment rarely if ever shous a_ witness material she has not already seen, does not have\npersonal knouledge of, or would not have some specific reason to opine upon. Practically\nspeaking, therefore, the concerns defense counsel raises about future use in civil litigation are not\nlikely to occur.\n\nNevertheless, a criminal protective order is not the appropriate forum for the defendant to\ndemand restrictions on the Government’s use of its oun materials. To the contrary, as noted above,\nmany of those restrictions are already established by rule and law—standards the defendant makes\nno suggestion the Government has failed to adhere to in this case. Moreover, the Government as\na whole, including those beyond the prosecutors on this case, may have obligations that would\nconflict with such language in a protective order. For example, the Government has obligations\nunder various statutory and regulatory regimes, including but not limited to the Freedom of\nInformation Act and Touhy v. Ragen, 34o U.S. 462 (l95l), that cannot be bargained away through\na protective order. Indeed, the Government can represent that the Department of Justice has\nreceived both FOJA and Jouhy requests in connection with this investigation, requests to which\nthe Department has a legal obligation to respond appropriately. The Government respectfully\nsubmits it would be inappropriate for the defendant to seek—or the Court to order—language in a\nprotective order that conflicts with or supersedes those obligations. Tellingly, the defendant cites\nno authority or precedent for her request regarding this issue.\n\nBy contrast, to the extent the defendant intends to produce reciprocal discovery to the\nGovernment, it may in that case be appropriate to limit the Government’s use, or third parties’ use,\n\n* Specifically, the defendant’s proposed protective order differs from the Government’s in that\nit adds a paragraph, its paragraph 3, proposing restrictions upon the Government and its potential\nwitnesses, and their counsel, as well as adding language to its paragraph 5, which is Government\nparagraph 4, further restricting potential government witnesses and their counsel.\nApp.o6l\nDOJ-OGR-oool952o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019521.jpg": "OGsedl ADA S BOs ATT (hdc WHE 262 F iB 6228/PAg Ragei7l Ab7\nThe Honorable Alison J.

But there is no basis to add\nadditional restrictions upon the Government’s use of materials gathered by the Government itself.\nThe defendant’s only counter-argument, as noted—that this Court should put third parties\n“on equal footing with the defense’—is both unlikely to be relevant given the Government’s\nstandard practice, as described above, and, the Government submits, an irrelevant consideration in\nthe context of a criminal protective order. Indeed, the Government respectfully submits that\nneither it nor this Court is well-positioned to, or should, become the arbiter of what is appropriate\nor permissible in civil cases.\nIn sum, the defendant’s atempt to restrict the Government and to restrict third parties in\nthis way appears to be unprecedented, and is without legal basis, and should be denied.\nAccordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the Court should enter the Government’s\nproposed protective order, which is enclosed, and deny the defendant’s motion.\nRespectfully submited,\nAUDREY STRAUSS\nActing United States Atorney\nBy:\nAlex Rossmiller / Alison Moe / Maurene Comey\nAssistant United States Atorneys\nSouthern District of New York\nTel: (2l2) 637-24l5\nCe: — All counsel of record (via ECF)\nApp.o62\nDOJ-OGR-oool952l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019548.jpg": "Cased ADAP SBos AT en (dc WME 32 FiRAB62o/Pageigei3l ab3\nstake.

Hayden Co. of\nN.Y. v. Siemens Medical Sys., Inc., 797 F.2d 85, 9o (2d\nCir. l986) (‘The district court’s denial of modification\n[of a protective order] does not fall within the ‘collat-\neral order’ doctrine of Cohen.”). Because “a litigant\ndoes not have an unrestrained right to disseminate in-\nformation that has been obtained through pretrial dis-\ncovery,” such protective orders do not amount to an im-\npermissible prior restraint under the First Amend-\nment. Caparros, 8oo F.2d at 25. Even where a litigant\nraises a colorable argument that a protective order vi-\nolates a litigant’s right to release documents outside of\ncriminal litigation, “adjudication of any such right can\nawait final judgment on the underlying charges” be-\ncause the “purported right at issue is not related to any\nright not to stand trial.” Jd. at 26.\nB. Discussion\n\nMaxwell’s jurisdictional arguments run afoul of\nthis Circuit’s precedent and offer no justification for\nincluding the Order in the “small class” of decisions\nthat constitute immediately appealable collateral or-\nders.

Instead, the Protective Order “im-\nposed restrictions on the parties’ disclosure of materi-\nals exchanged in the course of pending litigation” and,\nlike the similar provision in the Pappas protective or-\nder, is therefore “not subject to appeal” prior to entry\nof final judgment. Pappas, 94 F.3d at 798.\n\nCaparros is similarly analogous. That case declined\nto find jurisdiction over a similar order for several rea-\nsons, including because “[t]he purported right at issue\nis not related to any right to stand trial.” Caparros, 8oo\nF.2d at 26. The Court also concluded that the protec-\ntive order in that case would be reviewable on appeal\nafter final judgment and emphasized that the defend-\nant would not suffer any “grave harm ... if the order\nis not immediately reviewed.” Jd. So too here. Maxwell\nhas not articulated any serious injury she will suffer if\nthis Court dismisses her appeal. The only theoretical\nharm might be prejudicial pretrial publicity arising\nfrom the unsealing of filings in a civil case. Should any\nprejudicial publicity arise, though, Maxwell will be\nfully able to raise that issue on appeal after the entry\nof final judgment in her criminal case. See, e.g., United\nStates v.

Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing factors include\nbut are not limited to the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o (quoting United\nStates v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo48 (2d Cir.l995) (\"Amodeo II\")). The proposed\nredactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that Defendant's leter motions are\n\"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process,'\nthereby qualifying as a \"judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the\nLugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995).\nAnd the Court also finds that the common law presumption of access ataches. Id. at\nl46; see also Nixon v. Warner Commce'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 6o2 (l978).\nNevertheless, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the redactions are narrouly tailored to properly guard the\nprivacy interests of the individuals referenced in the Defendant's submission and in the\ncorresponding exhibits The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the redacted\ndocuments and corresponding exhibits.

Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the documents in\nquestion are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of the common law\npresumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access.

In\naccordance with this Court's December 7, 2o2o Order, see Dkt.

These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span> is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial.

But the statutory maximum is\nhardly relevant to determine risk of flight. In the vast majority of\nfederal cases, the statutory maximum penalties are sky-high and are\nnot reflective of the real potential penalties. See, e.g., l8 U.S.C. l658(b)\n(statutory maximum of life imprisonment for turning off a light in a\nlighthouse to expose a ship to danger).\n\nEven if there were evidence to back up the four anonymous\naccusers, the Second Circuit “require[s] more than evidence of the\ncommission of a serious crime and the fact of a potential long sentence\nto support a finding of risk of flight.” United States v. Friedman, 837\nF.2d 48, 49-5o (2d.

Importantly, in contrast with the bail position it took with Epstein, the government\ndoes not and cannot assert that Ms. Maxwell presents a danger to the community under Section\n3l42(g)(4).\n\nMs. Maxwell’s Response. The Court should exercise its discretion to grant bail to Ms.\nMaxwell, on the strict conditions proposed belou (or as modified by the Court), for two\ncompelling reasons.\n\nFirst, the COVID-l9 crisis and its impact on detained defendants warrants release. As\nthis Court has noted, the COVID-l9 pandemic represents an unprecedented health risk to\nincarcerated individuals, and COVID-l9-related restrictions on atorney communications with\npretrial detainees significantly impair a defendant’s ability to prepare her defense. Simply put,\nunder these circumstances, if Ms. Maxwell continues to be detained, her health will be at serious\nrisk and she will not be able to receive a fair trial. (See infra Section I, pages 5 to 9).\n\nSecond, the Court should grant bail because the government has not met its burden under\nthe Bail Reform Act and controlling case law. The presumption relied on by the government\nmay be rebuted, and is so here. Ms. Maxwell has strong ties to the community: she is a U.S.\ncitizen and has lived in this country for almost 3o years; she ran a non-profit company based in\nthe United States until the recent media frenzy about this case forced her to wind it doun to\nprotect her professional colleagues and their organizations; and she has very close ties with\nfamily members and friends in New York and the rest of the country. Nor does her conduct\nindicate that she is a flight risk: she has no prior criminal record; has spent years contesting civil\nlitigation arising from her supposed ties to Epstein; and has remained in the United States from\nthe time of Epstein’s arrest until the present, with her counsel in regular contact with the\ngovernment. She did not flee, but rather left the public eye, for the entirely understandable\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oool988l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019883.jpg": "Cast F-26-2oDS5O.ASN Bacturhert l8 HiedOPAO/bo Pages of 26o\ninnocence.”’). The government has failed to meet its burden of establishing that Ms. Maxwell\npresents an “actual risk of flight” and must be detained under Section 3l42. The strict bail\nconditions outlined above are appropriate under the circumstances and are the “least restrictive”\nset of conditions that will “reasonably assure” Ms. Maxwell’s appearance in Court, without the\nhealth and access to counsel risks inherent in the government’s request that Ms. Maxwell be\ndetained pending trial. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 (c)(l)(B). Under the controlling legal standards,\nMs. Maxwell should be released on bail.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nThere are two compelling reasons why the Court should order Ms. Maxwell’s release\non bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed:\n\nFirst, Ms. Maxwell will be at significant risk of contracting COVID-l9 if she is detained,\nand she will not be able to meaningfully participate in the preparation of her defense due to the\nrestrictions that have been placed on atorney visits and phone calls in light of the pandemic.\n\nSecond, the government has failed to carry its burden under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 that no\ncombination of conditions can be imposed that will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s presence in\ncourt.\n\nI. The Conditions Created by the COVID-l9 Pandemic Mandate the Release of\n\nMs. Maxwell,\n\nImpact of COVID-l9 on the Prison Population. We submit that the conditions created by\nthe COVID-l9 pandemic compel Ms. Maxwell’s release pursuant to appropriate bail conditions.\nFour months ago, this Court held in United States v. Stephens, l5-CR-95 (AJN), 2o2o WL\nl295l55 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. l9, 2o2o), that COVID-l9 is an “unprecedented and extraordinarily\ndangerous” threat that justifies release on bail. /d. at *2. In that case, the defendant, who had no\nunderlying medical conditions, filed an emergency motion for reconsideration of the Court’s\n\nb\nDOJ-OGR-oool9883", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019886.jpg": "CaGese2hlcrdaseuAUAN Scene l &Pitdd BHPPHMS Pages 2 St 2EP\n\nStephens, Ms. Maxwell’s inability to meet with her atorneys while this policy is in effect\nconstitutes a “compelling reason” requiring her release. Stephens, 2o2o WL l295l55 at *3.°\n\nEven speaking by phone with Ms. Maxwell presents daunting challenges due to COVID-\nl9-related protocols requiring at least 72 hours’ notice to schedule a call, unless it is urgent, in\nwhich case counsel can email a request to the MDC. As counsel learned this past week,\nhouever, even an urgent call request does not mean the call will take place in the time required.\nAt approximately 5:3o p.m. on July 6, 2o2o, the Court ordered us to confer with Ms. Maxwell\nabout waiving her physical presence at the arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing, and\nordered counsel for both sides to jointly report back by 9:oo p.m. that night with a proposed date\nand time for these proceedings. We promptly emailed the MDC to request an urgent call,\nmaking specific reference to the Court’s Order, but were not connected with Ms. Maxwell until\n9:oo p.m. There will no doubt be other orders of the Court with no guarantees we will be able to\nreach our client in time if she is detained.’ In addition, during this past week, Ms. Maxwell has\nnot been able to physically review documents and has had limited access to writing materials.\nThe prohibition on in-person visits means we must read to her any documents requiring her\nreview, and she has virtually no ability to take notes. The age of the allegations in this case\ncompound these problems. Under the current circumstances, Ms. Maxwell cannot review\n6 Since the Court issued its opinion in Stephens, numerous other courts in this District have ordered defendants\nreleased on bail, over the government’s objection, due to the pandemic and its impact on the defendant’s ability to\nprepare for trial. See, e.g., United States v. Carrillo-Villa, 2o-MJ-3o73 (SLC) (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 6, 2o2o) (releasing\nundocumented defendant in drug conspiracy case because of inability to meaningfully communicate with lawyer and\nrisk of COVID-l9); United States v. Hudson, l9-CR-496 (CM) (S.D.N.Y. Mar. l9, 2o2o) (releasing defendant in\ndrug conspiracy, loansharking, and extortion case, whose two prior, pre-COVID-l9 bail applications were denied,\nbecause of inability to prepare for upcoming trial and risk of COVID-l9); United States v. Chandler, l9-CR-867\n(PAC), 2o2o WL l528l2o, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 3l, 2o2o) (releasing defendant on felon in possession case, with\nprior manslaughter conviction, due to inability to prepare for trial due to COVID-l9 restrictions).\n7 The government has recently worked with the BOP to set up a standing call between counsel and Ms. Maxwell\neach morning until the initial appearance to facilitate atorney-client communications. While we greatly appreciate\nthese efforts, they are a short-term patch to a persistent problem that shous no signs of abating. Nor would it be\nappropriate, on an ongoing basis, for the prosecutors to be involved in and dictate the date and time of our\ncommunications with our client in connection with the preparation of our defense.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oool9886", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019887.jpg": "Case 922 lcrDISSCUAUIN DstamteHPl &Pitdd B77 POH Pagers St 2o\ndocuments and other evidence from approximately twenty-five years ago and meaningfully assist\nin the preparation of her defense.

The Government Has Not Carried Its Burden Under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42,\n\nThe grave concerns raised by the current COVID-l9 crisis notwithstanding, Ms. Maxwell\nmust be released because she has met her limited burden of production shouing that she does not\npose a flight risk, and the government has entirely failed to demonstrate that no release condition\nor combination of conditions exist that will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s presence in court.\n\nA.

Salerno, 48l\nU.S. 739, 755 (l987). Pretrial detention is appropriate only where “no condition or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the [defendant].” United States v.\nSabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (quoting l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)). The Bail Reform Act\nprovides that a court “shall order the pretrial release” of the defendant (l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(b))\n(emphasis added), but may impose bail conditions if “such release will not reasonably assure the\nappearance” of the defendant in court. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c). Where conditions are necessary,\nsuch release shall be “subject to the /east restrictive . . . set of conditions that [the court]\ndetermines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.” l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(c)(l)(B) (emphasis added). Consequently, “[u]nder this statutory scheme, ‘it is only a\nlimited group of offenders who should be denied bail pending trial.’” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited).\n\n8 See also Leter of Sean Hecker to Hon.

See Hung v. United\nStates 439 U.S. l326, l329 (l978) (to detain based on risk of flight, government must shou\nmore than “opportunities for flight,’ and instead must establish an “inclination on the part of\n[the defendant] to flee”). That is not what the Bail Reform Act requires. Indeed, courts in\nthis Circuit and elsewhere commonly find that bail conditions can adequately address risk of\nflight, even where individuals have foreign citizenship and passports or otherwise substantial\nforeign connections, and financial means. See, e.g., Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 66; United States v.\nHansen, lo8 F. App’x 33l (6th Cir. 2oo4); United States v. Hanson, 6l3 F. Supp. 2d 85 (D.D.C.\n2oo9); United States v.

To begin with, the\nnotion that the defendant is protected from prosecution by the Non-Prosecution Agreement\n(“NPA”) between Jeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Atorney’s Office in the Southern District of Florida\n(“SDFL”) is absurd. That agreement affords her no protection in this District, for at least three\nreasons. First, the defendant was not a party to that agreement nor named in it as a third-party\nbeneficiary, and the defendant offers no basis to think she would have standing to claim any rights\nunder the NPA. Tellingly, the defendant cites no authority for the proposition that an agreement\nshe was not a party to and that does not even identify her by name could possibly be invoked to\nbar her prosecution. Second, and equally important, the NPA does not bind the Southern District\nof New York, which was not a party to the agreement. See United States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o,\n672 (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam) (“A plea agreement binds only the office of the United States\nAtorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the\nagreement contemplates a broader <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span>.”)); United States v.

So, instead, in its response the government urges the Court to disregard the\nsignificant additional evidence proffered to the Court and further argues that a defendant cannot\nbe eligible for bail (apparently on any conditions), unless she can provide an absolute guarantee\nagainst all risks. But this is not the legal standard. United States v.

Jd. at 83:2l 83:25. The Court also observed that the\nDefendant had family and personal connections to the United States but concluded that the\nabsence of any dependents, significant family ties, or employment in the United States also\nsupported the conclusion that flight would not pose an insurmountable burden for her. Jd. at\n84:4 84:9. While the Defendant’s renewed motion for bail addresses some of these factors, it\ndoes not alter the Court’s conclusion.\n\nThe first few considerations remain relatively unchanged. The Defendant continues to\nhave substantial international ties and multiple foreign citizenships, and she continues to have\nfamilial and personal connections abroad. None of the evidence presented in support of the\npresent motion fundamentally alters those conclusions. To address the Court’s concern that the\nDefendant’s French citizenship presented the opportunity that she could flee to France and that\nshe would be able to resist extradition on that basis, see Tr. at 83:l8—83:2o, the Defendant nou\noffers to waive her right to extradition from both the United Kingdom and France, along with\nexpert opinions reports claiming that such waivers would likely make it possible to resist an\nextradition request from the United States to either country. See Def. Mot., Exs. T, U, V. As the\nGovernment points out in its brief, houever, the legal weight of the waivers is, at best, contested.\nThe French Ministry of Justice, for instance, indicated in a leter submited in conjunction to the\nGovernment’s opposition that the French Code of Criminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits” the\nextradition of a French national. See Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. B. And while the Defendant’s oun\nexpert atempts to rebut the Ministry of Justice’s leter, see Def. Reply, Ex. A, even the\nDefendant’s oun experts use probabilistic, rather than absolute, language, leaving open the\npossibility that extradition would be blocked. See, e.g., Def. Mot., Ex.

The Proposed Additional Bail Conditions Will Reasonably Assure Ms. Maxwell’s\n\nAppearance in Court\n\nAs set forth above, Ms. Maxwell nou proposes two additional restrictions that eliminate\nany means or opportunity that she may have to leave the country. The Court should therefore\nreconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the proposed conditions. See United States v.\nRoue, No. o2 CR. 756 LMM, 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3) (“[A] release\norder may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on reconsideration was knoun to\nthe movant at the time of the original hearing.”); see also United States v. Petrov, No. l5-CR-66-\nLTS, 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5) (noting “Court’s inherent authority for\nreconsideration of the Court’s previous bail decision”).\n\nA. Renunciation of Foreign Citizenship\n\nTo demonstrate her commitment to abide by her conditions of release and to provide\nfurther assurance to the Court that she will not atempt to leave the country, Ms. Maxwell is\nwilling to formally renounce her foreign citizenships in France and the United Kingdom. Should\nthe Court feel this drastic condition is necessary, the required documents will be submited to the\nappropriate authorities. Moreover, as a standard condition of bail, all of Ms. Maxwell’s\npassports will be surrendered to the government and no further application will be made.\n\nIf the Court deems it a necessary condition of release, Ms. Maxwell will formally\ncommence the procedure to renounce her foreign citizenship. The requisite paperwork is in the\nprocess of being completed. Renunciation of UK citizenship can be accomplished immediately\nupon granting of bail. The process of renouncing her French citizenship, while not immediate,\nmay be expedited.\n\nCitizenship is a precious and priceless asset. Ms. Maxwell’s decision to give up\ncitizenship from the county of her birth and the country of her upbringing demonstrates her\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol54", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020156.jpg": "CaSesb: 2o-8o o88oHAEN ZetuPhent /LOO l FileasaesF2igePAge 66st 9\n\nof Ms. Maxwell’s London house and any other assets, excluding salary, hereinafter acquired.\nThe asset manager will approve the financial institution at which the New Account is created and\nmust approve and co-sign any expenditure from the New Account, with the exception of\ndisbursements for Ms. Maxwell’s legal fees in connection with the ongoing criminal and civil\nlitigation and for payment of taxes, which will not require authorization.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nWe write on behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, to respectfully request that the Court\norder the Bureau of Prisons to give Ms. Maxwell access to the laptop computer provided by the\ngovernment so that she can review discovery on weekends and holidays.\n\nAt the request of defense counsel, the government provided Ms. Maxwell with a laptop\ncomputer to review the voluminous discovery, which was produced on a series of external hard\ndrives. Currently, Ms. Maxwell is given access to the laptop only on weekdays. On weekends\nand holidays, Ms. Maxwell must use the prison computer on her floor to review discovery.\nHouever, the prison computer is not equipped with the software necessary to read large portions\nof the discovery recently produced by the government. As a result, Ms. Maxwell loses several\ndays of review time every weekend and every holiday because she does not have access to the\nlaptop. If Ms. Maxwell is to have any hope of reviewing the millions of documents produced in\ndiscovery so that she can properly prepare her defense by the July l2, 2o2l trial date, she must\nhave access to the laptop every day, including weekends and holidays.\n\nDefense counsel has raised this issue with the government and it has no objection to Ms.\nMaxwell having access to the laptop seven days a week. At the request of defense counsel, the\ngovernment has contacted officials at the MDC on several occasions in the past few weeks to\nrequest that they lift this <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span>, but without success.\n\nThere is no principled justification for this <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span>. Ms. Maxwell was given access to\nthe laptop every day (including weekends and the Thanksgiving holiday) for the entire l4-day\nperiod that she was quarantined in her isolation cell in November-December 2o2o because she had\ncome into close contact with a member of the MDC staff who had tested positive for COVID.

The recently filed superseding indictment directly contravenes that\nagreement and adds two new charges which vastly expand the relevant time period from a four-\nyear period in the l99os to an eleven-year period stretching from l994 to 2oo4. These additions\nsignificantly alter the scope of the government’s case and necessarily shift the focus of the\ndefense’s trial preparation. Instead of being focused on mounting a defense to the allegations of\nthe three accusers from the l99os, as we have been doing, the defense will nou have to spend\nconsiderable time and resources investigating allegations of new conduct in a completely\ndifferent time period involving numerous additional witnesses, and with all of the difficulties that\nCOVID restrictions still place on a meaningful defense investigation.\n\nWe do not want to postpone the trial but have no choice but to ask for a continuance. The\ngovernment bears responsibility for this need, having filed a late-breaking superseding\nindictment based on a witness who has been knoun to the government since the Florida\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o3o7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020365.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page? of 24\n\nl3. Second, on December 8, 2o2o, Maxwell renewed her request for\nbail, presenting a revised bail package with additional financial restrictions. (Ex.\nE). After considering multiple writen submissions (Ex. E, F, G), Judge Nathan\ndenied Maxwell’s application in a detailed writen opinion (Ex. H).

Judge Nathan emphasized that Maxwell’s\n“natern of providing incomplete or erroneous information to the Court or to Pretrial\nServices bears significantly’ on her assessment of Maxwell’s history and\ncharacteristics. (/d. at l5). Judge Nathan therefore again concluded that Maxwell\npresented a risk of flight and that Maxwell’s proposed bail package “cannot\nreasonably assure her appearance.” (/d. at l6).

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span> is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o397", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020403.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Pagel7 of 9l\n\nl2/o7/2o2o ENDORSED LETTER as to Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J.

On April 2l, 2o2l, the Court's Chambers received a\nleter from counsel for a non—party requesting assurances as to privacy protections for\nhis client in any filings or proceedings in this case. The leter requests anonymity on\nbehalf of the client as an alleged victim of a sexual crime.

The Court will take no further action based on the April 2l,\n2o2l leter but will file it under seal to protect the privacy interests of the non—party\nasserting that interest.

Dkt. Nos. 248, 253, 254, 258,\n259. Legal counsel for MDC, where Ms. Maxwell is detained pretrial, alleges that her\nlawyers violated Bureau of Prisons rules by providing Ms. Maxwell materials at an\nin-person atorney—client visit. Dkt. Nos. 254, 259. Ms. Maxwells lawyers\ncategorically deny the allegations and threaten separate legal action against MDC staff\nbased on the incident and the accusation. Dkt. Nos. 253, 258. The Court intimates no\nviews as to whether some other action or process is appropriate or proper in light of\neither sides allegations. This Courts obligation in this case, and any other, is to ensure\nthat the defendant is given an opportunity to meet with her lawyers, engage in\nconfidential atorney—client communications, and prepare for trial. Mindful of that\nobligation, the Court declines to take further action at this time. After receiving the\ndefenses first leter motion, the Court ordered MDC legal counsel to shou cause why\nthe Court should not grant the requested relief. Dkt. No. 249. The Court then granted\nin part defense counsels original request and ordered MDC legal counsel to respond to\ncertain questions about the April 24, 2o2l incident and the procedures in place to\nensure the confidentiality of Ms. Maxwells lawyer-client communications. Dkt. No.\n255. Defense counsels current application is that this Court order MDC to turn over\ncopies of video tapes of the in-person atorney—client visit. Dkt. No. 258. Those video\ntapes must be preserved in light of defense counsels preservation leter. Dkt. No. 248,\nEx. C. If Ms. Maxwell or defense counsel are entitled to view or receive copies of\nthose materials as a mater of law, they should be provided. To the extent defense\ncounsel is seeking entitlement to those materials from this Court, that application is\ndenied. The Court has ensured and will continue to ensure that Ms. Maxwell has the\nopportunity to meet meaningfully and confidentially with her lawyers in light of all\nrelevant circumstances and consistent with the treatment of all other detained inmates\nin BOP custody.

Dkt. No. 455. As to the first item, the Government seeks clarification\nabout the line between permissible and impermissible cross—examination for witnesses\ntestifying under a pseudonym. The Government's suggested level of generality as to\npermissible cross—examination of the witnesses’ careers would unduly curtail the\nDefendant's Sixth Amendment right to meaningful cross—examination. See United\nStates v. Figueroa, 548 F.3d 222, 227 (2d Cir. 2oo8). The line of questioning the\nGovernment identifies may be relevant to a juror's credibility determination and thus\nthe Court will not limit the Defendant's ability to pursue such questioning on\ncross—examination. As the Court noted at the November l conference, the Defendant\nmay not elicit the name of a specific employer, but the type and genre of employment\nmay be relevant to the jury's assessment of credibilty. Nov. l, 2o2l Transcript at\nll-l2.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span> is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o498", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020504.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 3-2, o7/o8/2o22, 3344434, Pagel8 of 92\n\nl2/o7/2o2o ENDORSED LETTER as to Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J.

Legal counsel for MDC, where Ms. Maxwell is detained pretrial, alleges that her\nlawyers violated Bureau of Prisons rules by providing Ms. Maxwell materials at an\nin-person atorney—client visit.

Dkt. No. 455. As to the first item, the Government seeks clarification\nabout the line between permissible and impermissible cross—examination for witnesses\ntestifying under a pseudonym. The Government's suggested level of generality as to\npermissible cross—examination of the witnesses’ careers would unduly curtail the\nDefendant's Sixth Amendment right to meaningful cross—examination. See United\nStates v. Figueroa, 548 F.3d 222, 227 (2d Cir. 2oo8). The line of questioning the\nGovernment identifies may be relevant to a juror's credibility determination and thus\nthe Court will not limit the Defendant's ability to pursue such questioning on\ncross—examination. As the Court noted at the November l conference, the Defendant\nmay not elicit the name of a specific employer, but the type and genre of employment\nmay be relevant to the jury's assessment of credibilty. Nov. l, 2o2l Transcript at\nll-l2. As to the second item, the Government is ORDERED to submit a proposed\norder regarding sketch artist depictions of certain witnesses on or before November l8,\n2o2l. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

The Defense on\nDecember l2, 2o2l, moved to permit three anticipated witnesses to testify under a\npseudonym or their first names only. The Government filed a leter opposing this\nrequest on December l4, 2o2l. The Defense's primary contention is that some form of\nanonymity for its witnesses is justified by the same reasons that the Court permited\nthree alleged victims and two related government witnesses to testify under\npseudonyms. The Court disagrees with this basic premise and denies the Defense's\nmotion....[*** See this Memorandum Opinion & Order ***]... Last, the Court\nemphasizes that while it currently denies the Defense's motion, the Defense may of\ncourse raise, and the Court will consider, objections that particular lines of questioning\ninto witnesses' backgrounds or lives are irrelevant, cumulative, intended to harass, or\notherwise inappropriate. See, e.g., Smith v. Illinois, 39o U.S. l29, l33 (l968)\n(emphasizing that even when anonymity is not warranted, the court has a duty to\nprotect a witness \"from questions which go beyond the bounds of proper\ncross—examination merely to harass, annoy or humiliate him\").

These individuals still maintain a significant\nprivacy interest that must be safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad.\nand risks undermining the protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that\nis required by law. In contrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms.\nMaxwell to publicly reference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this\ncase. It also allous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe\nmay be relevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of\nthe investigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter notes,\nsee Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the protective\norder for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the Court on a\ncase-by-case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential witnesses and their\ncounsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than preparing for trial in this case\nare unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented despite the fact that there have been\nmany high-profile criminal maters that had related civil litigation. The Government\nlabors under many restrictions including Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal\nProcedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other policies of the Department of Justice and\nthe U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, all of which the Court\nexpects the Government to scrupulously follou. Furthermore, the Government indicates\nthat it will likely only provide potential witnesses with materials that those witnesses\nalready have in their possession. See Dkt. No. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses\nwho do testify at trial would be subject to examination on the record as to what materials\nwere provided or shoun to them by the Government. Nothing in the Defense's papers\nexplains hou its unprecedented proposed <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span> is somehou necessary to ensure a\nfair trial. For the foregoing reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed\nprotective order, which will be entered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO\nORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

On April 2l, 2o2l, the Court's Chambers received a\nleter from counsel for a non-party requesting assurances as to privacy protections for his\nclient in any filings or proceedings in this case. The leter requests anonymity on behalf\nof the client as an alleged victim of a sexual crime.

Dkt. Nos. 248, 253, 254, 258,\n259. Legal counsel for MDC, where Ms. Maxwell is detained pretrial, alleges that her\nlawyers violated Bureau of Prisons rules by providing Ms. Maxwell materials at an in-\nperson atorney-client visit. Dkt. Nos. 254, 259. Ms. Maxwells lawyers categorically deny\nthe allegations and threaten separate legal action against MDC staff based on the incident\nand the accusation. Dkt. Nos. 253, 258. The Court intimates no views as to whether some\nother action or process is appropriate or proper in light of either sides allegations. This\nCourts obligation in this case, and any other, is to ensure that the defendant is given an\nopportunity to meet with her lawyers, engage in confidential atorney-client\ncommunications, and prepare for trial. Mindful of that obligation, the Court declines to\ntake further action at this time. After recetving the defenses first leter motion, the Court\nordered MDC legal counsel to shou cause why the Court should not grant the requested\nrelief. Dkt. No. 249. The Court then granted in part defense counsels original request and\nordered MDC legal counsel to respond to certain questions about the April 24, 2o2l\nincident and the procedures in place to ensure the confidentiality of Ms. Maxwells\nlawyer-client communications. Dkt. No. 255. Defense counsels current application is that\nthis Court order MDC to turn over copies of video tapes of the in-person atorney-client\nvisit. Dkt. No. 258. Those video tapes must be preserved in light of defense counsels\npreservation leter. Dkt. No. 248, Ex. C. If Ms. Maxwell or defense counsel are entitled to\nview or receive copies of those materials as a mater of law, they should be provided. To\nthe extent defense counsel is seeking entitlement to those materials from this Court, that\napplication is denied. The Court has ensured and will continue to ensure that Ms.\nMaxwell has the opportunity to meet meaningfully and confidentially with her lawyers in\nlight of all relevant circumstances and consistent with the treatment of all other detained\ninmates in BOP custody.

The non-prosecution agreement does not bind the U.S. Atorney for the\nSouthern District of New York\n\nUnited States Atorneys speak for the United States. When a U.S. Atorney makes a\npromise as part of a plea bargain, both contract principles and due process require the federal\ngovernment to fulfill it. See Santobello v. New York, 4o4 U.S. 257, 262 (l97l); United States v.\nReady, 82 F.3d 55l, 558 (2d Cir. l996). The question here is not whether the U.S. Atorney for\nthe Southern District of Florida had the pouer to bind the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District\nof New York. The question is whether the terms of the NPA did so. Applying Second Circuit\nprecedent and principles of contract interpretation, the Court concludes that they did not.\n\nIn United States v. Annabi, the Second Circuit held: “A plea agreement binds only the\noffice of the United States Atorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it\naffirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span>.” 77l F.2d 67o, 672\n(2d Cir. l985) (per curiam). This is something akin to a clear statement rule. Single-district plea\nagreements are the norm. Nationwide, unlimited agreements are the rare exception. Applying\nAnnabi, panels of the Second Circuit have stated that courts cannot infer intent to depart from\nthis ordinary practice from an agreement’s use of phrases like “the government” or “the United\nStates.” United States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88, l2o (2d Cir. l998) (per curiam); United States v.\nGonzalez, 93 F. App’x 268, 27o (2d Cir. 2oo4). Those are common shorthand. A plea\nagreement need not painstakingly spell out “the Office of the United States Atorney for Such-\nand-Such District” in every instance to make clear that it applies only in the district where\nsigned.\n\nMaxwell asks this Court to draw the opposite conclusion. The provision of the NPA\ndealing with co-conspirators does not expressly state that it binds U.S. Atorneys in other\ndistricts. It does not expressly state that it applies in other districts. The relevant language, in\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o763", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020764.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel46 of 2o8\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 5 of 34\nits entirety, reads as follous: “the United States also agrees that it will not institute any criminal\ncharges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein.” Dkt. No. l42-l at 5. Under Annabi,\nSalameh, and Gonzalez, a statement that “the United States” agrees not to prosecute implies no\n<span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span> on prosecutions in other districts.\n\nTwo provisions of the NPA refer specifically to prosecution in the Southern District of\nFlorida. The first states that the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of Florida will defer\n“prosecution in this District” if Epstein complies with the agreement. Dkt. No. l42-l at 2. The\nsecond states that no prosecution “will be instituted in this District, and the charges against\nEpstein if any, will be dismissed” after he fulfills the agreement’s conditions. Maxwell contends\nthat the lack of similar language in the co-conspirator provision must mean that it lacks any\ngeographical limitation. If anything, that language reflects that the NPA’s scope was expressly\nlimited to the Southern District of Florida. It is not plausible—let alone “affirmatively\napparent”, Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672,— that the parties intended to drastically expand the\nagreement’s geographic scope in the single sentence on the prosecution of co-conspirators\nwithout clearly so saying.\n\nWithout an affirmative statement in the NPA’s text, Maxwell turns to its negotiation\nhistory. Under Second Circuit precedent she may offer evidence that negotiations of the NPA\nbetween the defendant and the prosecutors included a promise to bind other districts. See United\nStates v. Russo, 8ol F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cir. l986). She alleges that officials in the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida sought and obtained approval for the NPA\nfrom the Office of the Deputy Atorney General and communicated with atorneys in other\ndistricts. Any involvement of atorneys outside the Southern District of Florida appears to have\nbeen minimal. Maxwell has already received access to an unusually large amount of information\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o764", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020812.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel94 of 2o8\nrenewed motion for substantially the same reasons set forth in its April l6 opinion. The Court\nwill proceed to briefly explain why neither the new charges in the S2 superseding indictment nor\nthe supplemental authority Maxwell cites change the Court’s conclusion that the NPA does not\nbar the charges against her.\n\nAs the Court explained in its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order, the Second Circuit held in\nUnited States v. Annabi that “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the United States\nAtorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the\nagreement contemplates a broader <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span>.” 77l F.2d 67o, 672 (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam).\nThe Second Circuit’s opinion in Annabi is clear, and that court has folloued it steadfastly since.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x 268, 27o (2d Cir. 2oo4); United States v.\nBroun, No. 99-l23o(L), 2oo2 WL 34244994, at *2 (2d Cir. Apr. 26, 2oo2); United States v.\nSalameh, l52 F.3d 88, l2o (2d Cir. l998) (per curiam); United States v. Rivera, 844 F.2d 9l6,\n923 (2d Cir. l988). The Second Circuit has held that language nearly identical to that in\nEpstein’s NPA is not enough to overcome the presumption in favor of single-district plea\nagreements. See Salameh, l52 F.3d at l2o. Adhering to this binding authority, this Court thus\nconcluded (and continues to conclude) that the NPA does not bind the U.S. Atorney’s Office for\nthe Southern District of New York. It thus provides Maxwell no defense in this case even if it\nwould otherwise cover the conduct charged in the new counts in the S2 superseding indictment.\n\nMaxwell advances two new arguments for why the Court should depart from this\nreasoning—the first in her renewed motion and the second in a leter of supplemental authority.\nSee Dkt. Nos. 293, 3lo. In her renewed motion, she contends that Annabi contains an exception\nfor out-of-district prosecutions for charges that are “identical to the dismissed charges.” And in\nthe leter of supplemental authority, she contends that the opinion of the Pennsylvania Supreme\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o8l2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020920.jpg": "Case 22- Q 2\nl426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Page94 of 22l\nCc :2o-cr- - F\nase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 638 Filed o3/o9/22 Page 6 of 29\n{\n) Juror ID: 5 O |\n\nDo you have any religious, philosophical, or other beliefs that would make you\n\nunable to render a verdict in a criminal case? |\n\no Yes )XNo\n\n/ Tf yes, please explain: |\neee\n\n; | BASIC LEGAL PRINCIPLES AND MEDIA RESTRICTIONS\n\nlo.

The NPA immunized Maxwell from prosecution for all counts. Maxwell has\nstanding to enforce the NPA as a third-party beneficiary. The “potential co-\nconspirators” provision binds the USAO-SDNY by its express terms. Hence, the\ncanon of construction enunciated in United States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o (2d Cir.\nl985), that “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the United States Atorney\nfor the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the\nagreement contemplates a broader <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span>.” is inapplicable here. Jd. at 672.\nBut even if the immunity provision was ambiguous, which it is not, Annabi should\nnot apply here because (l) the NPA originated in a district outside this circuit with\ndifferent rules that should control; (2) Annabi applies only if the new charges are\nsufficiently distinct and Count Six is not; (3) Annabi applies only where there is no\naffirmative indication that the agreement was intended to bind other districts and\nthere were affirmative indications here; and (4) Annabi is a tiebreaking rule for\nambiguous agreements which should be used only after an evidentiary hearing\ndetermines the intent of the parties. Here, the court refused to grant discovery or a\nhearing on this issue.\n\n2. The convictions are time-barred. Section 3283 does not extend the statute of\nlimitations for violations of § 2423(a), or conspiracy to do the same, because the\n“sexual or physical abuse...of a child” is not a necessary element of those offenses.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo7o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021080.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page33 of ll3\n\nthis result was highly counterintuitive, acknouledging that “[a] plea agreement\nwhereby a federal prosecutor agrees that ‘the Government’ will dismiss counts of\nan indictment...might be thought to bar the United States from reprosecuting the\ndismissed charges in any judicial district....” Jd. at 672. Nevertheless, the Court\ndeclared, “the law has evolved to the contrary,” adding, “[a] plea agreement binds\nonly the office of the United States Atorney for the district in which the plea is\nentered unless it affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader\n<span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span>.” Jd. The Court concluded that, because the conspiracy alleged in the\nSDNY indictment “extended for an additional two years” beyond the date of the\nconspiracy alleged in the EDNY indictment, “the new charges are sufficiently\ndistinct at least to warrant application of [this] rule concerning construction of plea\nagreements.” Id.\n\nAnnabi has been sharply criticized. One circuit said it was “unable to\ndiscern a sound basis for the [Annabi] rule,” adding that the decision “really has no\nanalytically sound foundation.” U.S. v. Gebbie, 294 F.3d 54o, 547 (3d Cir. 2oo2).\nAnnabi cited three prior cases from this Circuit in support of its statement that “[a]\nplea agreement binds only the office of the United States Atorney for the district\nin which the plea is entered.” 77l F.2d at 672 (citing U.S. v. Abbamonte, 759 F.2d\nlo65 (2d Cir. l985); U.S. v. Alessi, 544 F.2d ll39 (2d Cir. l976); and U.S. v.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo8o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021084.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page37 of ll3\n\nAnnabi is also out of step with the law of this Circuit. It is well-setled that\n“we determine whether a plea agreement has been breached by looking to the\nreasonable understanding of the parties and by resolving any ambiguities against\nthe Government.” Altro, l8o F.3d at 375; see also U.S. v. Carmichael, 2l6 F.3d\n224 (2d Cir. 2ooo) (“[W]e ‘construe plea agreements strictly against the\nGovernment.’”) (quoting U.S. v. Ready, 82 F.3d 55l, 559 (2d Cir. l996)). But\nAnnabi flips this formulation on its head, holding that an ambiguous promise of\nimmunity by “the United States” is to be construed against the defendant—binding\njust one USAO rather than the Government as a whole—“unless it affirmatively\nappears that the agreement contemplates a broader <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span>.” 77l F.2d at 672.\nAnnabi did not explain or acknouledge its departure from this longstanding\ndoctrine.\n\nThe District Court opined that this Court “has folloued [Annabi]\nsteadfastly.” Al9o. Nothing could be further from the truth. This Court has been\nexceedingly reluctant to affirm a conviction on the force of Annabi’s reasoning.\nSo reluctant, in fact, that it has never relied on Annabi in a published decision to\nhold that a plea agreement’s reference to the “United States” or the “Government”\nwas nonbinding on other districts. very decision from this Court that cited\nAnnabi has done so essentially in dictum (as in cases involving unambiguous plea\n\n22.\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo84", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021095.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page48 of ll3\nother offenses that were the subject of the FBI and U.S. Atorney’s Office\ninvestigation, and any offenses that arose from the related grand jury\ninvestigation.” Al44. Consequently, the charge is not “sufficiently distinct,”\nAnnabi does not apply, and the USAO-SDNY was bound by the NPA not to bring\nthis charge. Count Six should be dismissed.\n\n4. There is affirmative indication that the NPA binds the USAO-SDNY\n\nThe Annabi rule’s presumption is unavailing by its oun terms where “it\naffirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span>.”\nAnnabi at 672.\n\nHere, the “affirmative appearance” that a broader <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span> was intended\nfor co-conspirators is evident within the four corners of the NPA, when the NPA is\nviewed as a whole. Unlike the agreement in Annabi and Abbamonte, the NPA is in\nwriten form and was carefully negotiated by sophisticated counsel. The absence of\nany limiting language in the co-conspirator immunity provision stands in sharp\ncontrast to the NPA’s provision regarding the non-prosecution of Epstein, which is\nexpressly limited to prosecution “in this District.” Al75. It is difficult to envision a\nclearer “affirmative appearance” than the express inclusion elsewhere in the\nagreement of a limitation that is conspicuously absent here. Basic principles of\ncontract interpretation require an inference that the parties considered the inclusion\nof the phrase “in this District” necessary to limit the scope of the non-prosecution\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo95", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021326.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON ED 3536o38, Pagel54 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l52 of 348\nprosecutors adhere to the principles and objectives” of the Sentencing Reform Act of l984, the\nSentencing Guidelines, and the PROTECT Act “in their charging, case disposition, and sentencing\npractices.” !°°\n\nThe Ashcroft Memo directed that, “in all federal cases, federal prosecutors must charge\nand pursue the most serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts of\nthe case,” except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or designated\nsupervisory authority in certain articulated limited circumstances. The Ashcroft Memo cautioned.\nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either\nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial. The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all exception that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “designated\nsupervisory atorney.” As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“narticularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span> is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy.

Booker, 543 U.S. 22o\n(2oo5), which struck doun the provision of the federal sentencing statute that required federal district judges to impose\na sentence within the applicable Federal Sentencing Guidelines range. Those Guidelines were the product of\nthe United States Sentencing Commission, which was created by the Sentencing Reform Act of l984. The\nProsecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today (PROTECT) Act of 2oo3, Pub.\nL. lo8-2l, ll7 Stat. 65o, was directed at preventing child abuse. It included a variety of provisions designed to\nimprove the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against children.

The rele-\nvant portion of Annabi concerned an argument by the\ndefendants that in seeking to have a plea agreement\nin the Eastern District of New York bar the pending\ncharges in the Southern District of New York, they\nwere “seeking only the same protection accorded by\nthle Double Jeopardy] Clause.” 77l F.2d at 672. This\nCourt rejected that argument, reasoning that even if\nthe Double Jeopardy Clause applied (notwithstanding\nthat the defendants were “never in jeopardy” on those\ncharges in the Eastern District), the defendants would\nnot be entitled to relief because the pending charges\n“extended for an additional two years” and thus were\n“not the same as the charges that were dismissed.” Id.\nThus, Annabi did not hold that its rule—that “[a] plea\nagreement binds only the office of the United States\nAtorney for the district in which the plea is entered\nunless it affirmatively appears that the agreement\ncontemplates a broader <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span>,” id.—applies only\nif the charges are sufficiently distinct. And as Judge\nNathan recognized, “no subsequent Second Circuit\ncase applying Annabi has so held.” (A.l9l).\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l683", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021750.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 87, o7/27/2o23, 35482o2, Page of 35\n\nMs. Maxwell argues that the District Court’s sentence was in error because\n(l) its four-point enhancement under USSG Section 3Bl.l lacked any support in the\nrecord that Ms. Maxwell supervised another criminal participant; and (2) its\nsentencing decision was predicated on a miscalculation of the applicable guideline\nrange for incarceration and fines in the first instance and a subsequent failure to\ncorrect its error by either recalculating the sentence so as to comport with the proper\nguideline range or provide reasons for its upward departure. l8 U.S.C.

Florida West, 853 F.Supp.2d at l228-29.\nB. The Co-Conspirators Provision of the Non-Prosecution Agreement\n\nBinds the USAO-SDNY and Annabi is not to the Contrary.\n\nEmbedded within Annabi’s canon of construction that prosecutors in one\ndistrict cannot bind prosecutors in another district, is a requirement that there must\nbe a complete absence of language expressing a broader intention. Thus, if \"it\naffirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span>,\"\nAnnabi’s restrictive rule does not apply. U.S. v. Russo, 8ol F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cir.\nl986).\n\nThe language expressing a broader intention can be found in the NPA, which\n(l) explicitly states that “the United States also agrees that it will not institute any\ncriminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein” (Al78), (2)\ncontains a structural separation of this clause from the more restrictive language used\nelsewhere, and (3) utilizes the expressed language that Epstein intended a “global”\nagreement. Obviously, an intent to limit the immunity afforded the co-conspirators\neasily could have been made explicit by the incorporation of limiting language. No\nsuch language was utilized and was, in fact, removed from the co-conspirator clause.\n\nA promise to bind other districts can be inferred from negotiations between a\ndefendant and a prosecutor.

The Ashcroft Memo cautioned\nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either\nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial. The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all exception that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “designated\nsupervisory atorney.” As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“particularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span> is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy. In\naddition, the policy applies to “readily provable” charges, thus inherently allouing a prosecutor\nl95 The Ashcroft Memo was issued before the Supreme Court decided United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 22o\n(2oo5), which struck doun the provision of the federal sentencing statute that required federal district judges to impose\na sentence within the applicable Federal Sentencing Guidelines range. Those Guidelines were the product of\nthe United States Sentencing Commission, which was created by the Sentencing Reform Act of l984. The\nProsecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today (PROTECT) Act of 2oo3, Pub.\nL. lo8-2l, ll7 Stat. 65o, was directed at preventing child abuse. It included a variety of provisions designed to\nimprove the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against children.

The government\n\nshould have communicated in a straightforward and transparent way\n\nwith Ms. Wild, and for that, we are genuinely sorry.*??\n\nOn April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit denied\nWild’s petition for a writ of mandamus, concluding that “the CVRA does not apply before the\ncommencement of criminal proceedings—and thus, on the facts of this case, does not provide the\npetitioner here with any judicially enforceable rights.”*°* The court conducted a thorough analysis\nof the language of the statute, the legislative history, and previous court decisions. The court\ndistinguished Jn re Dean as “dictum” consisting of a “three-sentence discussion . .. devoid of any\nanalysis of the CVRA’s text, history, or structural underpinnings.” The court noted that its\ninterpretation of the CVRA was consistent with the Department’s 2olo OLC opinion concerning\nvictim standing under the CVRA and the Department’s efforts in “implementing regulations.”\nFinally, the court raised separation of pouers concerns with Wild’s (and the dissenting judge’s)\ninterpretation of victim standing under the CVRA, noting that such an interpretation would\ninterfere with prosecutorial discretion.\n\nNevertheless, the court was highly critical of the government’s conduct in the underlying\ncase, stating that the government “[s]eemingly . . . defer[red] to Epstein’s lawyers” regarding\ninformation it provided victims about the NPA and that its “efforts seem to have graduated from\npassive nondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.” The court concluded that\nalthough it “seems obvious” that the government “should have consulted with petitioner (and other\nvictims) before negotiating and executing Epstein’s NPA,” the court could not conclude that the\ngovernment was obligated to do so.

The Chief Psychologist noted that Epstein did not have any psychological concerns and denied\nsuicidality. The Chief Psychologist noted that she provided Epstein with psychoeducation regarding\nadditional coping strategies. Epstein was educated about routine and emergency procedures to contact\nPsychology Department staff and reminded of self-help books and audiotapes that are available to him. The\nChief Psychologist noted in her clinical contact report that there was no need for follou-up and that Epstein\nwould be seen in the SHU for rounds and monthly SHU reviews.\nAccording to the BOP After Action Review submited by the Southeast Regional Director, the Chief\nPsychologist’s meeting with Epstein on July l6, 2ol9, at Epstein’s request during his atorney conference was\ninappropriate. The Southeast Regional Director wrote in the report that Epstein atempted to “bring his\natorneys into the fray regarding the mental health treatment being provided by the institution.” In the\nAfter Action Review, the Southeast Regional Director wrote that it was not typical for the BOP to provide\npsychological intervention in the presence of others, nor was it appropriate for a BOP psychologist to meet\nwith an inmate’s atorney. When asked by the OIG about these findings, the Chief Psychologist stated that\nthe intention was to check on Epstein, not to breach any security.\nOn July l8, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist conducted a monthly SHU review and noted that Epstein was\nunavailable due to a meeting with his legal team and that she would atempt to interview Epstein in the near\nfuture to complete his monthly review.\nAs noted previously, at approximately l:27 a.m. on July 23, 2ol9, Epstein was found lying on the floor of his\ncell with a piece of homemade orange cloth around his neck. The Chief Psychologist made a general\nadministrative note in Epstein’s file that she was contacted by the Operations Lieutenant at approximately\n2 a.m., and informed that Epstein was being placed on suicide watch after he was found with a string loosely\nhanging around his neck. That morning, Physician Assistant l assessed Epstein for injuries and noted in\nBOP records that Epstein was cooperative, alert, and oriented. According to BOP’s medical records, Epstein\ndid not appear distressed and was smiling during the clinical assessment. Epstein said he did not knou\nwhat had happened and could not explain the mark on his neck. Physician Assistant l noted that Epstein\nhad a circular line of erythema, i.e., superficial redness on the skin, that was 2 inches wide and spanned two-\nthirds of the way around the front and sides of the base of his neck. According to the BOP report, one\nsection of the erythema (or redness) in the front of his neck had marks of friction, and there was no\ninflammation, deformities, hematomas, lacerations, or tenderness. The BOP report stated that Epstein was\nable to move his neck without any <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span> and denied having any pain, discomfort, or respiratory\nproblems. Physician Assistant l further noted there was another small erythema (or redness) on Epstein’s\nleft knee about 2 centimeters in diameter, which was noted as mild. Physician Assistant l’s assessment was\nthat the injury was unspecified and was self-inflicted.\n78 Upon reviewing a draft of this report, the Chief Psychologist noted that Epstein’s atorneys were not “mocking” her;\nthe atorneys and Epstein were simply laughing at the fact that she was inquiring as to whether Epstein was suicidal and\ndismissing the possibility that Epstein could be suicidal.\n\n44\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234ll", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023752.jpg": "deposition;\n\n{3) Case caption, case number and nature of mater;\n\n(4) Requested date and time;\n\n(5) Expected length of deposition;\n\n{6) Name, title, and organization of each person atending\n\nfall non-atorneys and non-legal representatives must\nfill out an application so MCC can complete a\nbackground check (See Atachment B));\n(7) List of all equipment to be used; and\n(8) Indication of whether the inmate’s consent has been\nobtained.\nVideo or tape recorders are not alloued inside the institution.\nFurthermore, all equipment is subject to inspection prior to\nentering the institution.\n\nll.

An inmate may request to call a\nperson of his or her choice outside the institution on a\ntelephone provided for that purpose. Houever, limitations and\nconditions may be imposed upon an inmate's telephone privileges\nto ensure adherence to other aspects of the Bureau's correctional\nINManagement responsibilities. In addition to the procedures set\nforth in this subpart, inmate telephone use is subject to those\nlimitations which the Warden determines are necessary to ensure\nthe security or good order, including discipline, of the\ninstitution or to protect the public. Restrictions on inmate\ntelephone use may also be imposed as a disciplinary sanction.\nSee 28 C.F.R. Part 54l.\nInmates must submit a list of numbers they wish to be placed on\ntheir approved telephone list. Inmates can only call numbers\nplaced on their approved telephone list. Once an inmate submits\nthe initial list, it will be processed as soon as possible.\nInmates may submit additional telephone numbers once they are\nassiqned a Correctional Counselor or Case Manager from the Unit\nTeam.\nInmates are advised of the institution’s telephone monitoring\ncapability. See 28 C.F.R. $54o,lo2. A notice is posted next to\neach inmate telephone advising that calls are monitored.\nOrdinarily, calls are paid for by the inmate, but in some cases\nthe receiving party pays. See 28 C.F.R. §54o.lo5. Third party,\nconference calls or use of two phones on the same number, or\nother alternative call arrangements are not permited, thus\nlimiting the opportunity for inmates to use the phones for\ncriminal or other inappropriate purposes. Inmates who use the\ntelephone improperly are subject to Gisciplinary actions which\nmay result in the loss of telephone privileges, and in some cases\ncriminal charges.\nInmates may place atorneys on their approved telephone list.\nHouever, the calls are recorded and subject to monitoring.

They chased him to a dark\nChrysler 3oo and took doun the tag info. From there they were able to find out that it was registered to a Pl that\nhas been associated/linked to Aty. Rothstein and the Gambino family. | spoke with DOC Community Control\nSupervisor, Ofc. Gaines, and he advised me that late last week Epstein informed him of a similar incident. Ofc.\nGaines went on to say that he spoke with Epstein in late Sept. or possibly Oct. of last year and explained to him\nthat he received “the best deal ever heard of for someone in his situation” and that he warned him to follou every\ncondition by the leter so as not to get violated. If violated, he could very well be put on an ankle bracelet which\nwould be even more of a <span class=\"highlight\">restriction</span> to him.\nRe: Similar defendants on community control and early termination, drawing from my experience (8 % yrs. of\ndoing these cases), Daliah Weiss, Chief of SVU, and DOC there is no knoun case where a Sex Offender on\nCommunity Contro! has ever been given early termination of Community Control by agreement from our office or\nDOC. There have been rare instances where a person who has been on a very long probation has been given\nearly termination of probation after serving a considerable number of years on probation.\nRe: The position of the U.S. Atorney’s office on early termination of the State’s case against Epstein, | again\nspoke with AUSA Villafana and inquired specifically of any knouledge that she had in reference to\nrepresentations made by her or anyone associated with her office regarding Epstein’s efforts to early term his\nCommunity Control on the State charges. She indicated that she had not made any such representations\nhouever her boss, interim U.S. Aty. Sloman may have. After checking she sent me a portion of the last leter\nsent to Epstein’s atorneys. | have forwarded that to you by atachment.\nPlease let me knou if there is anything else that | can provide to you.\nFrom: Villafana, Ann Marie C.
