We\nwere all quite proud when she graduated from Oxford with her Bachelor's degree. She,\nlearned early on the value of hard work\nAround l99o, Ghislaine came to live in New York to continue\nMaxwell Corporate Gifts, a successful company she had founded in the UK which was\nee in l99l, Ghislaine had to rely on her personal\ncompass, inner resilience and sheer determination to build a fresh life for herself. Her prior\n‘big picture’ experience, top-level entertaining skills and talent for organizing, coupled with\nher multi-cultural and multi-lingual sophistication, opened doors into New York society.\nAlthough it is true that for many years Ghislaine was frequently involved in high society and\natended fashionable social gatherings; what irks me greatly is the press’s one dimensional\n‘socialite’ focus on Ghislaine, that completely denies and refuses to acknouledge the very\nserious, highly intellectual and passionate caring sides of Ghislaine. For example, since 2oo3,\nGhislaine devoted all her energy, her oun financial resources and intellectual skills to helping\nsave the Oceans, through her <span class=\"highlight\">establishment</span> of the not-for-profit company, The Terramar\nProject. Ghislaine's deep knouledge and appreciation of the significant role the oceans play\nin our world’s fragile ecosystem enabled her to work with key partners to influence the\nUnited Nations in 2ol4 in enunciating its Sustainable Development Goal l5 \"To conserve\nand sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development.\"\nIndeed, it seemed so clear to me that this mission encompassed her life's passion and offered\na way for her proactively to give something back of real value to society.\nGhislaine shoued a huge amount of courage and forbearance in the face of great adversity\nand in the years that folloued. I have seen this strength more than ever\nduring the times\nDespite the tremendous daily pressures she has been under, notably from the world’s media,\nuniversally hostile to her, she has shoun simultaneously a deal of humility and fortitude. She\nhas the profoundly deep conviction (through every fibre of her being) of her innocence in the\nface of all the unsupported accusations and criminal charges laterly filed against her.\nTo the best of my knouledge and belief, [| Ghislaine has never been brought in for\nquestioning, arrested, or charged with any criminal offense by law enforcement until nou.\nNotwithstanding the seriousness of the offenses with which she has been charged, as a US\nCitizen, she has the constitutional right to the presumption of innocence and a fair trial. For\nthe purpose of increasing their profits by boosting TV ratings and / or newspaper readership,\nthe world’s media has aired or printed the most heinous accusations against her, in some\ncases for years nou, that have never been cross-examined in a criminal court in front of an\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2o29\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005872.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page5of 43\n\n96o N.

Feldman Announces\nProposed <span class=\"highlight\">Establishment</span> of the Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program\nJordana (“Jordy”) H. Feldman, Kenneth R. Feinberg and Camille S. Biros today announced that the Co-Executors\nof the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (“Estate”) have filed documents in the Superior Court of the U.S. Virgin Islands,\nseeking expedited approval from the Court for the <span class=\"highlight\">establishment</span> of a voluntary claims resolution program that will\nallou eligible individuals the opportunity to resolve their sexual abuse claims against Mr. Epstein and his Estate\nthrough a confidential, non-adversarial alternative to litigation.\nMs. Feldman, Mr. Feinberg and Ms. Biros — distinguished, independent claims administration experts with\nextensive experience in fashioning similar claims programs — will lead the design of the program, including\ndeveloping criteria and requirements for the evaluation and determination of eligibility and compensation, and the\naccompanying claims process. Ms. Feldman, Mr. Feinberg and Ms. Biros will draft the program protocol and will\nafford interested parties, including potential claimants and/or their legal representatives, an opportunity to provide\ninput on the protocol prior to its finalization. They expect that, once approved by the Court, the program will start\naccepting claims in approximately 9o days.\n“This important program will offer victims the opportunity to obtain long-overdue compensation, to be heard and\ntreated with the compassion, dignity and respect they deserve, and to achieve some measure of justice and\nvalidation that has eluded them for so many years. The claims resolution process will be fair, prompt, and non-\nadversarial, and will provide victims with a meaningful alternative to years of protracted civil litigation and its\nassociated costs, risks and uncertainties,” said Ms. Feldman.\nMs. Biros added that “participation in the program will be entirely voluntary and will not affect any rights the\nclaimant may have unless and until she accepts the compensation determination and signs a litigation release. All\nclaimants will be afforded an opportunity to meet confidentially with the Administrator, if they so desire, in order\nto provide any information that may bear upon the evaluation of their claims.”\nMs. Feldman, who recently served as Deputy Special Master of the September llth Victim Compensation Fund,\nthe litigation-alternative program administered by the U.S. Department of Justice that compensates victims who\nhave become sick or died as a result of their September l lth-related exposure, will also administer the new program.\nMs. Feldman will, in the role of Administrator, have complete autonomy and decision-making authority over\nprogram operations and claim determinations, and the Estate will have no authority to modify or reject\nMs. Feldman’s decisions on any basis or as to any claim. Mr. Feinberg, the nation’s leading expert in fashioning\neffective dispute resolution alternatives, and his colleague, Ms. Biros, will partner with Ms. Feldman in the\ndevelopment and implementation of the program, lending their extensive expertise to that process.\nMr. Feinberg added, “We are pleased to have been asked to implement this important program, and are eager to\nbegin designing it so that claimants will have a forum where their suffering is acknouledged and their claims are\npromptly and appropriately compensated.” Regarding Ms. Feldman he said, “Jordy brings not only a wealth of\nexperience from her long-time work with the 9/ll community, but also a profound sense of empathy for victims\nand a deep commitment to ensuring fairness in process and outcome.”\nOnce approved, the program will operate and maintain a website that provides general information about the\nprogram, including the Protocol, Frequently Asked Questions, information about claims filing deadlines and a\nregistration process for new complaints. Contact information for the program will also be available on the website.\nFor media inquiries about the program, contact ClaimantServices@EpsteinVCP.com or 877-3l2-3o55.\nDOJ-OGR-oooll474\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011505.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-7 Filed o7/l5/22 Pagel QeHIBIT G\nIN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF THE VIRGIN ISLANDS\nDIVISION OF ST.
