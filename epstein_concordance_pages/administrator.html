Over\nthe course of several telephone conversations concerning the renovations, Cosby and\nConstand developed a personal relationship.\n\nSoon after this relationship began, Cosby invited Constand to his Cheltenham\nresidence. When Constand arrived, Cosby greeted her, escorted her to a room, and left\nher alone to eat dinner and drink wine. Cosby later returned, sat next to Constand on a\ncouch, and placed his hand on her thigh.

As we\nexplained in Commonwealth v.

As the Commonwealth’s representatives, prosecutors\nare duty-bound to pursue “equal and impartial justice,” Appeal of Nicely, l8 A. 737, 738\n(Pa. l889), and “to serve the public interest.” Clancy, l92 A.3d 52. Their obligation is\n“not merely to convict,” but rather to “seek justice within the bounds of the law.”\nCommonwealth v. Starks, 387 A.2d 829, 83l (Pa. l978).\n\nAs an “<span class=\"highlight\">administrator</span> of justice,” the prosecutor has the pouer to decide\n\nwhether to initiate formal criminal proceedings, to select those criminal\n\ncharges which will be filed against the accused, to negotiate plea bargains,\n\nto withdraw charges where appropriate, and, ultimately, to prosecute or\n\ndismiss charges at trial. See, e.g., l6 P.S. § l4o2(a) (“The district atorney\n\nshall sign all bills of indictment and conduct in court all criminal and other\n\nprosecutions ... .”); Pa.R.Crim.P. 5o7 (establishing the prosecutor’s pouer\n\nto require that police officers seek approval from the district atorney prior\n\nto filing criminal complaints); Pa.R.Crim.P. 585 (pouer to move for nolle\n\nprosequi); see also ABA Standards §§ 3-4.2, 3-4.4.

PURPOSE AND OVERVIEW\nThe Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program (the “Program”) is a voluntary, independent Program that\nhas been established to compensate and resolve the claims of victims-survivors of sexual abuse by\nJeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”).\nThe Estate of Jeffrey Epstein (the “Estate”) has retained the services of nationally recognized claims\nadministration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana H. Feldman to design the\nProgram. Ms. Feldman will also serve as the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> of the Program (the “<span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span>”). This\nProtocol reflects input from victims-survivors, their lawyers, other potentially interested parties, and\nrepresentatives of the Estate.\nThrough the Program, the Estate wishes to acknouledge the wrongs endured by victims-survivors and\noffer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for such sexual abuse.\nThe Program is governed by the follouing non-exclusive guiding principles:\ne The Program is purely voluntary. It does not affect any rights a Claimant may have\nunless and until the Claimant accepts the offered compensation and executes a\nRelease. A Claimant may reject the offer of compensation and may stop\nparticipating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time prior to execution\nof the Release.\ne The Program is independent and will in no way be administered, controlled or\noverseen by the Estate. The <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> is responsible for all decisions relating to\nthe review, processing and evaluation of individual claims submited to the\nProgram.

Ms. Feldman will also serve as the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> of the Program (the “<span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span>”). This\nProtocol reflects input from victims-survivors, their lawyers, other potentially interested parties, and\nrepresentatives of the Estate.\nThrough the Program, the Estate wishes to acknouledge the wrongs endured by victims-survivors and\noffer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for such sexual abuse.\nThe Program is governed by the follouing non-exclusive guiding principles:\ne The Program is purely voluntary. It does not affect any rights a Claimant may have\nunless and until the Claimant accepts the offered compensation and executes a\nRelease. A Claimant may reject the offer of compensation and may stop\nparticipating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time prior to execution\nof the Release.\ne The Program is independent and will in no way be administered, controlled or\noverseen by the Estate. The <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> is responsible for all decisions relating to\nthe review, processing and evaluation of individual claims submited to the\nProgram. The <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> will have final, binding and exclusive authority to\ndetermine Claimant eligibility and the valuation of each eligible individual claim.\nDecisions of the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> made pursuant to this Protocol are not subject to\nreview or modification in any way by the Estate or any other party or entity.\ne There is no cap or limitation on the aggregate amount of funds available to\ncompensate all eligible Claimants or on the amount of compensation to be made to\neach individual Claimant. Each individual claim will be evaluated separately by the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span>.

PURPOSE AND OVERVIEW\nThe Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program (the “Program”) is a voluntary, independent Program that\nhas been established to compensate and resolve the claims of victims-survivors of sexual abuse by\nJeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”).\nThe Estate of Jeffrey Epstein (the “Estate”) has retained the services of nationally recognized claims\nadministration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana H. Feldman to design the\nProgram. Ms. Feldman will also serve as the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> of the Program (the “<span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span>”). This\nProtocol reflects input from victims-survivors, their lawyers, other potentially interested parties, and\nrepresentatives of the Estate.\nThrough the Program, the Estate wishes to acknouledge the wrongs endured by victims-survivors and\noffer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for such sexual abuse.\nThe Program is governed by the follouing non-exclusive guiding principles:\ne The Program is purely voluntary. It does not affect any rights a Claimant may have\nunless and until the Claimant accepts the offered compensation and executes a\nRelease. A Claimant may reject the offer of compensation and may stop\nparticipating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time prior to execution\nof the Release.\ne The Program is independent and will in no way be administered, controlled or\noverseen by the Estate. The <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> is responsible for all decisions relating to\nthe review, processing and evaluation of individual claims submited to the\nProgram. The <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> will have final, binding and exclusive authority to\ndetermine Claimant eligibility and the valuation of each eligible individual claim.\nDecisions of the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> made pursuant to this Protocol are not subject to\nreview or modification in any way by the Estate or any other party or entity.\ne There is no cap or limitation on the aggregate amount of funds available to\ncompensate all eligible Claimants or on the amount of compensation to be made to\neach individual Claimant. Each individual claim will be evaluated separately by the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span>. The <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> will determine, in her sole and exclusive\ndiscretion, issues of eligibility and the amount of compensation and the Estate will\npay all eligible claims based on the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span>’s determination.\nl|Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5l47", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005148.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 336-3 Filed o9/o7/2l Page l5 of 22\ne All Claimants will be treated with respect, dignity and fairness without regard to\n\nrace, color, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, gender or disability. To\n\nensure claims will be adjudicated fairly, the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> will manage the process\n\nso that all Claimants can equally access the Program’s claim process. Individuals\n\nwith disabilities will be given the opportunity to effectively communicate their\n\nclaims and to request special process accommodations.\nThe Program is available to all victims-survivors regardless of where they were harmed, when they were\nharmed, whether the claim is time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and whether they\nhave previously filed a lawsuit against or setled with Epstein and/or the Estate.\nThe exclusive claims period for filing a claim pursuant to this Protocol shall commence on the to-be-\ndetermined Effective Date and shall conclude nine (9) months after that date (“Filing Deadline”). All\nindividual claims filed with the Program must be filed within this period.\nTo complement the Program’s resources, the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> will, at her discretion and with the consent\nof the Claimant, consult with Professor Marci A. Hamilton, a nationally recognized sexual abuse expert,\nleading legal academic and advocate of victims’ rights. Ms. Hamilton’s role will be to further inform the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> and her staff about the dynamics of sexual abuse, common responses to sexual abuse,\nand the impact of sexual abuse on victims; to serve as a resource for the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> in developing or\nupdating policies and procedures; to advise the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> regarding sensitivities involved in\ninteractions with victims; and to serve as a referral source for the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> in providing post-\ndetermination information to claimants who seek guidance, counseling or other services. The\n<span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> may, at her discretion and with the Claimant’s prior writen consent, request that Ms.\nHamilton review an individual claimant file. The <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> will determine on a case-by-case basis, in\nher discretion, the need to anonymize individual claimants’ files before sharing them with Ms. Hamilton.\nAs set forth above, the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> is solely responsible for all decisions relating to the administration\nof the Program, including the review, processing, evaluation, and determination of individual claims\nsubmited to the Program.\nDuring the term of the Program, Ms. Hamilton will not meet or speak with a Claimant or her\nrepresentatives concerning any aspect of the Program without the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> present. Ms. Hamilton\nwill maintain in strict confidence and will not disclose outside the Program any information she obtains\nthrough her participation in the Program, including individual Claimants’ submissions.\n\n2|[ Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5l48", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005150.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 336-3 Filed o9/o7/2l Page l7 of 22\nagreement shouing legal representation signed by both the Claimant and the atorney or a signed\nstatement by an adult Claimant and the atorney that a licensed/admited atorney is acting on her\nbehalf.\n\nil.

PURPOSE AND OVERVIEW\nThe Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program (the “Program”) is a voluntary, independent Program that\nhas been established to compensate and resolve the claims of victims-survivors of sexual abuse by\nJeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”).\nThe Estate of Jeffrey Epstein (the “Estate”) has retained the services of nationally recognized claims\nadministration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana H. Feldman to design the\nProgram. Ms. Feldman will also serve as the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> of the Program (the “<span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span>”). This\nProtocol reflects input from victims-survivors, their lawyers, other potentially interested parties, and\nrepresentatives of the Estate.\nThrough the Program, the Estate wishes to acknouledge the wrongs endured by victims-survivors and\noffer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for such sexual abuse.\nThe Program is governed by the follouing non-exclusive guiding principles:\ne The Program is purely voluntary. It does not affect any rights a Claimant may have\nunless and until the Claimant accepts the offered compensation and executes a\nRelease. A Claimant may reject the offer of compensation and may stop\nparticipating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time prior to execution\nof the Release.\ne The Program is independent and will in no way be administered, controlled or\noverseen by the Estate. The <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> is responsible for all decisions relating to\nthe review, processing and evaluation of individual claims submited to the\nProgram. The <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> will have final, binding and exclusive authority to\ndetermine Claimant eligibility and the valuation of each eligible individual claim.\nDecisions of the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> made pursuant to this Protocol are not subject to\nreview or modification in any way by the Estate or any other party or entity.\ne There is no cap or limitation on the aggregate amount of funds available to\ncompensate all eligible Claimants or on the amount of compensation to be made to\neach individual Claimant. Each individual claim will be evaluated separately by the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span>. The <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> will determine, in her sole and exclusive\ndiscretion, issues of eligibility and the amount of compensation and the Estate will\npay all eligible claims based on the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span>’s determination.\nl|Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5l69", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005170.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 336-4 Filed o9/o7/2l Page l5 of 22\ne All Claimants will be treated with respect, dignity and fairness without regard to\n\nrace, color, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, gender or disability. To\n\nensure claims will be adjudicated fairly, the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> will manage the process\n\nso that all Claimants can equally access the Program’s claim process. Individuals\n\nwith disabilities will be given the opportunity to effectively communicate their\n\nclaims and to request special process accommodations.\nThe Program is available to all victims-survivors regardless of where they were harmed, when they were\nharmed, whether the claim is time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and whether they\nhave previously filed a lawsuit against or setled with Epstein and/or the Estate.\nThe exclusive claims period for filing a claim pursuant to this Protocol shall commence on the to-be-\ndetermined Effective Date and shall conclude nine (9) months after that date (“Filing Deadline”). All\nindividual claims filed with the Program must be filed within this period.\nTo complement the Program’s resources, the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> will, at her discretion and with the consent\nof the Claimant, consult with Professor Marci A. Hamilton, a nationally recognized sexual abuse expert,\nleading legal academic and advocate of victims’ rights. Ms. Hamilton’s role will be to further inform the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> and her staff about the dynamics of sexual abuse, common responses to sexual abuse,\nand the impact of sexual abuse on victims; to serve as a resource for the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> in developing or\nupdating policies and procedures; to advise the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> regarding sensitivities involved in\ninteractions with victims; and to serve as a referral source for the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> in providing post-\ndetermination information to claimants who seek guidance, counseling or other services. The\n<span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> may, at her discretion and with the Claimant’s prior writen consent, request that Ms.\nHamilton review an individual claimant file. The <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> will determine on a case-by-case basis, in\nher discretion, the need to anonymize individual claimants’ files before sharing them with Ms. Hamilton.\nAs set forth above, the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> is solely responsible for all decisions relating to the administration\nof the Program, including the review, processing, evaluation, and determination of individual claims\nsubmited to the Program.\nDuring the term of the Program, Ms. Hamilton will not meet or speak with a Claimant or her\nrepresentatives concerning any aspect of the Program without the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> present. Ms. Hamilton\nwill maintain in strict confidence and will not disclose outside the Program any information she obtains\nthrough her participation in the Program, including individual Claimants’ submissions.\n\n2|[ Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5l7o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005172.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 336-4 Filed o9/o7/2l Page l7 of 22\nagreement shouing legal representation signed by both the Claimant and the atorney or a signed\nstatement by an adult Claimant and the atorney that a licensed/admited atorney is acting on her\nbehalf.\n\nil.

PURPOSE AND OVERVIEW\nThe Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program (the “Program”) is a voluntary, independent Program that\nhas been established to compensate and resolve the claims of victims-survivors of sexual abuse by\nJeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”).\nThe Estate of Jeffrey Epstein (the “Estate”) has retained the services of nationally recognized claims\nadministration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana H. Feldman to design the\nProgram. Ms. Feldman will also serve as the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> of the Program (the “<span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span>”). This\nProtocol reflects input from victims-survivors, their lawyers, other potentially interested parties, and\nrepresentatives of the Estate.\nThrough the Program, the Estate wishes to acknouledge the wrongs endured by victims-survivors and\noffer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for such sexual abuse.\nThe Program is governed by the follouing non-exclusive guiding principles:\ne The Program is purely voluntary. It does not affect any rights a Claimant may have\nunless and until the Claimant accepts the offered compensation and executes a\nRelease. A Claimant may reject the offer of compensation and may stop\nparticipating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time prior to execution\nof the Release.\ne The Program is independent and will in no way be administered, controlled or\noverseen by the Estate. The <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> is responsible for all decisions relating to\nthe review, processing and evaluation of individual claims submited to the\nProgram. The <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> will have final, binding and exclusive authority to\ndetermine Claimant eligibility and the valuation of each eligible individual claim.\nDecisions of the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> made pursuant to this Protocol are not subject to\nreview or modification in any way by the Estate or any other party or entity.\ne There is no cap or limitation on the aggregate amount of funds available to\ncompensate all eligible Claimants or on the amount of compensation to be made to\neach individual Claimant. Each individual claim will be evaluated separately by the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span>. The <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> will determine, in her sole and exclusive\ndiscretion, issues of eligibility and the amount of compensation and the Estate will\npay all eligible claims based on the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span>’s determination.\nl|Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7374", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007375.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 48o-l Filed ll/2l/2l Page 9ofl6\ne All Claimants will be treated with respect, dignity and fairness without regard to\n\nrace, color, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, gender or disability. To\n\nensure claims will be adjudicated fairly, the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> will manage the process\n\nso that all Claimants can equally access the Program’s claim process. Individuals\n\nwith disabilities will be given the opportunity to effectively communicate their\n\nclaims and to request special process accommodations.\nThe Program is available to all victims-survivors regardless of where they were harmed, when they were\nharmed, whether the claim is time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and whether they\nhave previously filed a lawsuit against or setled with Epstein and/or the Estate.\nThe exclusive claims period for filing a claim pursuant to this Protocol shall commence on the to-be-\ndetermined Effective Date and shall conclude nine (9) months after that date (“Filing Deadline”). All\nindividual claims filed with the Program must be filed within this period.\nTo complement the Program’s resources, the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> will, at her discretion and with the consent\nof the Claimant, consult with Professor Marci A. Hamilton, a nationally recognized sexual abuse expert,\nleading legal academic and advocate of victims’ rights. Ms. Hamilton’s role will be to further inform the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> and her staff about the dynamics of sexual abuse, common responses to sexual abuse,\nand the impact of sexual abuse on victims; to serve as a resource for the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> in developing or\nupdating policies and procedures; to advise the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> regarding sensitivities involved in\ninteractions with victims; and to serve as a referral source for the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> in providing post-\ndetermination information to claimants who seek guidance, counseling or other services. The\n<span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> may, at her discretion and with the Claimant’s prior writen consent, request that Ms.\nHamilton review an individual claimant file. The <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> will determine on a case-by-case basis, in\nher discretion, the need to anonymize individual claimants’ files before sharing them with Ms. Hamilton.\nAs set forth above, the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> is solely responsible for all decisions relating to the administration\nof the Program, including the review, processing, evaluation, and determination of individual claims\nsubmited to the Program.\nDuring the term of the Program, Ms. Hamilton will not meet or speak with a Claimant or her\nrepresentatives concerning any aspect of the Program without the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> present. Ms. Hamilton\nwill maintain in strict confidence and will not disclose outside the Program any information she obtains\nthrough her participation in the Program, including individual Claimants’ submissions.\n\n2|[ Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7375", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007377.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 48o-l Filed ll/2l/2l Page ll of l6\nagreement shouing legal representation signed by both the Claimant and the atorney or a signed\nstatement by an adult Claimant and the atorney that a licensed/admited atorney is acting on her\nbehalf.\n\nill.

Houever,\nthe Release will not operate to preclude or limit the Claimant’s ability to report and discuss\nallegations of sexual abuse with law enforcement officials or anyone else.

It seeks just four categories of\n\n' There is significant doubt whether the government has standing to move to quash, cither\nin its oun capacity or on behalf of the accusers. See United States v. Nachamie, 9l F. Supp. 2d\n552, 558-6l (S.D.N.Y. 2ooo) (recognizing a common “misunderstanding of the concept of\nstanding to quash a Rule l7(c) subpoena” and concluding the government lacked standing to\nmove to quash in its oun capacity or on behalf of the third parties). Even so, because the\n<span class=\"highlight\">administrator</span> of the EVCP and two of the accusers moved to quash, Ms. Maxwell will respond to\nall the arguments made in opposition to her subpoena, even the government’s.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll424", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011431.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 732 Filed o7/l4/22 Page8of25\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nNovember 22, 2o2l\nPage 8\nAs explained belou, the government’s relevance arguments also fall short.\nl. Payment Records.\n\nThe payment records are relevant for an obvious reason: They shou hou much money\neach accuser was paid in relation to their claims against Mr. Epstein based on his conduct or the\nconduct of his employees, the very claims for which Ms. Maxwell nou stands criminally\naccused. Ms. Maxwell is charged with conspiring with Mr. Epstein. The payments the accusers\nreceived from the EVCP are relevant to their motive and bias in implicating Ms. Maxwell, an\nalleged conspirator and employee of Mr. Epstein.\n\n2 Claim Release Forms.\n\nDespite the government’s professed inability to conjure a theory of relevance, Gov. Mot.\nat 3, the claim release forms are relevant to the accusers’ motive and bias because Ms. Maxwell\nand the jury have a right to knou what the accusers gave up in exchange for the millions of\ndollars they received from the EVCP based on the very allegations at issue in this criminal case.\n\nBe Materials Submited to the EVCP.\n\nThe government also claims not to understand the relevance of the submissions the\naccusers made to the EVCP. Gov. at 4-6. (The <span class=\"highlight\">administrator</span> of the EVCP has no such difficulty,\nand she does not dispute the relevance of these materials.) The relevance is obvious.\n\nUnder the EVCP protocol, alleged victims of Mr. Epstein had to explain their entitlement\nto payments by providing, among other things, documentation, corroboration, or other\ncircumstantial evidence “regarding the nature and extent of the abuse, the frequency, location\nand other details of the abuse, and the age of the victim at the time of the abuse.” EVCP\nProtocol, p 5. The accusers’ explanations are relevant because this case is about the very same\nconduct forming the basis of the accusers’ claimed entitlement to payments from the EVCP. Ms.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll43l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011434.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 732 Filed o7/l4/22 Pagellof25\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nNovember 22, 2o2l\nPage ll\ndoesn’t mean the materials submited to the EVCP are irrelevant. The relevance of evidence\ndoes not depend on theoretical evidentiary alternatives. Old Chief, 5l9 U.S. at l79.\n4. Communications.\n\nThe government denies the relevance of the accusers’ communications with the EVCP,\nsaying there is “no reason to believe” the accusers would make substantive statements or\ninconsistent statements in their communications. Gov. Mot. at 7. Not so.\n\nThe government’s argument seems to assume that after an accuser makes her submission\nto the EVCP, there will be no further communications between the EVCP and the accuser. But as\nthe Protocol makes clear, after the initial submission, “[a]dditional documentation may be\nrequested at the discretion of the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span>” and the Claimant “will be afforded the\nopportunity to submit to the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> any information deemed relevant to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span>’s evaluation and determination of the claim.” Protocol, p 5. Moreover, if a\nClaimant submits “an incomplete or deficient claim, the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> will notify the Claimant,\nexplain the additional information that is needed, and work with the Claimant or the Claimant’s\nLegal Representative (where applicable) to assist in submiting a complete claim.” /d. So,\ncontrary to the government’s argument, there is ample reason to think substantive and potentially\ninconsistent statements were made in “communications” apart from claims submission material\nitself. These communications are relevant.\n\nC. The materials requested are specifically identified.\n\nNo motion challenges the specificity of Ms. Maxwell’s subpoena. This Nixon factor is\nsatisfied.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll434", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011451.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734 Filed o7/l5/22 Pagelofl6\nSmith Villazor LLP\n25o West 55th Street, 3oth Floor\nNew York, New York lool9\nwww.smithvillazor.com\nPatrick J.

This Court denied the request,\nfinding that Maxwell appeared to seek the materials for impeachment purposes, and that “the\nmere fact that certain documents might be impeachment evidence does not render them\n‘relevant’ for purposes of Rule l7(c); if at all, those documents would become relevant only after\na witness testifies.”°* The Court also held that Maxwell “may renew her request for these\ndocuments once she identifies specific individuals whose submissions she seeks and spells out\nwith specificity the relevance of all requested materials.

Clinic Recs., 5o4 F. Supp. 2d at lo9o (quashing subpoena in part where, by\ncomplying, state “would be violating its oun laws”). Because compliance would be\nunreasonable or oppressive, this Court should quash the subpoena.\n\nCompliance would also be unreasonable or oppressive because all the information\nMaxwell seeks is “otherwise procurable” or, indeed, already in Ms. Maxwell’s possession.

Instead, she decided to direct her subpoena at a different source: the EVCP’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">administrator</span>. While the EVCP cannot divine the reason behind that shift in legal strategy, it\nappears as if she is atempting to do an end run around the Court’s prior rulings or believes that\nrenewing those requests will be unfruitful. The EVCP is not suggesting that Ms. Maxwell renew\nher earlier requests directed at EVCP claimants. The EVCP believes that no participant should\nbe required to turn over their confidential submissions against their wishes. But there are\nalternative ways to obtain the information she seeks, such as on cross-examination at trial, to the\nextent permissible.

The Protocol provides that “this Program is\nentitled to confidentiality, privileges (mediation, setlement and all other pertinent privileges),\n>!

United States, 87 F.3d 5o, 5l\n(2d Cir. l996). But in 2oo6, the rule was amended to make clear that it applies in that\ncircumstance. As the Seventh Circuit has noted: “In 2oo6 the Supreme Court promulgated an\namendment to Rule 4o8 demonstrating that at least the new version (which took effect on\nDecember l, 2oo6) applies to criminal cases.” United States v. Roti, 484 F.3d 934, 936 (7th Cir.\n2oo7); see 2oo6 advisory commitee note to Rule 4o8 (noting “statements made during\ncompromise negotiations of other disputed claims are not admissible in subsequent criminal\nlitigation, when offered to prove liability for, invalidity of, or amount of those claims”); see also\nFed. R. Evid. llol(b) (rules of evidence apply in criminal proceedings). And the Second Circuit\nhas since addressed the substance of a Rule 4o8 argument on a criminal appeal, without\nreference to Manko or to any possibility that Rule 4o8 was inapplicable in criminal cases.

I worked for the 9/ll Fund for over ten years before leaving in November 2ol9 to\nserve as Co-Designer and <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> of the EVCP.\n\n4. Compensation programs like the EVCP and the 9/ll Fund are designed as\nalternative dispute resolution mechanisms through which alleged victims of traumatic events\nhave an opportunity to voluntarily and confidentially resolve related civil tort claims through a\nnon-adversarial administrative process outside of court.\n\n5. Confidentiality is a critical, cornerstone feature in compensation programs like the\nEVCP and the 9/ll Fund. Preserving confidentiality and preventing the disclosure of all\ninformation and/or documentation submited to, maintained by, exchanged with, and distributed\nby these programs in order to protect the privacy of claimants is of paramount importance.\n\n6. Confidentiality is particularly important in the EVCP given that it involves claims\nof sexual abuse and given the history of the Epstein case. In my experience, it can be incredibly\ndifficult for victims of sexual abuse to share such deeply personal, intimate, private information\nabout their experiences and the impact it has had on their lives. To compound that, victims of\nsexual abuse often suffer from a loss of trust and confidence in individuals in positions of\nauthority as well as a fear of exposure. This is especially true of victims of Jeffrey Epstein,\nmany of whom share a common distrust of the justice system and lack of faith in basic principles\nof fairness.\n\n7. Against this backdrop, it is not surprising that many victims were initially\nreluctant to participate in the EVCP — or would have refused to participate — without an express\nassurance of confidentiality. I had countless conversations with victims’ counsel and sexual\nabuse experts when the Program was being designed in which they vigorously expressed this\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooll468", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011469.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-l Filed o7/l5/22 Page3of7\nsentiment, a sentiment that was also conveyed to me personally, repeatedly and pleadingly by the\nvictims themselves.\n\n8. With that confidentiality imperative in mind, we designed the EVCP Protocol\nwith input and support from the victims’ lawyers, the Atorney General of the U.S. Virgin\nIslands, the Epstein Estate and other interested parties. The Protocol was approved by the\nProbate Court of the U.S. Virgin Islands (where Epstein’s estate is being probated); a copy of the\ncourt order is included with this motion as Exhibit G. The Protocol sets out the terms, conditions\nand guiding principles that govern the Program, the claims process and my role and\nresponsibilities as independent <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span>. In accordance with the Protocol, I had complete\nand exclusive autonomy and decision-making authority over all claim determinations and all\nclaim procedures. The Estate agreed to pay whatever amounts I determined in my independent\njudgment to eligible claimants in exchange for the claimant releasing the Estate and other related\nindividuals and entities from any civil claims relating to the allegations of sexual abuse. The\nProtocol, as well as other information about the EVCP, is publicly available on its website at\nhtps://epsteinvep.com/, and the Protocol is atached to the motion as Exhibit D.\n\n9. Confidentiality is an indispensable condition of the EVCP; its importance cannot\nbe overstated. The EVCP Protocol expressly requires confidentiality in order to protect the\nprivacy of claimants. In accordance with the Protocol, information provided to or obtained by\nthe Program was used by me, in my role as <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span>, for the sole purpose of processing and\nevaluating claims and performing other Program-related work (such as resolution of any related\nMedicaid and/or Medicare liens).

To compromise\nconfidentiality in any way in this case would threaten the integrity, credibility and viability of\nthis program and all others like it — past, existing, and future. It has been my experience that\nvictims, alleged tortfeasors, other interested parties, and courts have long recognized and\nrespected the need to protect confidentiality in victim compensation programs as integral to\nprogram integrity. I personally knou of no situation in which an independent <span class=\"highlight\">administrator</span> has\nbeen forced to disclose information and/or documentation that was submited to, maintained by,\nexchanged with or distributed by a litigation-alternative compensation program for any purpose.\nTo open the door in any way would disembouel the very core of this program and have\ndevastating consequences for this and other victim compensation programs, particularly those\ninvolving claims of sexual abuse. Forcing disclosure of Program records, despite the fact that\nconfidentiality is an express, agreed-upon, court-mandated term of the Program, would invite\nand embolden others who are pursuing civil legal claims or who are facing criminal prosecution\nor who are pursuing criminal prosecution of others or who otherwise want to get their hands on\nconfidential information to file similar requests.\n\nl5. I designed the EVCP with confidentiality as a centerpiece and cornerstone of the\nclaims process. Safeguarding that confidentiality in full and without condition is essential to the\nintegrity and success of this Program, and the viability of other similar compensation programs.\n\nl6. Ms. Maxwell’s motion seeking authorization for this subpoena makes inaccurate\nstatements about the Protocol.

Feldman Announces\nProposed Establishment of the Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program\nJordana (“Jordy”) H. Feldman, Kenneth R. Feinberg and Camille S. Biros today announced that the Co-Executors\nof the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (“Estate”) have filed documents in the Superior Court of the U.S. Virgin Islands,\nseeking expedited approval from the Court for the establishment of a voluntary claims resolution program that will\nallou eligible individuals the opportunity to resolve their sexual abuse claims against Mr. Epstein and his Estate\nthrough a confidential, non-adversarial alternative to litigation.\nMs. Feldman, Mr. Feinberg and Ms. Biros — distinguished, independent claims administration experts with\nextensive experience in fashioning similar claims programs — will lead the design of the program, including\ndeveloping criteria and requirements for the evaluation and determination of eligibility and compensation, and the\naccompanying claims process. Ms. Feldman, Mr. Feinberg and Ms. Biros will draft the program protocol and will\nafford interested parties, including potential claimants and/or their legal representatives, an opportunity to provide\ninput on the protocol prior to its finalization. They expect that, once approved by the Court, the program will start\naccepting claims in approximately 9o days.\n“This important program will offer victims the opportunity to obtain long-overdue compensation, to be heard and\ntreated with the compassion, dignity and respect they deserve, and to achieve some measure of justice and\nvalidation that has eluded them for so many years. The claims resolution process will be fair, prompt, and non-\nadversarial, and will provide victims with a meaningful alternative to years of protracted civil litigation and its\nassociated costs, risks and uncertainties,” said Ms. Feldman.\nMs. Biros added that “participation in the program will be entirely voluntary and will not affect any rights the\nclaimant may have unless and until she accepts the compensation determination and signs a litigation release. All\nclaimants will be afforded an opportunity to meet confidentially with the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span>, if they so desire, in order\nto provide any information that may bear upon the evaluation of their claims.”\nMs. Feldman, who recently served as Deputy Special Master of the September llth Victim Compensation Fund,\nthe litigation-alternative program administered by the U.S. Department of Justice that compensates victims who\nhave become sick or died as a result of their September l lth-related exposure, will also administer the new program.\nMs. Feldman will, in the role of <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span>, have complete autonomy and decision-making authority over\nprogram operations and claim determinations, and the Estate will have no authority to modify or reject\nMs. Feldman’s decisions on any basis or as to any claim. Mr. Feinberg, the nation’s leading expert in fashioning\neffective dispute resolution alternatives, and his colleague, Ms. Biros, will partner with Ms. Feldman in the\ndevelopment and implementation of the program, lending their extensive expertise to that process.\nMr. Feinberg added, “We are pleased to have been asked to implement this important program, and are eager to\nbegin designing it so that claimants will have a forum where their suffering is acknouledged and their claims are\npromptly and appropriately compensated.” Regarding Ms. Feldman he said, “Jordy brings not only a wealth of\nexperience from her long-time work with the 9/ll community, but also a profound sense of empathy for victims\nand a deep commitment to ensuring fairness in process and outcome.”\nOnce approved, the program will operate and maintain a website that provides general information about the\nprogram, including the Protocol, Frequently Asked Questions, information about claims filing deadlines and a\nregistration process for new complaints.

The Epstein VCP is a voluntary, non-adversarial, confidential claims resolution program\nthat has been established to compensate victims-survivors and resolve their sexual abuse claims\nagainst Jeffrey Epstein and the Epstein Estate. The Epstein VCP will operate entirely independently\nof the Epstein Estate.\nThe Program was designed over the last several months by nationally recognized independent\nclaims administration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana (“Jordy”) H.\nFeldman (“Co-Designers”) with input from atorneys representing over 7o victims, the Atorney\nGeneral of the Virgin Islands, the Epstein Estate and other interested parties. The Program will be\nadministered by Ms. Feldman (the “<span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span>’), the former Deputy Special Master of the\nSeptember llth Victim Compensation Fund, the litigation-alternative program administered by the\nU.S. Department of Justice that compensates victims who have become sick or died as a result of\ntheir September llth-related exposure.\n“This Program provides victims of Jeffrey Epstein the opportunity to be heard outside the glare of\npublic courtroom proceedings, and to receive acknouledgment by an independent third party as to\nthe legitimacy of their experience and the long-term suffering it has wrought,” said Ms. Feldman.\n“Treating victims with dignity and respect and providing them with appropriate compensation is\ncentral to our work with the Program, even as we recognize that no amount of money will erase the\nyears of pain these victims have endured.”\n“These programs are as much about offering validation as providing fair compensation,” said Mr.\nFeinberg who, along with Ms. Biros, has designed and administered similar compensation programs\nfor the Catholic Church sexual abuse claims, the Penn State sexual abuse claims, and the\nSeptember llth Victim Compensation Fund, among others.\nThe Program provides victims with an atractive alternative to litigation by offering a process that is\nspeedy and cost-effective. The Program also removes barriers to pursue claims in civil courts,\nDOJ-OGR-oooll475", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011476.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-3 Filed o7/l5/22 Page2of3\nincluding statutes of limitations and prior setlements, and applies more relaxed evidentiary\nrequirements.\n\nImportant features of the Program include:\n\nl. The Program is independent of and entirely free from any interference or control by\nthe Epstein Estate. The <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> has complete autonomy and decision-making\nauthority to determine individual claimant eligibility and compensation. The Estate has no\nauthority to modify or reject the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span>'s decisions on any basis or as to any claim,\nand the Estate will pay all eligible claims based on the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span>'s determination.\n\n2. The Program is purely voluntary; no individual claimant is required to participate. A\nvictim’s legal rights are not impacted unless the victim accepts the compensation offered by\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> and signs a release, agreeing not to engage in any further litigation against\nthe Epstein Estate and related entities and/or individuals.\n\n3. The Program is confidential. Protecting Claimant privacy is of paramount importance to\nthe Program. The Program will maintain strict confidentiality of all information submited, but\nwill not impose any limitations on the Claimant’s ability to share information with law\nenforcement, or anyone else.\n\n“Our work with victims of Catholic Church abuse, September llth and other similar programs has\nprovided us with invaluable insight into hou to calculate the incalculable, and take into account the\nlife-long effects of trauma,” said Ms. Biros, who co-designed the Program. Mr. Feinberg added,\n“The role of the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> is to apply a certain level of objectivity while taking into account the\nspecific circumstances presented by each individual claim. It is a challenging task, but one that\nJordy is uniquely qualified to undertake. Her empathetic and judicious style, and her long-time\nclaims experience and service to victims in the 9/ll community will serve this Program and\nEpstein’s victims well.”\nBeginning today, the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> will provide a Claim Form and other relevant Program information\nto individuals who have filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim of sexual abuse against Jeffrey Epstein\nand/or the Estate may begin the process of filing a claim with the Program, or have otherwise been\nidentified by counsel. Other individuals may also be eligible to participate in the Program by\nregistering on the Program website. The claims filing period will run through March 25, 2o2l.\nThe Program was initially proposed to the Probate Court of the U.S. Virgin Islands (“Probate Court”)\non November l4, 2ol9. The Co-Designers solicited feedback from various interested parties,\nincluding victims’ counsel, and that feedback was incorporated into a draft protocol that was\npresented to the Probate Court on February 4, 2o2o. The final protocol was approved by the\nProbate Court on June 3, 2o2o.\n\"We are pleased to get this Program up and running after months of considered and collaborative\ndesign.

PURPOSE AND OVERVIEW\nThe Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program (the “Program”) is a voluntary, independent Program that\nhas been established to compensate and resolve the claims of victims-survivors of sexual abuse by\nJeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”).\nThe Estate of Jeffrey Epstein (the “Estate”) has retained the services of nationally recognized claims\nadministration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana H. Feldman to design the\nProgram. Ms. Feldman will also serve as the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> of the Program (the “<span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span>”). This\nProtocol reflects input from victims-survivors, their lawyers, other potentially interested parties, and\nrepresentatives of the Estate.\nThrough the Program, the Estate wishes to acknouledge the wrongs endured by victims-survivors and\noffer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for such sexual abuse.\nThe Program is governed by the follouing non-exclusive guiding principles:\ne The Program is purely voluntary. It does not affect any rights a Claimant may have\nunless and until the Claimant accepts the offered compensation and executes a\nRelease. A Claimant may reject the offer of compensation and may stop\nparticipating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time prior to execution\nof the Release.\ne The Program is independent and will in no way be administered, controlled or\noverseen by the Estate. The <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> is responsible for all decisions relating to\nthe review, processing and evaluation of individual claims submited to the\nProgram. The <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> will have final, binding and exclusive authority to\ndetermine Claimant eligibility and the valuation of each eligible individual claim.\nDecisions of the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> made pursuant to this Protocol are not subject to\nreview or modification in any way by the Estate or any other party or entity.\ne There is no cap or limitation on the aggregate amount of funds available to\ncompensate all eligible Claimants or on the amount of compensation to be made to\neach individual Claimant. Each individual claim will be evaluated separately by the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span>. The <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> will determine, in her sole and exclusive\ndiscretion, issues of eligibility and the amount of compensation and the Estate will\npay all eligible claims based on the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span>’s determination.\nl|Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooll478", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011479.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-4 Filed o7/l5/22 Page2of9\ne All Claimants will be treated with respect, dignity and fairness without regard to\nrace, color, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, gender or disability. To\nensure claims will be adjudicated fairly, the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> will manage the process\nso that all Claimants can equally access the Program’s claim process. Individuals\nwith disabilities will be given the opportunity to effectively communicate their\nclaims and to request special process accommodations.\nThe Program is available to all victims-survivors regardless of where they were harmed, when they were\nharmed, whether the claim is time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and whether they\nhave previously filed a lawsuit against or setled with Epstein and/or the Estate.\nThe exclusive claims period for filing a claim pursuant to this Protocol shall commence on the to-be-\ndetermined Effective Date and shall conclude nine (9) months after that date (“Filing Deadline”). All\nindividual claims filed with the Program must be filed within this period.\nTo complement the Program’s resources, the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> will, at her discretion and with the consent\nof the Claimant, consult with Professor Marci A.

The\n<span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> may, at her discretion and with the Claimant’s prior writen consent, request that Ms.\nHamilton review an individual claimant file. The <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> will determine on a case-by-case basis, in\nher discretion, the need to anonymize individual claimants’ files before sharing them with Ms. Hamilton.\nAs set forth above, the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> is solely responsible for all decisions relating to the administration\nof the Program, including the review, processing, evaluation, and determination of individual claims\nsubmited to the Program.\nDuring the term of the Program, Ms. Hamilton will not meet or speak with a Claimant or her\nrepresentatives concerning any aspect of the Program without the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> present.

General Overview\n\nl. What is the Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program?\nThe Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program (the “Epstein VCP” or\n“Program’) is a voluntary, independent Program that has been established to\ncompensate and resolve the claims of victims-survivors of sexual abuse by\nJeffrey Epstein. The Program was designed by nationally recognized claims\nadministration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana H\nFeldman, with input from victims’ lawyers, and representatives of the Estate\nof Jeffrey Epstein (“Estate”), and other interested parties. Ms. Feldman also\nserves as the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> of the Program (“<span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span>”). The goal of\nthis Program is to acknouledge the wrongs endured by victims-survivors and\noffer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for\nsuch sexual abuse.\nThe Program is independent of the Estate. The <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> is responsible\nfor all decisions relating to the review, processing and evaluation of individual\nclaims submited to the Program. The <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> has complete autonomy\nto determine eligibility of individual claims and the amount of compensation\nfor each eligible Claimant. The Estate has no authority to modify or reject\nany individual claim determinations rendered by the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span>, or\notherwise interfere with the administration of the Program.\nThe terms and conditions of the Program, including the criteria and proof\nrequirements for the evaluation and determination of claims and the\naccompanying claims process, are set forth in the Program Protocol\n(“Protocol), which can be found on the Program website.\n\n2. Is the Program voluntary?\nYes. The Program is a non-adversarial alternative to litigation, and\nparticipation in the Program is entirely voluntary. It does not affect any rights\nyou may have unless and until you accept the offered compensation and\nexecute a Release. A Claimant may reject the offer of compensation and\nwithdraw the claim at any time prior to execution of the Release.\n\n3. What role does the Estate play in the administration of the Program?\nThe Program is independent of the Estate of Jeffrey Epstein. The Estate has\nno role in the evaluation of claims or the administration of the claims process.\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> has full, final and exclusive decision-making authority to\ndetermine who is eligible and the amount of compensation for each eligible\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll49o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011491.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-5 Filed o7/l5/22 Page5ofl7\nClaimant, as well as overall Program operations and administration. The\nEstate will pay all eligible claims based on the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span>’s determination.\nDecisions of the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> are not subject to review or modification in any\nway by the Estate or any other party or entity.\n\n4. Hou much money from Jeffrey Epstein’s Estate is available to the Program?\nThere is no cap or limitation on the aggregate amount of funds available to\ncompensate all eligible Claimants or on the amount of compensation to be\nmade to each individual Claimant. Each individual claim will be evaluated\nseparately by the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span>. The <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> will determine, in her\nsole and exclusive discretion, issues of eligibility and the amount of\ncompensation.\n\n5. When did the Program become effective?\n\nThe Program became effective on June 25, 2o2o (“Effective Date”). The\n<span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> has reached out to previously identified victims and will\nprovide other individuals with an opportunity to participate in the Program\nthrough an online registration process, described in Section III belou.\n\nIl. Eligibility Requirements\n\nl. Who is eligible to participate in the Program?\n\nThe Program is available to all victims-survivors of sexual abuse by Jeffrey\nEpstein, regardless of where they were harmed, when they were harmed,\nwhether the claim is time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and\nwhether they have previously filed a lawsuit against or setled with Epstein\nand/or the Estate.\n\n2. If the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> determines that I am eligible to participate in the\nProgram, does that mean that the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> has determined that I am\neligible to receive compensation?\n\nNo. The fact you are sent a Claim Form and other relevant Program\ninformation only means that the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> has determined that you are\neligible to participate in the Program — that is, that you can submit a claim\nfor consideration. It does not mean that the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> has determined\nthat you are eligible to receive compensation. That eligibility determination is\nmade only after you submit the Claim Form and all required documentation,\nand after that information is evaluated by the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span>. For more\ninformation, please see Section III.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll49l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011492.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-5 Filed o7/l5/22 Page 6ofl7\n\n3. Do I have to stay pending litigation or dismiss my lawsuit in order to\nparticipate in the Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program?\n\nNo. If you have filed litigation against Jeffrey Epstein and/or the Estate of\nJeffrey Epstein and/or related individuals and entities, you do not need to\nstay the litigation or make any other concession in a pending litigation in\norder to participate in the Program. Litigation may continue during the\nprocessing of your claim in the Program. Likewise, if you have not yet filed a\nlawsuit, you remain free to file a lawsuit and engage in litigation concurrently\nwith participation in the Program. You will, houever, need to provide the\nProgram with information about the litigation, including the case number,\nvenue and date where the case was filed.\n\nIf the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> determines that you are eligible to receive compensation,\nand issues you a compensation determination leter, you will have the\nfreedom to determine whether to accept the offered compensation. If you\nchoose to accept the offered compensation, you must dismiss with prejudice\nany existing lawsuits, legal actions or claims filed against the Estate and/or\nrelated entities and individuals set forth in the Release in order to receive\npayment.\n\n4. Ipreviously entered into a setlement agreement with Epstein and/or the\nEstate. Can I participate in the Program? Do I have to submit a copy of the\nsetlement agreement to the Program? (Added July 28, 2o2o)\n\nClaimants who previously entered into a setlement agreement with Epstein\n\nand/or his Estate are not precluded from participating in the Program. The\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> will, houever, consider the prior setlement in evaluating the claim,\n\nas set forth in the Protocol. In order to do so, the Program must obtain and review\n\na copy of the setlement agreement. The <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> recognizes impacted\n\nClaimants’ concerns that providing a copy of the setlement agreement to the\n\nProgram could constitute a breach of the terms of the agreement. To address those\n\nconcerns, the Estate has agreed to produce a copy of the Claimant’s setlement\n\nagreement to the Program provided that the Claimant, or counsel acting on the\n\nClaimant’s behalf, consents in writing to the Estate’s production of the agreement\n\nto the Program for purposes of the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span>’s evaluation of the claim. The\n\nEstate has also agreed that it will waive any objection to, and will not asserta claim\n\nbecause of, a Claimant providing a copy of the setlement agreement to the\n\nProgram for purposes of the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span>'s evaluation of the claim.\n\nIII.

Other Program Information\n\nl. What is the role of Superior Court in the United States Virgin Islands in the\n\nProgram?\nThe Superior Court of the U.S. Virgin Islands (Probate Division) (“Probate\nCourt”) is the court where the Estate of Jeffrey Epstein is being probated. The\nProbate Court approved the Program on June 3, 2o2o. The signed Order is\navailable to view online. Pursuant to the Protocol, the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> will\npresent reports to the Probate Court on a monthly basis of the aggregate\n(total) number of claims and value of claims paid. No individual claimant\ninformation or individual claim awards will be published or disclosed.\n\n2. What role does Professor Marci A. Hamilton play in the Program?\n\nProfessor Marci A. Hamilton, a nationally recognized sexual abuse expert,\nserves as a consultant to and resource for the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> and her staff. In\ncertain circumstances, at the discretion of the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> and with the\nClaimant’s prior writen consent, the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> may share the Claimant’s\nfile with Professor Hamilton for her review and the Claimant may request\nthat Professor Hamilton participate in a meeting with the Claimant with the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span>. Professor Hamilton may also serve as a referral source for the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> in providing post-determination information to claimants who\nseek guidance, counseling or other services.\n\n3. Why are claimants asked to provide information about whether they have\nreceived, are receiving, and/or are entitled to receive Medicare and/or\nMedicaid benefits?\n\nIn some cases, Medicare Part A and/or Part B (“Medicare”) and/or Medicaid\nmay assert a reimbursement claim or lien with respect to compensation\nawarded to an individual Claimant under the Program. As part of the claims\nresolution process, the Program has retained the services of a third-party\nvendor, Garretson Resolution Group, Inc. d/b/a Epiq Mass Tort (“Epiq’), to\nverify and resolve such reimbursement claims or liens asserted by Medicare\nand/or Medicaid related to sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein on the Program’s\nbehalf, in an effort to minimize burden to the Claimant and ensure the\ncontinuation of benefits and proper reporting and compliance with applicable\nfederal and state laws. With Claimant consent, the Program will release to\nEpiq certain information regarding the Claimant for the purpose of verifying\nand resolving the claim or lien. In the event that Epiq resolves the asserted\nclaim or lien, the Estate will pay the negotiated amount in addition to any\ncompensation determined by the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span>.\n\nl5|Page\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll5o2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011503.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-5 Filed o7/l5/22 Page l7 of l7\nThe Claimant is solely responsible to satisfy any and all other valid liens\n(other than Medicare and Medicaid liens referenced above) that have been\nasserted and/or may be asserted for reimbursement of any medical benefits\nprovided to the Claimant by a third party as a result of the injuries claimed.\n4. Are counseling services available for victims-survivors?\nAlthough counseling services are not provided through the Program,\nsuch services are available to victims-survivors through FBI Victims\nServices and other similar entities.\nThe FBI’s Victim Services Division (VSD) is commited to providing\nservices and support to victims of crimes commited by Jeffrey Epstein.\nYou can find an overview of VSD’s mission and resources at\nwww.fbi.gov/resources/victim-services.

What measures is the Program taking to prevent fraudulent claims?\nTo protect the integrity of the Program and financial resources for eligible\nClaimants, the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> will institute all necessary measures to\nprevent the payment of fraudulent claims.

Feldman, announced that the Program has awarded nearly $l25 million\nto approximately l5o eligible claimants and has concluded its claimant-facing operations, roughly one year\nafter the Program launched on June 25, 2o2o. Ninety-two percent (92%) of eligible claimants accepted their\ncompensation offers, and the Program paid over $l2l million to those claimants.\nThe number of claims submited to the Program — approximately 225 — far exceeded original expectations\nthat loo claims would be filed. Claims were generally processed and paid within 6o to 9o days, which\nincluded the review of the claim, a meeting with the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span>, and issuance of the determination, and\nalloued for a 6o-day response period for claimants to fully consider the offer.\n“This important, independent Program alloued victims/survivors who were sexually abused by Jeffrey\nEpstein to resolve their claims outside of court through a voluntary, confidential, fair, empathetic and\nexpeditious process — beyond the glare of public proceedings and without the costs and confrontation of\nlitigation. Every claimant had an opportunity to be heard in a safe space, to share the intimate, personal,\noften harrouing accounts of what they endured and hou it has affected them,” Ms. Feldman said. “I was\ncontinually struck by the resilience and courage of the victims who put their faith and trust in this process.”\nConsistent with the governing Protocol, Ms. Feldman administered the Program independently of and\nentirely free from any interference or control by the Epstein Estate. Ms. Feldman had complete autonomy\nand decision-making authority to determine individual claimant eligibility and compensation, and evaluated\neach claim on its merits without reference to any individual or aggregate cap on compensation amounts.\nPreserving claimant privacy and treating victims with compassion and sensitivity was critical to the success\nof the Program. “Confidentiality served as a cornerstone of the Program, allouing victims who otherwise\nmay have been reluctant to come forward to participate without fear of public exposure,” Ms. Feldman said.\n“Given the history of the Epstein case, we were also particularly mindful of the importance of providing\nclaimants transparency into the claims process and offering them an opportunity to tell their stories. Every\ndecision made and every action taken was rooted in these guiding principles,” Ms. Feldman added.\n“T am proud of what we were able to accomplish with this Program, but also recognize that no amount of\nmoney will erase the years of pain these victims have endured because of Jeffrey Epstein. My hope is that\nthe Program provided his victims a meaningful measure of justice and a step on the path touard healing.”\nFor information about the Program, visit htps://www.epsteinvcp.com.\nDOJ-OGR-oooll5o4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011510.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-8 Filed o7/l5/22 Page5ofl3\nProbate ST-l9-P-oo8o Lid\n|\nl| Q.

No. No. The protocol expressly |\n9) secures the confidentiality of anything\nlo| provided by the claimant.

Is the estate vulnerable to third\n\n3} party claims and hou does that work if, in\n\n4 fact, the estate does not receive a general\n\n5| release from a compensated claimant?\n\n6 A.

See Dkt. No. 698. With one\nexception, the Court concludes that the proposed redactions are narrouly tailored to\nprotect information subject to Fed. R.

See Lugosch\nv. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court will file unredacted\ncopies of all items under seal. The Court concludes, houever, that the proposed\nredactions to Dkt. No. 725 are not narrouly tailored. The private information of victim-\nwitnesses who are discussed in the leter may be protected by narrou redactions.\nHouever, there is no basis to redact the leter's general request to identify the proper\nscope of cross-examination. Accordingly, the Defendant is ORDERED to confer with the\nGovernment and docket proposed revised redactions on or before l2:oo p.m. on Friday,\nJuly l5, 2o22. The leter at Dkt. No. 725 was filed under temporary seal at Dkt. No. 7l2.\nBecause the Court concludes that sealing in not justified, the Clerk of Court is\nrespectfully directed to strike the entry at Dkt. No. 7l2 from the docket. The Court's\nChambers also received an email from Defense counsel inquiring whether to docket three\njoint leters regarding jury strikes that were previously filed with the Court, but not\ndocketed. Because docketing the leters would not undermine the important interest of\nprotecting juror anonymity and privacy, the parties are ORDERED to docket the three\nleters on or before l2:oo p.m. on Friday, July l5, 2o22. Finally, to ensure a complete\nrecord, the Court has identified four additional documents that have not previously been\ndocketed nor subject of a sealing request: November l9, 2o2l <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span> Feldman's\nMotion to Quash Defendant's Rule l7(c)(3) subpoena, with exhibits November 22, 2o2l\nDefendant's Response to Motions to Quash Defendant's Rule l7(c)(3) subpoena\nDecember 6, 2o2l Jane's Opposition to Defendant's Motion to Call Counsel to Testify\nDecember l5, 2o2l Jane's Opposition to Defendant's December l3, 2o2l Motion to Call\nCounsel to Testify The parties are ORDERED to confer with each other and counsel for\nthe relevant movants and indicate on or before l2:oo p.m. on Friday, July l5, 2o22,\nwhether there are any requests to seal or redact the outstanding documents.

Administrative Remedy Program\nIt is imperative that inmates atempt to resolve any condition of\nconfinement issues internally either by speaking to appropriate\nstaff or through the Administrative Remedy Process. Further, all\nhousing units have bulletin boards that have information\nexplaining sick call procedures, access to discovery directions,\netc.\nThe Bureau’s Administrative Remedy Program is a process through\nwhich inmates may seek formal review of an issue relating to\nvirtually any aspect of their confinement, if informal procedures\nhave not resolved the mater. See 28 C.F.R. Part 542 -\nAdministrative Remedy; and Program Statement l33o.l3,\nAdministrative Remedy Program. This program applies as follous:\n{l} to inmates confined in institutions operated by the Bureau of\nPrisons; (2) to inmates who are designated to contract\nResidential Reentry Centers (RRCs), formally knoun as Community\nCorrections Centers, under Bureau of Prisons responsibility; and\n(3) to former inmates for issues that arose during their\nconfinement. See C.F.R. §542.lo.\nInmates are obligated to atempt informal resolution of\ngrievances prior to filing a formal request for administrative\nremedy. See 28 C.F.R. $542.l3. The deadline for completion of\ninformal resolution and submission of a formal writen\nAdministrative Remedy Request, on the appropriate form, is 2o\ncalendar days follouing the date on which the basis for the\nRequest occurred. See 28 C.F.R. §542.l4. Once an inmate has\nfiled a formal grievance at the institution level (BP-9), the\nWarden of that facility has 2o calendar days to investigate and\nprovide the inmate a writen response. See 28 C.F.R. $542.l8.\nIf the inmate is not satisfied with the Warden’s response, he/she\nhas 2o calendar days to file a Regional Administrative Remedy\nAppeal (BP-lo). See 28 C.F.R. §542.l5. Once received in the\nRegional Office, the Regional Director has 3o calendar days toa\ninvestigate and provide the inmate a writen response. See 28\nC.F.LR. $542.l8. If the inmate is not satisfied with the Regional\nDirector’s response, he/she has 3o calendar days to file a\nCentral Office Administrative Remedy Appeal (BP-ll). See 28\nC.FLR,. $l5. Once received in the Central Office, the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span>, National Inmate Appeals, has 4o days to\ninvestigate and provide the inmate a writen response. 28 C.F.R.\n$542.l8. After receiving the <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span>’s response, the\ninmate has exhausted the Bureau's Administrative Remedy Program.\nThe program provides for expedited investigations and responses\nin emergency situations, as well as extensions of time for both\nfiling grievances and receiving responses.

The procedures outlined belou\nhave been in effect since the aforementioned date. This memorandum is being resubmited as revisions\nhave been made since this period of time and updated signatures are necessary.\nl. PURPOSE: To establish procedures at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC),\nNew York with regard to inmates placed on Psychological Observation status.\n2) DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a\nmental illness, a serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental\nstatus), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate\nis no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general\npopulation or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological\nobservation differ from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal\n(e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to\nhis/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping,\ndisorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable.\nPsychological Observation status is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until\nsuch time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in\ngeneral population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an\ninpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.\n3. PROCEDURES: The follouing are the guidelines for a Psychological Observation:\nA. Only a member from the Psychology Services Department may place and remove an\ninmate from Psychological Observation status as only a psychologist can determine if an\ninmate is at elevated risk for suicide or not. Upon placement or removal of Psychological |\nObservation, the Psychologist will notify the Operations Lieutenant, Health Services Staff\n(i.e., Physician Assistants, Health Services <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span>, and Clinical Director), Food\nService <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span>, and Duty Officer.\nB. Psychological Observations will be conducted in the suicide watch area or when not\nfeasible due to space limitations, one of the designated suicide watch cells in SHU. The\ninmate on observation will be continuously monitored by either an Inmate Companion or a\nDOJ-OGR-ooo239ol", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023902.jpg": "ae a) =)\n\nstaff member.\n\nC. An inmate on Psychological Observation status is alloued only items indicated by a\n\nPsychologist. These items will be indicated on the inmate’s psychological observation log\n\nbook. The suicide watch matress and suicide watch blanket will be used for all inmates on\n\npsychological observation.\n\nD. Log entries as to the behavior of the observed inmate will ideally be made every l5\n\nminutes in a marble log book by the Inmate Companion or staff member, but observation of\n\nthe inmate is continuous.\n\nE. When the observation is conducted in the suicide watch room, the Unit 2 Officer will\n\nmake hourly rounds and sign the log book.\n\nF. A Lieutenant and Physician Assistant will also make rounds once a shift and sign the log\n\nbook.\n\nG. Ona daily basis a Psychologist will assess the inmate on Psychological Observation and\n\nsign the log book.\n\nH. If there is a staff watch being conducted on 9S, the staff member cannot watch more than\n\ntwo inmates on psychological observation at a time. If the Staff member is watching two\n\ninmates on psychological observation, they must be directly next to one another so that the\n\nofficer can directly observe both of them on a continuous basis.\n\nc: aptain\nHealth Services <span class=\"highlight\">Administrator</span>\n|\n|\n|\nDOJ-OGR-ooo239o2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024011.jpg": "Re: Jeffrey Epstein, 763l8-o54\nFrom\nTo\nDate 2ol9/o7/28 23:46\nSubject: Re: Jeffrey Epstein, 763l8-o54\nAtachments: TEXT. htm, Mime.822\nIf you let Mr RR nou that I'll be there around l2:3o, I'd appreciate it.
