My vulnerability and brokenness made mo a prime\nI came to New York when I was 22 years old, wanting to stent my life over after an incredibly\nebusive relationship, and hoping to atend FIT and work in the fashion industry. Those dreams\n~ Seon after arriving, ! met on Epstein/Maxwell recruiter named Natalya Malyshev ina club. She\nbefitended me and, soon after that, arranged for me to meet “Jeffery”. She described him as a\nkind philanthropist who could help me get into FIT and provide much-needed support,\n. something which was alien to me.\nOver the next seven to eight months, I became, against my will, nothing more than 9 sex toy with\n4 heartbeat and soul used to entertain of Epstein, Maxwell aed ethers. Sometimes I was subjected\nto his sexual predation multiple times per day, both in his New York mansion and on his private\n: istand St. Lite James in the U.S. Virgin Islands, aided by Maxwell and others. On one visit to\nthe island, the sexual demands, degradation and humiliation caused me to try to escape by\n: jumping off a cliff into shark-infested waters; l was caught by Maxwell and company moments\nbefere jumping. At the time, that extrentely risky escape seemed more appealing than being\nraped one more dime,\nAs the evidence at the Maxwell trial proved, and my oun experience confirms, Maxwell was his\nrighthand woman, She was the Five Star General of several recruiters and many others who\nprovided the means and cover for Epstein’s predation.\n; Epstein and Maxwell were masters ot finding young, vulnerable girls and young women to\nexploit. Upon targeting a vulnerable gir/young woman, they would ingratiate themselves to hes,\nEpstein was a very wealthy, generous man whose primary interest was to help the leas fortunate.\nHe and Maxwell were sophisticated, wostdly adults with deep ties to important people, world\nleaders and institutions who could give the victims the lifeline they needed to make their dreams\n_ Weslity or orush them.\nHouever, coon after tulling me and others into a false sense of comfort and security, they\npounced, ensnaring us in their upside-doun, twisted wortd of rape, rape and more rape.
