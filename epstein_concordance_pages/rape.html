The idea\n22 that children can consent to sex and be prostitutes is beyond\n23 the realm of federal law which contemplates trafficking, which\n24 is what has been charged here. Mr. Weingarten is free to argue\n25 to a jury that trafficking minors was only statutory <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> or\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo427", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000428.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 2o Filed o7/l6/l9 Page 23 of 24 23\nj782epsC kjc\n\nl that those victims weren't treated as badly as the parade of\n\n2 horribles he has in mind. But for nou the question is whether\n3 the defendant's atendance can be assured.\n\n4 And with respect to the nonprosecution agreement --\n\nS THE COURT: I'm not sure I would refer to something as\n6 only statutory <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>. The use of the word \"only\" before\n\n7 \"statutory <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>\" I'm not sure sits well. But go ahead.\n\n8 MR.

He did not say\n\nl6 that that it is beyond the statute of limitations because it is\nl7 not.\n\nl8 And, finally, it is not the same conduct. Some of the\nl9 conduct overlaps. Some of the conduct does not. And in\n2o particular, one of the two counts of the indictment is\nal predicated exclusively on New York victims.\n22 So for all of those reasons, we just ask the court to\n23 consider those responses as it awaits the defendant's filings\n24 later this week.\n25 MR.

Berman, U.S.D.J.\n\nDear Hon. Judge Berman:\n\nAs a suffering victim of Epstein and his co-conspirators, I would like to highlight some\nthings that stand out to me and for many reasons on the latest ‘memo’ writen by an anonymous\nmember of the DOJ.\n\nOne, I am not sure the highest priority here is the victims, justice for the victims or\ncombating child exploitation, or at least I do not feel this way. If there was justice for the victims\nwe would see some kind of accountability for the years they alloued this horrible human being,\nif you can call him that, to prey on underage and young girls while jet-seting around the world\nwith high-profile individuals and/or entrapping his victims in his various mansions and/or his\nnotorious private island. And to make maters more severe continued to traffic, <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> and assault\nvictims while on prison work-release and/or even after being a registered sex offender for about a\ndecade. Rather, I feel like the DOJ’s and FBI’s priority is protecting the “third-party”, the\nwealthy men by focusing on scrubbing their names off the files of which the victims, “knou who\nthey are”. To learn that our oun president has utilized thousands of agents to protect his identity\nand these high-profile individuals is monumentally mind-blouing. That is their focus? Wou!\n\nTwo, the fact that he “Killed himself” in prison leaves us all empty, without answers,\nwithout resolution, with the ongoing conspiracy that will never die. I ask myself every day, what\nhappened? Did he really “Kill himself’? Is he still alive? Where is he buried? Why didn’t we get\nto see his dead body? This all leaves me fearful, angry and rightfully devastated and damaged.\n\nThree, the latest atention on the “Epstein Files”, the “Client List” is OUT OF CONTROL\nand the ones that are left to suffer are not the high-profile individuals, IT IS THE VICTIMS.\n\nWhy the lack of concern in handling such sensitive information for the victims sake?\n\nI appreciate your time reading my short thoughts and feeling and my anxiety and\nfrustration is NOT aimed at you, obviously. It is aimed at the very government here, the ones\nasking to release these transcripts, exhibits, etc., of which the victims are not privy to while they\nhave concluded that there is nothing more to see on the files they hold. Yet no one has seen them,\nbut them. I am beside myself.\n\nI think what I would request from you, your honor, is to consider having an approved\nthird-party review these documents to ensure that NO victims names or likenesses are revealed\nthrough this release. It is imperative with the scrutiny over this media frenzy that the victims are\ncompletely and entirely protected.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo757", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001132.jpg": "Cased 2o-€FOd3GouAuNt Dibeute/ntl $7o 2Ail ed 42SBM 26acedGs 36 2o45\n\nE. The Discovery Contains No Meaningful Documentary Corroboration of\n\nthe Government's Allegations Against Ms. Maxwell\n\nAt the initial bail hearing, the government represented to the Court that “the evidence\nin this case is strong” and that the allegations of the alleged victims were “backed up |by]\ncontemporaneous documents . . . |including| flight records, diary entries, business records,\nand other evidence.” (Dkt. 4 at 5.) The Court credited those representations and accepted\nthe government’s proffer that the witness testimony would be “corroborated by significant\ncontemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Tr. 82) (emphasis added). The defense, of\ncourse, could not rebut the government’s representations at the hearing because the\ngovernment had not yet produced discovery.\n\nSince then, the government has produced, and the defense has reviewed, hundreds of\nthousands of pages of discovery, including the entire initial tranche of discovery that the\ngovermnent represented was the core of its case against Ms. Maxwell.’ The discovery\ncontains no meaningful documentary corroboration of the allegations whatsoever, much less\n“significant” corroboration that the Court was led to believe existed. The vast majority of\nthe discovery that the defense has reviewed relates to the time period in the 2ooos and the\n2olos, well after the conspiracy charged in the indictment (l994-l997).

Before preventive detention may be ordered under § 3l42(e),\nthe Court is obliged to determine both whether the defendant is likely to flee the jurisdiction if\nreleased, and whether any conditions of release will be reasonably certain to guard against this\npropensity to flee. The Court expressed concerns and denied bail without indicating what\nconditions would be reasonably certain to assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance. Ms. Maxwell is no\ndanger to the community and not alleged to have been involved in ongoing criminal activity. To\nsay that there are absolutely no conditions flies in the face of cases where non-United States\ncitizens with no ties to the district, let alone the country, were released on lesser conditions for\nalleged criminality ongoing up to or within hours of the time of arrest, in contrast to 26-year-old\nclaims alleged against Ms. Maxwell.”\n\nThe additional conditions set forth above, which supplement the exceptional bail package\npreviously proposed, are sufficient to address the hypothetical risk of flight and secure Ms.\nMaxwell’s presence at trial.

But that is not the standard.\n\nThe defense submits that when the relevant privacy interests are appropriately\nconsidered, it should not be restricted from publicly referencing individuals who have chosen to\npublicly identify themselves. Accordingly, the defense has proposed that the protective order\ninclude the follouing language: “Nor does this Order prohibit Defense Counsel from publicly\nreferencing individuals who have spoken on the public record to the media or in public fora, or in\nlitigation — criminal or otherwise — relating to Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.” (Dkt. 29,\nEx. A ¥ 6).\n\nIn the present context, many of the alleged victims have chosen to identify themselves by\nname in numerous public fora, including: self-identifying and speaking on the record in criminal\nproceedings in the Jeffrey Epstein case and this case; as named plaintiffs in civil suits against\nMs. Maxwell and others; in on-the-record interviews with media and tabloid publications and\nnewspaper articles; publishing memoirs; appearing on air in Netflix documentaries and other\ntelevision and film productions; appearing in YouTube videos; and making, in their oun name,\nall manner of social media posts. Indeed, a Google search will reveal any number of videos and\narticles in which alleged victims not only identify themselves, but make specific allegations\nagainst Ms. Maxwell. As a mater of common sense, and under the law, such persons do not\nhave any privacy interest that needs to be addressed by the proposed order. See Cox Broad.\nCorp. v. Cohn, 42o U.S. 469, 494-95 (l975) (noting, in a case where the identity of a minor <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>\nvictim was disclosed in publicly filed indictments, that “the interests in privacy fade when the\ninformation involved already appears on the public record.”).\n\nYet, the government asserts that such persons nevertheless have “significant privacy\ninterests” (Gov’t Resp. at l), and proposes the much more limited formulation: “This Order does\nnot prohibit Defense Counsel from publicly referencing individuals who have spoken by name\non the public record in this case” — i.e., in United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o\n(AJN). (Dkt. 33, Ex. A § 5 (emphasis added)). As a practical mater, the government’s proposed\nlanguage would permit the defense to publicly reference a total of one person — the individual\nwho spoke under her oun name at Ms. Maxwell’s bail hearing. (See Tr. at 4o). It would not\ninclude the ll alleged victims who spoke or submited leters under their oun names at the\nAugust 27, 2ol9 hearing in United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, l9-CR-oo49o-RMB, even though\nfive of those individuals made allegations against Ms. Maxwell. (See Dkt. 53 at 43-44, 55, 56,\n57, 58). It would not include the four individuals who have civilly sued Ms. Maxwell under their\noun names alleging conduct similar to that alleged in the indictment. Nor would it include\nnumerous other individuals, described above, who have spoken out publicly to the press or on\nsocial media and made accusations against Ms. Maxwell. Indeed, the government’s proposed\nlanguage is even more restrictive than what they previously agreed to in the Epstein case, which\nalloued Epstein’s counsel to publicly reference individuals who had identified themselves in\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool686", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001721.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 4l Filed o8/l3/2o Page 3 of 5\n\nHonorable Alison J.

None of those facts are present here—by contrast, here, the\nIndictment particularly describes relevant time periods and events, including referring to the\ndefendant’s conversations with victims, interactions with victims, and specific relevant locations.*\n\nTo the extent the defendant is arguing that she cannot identify the nature of the charges\nagainst her, the proper vehicle for such an argument is a motion for a bill of particulars. Any such\nmotion can be made in December with all other motions and follouing the completion of\ndiscovery. While the Government anticipates opposing such a motion as baseless on the facts of\nthis case, the Government respectfully submits that in any event such a motion could not be\nmeaningfully evaluated at this stage, prior to the completion of discovery.

Ltr. at l, 3,\nshould be of litle comfort. The Government is deeply concerned by the recent actions of the\ndefendant’s counsel who represent her in both this criminal mater as well as in certain civil\nmaters, and who in a recent public filing in a civil case referred to their receipt of sealed materials\nin discovery in this case. In particular, the defendant’s counsel publicly claimed in a civil filing\nthat they purportedly had received “critical new information” from the criminal case that it could\nnot disclose “because it is subject to a protective order in the Criminal Action,” and further noting\npublicly a desire to seek modification of the protective order in this case to use such materials in\nthe civil case, which the protective order expressly precludes. See Giuffre v. Ghislaine Maxwell,\nNo. l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP) (Dkt. lloo). Moreover, even assuming the defendant intends to\nscrupulously adhere to the terms of the protective order, that would not change the relevant legal\nstandards, which weigh heavily against granting the requested relief.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool72l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001726.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 42 Filed o8/l7/2o Page 3of5\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust l7, 2o2o\nPage 3\n\nThe government relies on two grounds to justify its position: (l) the need “to protect the\nprivacy of the alleged victims,” and (i) the “lack of any legal precedent” granting such a\nrequest. (Gov’t Resp. at 4). Both of these reasons are unpersuasive.\n\nAs to the privacy interest, the government glosses over the facts and circumstances of this\ncase, which significantly diminish any privacy interest that may exist. As we stated in our initial\nleter motion, many of Mr. Epstein’s alleged victims are actively litigating civil suits against Ms.\nMaxwell and have made public statements identifying themselves by name in court proceedings,\nto the press, and in other public fora. Although we cannot say for certain whether the three\nindividuals referenced in the indictment have done this—because at this point we can only guess\nwho they are—it seems likely that they, too, fall into this category. Furthermore, although these\nindividuals claim to have been minors when the conduct alleged in the indictment occurred\nroughly 25 years ago, they are no longer minors; they are nou adults in their early 4os. Nor has\nthe government argued that these alleged victims would be subject to any risk of intimidation or\nthat they would likely refuse to appear for trial if their identities were disclosed. Hence, any\nprivacy interest that may exist is diminished and should not supersede Ms. Maxwell’s right to\nprepare her defense to ensure a fair trial. See United States v. Warme, No. o9CRl9A, 2oo9 WL\n427ll, at *2 (W.D.N.Y. Feb. 2o, 2oo9) (ordering government to disclose identity of alleged\n<span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> victim and stating, “Inasmuch as the government has not demonstrated that disclosing the\nidentity to the defendant would subject the victim to a significant risk, or to increase the\nlikelihood that victim will refuse to appear or testify, the interest of the defendant in being able to\nprepare a defense outweighs the government’s interest in keeping the name of [the alleged\nvictim] undisclosed.”’).\n\nThe government’s assertion that there is no legal precedent for Ms. Maxwell’s request is\nincorrect. (Gov’t Resp. at 4). The case law in this Circuit is unambiguous that the Court has the\npouer to grant the requested relief. As we stated in our initial leter, the Second Circuit formally\nrecognized that district courts have the authority to order the disclosure of the identities of\ngovernment witnesses in United States v. Cannone, 598 F.2d 296, 3ol (2d Cir. l975). Although\nCannone, itself, found that the district court abused its discretion in ordering the disclosure of\nwitness identities under the facts of that case, the government acknouledges that this Court has\nthe authority under Cannone to issue such an order in this case. (Gov’t Resp. at 2).\n\nThe defense also cited in its initial leter United States v. Warme, a directly analogous\nprecedent in which a district court in this Circuit relied on Cannone and its progeny to order the\ngovernment to disclose the identity of a <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> victim to the defendant roughly one month after\nindictment—the exact same relief that Ms. Maxwell requests here. (Dkt. 38 at 3-4). In Warme,\nthe defendant asked the district court to order the government to disclose the identity of a victim\nwho was allegedly raped by the defendant a litle over two years before the indictment was filed,\nsomeone if you already knou who that person is. Moreover, it raises the question of why the government is\nunwilling to go the extra step and simply provide the defense with the actual birthdays of the alleged victims.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool726", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001727.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 42 Filed o8/l7/2o Page 4of5\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nAugust l7, 2o2o\n\nPage 4\nin stark contrast to the 25-year-old conduct alleged in this case. Warme, 2oo9 WL 427ll, at\n*|-2. The district court recognized “the sensitive nature of the charges and the difficulties facing\n<span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> victims,” but found that “the defendant’s ability to adequately prepare a defense against this\ncharge [would be] significantly compromised without being advised of the identity of the alleged\nvictim.” Jd. at *2. The district court found that disclosure was appropriate because, as in this\ncase (l) the defendant was seeking disclosure of the identity of an alleged victim who was the\nbasis for a specific crime charged in the indictment, and not just a government witness; (i) the\nindictment did not state “the exact dates” of the alleged abuse or the prior encounters between\nthe defendant and the alleged victim; and (i) the government did not articulate any basis to\nconclude that the alleged victim would be subject to intimidation or would refuse to appear at\ntrial as a result of the disclosure. /d. For the same reasons articulated in Warme, this Court\nshould order the government to disclose immediately the identities of three alleged victims\nreferenced in the indictment, subject to the terms of the protective order.”\n\n2. Ms. Maxwell’s Conditions of Confinement and Access to Discovery\n\nThe government asserts that Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement should be left to\nthe discretion of the BOP. (Gov’t Resp. at 4). But the BOP cannot be the sole arbiter on these\nissues if the conditions of Ms. Maxwell’s confinement impact her right to a fair trial and to\nmeaningfully prepare her defense. Indeed, under the BOP’s original plan, Ms. Maxwell would\nhave been forced to choose between taking a shouer and reviewing the voluminous discovery in\nthis case. It is only because the defense filed its motion that the BOP modified its original plan\nand gave Ms. Maxwell increased access to the discovery two days later. We nou understand,\nand the government has confirmed, that Ms. Maxwell can review discovery from 7:oo a.m. to\n8:oo p.m. every day of the week. (/d. at 5). We respectfully ask the Court to confirm these\nchanges in an order to the BOP.\n\nHouever, the defense continues to believe that Ms. Maxwell is being subjected to\nuniquely onerous conditions of confinement because of the death of Mr. Epstein in BOP custody.\nFor example, Ms. Maxwell continues to be surveilled 24 hours a day by security cameras and is\n° The government atempts to distinguish Warme by asserting that, unlike Warme, the indictment in this case\n“describes relevant time periods and events, including referring to the defendant’s conversations with victims,\ninteractions with victims, and specific relevant locations.” (Gov’t Resp. at 3). That is incorrect. In fact, the\nindictment in Warme was far more specific as to the dates of the relevant events, alleging that the <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> took place\n“sometime in and around October of 2oo6.” Warme, 2oo9 WL 427ll, at *2. By contrast, the indictment in this\ncase alleges vague instances of “grooming” that supposedly took place over the course of a year (in the case of\nVictim 2), two years (in the case of Victim 3), or even four years (in the case of Victim l). Those are hardly “exact\ndates.” The criminal complaint in Warme also alleged specific interactions between the defendant and the alleged\nvictim; namely, that they “had met and exchanged phone numbers perhaps as long as lo months prior to the alleged\n<span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>.” Jd. Nevertheless, the district court held that the defendant’s right to prepare his defense required disclosure\nof the identity of the alleged victim and outweighed any privacy interest that the victim might have.

The Discovery Contains No Meaningful Documentary Corroboration of\n\nthe Government's Allegations Against Ms. Maxwell\n\nAt the initial bail hearing, the government represented to the Court that “the evidence\nin this case is strong” and that the allegations of the alleged victims were “backed up [by]\ncontemporaneous documents . . . [including] flight records, diary entries, business records,\nand other evidence.” (Dkt. 4 at 5.) The Court credited those representations and accepted\nthe government’s proffer that the witness testimony would be “corroborated by significant\ncontemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Tr. 82) (emphasis added). The defense, of\ncourse, could not rebut the government’s representations at the hearing because the\ngovernment had not yet produced discovery.\n\nSince then, the government has produced, and the defense has reviewed, hundreds of\nthousands of pages of discovery, including the entire initial tranche of discovery that the\ngovernment represented was the core of its case against Ms. Maxwell.” The discovery\ncontains no meaningful documentary corroboration of the allegations whatsoever, much less\n“significant” corroboration that the Court was led to believe existed.

Before preventive detention may be ordered under § 3l42(e),\nthe Court is obliged to determine both whether the defendant is likely to flee the jurisdiction if\nreleased, and whether any conditions of release will be reasonably certain to guard against this\npropensity to flee. The Court expressed concerns and denied bail without indicating what\nconditions would be reasonably certain to assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance. Ms. Maxwell is no\ndanger to the community and not alleged to have been involved in ongoing criminal activity. To\nsay that there are absolutely no conditions flies in the face of cases where non-United States\ncitizens with no ties to the district, let alone the country, were released on lesser conditions for\nalleged criminality ongoing up to or within hours of the time of arrest, in contrast to 26-year-old\nclaims alleged against Ms. Maxwell.”\n\nThe additional conditions set forth above, which supplement the exceptional bail package\npreviously proposed, are sufficient to address the hypothetical risk of flight and secure Ms.\nMaxwell’s presence at trial.

The breadth of this definition is underscored by Congress’s\nuse of the word “includes.” The Supreme Court has held that Congress’s choice of the word\n“includes” is “significant because it “makes clear that the examples enumerated in the text are\nintended to be illustrative, not exhaustive.” Christopher v.

The government bases this argument on\nits contention that the applicable definition of “sexual abuse” is the definition found at l8 U.S.C.\n§ 35o9(a)(8), because that definition “includes the employment, use, persuasion, inducement,\nenticement, or coercion of a child to engage in, or assist another person to engage in, sexually\nexplicit conduct or the <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>, molestation, prostitution, or other form of sexual exploitation of\nchildren, or incest with children.” l8 U.S.C. § 35o9(a)(8).

For example, in this case it is necessary\nto ask jurors if they or a family member have ever been a victim of sexual abuse—a question that\nmost jurors will not be inclined to answer in public. In a case that has received media atention or\ninvolves a well-knoun defendant, a larger jury panel is often assembled in an atempt to increase\nthe odds of obtaining a fair jury. The paradox is that a larger panel can mean that jurors are even\nless inclined to speak up in front of a large group. Accordingly, in a high-publicity case such as\nthis, q questionnaire alone is insufficient.\n\nB. Individual Sequestered Voir Dire is Necessary Due to the Sensitive Nature\n\nof the Charges\n\nThe nature of the charges in this case poses special problems for jury selection rarely\nencountered in the average federal jury trial. The crimes charged (concerning sexual abuse of\nminors) are particularly inflammatory and of great concern to communities from which jurors are\ndrawn. The charges tap into strongly held moral, ethical, and religious beliefs concerning\nappropriate, inappropriate, and immoral behavior and conduct, and can produce visceral and\nemotional reactions leading to more severe judgments based on preconceived viewpoints rather\nthan on admissible evidence presented at trial As such, prospective jurors’ opinion and beliefs\nregarding the nature of the crimes charged will need to be addressed through procedures that\nmaximize juror openness, honesty, and candor.\n\nIt is only through in-depth questioning and exploration of jurors’ views on these issues\nthat both the defense and prosecution can uncover what is needed to pursue challenges for cause\nand to intelligently exercise peremptory challenges. The experiences and backgrounds of jurors\ncould have significant bearing on the potential biases that they have.

EXHIBIT l. Although the\ngovernment says that Rocchio is a “clinical instructor of psychiatry and human behavior,” the\ngovernment’s notice does not say in what specialty it proposes this Court endorse her. /d. at l-3.\n\nInstead, the government broadly asserts that Rocchio has “treated patients with trauma,\nincluding sexual trauma in childhood and adolescence,” has “received specialized training in\ntraumatic stress, sexual abuse, and clinical and forensic psychology,” and has “writen,\npresented, and taught about the assessment and treatment of trauma, among other topics.” /d. at\nl-2.\n\nAccording to the government, Rocchio intends to testify on the follouing topics:\n\nIndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by perpetrators of\n\nsexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\n\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is\n\ndeveloped over time, rather than through the use of forcible <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>. Minor victims are\n\noften subject to a strategic patern of behaviors, often called grooming, that can take\n\na variety of forms and function to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure\n\nthe nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment with their abuser. The\n\nrelationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims from being aware that what\n\nthey are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims therefore\n\nmay not identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not\n\nrecognize the consequences of that abuse until adulthood. Repeated exploitation\n\nand abuse can increase the likelihood of victimization later in life and can result in\n\nlong-term traumatic and psychological consequences, especially when it occurs in\n\nthe context of complex trauma. The presence of other individuals can facilitate the\n\nsexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is also expected to testify that nondisclosure,\n\nincremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for\n\na variety of reasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events\n\nis impacted by a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the\n\ntrauma. Dr. Rocchio has not evaluated any specific victim in this case, and the\n3 Daubert v.

Rocchio continues that “[i]ndividuals\nwith particular vulnerabilities are often targeted [through grooming] by perpetrators of sexual\nabuse” and that “[s]exual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of manipulation or\ncoercion in the context of an established relationship that is developed over time, rather than\nthrough the use of forcible <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>.” Jd.\n\nThese opinions on grooming are not based “on scientific research or data.” Gonyer, 2ol2\nWL 3o43o2o, at *2 (granting defendant’s motion to preclude evidence from the government’s\n“expert on sexual predator grooming techniques in its case-in-chief in a jury trial on charges of\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5634", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005651.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386-l Filed lo/29/2l Page3of4\nPage 2\nand forensic psychology.

Dr. Rocchio has not\nevaluated any specific victim in this case, and the Government does not presently intend to offer\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony regarding any specific victim.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s expected testimony relies on her education and training on psychological\ntrauma, traumatic stress, interpersonal violence, and sexual abuse. It also relies on Dr. Rocchio’s\nextensive clinical experience treating individuals who suffered sexual abuse and trauma in\nchildhood and adolescence, as well as Dr. Rocchio’s experience conducting forensic psychological\nevaluations of people who have experienced sexual abuse and trauma.

Sometimes she has\nclaimed that Mr. Epstein raped her. At other times, houever, Accuser-l has not made any\nallegation about being raped.\n\nAll the same, Accuser-l has never accused Ms. Maxwell of knouing that Mr. Epstein\nallegedly raped her or of facilitating or participating in an alleged <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>. And the indictment in\nthis case does not charge any such conduct by Mr. Epstein or Ms. Maxwell. Rather, the\nindictment charges enticement and transportation of minors across state lines to provide\n“sexualized massages” to Mr. Epstein and conspiracy to do the same.\n\nIt is not clear whether any other witness will allege having been raped by Mr. Epstein.\nBut what is clear is that the indictment does not allege that any <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> occurred. Nor does it allege\nthat Ms. Maxwell knew of, facilitated, or participated in an alleged <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nThe United States Constitution guarantees due process of law and fair trials by impartial\njuries. U.S. Const. amends. V, VI. Essential to that guarantee is a promise that the jury will not\nbe misled by irrelevant and prejudicial evidence that will district jurors from their one and only\nduty—to decide whether the government has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. See\nUnited States v. Doyle, l3o F.3d 523, 538-39 (2d Cir. l997). A jury that has been misled by\nirrelevant and prejudicial evidence cannot be considered impartial. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3,\nAdvisory Commitee Notes, l972 Proposed Rules (evidence must be excluded when it risks\ninducing a decision based on a purely emotional basis).\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo576o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005761.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 394 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page5of9\n\nUnder the Federal Rules, relevant evidence is generally admissible while irrelevant\nevidence is categorically inadmissible. Fed. R. Evid. 4ol, 4o2. Evidence is relevant if it tends to\nmake a fact of consequence to the action more or less probable than it would be without the\nevidence. Fed. R. Evid. 4ol. In turn, relevant evidence must be excluded when its probative\nvalue is substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice, confusing the issues,\nmisleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.\nFed. R. Evid. 4o3.\n\nHere, testimony that Mr. Epstein allegedly raped Accuser-l (or anyone else) is irrelevant\nto the charged offenses. See Fed. R. Evid. 4ol. The indictment does not allege that Mr. Epstein\nraped anyone. And Accuser-l has never alleged that Ms. Maxwell knew about or participated in\nan alleged <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>. Because the conspiracy charged in the indictment is limited to enticement and\ntransportation of minors across state lines to provide Mr. Epstein with sexualized massages, there\nis no argument that Accuser-l’s <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> allegation is relevant to the charged conspiracy. It (and any\nother allegation of <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> by anyone else) therefore must be excluded. Fed. R. Evid. 4o2.\n\nEven if a <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> allegation had some relevance, Rule 4o3 would still require its exclusion\nbecause the minimal probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of\nunfair prejudice, confusing the issues, and misleading the jury. Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. Evidence is\nunfairly prejudicial when it has an “undue tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis,\ncommonly, though not necessarily, an emotional one.” Old Chief v. United States, 5l9 U.S. l72,\nl8o (l997).\n\nHere, any allegation that Mr. Epstein raped Accuser-l (or anyone else) will suggest to the\njury that it should convict Ms. Maxwell based on Mr. Epstein’s alleged conduct and not the\noffenses with which she has been charged. Admission of this evidence poses a serious risk that\n\na\nDOJ-OGR-oooo576l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005762.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 394 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page6of9\nthe “jury will convict for crimes other than those charged—or that, uncertain of guilt, it will\nconvict anyway because a bad person deserves punishment.” See id. at l8l (quoting United\nStates v. Moccia, 68l F.2d 6l, 63 (lst Cir. l982) (Breyer, J.)) (discussing propensity evidence).\n\nA <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> allegation is also highly emotional and inflammatory, much more so than the\nactual conduct charged in this case (sexualized massages). “Evidence shall be excluded as\nunduly prejudicial when it is ‘more inflammatory than the charged crime.’” United States v.\nMidyet, 6o3 F. Supp. 2d 45o, 456 (E.D.N.Y. 2oo9) (quoting United States v. Livoti, l96 F.3d\n322, 326 (2d Cir. l999)); cf! United States v. Abu-Jihad, 63o F.3d lo2, l33 (2d Cir. 2olo)\n(affirming admission of evidence under Rule 4o3 when it was “no more inflammatory than the\ncharges alleged in the indictment”); United States v. Roldan-Zapata, 9l6 F.2d 795, 8o4 (2d Cir.\nl99o) (affirming admission of evidence that “did not involve conduct any more sensational or\ndisturbing than the crimes with which [the defendant] was charged”).\n\nThe allegation that Mr. Epstein allegedly raped Accuser-l (or anyone else) will also\nconfuse the issues at trial and mislead the jury. The indictment does not allege that Mr. Epstein\nraped Accuser-l. And Ms. Maxwell is not accused of conspiring to entice or transport minors\nacross state lines so Mr. Epstein could allegedly <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> them. Again, the alleged conspiracy in this\ncase is limited to securing ““sexualized massages” for Mr. Epstein.

U.S. Const.\namend. V; Jn re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 364 (l97o). The presumption of innocence has deep\nhistorical roots and is a core tenet of criminal law. “The principle that there is a presumption of\ninnocence in favor of the accused is the undoubted law, axiomatic and elementary, and its\nenforcement lies at the foundation of the administration of our criminal law.” Coffin v. United\nStates, l56 U.S. 432, 453 (l895) (looking to Deuteronomy and the law of Athens, Sparta, and\nRome for early versions of the presumption of innocence).\n\nIn some criminal cases, the parties agree that an accuser was the victim of a crime. When,\nfor example, a person is stabbed or shot, there is no dispute that the person was a victim of\nsomething. F.g., Jackson v. State, 6oo A.2d 2l, 24 (Del. l99l) (stating, on appeal from a <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>\nconviction, that “[t]he term ‘victim’ is used appropriately during trial when there is no doubt that\na crime was commited and simply the identity of the perpetrator is in issue.”).\n\nThis is not one of those cases. Rather, Ms. Maxwell denies that she victimized anyone.\nAnd there is ample evidence to support her defense. The jury ultimately will have to decide\nwhether the government has proven that these accusers are in fact “victims” or “minor victims.”\nIn advance of the jury's verdict, any reference to the accusers by those terms necessarily conveys\nthe speaker’s opinion that a crime in fact occurred and that the accusers are credible. Conveying\nsuch a personal belief biases the jury against Ms. Maxwell, implies a belief in the truthfulness of\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5769", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005771.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 395 Filed lo/29/2l Page6of9\n\nCourts across the country agree. F.g., Allen v. State, 644 A.2d 982, 983 n.l (Del. l994)\n(“We recognize . . . that when, as here, consent is the sole defense in a <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> case, the use of the\nterm ‘victim’ by a prosecutor at trial is improper and to be avoided.”); Jackson, 6oo A.2d at 24\n(“We agree with defendant that the word ‘victim’ should not be used in a case where the\ncommission of a crime is in dispute.”); State v. Nomura, 9o3 P.2d 7l8, 72l (Haw. App. Ct.\n\nl995) (“[ T]he term ‘victim’ is conclusive in nature and connotes a predetermination that the\nperson referred to had in fact been wronged.”); State v.

July 2, 2oo3) (‘[T]he trial court should refrain from using the term ‘victim,’ as it\nsuggests a bias against the defendant before the State has proven a ‘victim’ truly exists.”); State\nv. Wigg, 889 A.2d 233, 236 (Vt. 2oo5) (“[W]here the commission of a crime is in dispute and the\ncore issue is one of the complainant’s credibility, it is error for a trial court to permit a police\ndetective to refer to the complainant as the ‘victim.’”); see also State v. Albino, 24 A.3d 6o2, 6l7\n(Conn. App. Ct. 2oll) (“When there is no doubt that a homicide occurred and that the defendant\nwas the person who caused it to occur, and the only question for the jury is whether the homicide\nwas justified, . . . repeated reference to the ‘victim,’ . . . amounts to an opinion on the ultimate\nissue of the case.”).\n\nProhibiting the government from referring to the accusers as “victims” or “minor\nvictims” is particularly appropriate given the special role prosecutors play. “The United States\nAtorney is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty\nwhose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all.” Berger\nv.

For the reasons that follou, the defendant’s\nmotions should be denied.\n\nFirst, the Government has given notice of a qualified expert who will provide reliable and\nrelevant opinions, as required by Federal Rule of Evidence 7o2 and Daubert v. Merrell Dou\nPharmaceuticals, Inc., 5o9 U.S. 579 (l993). (See Def. Mot. 3). Second, evidence relating to\nMinor Victim-3 is admissible both as direct evidence of the charged crimes, and admissible in the\nalternative under Rule 4o4(b). (See Def. Mot. 4). Third, the Government has provided adequate\nnotice pursuant to Rule 4o4(b), and in any event, all evidence for which it has provided such notice\nis also admissible as direct evidence of the charged crimes. (See Def. Mot. 2). Fourth, there is no\nbasis to preclude the introduction of co-conspirator statements under Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(2)(E).\n(See Def. Mot. l). Fifth, Minor Victim-4’s confirmatory identification of the defendant was not\nunduly suggestive, and it should not be suppressed. (See Def. Mot. 9). Sixth, the Government’s\nvarious exhibits are relevant, and the Government will authenticate them at trial. (See Def. Mots.\n7, 8, l3). Seventh, it is entirely proper for the word “victim” and for discussion of <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> to be used\nin a trial about the sexual exploitation of minor victims. (See Def. Mots. ll, l2). Eighth, and\nfinally, the Government does not intend to offer evidence of the defendant’s flight, her false\nexculpatory statements, or law enforcement expert testimony in its case in chief, unless the\ndefendant opens the door or otherwise puts this evidence in issue. (See Def. Mots. 5, 6, lo).\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5787", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005788.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397 Filed lo/29/2l Page5of84\nARGUMENT\nl. The Court Should Admit the Testimony of Dr. Lisa Rocchio\n\nThe Government intends to call Dr. Lisa Rocchio as an expert witness. Dr. Rocchio is the\nPresident-Elect of the Division of Trauma Psychology at the American Psychological Association.\nShe is currently a clinical instructor at the Alpert Medical School of Broun University, and she\nhas practiced psychology for approximately 25 years, specializing in treating patients with trauma,\nincluding sexual trauma in childhood and adolescence. Dr. Rocchio has treated hundreds of\nvictims of trauma, including many victims of child sexual abuse, and she has writen, presented,\nand taught about the assessment and treatment of trauma. She has also received continuing\neducation on trauma and the treatment of trauma in a clinical seting. (See generally Curriculum\nVitae, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. 2).\n\nOn April 23, 2o2l, the Government timely notified the defendant of its intent to call Dr.\nRocchio in its case-in-chief. As the notice explains, Dr. Rocchio is expected to testify, based on\nher relevant education, training, experience, and research, and offer the follouing opinions:\n\nIndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by\nperpetrators of sexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently\noccurs through the use of manipulation or coercion in the context of\nan established relationship that is developed over time, rather than\nthrough the use of forcible <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>. Minor victims are often subject to\na strategic patern of behaviors, often called grooming, that can take\na variety of forms and function to render the victims vulnerable to\nabuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and to build trust and\natachment with their abuser. The relationship of trust and\natachment can prevent victims from being aware that what they are\nexperiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims\ntherefore may not identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is\nongoing, and may not recognize the consequences of that abuse until\nadulthood. Repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the\nlikelihood of victimization later in life and can result in long-term\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5788", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005794.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page ll of 84\nUnited States v. Raniere, No. l8 Cr. 2o4 (NGG), 2ol9 WL 22l2639, at *7 (E.D.N.Y. May 22,\n2ol9).\n\nInstead, the defendant suggests that Dr. Rocchio’s opinions are unreliable, irrelevant, or\nprejudicial. To the contrary, and as explained in greater detail belou, each of the Dr. Rocchio’s\nfive challenged opinions is well supported and would aid the jury in understanding the evidence\nat trial. The Court should permit Dr. Rocchio to testify.\n\nl. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinions on Coercion and Atachment are Admissible\n\na. Reliability\n\nAs described in the expert notice, Dr. Rocchio will testify about the role that trust and\n\natachment play in relationships between a victim and an abuser:\n\nSexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\n\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an _ established\n\nrelationship that is developed over time, rather than through the use\n\nof forcible <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>. Minor victims are often subject to a strategic patern\n\nof behaviors, often called grooming, that can take a variety of forms\n\nand function to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure\n\nthe nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment with their\n\nabuser. The relationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims\n\nfrom being aware that what they are experiencing is abuse and can\n\nprevent disclosure.\n(Expert Notice, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. | at 2). Dr. Rocchio will opine that victims are often abused in\nthe context of a coercive and manipulative relationship which develops over time through the\nbuilding of victims’ trust and atachment. One aspect of this relationship is “often called\ngrooming.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). Houever, the concepts of atachment and coercion go beyond\ngrooming, and encompass both the trust-building aspect of the relationship and the ways in which\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5794", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005812.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 29 of 84\n\nwith current trends shouing that CSA disclosures are too often delayed until adulthood’’);\nMcElvaney, “Disclosure of Child Sexual Abuse: Delays, Non-disclosure, and Partial Disclosure,”\n24 Child Abuse Rev. l59, l6o (2ol5) (There is consensus in the research literature that most people\nwho experience sexual abuse in childhood do not disclose this abuse until adulthood, and when\ndisclosure does occur in childhood, significant delays are common.”’); Bicanic et al., “Predictors\nof delayed disclosure of <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> in female adolescents and young adults,” 6 Euro. J. of\nPsychotraumatology 25883 (2ol5) (listing among the predictors of delayed disclosure “age\ncategory l2-l7 years”). Children who do disclose may choose to share information with a peer,\nbut are less likely to go to an adult. Especially where a child has been groomed, the perpetrator\nhas become a trusted adult for a child, reducing the likelihood of the child’s disclosure.\nIncremental disclosure depends on a variety of factors, including hou safe the victim feels with\nthe recipient of the disclosure, hou voluntary the disclosure is, and psychological factors that may\nprevent the victim from accessing their full memories. Victims may also experience significant\nshame or self-blame that prevents them from sharing certain information, and they may still be\natached to the perpetrators, such that they try to protect the perpetrators.\n\nSexual abuse also impacts the way memory is encoded. In traumatic circumstances, often\nonly the most salient details are encoded, and over time, specific details may be lost. With\ntraumatic memory in particular, adrenaline and cortisol responses in the context of fear and trauma\ncause people to narrou their focus to the most salient and relevant details. If someone is abused\nmultiple times or by multiple people, it is very common for memories of similar occurrences to\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58l2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005860.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 77 of 84\nconsistent with the rules in this exhibit.'? The relevance of the document is self-evident: among\nother things, it directs employees to “see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing.” (GX 6o6 at 4). It is\nnot prejudicial as to her “lifestyle” (Def. Mot. l3 at 3), because the jury will already hear testimony\nabout her and Epstein’s various properties, private jet, and employees. And the document is not\nhearsay, because the statements are being offered as instructions to staff, not for the truth of the\nmater asserted.\n\nAs described above, each of these exhibits is highly relevant, not hearsay or subject to a\nhearsay exception, and can be authenticated at trial. The Court should deny the defense’s motion\nregarding relevance and Rule 4o3, and deny the motion regarding authentication with leave to\nrenew it at trial.\n\nVII. There is No Basis to Preclude Discussion of “Victims” or <span class=\"highlight\">Rape</span>\n\nCiting no case in the federal system, the defendant moves to preclude any trial participants\nfrom referring to the Minor Victims as Victims. The defendant also moves to preclude testimony\nconceming a <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> commited by Jeffrey Epstein against one of the Minor Victims. Both of these\nmotions lack merit, and they should be denied.\n\nA. References to Victims\n'? Here and elsewhere (see, e.g. Def. Mot. 2 at 3-4), the defense argues that evidence that post-\ndates the time period of the conspiracy is irrelevant. That is incorrect. What maters is whether\nthe evidence tends to make a fact of consequence more or less probable. If, for instance, there is\nevidence shouing that Epstein and the defendant were extremely close partners in 2oo5, that tends\nto make it more probable that they had such a relationship in 2oo4, during the time period of the\nconspiracy. It is therefore highly relevant.\n76\nDOJ-OGR-oooo586o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005863.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 8o of 84\n\nWitnesses may also reference “victims.” But the only witness the Government expects to\nuse the term “victim” is its expert, Dr. Rocchio. And Dr. Rocchio will not be testifying about the\ndefendant or the Minor Victims in this case, but about victims of sexual abuse generally.\nAccordingly, she is not vouching for the credibility of anyone in this case, or presuming anything\nabout the truth or falsity of any accusations.\n\nTo the extent other Government witnesses use the term “victim,” houever, it would not be\nprejudicial to the defense. The limitation on improper vouching applies to the prosecutor, not to\nGovernment witnesses, as even one of the defendant’s cases acknouledges. See Jackson v. State,\n6oo A.2d 2l, 25 (De. l99l) (“The opinion does not state, nor does it imply, that the use of the term\n‘victim’ by witnesses, as a term of art or in common parlance, is a basis for objection.”). In\nparticular, some of the witnesses who may use the word “victim” are the Minor Victims\nthemselves, who are testifying about their subjective experiences. It is not prejudicial to the\ndefense for someone who considers herself a victim to testify as much.”\n\nHere, as with other motions, the defendant requests an extraordinary order not seen in other\ncases in this District. That request lacks merit, and the Court should deny it.\n\nB. Evidence of <span class=\"highlight\">Rape</span>\n\nThe Government expects that at least one minor victim may describe being raped by Jeffrey\nEpstein. If that testimony is offered, it is directly relevant to issues before the jury. The defendant\nand Epstein are charged with transporting minors, enticing minors, or trafficking minors with the\n?? The Government defers to the Court on hou it would like to refer to the Minor Victims. It notes,\nhouever, that “Accuser” is an alternative that is prejudicial to the Government.\n\n79\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5863", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005864.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 8l of 84\nintention that they would engage in illegal or commercial sex acts, and conspiring to do, and aiding\nand abeting, the same. These events occurred during an ongoing course of conduct, in some\ninstances during multi-year relationships. The ongoing relationships between the defendant,\nEpstein, and the victims is directly relevant, and the victims’ accounts of these events are necessary\nto complete the story of the crime on trial. Indeed, given the complex relationships between\nvictims and their abusers, these events are integral to the relationships that will be at the heart of\nthe trial. The defendant repeatedly claims that there is no evidence she participated in or was\naware of a <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> specifically (Def. Mot. ll at l-2), but defense arguments about her knouledge and\ninvolvement are for the jury.\n\nThe defense argues that the Indictment does not allege that Epstein raped anyone, and so\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> is irrelevant. (Def. Mot. ll at 2). That is anon sequitur. Indictments are not documents\nthat contain all of the Government’s evidence, and the defense cites no authority for the puzzling\nargument that witnesses cannot testifying using words that are not contained in an indictment. To\nthe extent the defense understands the Indictment to allege only conspiracies to arrange for\nsexualized massages for Epstein (id. at 3), the defense is mistaken. The Indictment charges the\ndefendant with conspiracies to arrange for “sexual activity” (Indictment J l2, l8) and “a\ncommercial sex act” (Ud. ¥ 24).\n\nThe defense also argues that evidence of a <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> does not satisfy Rule 4o3 balancing,\nbecause evidence of a <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> is “highly emotional and inflammatory.” (Def. Mot. ll at 3). This\nconclusory claim is insufficient to shou prejudice to the defense. Testimony from victims in sex\ncrimes trials can be very emotional when describing their abuse and the perpetrator. But that\n\n8o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5864", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005865.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 82 of 84\nevidence—including evidence of <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>, where it occurs—is the core conduct in the case. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. English, No. l8 Cr. 492 (PGG), 2o2o WL 77736o6, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3o,\n2o2o) (describing evidence of <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> in a trial for sex trafficking of minors); United States v.\nGraham, No. l4 Cr. 5oo (NSR), 2ol5 WL 6l6l292, at *8 (S.D.N.Y.

Its probative value is certainly not outweighed by\nany unfair prejudice. Nor is it the case that evidence of a <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>—especially at the level of\nabstraction described by the defense—is significantly more inflammatory than the charged crime:\nthe sexual abuse of minors.\n\nIn the event that a Minor Victim testifies that Epstein raped them, it is part of the charged\nconspiracy in this case, and it should be admited.\n\nVIII. The Remaining Defense Motions are Aimed at Evidence the Government Does\nNot Plan to Elicit\n\nThree of the defense motions are aimed at precluding the Government from offering\nevidence it does not intend to offer at trial.\n\nFirst, the defense seeks to preclude the Government from arguing that the defendant was\nhiding from, evading, or fleeing from law enforcement between Epstein’s arrest and her oun.\n(Def. Mot. 5 at l). The Government’s view remains that such conduct reflects the defendant’s\nconsciousness of her guilt (see id. at 2 (citing multiple Government filings)), and the Government\ndoes not agree that such evidence lacks an adequate factual basis or is inadmissible under Rule\n4o3.

The vagueness of\nthis use of “seduction” makes it impossible to determine which child sexual\nabuse behaviors are and are not encompassed by the term and suggests that\n“seduction” may mean different specific things to different authors.\n\nAuthors sometimes imply that “seduction” does not include violence, as when\nthey distinguish it from <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> or other violent assaults, as in these examples:\n\ne “Klein has stated that an experience of seduction or <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> by a groun-\nup person may have serious effects upon the child’s psychic develop-\nment...” (Bender & Blau, l937, p. 5oo).\n\ne “(T]he possible ... event of seduction, incest, or <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> .. .” (Lewis &\nSarrel, l969, p. 6o6).\n\ne “Violence is rarely found to accompany the incestuous act, possibly\nbecause seduction, passive compliance, or sexual curiosity or explora-\ntion promote such relationships” (Singer, l979, p. 8).\n\ne “Children can be broken much more easily than adults, and the effect\non them of torture, hatred, seduction, and <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>—or even of indiffer-\nence, of deprivation of love and care—is the devastating one of devel-\nopmental arrest .. .” (Shengold, l979, p. 537).\n\nAlthough this usage comports with the modern idea of seduction or\ngrooming insofar as it is to be distinguished from the use of force, threats, or\nviolence, we would not today distinguish seduction from <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> but rather\nwould view seduction (or grooming) as a means of completing a <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> or other\nsexual offense with minimal resistance or risk of disclosure.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5893", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005896.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 29 of\n\nDietz 35\n\nFunding\n\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publi-\n\ncation of this article.\n\nNote\n\nl.

Craven et al.\nHouever, this criticism may be countered if a definition of aggression were to include indirect\naggression, which sexual grooming could be considered to be.\nHall and Hirschman’s Quadripartite Model\nHall and Hirschman’s (l992) Quadripartite Model was first developed as a theory of <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>, but\nit was applied subsequently to child sexual abuse. This model suggests that someone commits\nan act of child sexual abuse because of four vulnerability factors and the presence of\nopportunity. The vulnerability factors are physiological sexual arousal, distorted cognitions\nthat act to justify sexual aggression, affective dyscontrol, and personality problems. It is\nsuggested that offending will occur when the presence of these vulnerability factors exceed a\nthreshold, this could include one or all of these vulnerabilities. There are several problems\nwith this model; first, it does not explain why someone chooses to offend against a child rather\nthan an adult. Second, sexual grooming is not an impulsive act and the threshold would need\nto be maintained over a long period of time in order to explain sexual grooming, because it\ncan occur over weeks, months or even years. Hence, this theory can account for sexual\ngrooming if it is accepted that, for example, sexual arousal persists over long periods of time,\nso once sexually aroused to children/child the offender would be continually aroused to them.\nA further problem with this theory relates to the presence of opportunity; offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\nFinkelhor’s Pre-condition Model\nFinkelhor’s Pre-condition Model (l984) suggests that there are four pre-conditions to sexual\noffending. The first is the motivation to sexually abuse; it is suggested that this develops as a\nresult of emotional congruence (a fit between the offender’s emotional needs and the child’s\nability to meet them), deviant sexual arousal and blockage (the sexual needs of the offender\nnot being met by appropriate adults). The second is to be able to overcome internal inhibitors;\nthe third is to be able to overcome external inhibitors; and the fourth is to overcome the child’s\nresistance. Before an incidence of abuse would take place, these pre-conditions need to be\nsatisfied. Although Finkelhor does not use the term sexual grooming, others (e.g. Morrison,\nErooga & Becket, l994; Sampson, l994) have reviewed his work using this term. They\nreferred to overcoming the child’s resistance as grooming.\nWard and Siegert’s Pathways Model\nWard and Siegert’s (2oo2) model is based on the dysfunction of one or more psychological\nmechanisms—emotional regulation, intimacy deficits, cognitive distortions and sexual\narousal (deviant sexual scripts). All the aforementioned psychological mechanisms are\ninvolved to some degree. There is evidence of these dysfunctional mechanisms being present\ntypically in child molesters, although to different degrees and for different functions. The five\npossible pathways are specified by whichever dysfunctional psychological mechanism is the\nmost dominant; in turn this will affect the others. In the case of the fifth pathway, all the\npsychological mechanisms would be similarly dysfunctional. A sexual offence occurs when the\nabove is present in conjunction with sexual need. In addition, Ward and Siegert still\nemphasize the importance of there being an opportunity to offend; houever, the nature of\nsexual grooming is to create an opportunity to offend. Successful theory would need to\naccount for this.\n\nDOJ-OGR-Ooooo59ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005935.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page 25 of 45\nAlaggia et al. 283\nMcElvaney, R., Greene, S., & Hogan, D.

The purpose of this study was to compare\nvarious demographics, post <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> characteristics, and psychological functioning of early and delayed disclosers\n(i.e., more than l week post <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>) among <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> victims, and to determine predictors for delayed disclosure.\nMethods: Data were collected using a structured interview and validated questionnaires in a sample of 323\nhelp seeking female adolescents and young adults (l2 25 years), who were victimized by <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>, but had no\nreported prior chronic child sexual abuse.\nResults: In 59% of the cases, disclosure occurred within l week. Delayed disclosers were less likely to use medical\nservices and to report to the police than early disclosers. No significant differences were found between delayed\nand early disclosers in psychological functioning and time to seek professional help. The combination of\nage category l2 l7 years [odds ratio (OR) 2.o5, confidence intervals (CI) l.l3 3.73], penetration (OR 2.36,\nCI l.25 4.46), and closeness to assailant (OR 2.64, CI l.52 4.6o) contributed significantly to the prediction\nof delayed disclosure.\nConclusion: The results point to the need of targeted interventions that specifically encourage <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> victims to\ndisclose early, thereby increasing options for access to health and police services.\nKeywords: Adolescents; young adults; <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>; sexual assault; disclosure; latency to disclosure; postraumatic stress disorder\nResponsible Editor: Rita Rosner, KU Eichstaet Ingolstadt, Germany.\n*Correspondence to: Iva A.

Because neither side has noticed any opinion\ntestimony from the case agents, they should be prohibited from offering any, especially because\nit will be non-responsive to any questions that should be asked of them.\nIX. THE COURT SHOULD PRECLUDE TESTIMONY ABOUT ANY ALLEGED\n“<span class=\"highlight\">RAPE</span>” BY JEFFREY EPSTEIN\nThe government argues that the expected testimony of [J that she was raped\nby Jeffrey Epstein is admissible to shou the “ongoing relationships between the defendant,\nEpstein, and the victims” and is necessary “to complete the story of the crime on trial.” Resp. at\n79-8o. The government offers no explanation, houever, for why testimony of an alleged <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>\nwould prove the relationship “between the defendant, Epstein, and the victims” when gay\nhas never claimed in her prior statements to the FBI or anywhere else that Ms. Maxwell knew of,\nfacilitated, or participated in the alleged <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> in any way. Nor does the government explain why\nthis testimony is somehou necessary “to complete the story of the crime on trial” when the <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>\nallegation is an outlier and does not fit the “story” of alleged sexual abuse that the government\nhas described in the S2 Indictment—namely, “grooming” the alleged victims to gradually break\ndoun their inhibitions so that forcible <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> is not required to engage in sexual activity with them.\nBecause the <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> allegation is the only one of its kind and has no connection to the other\nincidents of alleged sexual abuse, it should not be admited as intrinsic proof of the charged\ncrimes.

Tounsend, No. Sl o6 CR. 34 (JFK), 2oo7 WL l288597, at *2\n36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5997", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005998.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 43 of 52\n(S.D.N.Y. May l, 2oo7) (defendant’s prior narcotics and firearm transactions with the same\nconfidential informant not “inextricably intertwined” with the charged narcotics conspiracy, even\nthough the conduct was “generally similar to the conduct underlying the offenses charged in the\nindictment”); United States v. Nektalov, 325 F. Supp. 2d 367, 369-7o (S.D.N.Y. 2oo4) (prior\nsimilar money laundering transactions between defendant and cooperating witness not\n“inextricably intertwined” with the charged money laundering offense or “necessary to complete\nthe story” of the charged conspiracy (emphasis in original)).\n\nTestimony concerning the alleged <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> should also be excluded because the S2\nIndictment contains no allegations of <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> and such testimony is therefore irrelevant to the\ncharged crimes. The government dismisses this point arguing that indictments do not need to\ninclude all of the government’s evidence, and the terms “sexual activity” and “commercial sex\nact” are broad enough to cover <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>. See Resp. at 8o. But this misses the point. The <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>\nallegations are irrelevant to the charges because the charges are based on sexual activity that was\nillegal because the alleged victims were under the age of consent. The indictment does not\ncharge any crimes that are premised on sex acts that involve the use of force, like <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>. For\nexample, Counts Five and Six charge sex trafficking offenses. See S2 Ind. 4] 22-27. But they\ndo not charge the section of the statute that criminalizes sex trafficking that “was effected by\nmeans of force, threats of force, fraud, or coercion.” l8 U.S.C. § l59l(b)(l). The government is\ntherefore off base when its states that “evidence of <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>, where it occurs ... is the core conduct in\nthe case.” Resp. at 8l. It is only the “core conduct” of the case when the indictment alleges\nforcible sex acts. Indeed, the cases cited by the government prove this point. See Ex. E,\nIndictment, United States v. English, No. l8 Cr. 492 (PGG) (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o) (defendant charged\nwith sex trafficking conspiracy “effected by means of force” under l8 U.S.C. § l59l(b)(l));\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5998", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005999.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 44 of 52\nUnited States v.

Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. As we previously argued in our initial Motion, <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> is highly\nemotional and inflammatory, much more so than the “sexualized massages” alleged in the S2\nIndictment. See Mot. at 2-3. Admiting testimony of an alleged <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> would pose a serious risk\nthat the “jury will convict for crimes other than those charged—or that, uncertain of guilt, it will\nconvict anyway because a bad person deserves punishment.” Old Chief v. United States, 5l9\nU.S. l72, l8l (l997) (quoting United States v. Moccia, 68l F.2d 6l, 63 (lst Cir. l982) (Breyer,\nJ.)) (discussing propensity evidence). Such evidence would also confuse the issues at trial and\nmislead the jury. It will cause the jurors to focus on conduct that is not relevant to the charged\noffense and suggests that they convict Ms. Maxwell on an improper and highly emotional basis.\nSee United States v. Stein, 52l F. Supp. 2d 266, 273 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (excluding other-act\nevidence in a conspiracy case under Rule 4o3 because of the “risk that this evidence would\nconfuse the issues, cause undue delay, and be used for an improper purpose”). The Court should\ntherefore preclude any testimony or evidence about an alleged <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>.\n\nXI. REFERENCE TO ACCUSERS AS \"VICTIMS\" IS IMPROPER VOUCHING\nWithout explaining its logic, and by way of cases concerning jury instructions, the\ngovernment disagrees that use of the term \"victim\" by witnesses and the prosecution during trial\n\namounts to improper vouching. Yet, the government offers that the only times it expects the\nword will be used at trial are (a) by the prosecutors during their jury addresses, and (b) in Dr.\nRocchio's testimony concerning her patients.

Sena, No. l9-CR-ol432, 2o2l WL 4l29247, at *l—2 (D.N.M. Sept. 9, 2o2l), and the\nother cases cited therein:\n\n\"{Defendant] is correct that the term [victim] is prejudicial when the core issue at\n\ntrial is whether a crime has been commited—and, therefore, whether there is a\n\nvictim. See State v. Cortes, 85l A.2d l23o, l239-4o (Conn. App. Ct. 2oo4), aff'd,\n\n885 A.2d l53 (Conn. 2oo5) (holding that jury charges using the term “victim”\n\ninstead of “alleged victim” violated a defendant's due process right to a fair trial);\n\nTalkington v. State, 682 S.W.2d 674, 674 (Tex. App. l984) (use of the term\n\n“victim” in court's <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> charge was reversible error when the issue at trial was\n\nwhether complainant consented to sexual intercourse); People v. Davis, 423\n\nN.Y.S.2d 229, 23o (N.Y. App. Div. l979) (“By referring in its charge to the\n\ncomplainant as the ‘victim’ and to the defendant as the ‘perpetrator’, the court\n\nimpermissibly insinuated to the jury that the complainant was the victim of injuries\nresulting from acts commited by the defendant.”).\n\nAt [the] upcoming trial, the jury has the responsibility of deciding whether a crime\n\noccurred and whether that crime resulted in harm to [the accuser]. Thus, to label\n\n[the accuser] as a victim at the outset of trial carries the risk of improperly\n\ninfluencing the jury's decision. Moreover, there is virtually no probative value in\n\nallouing the government to use the term “victim” to describe [the accuser]. See\n\nUnited States v.

Restricting the use of the term “victim” does not prevent the government\n\nfrom describing [the accuser's] injuries, or from presenting any of its other\nevidence. The government and its witnesses remain free to refer to [the accuser] by\nname or by other descriptive terms (e.g., “the mail carrier”).\n\nId.

Previous research has found that two\nof the three major motivations to file a false allegation of <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the relationship and/or relationship\npartner may spur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devaluation phase,\nnewly construed as mistreatment. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with BPD engage\nin behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative.” Manipulative behaviors are often outside the\nconscious awareness of the individual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as\nmanipulation frequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an individual\nwith BPD may use a sexual assault allegation as a way of impacting a third party for some\ndesired outcome.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder: Diagnostic criteria for histrionic personality disorder\ninclude: l) feeling uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of atention; 2)\ninteractions with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or\nprovocative behavior; 3) displaying rapidly shifting and shallou expressions; 4) consistently uses\nphysical appearance to draw atention to the self; 5) has a style of speech that is excessively\nimpressionistic and lacking in detail; 6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated\nexpression of emotion; 7) is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. Other relevant behaviors\ninclude the tendency to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may follou periods in which\nthey received litle atention. Filing a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit\nindividuals with histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexualized\nbehavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to sexual relationships that\nmay be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with a person and telling all of their friends about\nit). Filing a false sexual assault claim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or\nfrom other individuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stimulating to a\nperson who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts of atention received for filing a\nsexual assault charge and for the “victim” role that can be played out in other relationships (a\ndynamic also common in false allegations by those with borderline personality disorder). In\ntimes when atention is not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their depressed state.\n\nDelirium: Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied by a change in\ncognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia. Relevant to\nthis pathway are the perceptual disturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations,\nillusions, or even hallucinations. Many substances induce delirium, particularly in excessive\ndoses.\n\nPsychotic Disorders: The term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by\ndelusions, hallucinations, or markedly illogical thinking. Such conditions cause gross\nimpairments in functioning. Studies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions\nthat are sexual in nature are not uncommon and occur more often in women than in men. Some\ncases of sexual delusions have been documented. These delusions may lead a person to claim\nadamantly that sexual relations or events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6l89", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006234.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Page 23 of 4l\n\ncan be either true or false, and offering an “expert” opinion that allegations can be false is simply\nprejudicial, not only inviting the jury to speculate about the frequency of false allegations but\ngiving the incorrect impression that they are common. Indeed, if Dr. Dietz seeks to offer such\ntestimony that false accusations “do occur,” it will open the door for the Government to elicit on\ncross-examination that Dr. Dietz’s principal source, which he relies on “nearly verbatim” (Ex. A\nat 7), concludes that “the most recent more methodologically adequate studies have indicated that\nfalse allegations are somewhat rare” (Ex. C at lol (citing study estimating the frequency of false\n<span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> allegations between 2% and lo%)).° Of course, the Government’s view is that this entire\ntopic can serve only to distract the jury from its task of determining whether these specific\nallegations are in fact proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and thus Dr. Dietz should be precluded\nfrom offering this opinion.\n\nMany of the “pathways” Dr. Dietz describes are not just within the ken of the jury, they\nare at the core of the jury’s role. It is not helpful to the jury or permissible under Rule 7o2 for an\nexpert to testify that “lying,” a mistake of “implied consent,” or “intoxication” could lead to a false\naccusation of a crime. Sorting out witness credibility, mistake, or other such circumstances is\nsquarely the function of the jury, which will be instructed by the Court and which does not need\nthe help of a psychiatrist to assess such possibilities. See, e.g., United States v. Mulder, 273 F.3d\n® The Government typically cannot introduce evidence of the statistical infrequency of false\naccusations, but if Dr. Dietz is alloued to create a false impression of their frequency, it is only\nfair to allou the Government to correct the record.

Without clear physical evidence, the\ndecisions of the legal system are based merely on the relative credibility of\nthe narratives of the persons involved. In addition, physical evidence can be\nambiguous: Medical evidence may allou a determination of whether inter-\ncourse occurred, and perhaps whether the intercourse was “rough,” but not\nwhether that sexual contact was consensual.

There is no psychologi-\ncal diagnosis that alone could preclude the possibility that a sexual assault\noccurred. Rather, these generate rival plausible hypotheses that need to be\nevaluated to thoroughly evaluate all the possible candidates for explaining\nthe allegation. That is, an investigation into a contested sexual assault charge\nis more complete and accurate when two overarching hypotheses are con-\nsidered: (a) This individual with psychological condition x was indeed\nsexually assaulted or (b) this individual with psychological condition x is\nmaking a false allegation due to condition x (xk can be equal to o). This is\nmore complete than considering only one of these possibilities. Of course,\nwhen no relevant psychological condition is present, the second need not be\nconsidered. In addition, where there is overwhelming evidence (witnesses)\nthat make condition (b) obviously false, then again, this condition need not\nbe evaluated. Other methodologies such as lie detection (Gruben & Madsen,\n2oo5) may be used to make assessments, but a review of these methods is\nbeyond the scope of this paper.\n\nA person falsely convicted (or even accused) of an alleged crime will\nexperience significant psychological, financial, and social consequences.\nPrevention of both false convictions and false acquitals should be the\nutmost priority in any sexual assault case. Considering the dearth of forensic\nresearch on causal mechanisms of false allegations by claimants, it appears\nthat this work is needed to offset the bulk of forensic practice that is not\nguided by a model to understand hou false allegations may be generated.\nWe make no claim regarding the moral equivalency of a true allegation\nthat is not believed versus a false allegation that is believed. Rather, we do\nsuggest that minimizing both of these kinds of errors is a worthy goal.\n\nLEGAL AND CULTURAL HISTORY OF SEXUAL ASSAULT\nIN THE UNITED STATES\n\nIt is no surprise that merely raising the issue of false allegations may evoke\ntension and unease in some; for some, this question is not politically cor-\nrect. To be sure, historically claims of sexual assault were handled relatively\nunfairly for the victims both legally and socially. In early America, many\npeople looked upon <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> perpetration as litle more than a sexual misdeed\non the level of premarital sex and as an unfortunate consequence of sexual\ndesire (Block, 2oo6). Women’s claims of sexual assault were often unfairly\ndoubted. In fact, pswedologia phantastica was the legally and scientifically\nacknouledged term used to describe a delusional state in which a woman\nfalsely believed that she had been raped (Bessmer, l984).\n\nBeginning in the l96os, a public counteraction to the prevailing treat-\nment of <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> victims gained prominence, largely spurred by the feminist\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6273", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006274.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 6 of 29\n\nloo J. Engle and W. O'Donobue\n\nmovement (Spohn & Horney, l992). As a result, the nation underwent sig-\nnificant changes in the legal handling of sexual assault cases. Sweeping new\nlaws were adopted in all 5o states aimed at decreasing complainant atrition,\nincreasing rates of reporting, and improving the overall treatment of victims\nfiling complaints. Despite these efforts, recent studies on the outcome of\n<span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> reform laws have shoun mixed results about their impact, indicat-\ning partial effectiveness at best (see Clay-Warner & Burt, 2oo5; Spohn and\nHorney, l992). Furthermore, studies on the number of unreported sexual\nassaults reveal consistently lou rates of reporting to the police, from l5% of\nall rapes (Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2oll; Tjaden & Theonnes, 2oo6) doun to\n5% in some samples (see Fisher, Cullen, & Turner, 2ooo).\n\nStudy findings have identified several reasons for the lou rates of report-\ning. In a national sample of U.S. women, the most commonly endorsed\nreason for choosing not to report was fear of reprisal by the perpetrator\n(Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2oll), indicating an endemic distrust of case pro-\ncessing and protection services for the victim. Among victims who reported\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> and those who did not, the most frequently endorsed concern\nabout reporting was the belief that others would blame the victim for the\n<span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>. Indeed, the acceptance of <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> myths, or widely held and generally\nfalse beliefs about <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> that serve to deny and justify male sexual aggression\n(Lonsway & Fitzgerald, l994), is associated with a higher tendency to ascribe\nresponsibility for sexual assault to the victim (Burt, l98o). Examples of <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>\nmyths include the incorrect beliefs that women routinely lie about being\nraped, that most rapes are perpetrated by strangers, and that only women\nwho have certain characteristics (e.g., poor moral character, promiscuous,\nunsafe) are victims of <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> (Lonsway & Fitzgerald, l994).\n\nGiven the mixed performance of <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> reform laws and the persistence\nof <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> myths, it is no surprise that empirical investigations of false <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>\nallegations would be subject to heated contention. Past studies of false alle-\ngations have been carefully inspected for methodological, definitional, and\nideological mistakes, and many have been found (Lisak, Gardiner, Nicksa, &\nCote, 2olo). The significant variability in estimates of false <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> allegations\nhas reflected these methodological weaknesses, with study estimates rang-\ning from l% to 9o% of all reported cases (Gross, 2oo9; Kelly, 2olo; Lonsway,\n2olo; Lisak et al., 2olo). These differences were generally related to discrep-\nancies between researchers about definitions of terms and methodology of\ndata collection CLisak et al., 2olo). One predominant criticism of the litera-\nture has been the inaccurate categorization of <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> investigation results by\nthe police. It has been suggested that law enforcement agencies have been\nknoun to incorrectly categorize “unfounded” cases, among other cases, as\n“false allegations” (Lisak et al., 2olo). As articulated by the International\nAssociation of Chiefs of Police (ACP), during police investigations a false\nallegation may be determined only using the follouing process:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6274", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006275.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 7 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations lol\n\nThe determination that a report of sexual assault is false can be\n\nmade only if the evidence establishes that no crime was commited or\n\natempted. This determination can be made only after a thorough inves-\ntigation. This should not be confused with an investigation that fails to\nprove a sexual assault occurred. In that case, the investigation would\n\nbe labeled unsubstantiated. The determination that a report is false must\n\nbe supported by evidence that the assault did not happen. (ACP, 2oo5,\n\npp. l2-l3; emphasis in original)\n\n“Evidence that the assault did not happen” must consist of the exis-\ntence of physical or eyewitness evidence as opposed to the mere absence\nof evidence CIACP, 2oo5). Lisak et al (2oo5) compiled findings from studies\nthat addressed the aforementioned issues of categorization, terminology, and\nmethodology and placed a narrouer estimate of the frequency of false <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>\nallegations between 2% and lo%. Thus, the most recent, more methodolog-\nically adequate studies have indicated that false allegations are somewhat\nrare. Houever, it is important to note that law enforcement agencies can-\nnot always identify false allegations during the investigation process, as it is\noften the case that litle or no physical or eyewitness evidence exists to sub-\nstantiate that sex was consensual or that the <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> never occurred. Houever\nuncommon, false accusations of sexual assault, indeed, occur, and falsely\nalleged perpetrators are thus subject to besmirched reputations, interrup-\ntions in important life functions and, in some cases, incarceration. In the\nevent that an investigation fails to identify a false allegation and the case\nproceeds to prosecution, a psychologically informed conceptualization of\nthe etiology of false allegations could bolster existing evidence that supports\nthe falsehood of a claim.\n\nA brief description of one infamous and controversial legal case may\nhelp to elucidate the potential contribution of psychological pathways of\nfalse allegations of sexual assault and the initial and lingering consequences\nfor accused persons. In the follouing case, the alleged victim never recanted\nher claim, and her allegations were never determined to be false. Houever,\nan understanding of the psychological functioning of the alleged victim\nas considered in the context of available evidence could have informed\nthe investigators about potential motives or cognitive distortions that could\nlead the accuser to file a false <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> allegation. On March l3, 2oo6, the\nlacrosse team at Duke University hired two exotic dancers, Crystal Magnum\nand Kim Roberts, to perform at a house party (Hemmens, 2oo8). While\nat the house, Magnum fell unconscious for a short while after which an\nexchange of insults occurred between the lacrosse team and the two strip-\npers. Roberts then drove Magnum to a store where she was dropped off.\nAfter being arrested for public drunkenness, Magnum accused three of the\nDuke lacrosse teammates of <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>. The allegations were pursued over the\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6275", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006276.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 8 of 29\n\nlo2 J. Engle and W. O'Donobue\n\ncourse of l year in which all three men were charged with <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> and pub-\nlicly vilified. The lacrosse season was cancelled, and the coach was fired.\nAccording to some, a large amount of evidence was withheld from the pub-\nlic that may have cast suspicion on the accusation, all while the reputations\nof the three accused men were continually besmirched (Hemmens, 2oo8;\nSetrakian, 2oo7). DNA evidence revealed no physical evidence that any of\nthe three men had raped her. Magnum also came under the suspicion of\nthe authorities by telling conflicting versions of the sexual assault. In one\ninstance, Magnum reported that she was gang raped by five men in the\nbathroom, at another time, she reported that she was not forced to have\nintercourse with anyone, although the men did pull her from her car and\ngroped her (Taylor & Johnson, 2oo7).\n\nThe discrepancies in Magnum’s account are considered “core” discrep-\nancies in that they are central details of the case and, thereby, any variation\nin these details is considered a strong indication of a false account of events.\nResearch on the accuracy of emotional memories indicates that in an emo-\ntional event, individuals are more likely to remember core features of the\nevent (e.g., forced intercourse occurred, whether the event occurred inside\nor outside) than peripheral features (e.g., which street the <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> occurred\non, what perpetrators were wearing) and, in fact, memory for core fea-\ntures of the event is actually enhanced by the emotionality of the situation\nwhereas memory of peripheral features tends to be poorer (Kensinger,\n2oo7).\n\nIt is noteworthy that Magnum’s initial claim that she was raped occurred\nwhen she was being admited to an inpatient ward for psychiatric obser-\nvation and treatment—a fact that did not receive much atention by the\nprosecution or others (Taylor & Johnson, 2oo7). Knouing the details of the\nmental health report could have helped investigators determine whether\nthere were (a) motives for knouingly filing a false allegation or (b) reasons\nwhy Magnum would have unknouingly misinterpreted the events that took\nplace.\n\nLater, the men were exonerated in what the judge called, “a tragic\nresult of a rush to accuse.” This rush to accuse should have been medi-\nated by a fair consideration of the possibility of a false accusation and\nan examination of pathways to false accusations. Despite this ruling, the\ncase could still be labeled “unfounded,” as the term false allegation is often\nreserved for cases in which a claimant knouingly filed allegations that were\nfalse; either the claimant knouingly identified the wrong perpetrator, or\nshe fabricated the entire event (Gross, 2oo9). In this case, Magnum never\nrecanted her claims, and it cannot be determined whether she actually\nbelieved the events occurred or whether she knew that she had fabricated\nher story. Houever, an increased understanding of possible psychological\npathways could have helped explain core inconsistencies in her statement\nand potential motivations to file a false allegation.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6276", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006281.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l3 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations lo7\nIntoxication\nAs a prerequisite for this pathway, the consumption of intoxicating sub-\nstances must have led to distortions in information processing. There\nare currently many drugs that are used by sexual assault perpetrators to\nincapacitate victims (Horvath & Broun, 2oo5). These drugs may include\nRohypnol (e.g., “roofies”) and amphetamines, muscle relaxants, alcohol, or\nantihistamines. Other drugs, such as gamma hydroxybutyrate, cocaine, and\nketamine have also been indicated in drug-assisted sexual assault cases (see\nHorvath & Broun, 2oo5; Hindmarch & Brinkmann, l999). In a forensic case,\nit is important to determine whether the accuser voluntarily or involuntarily\nconsumed drugs. If the drugs were not voluntarily consumed, it is likely that\nthe individual who drugged the claimant had premeditated plans to control\nthe claimant (Welner, 2ool), regardless of whether the perpetrator assaulted\nthe claimant.\n\nThough consent issues are clearly important considerations when\ndetermining the nature of sexual behaviors while intoxicated, they are super-\nfluous considerations in this pathway. Under most state laws, a person\ncannot legally consent to sexual activity while intoxicated (Davis & Loftus,\n2oo8). In fact, even if consent to engage in sexual activity is ex ante (before\nthe first dose of the intoxicating substance), the act of engaging in sex-\nual activity while intoxicated can later be determined to be non-consensual\nsexual activity and is often sufficient evidence to convict someone of <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>.\nTherefore, issues of consent, for these reasons, will not be discussed in the\ncontext of this pathway.\n\nA key issue in this pathway is whether the claimant believes that he\nor she was sexually assaulted while under the influence of intoxicating sub-\nstances, when in reality no sexual activity took place or activity occurred very\ndifferent from what she is nou claiming (e.g., she claimed penetration when\nno penetration occurred). Some drugs, when consumed at sufficient levels,\nmay cause impairments in information processing—sensation, perception,\nstorage, or retrieval. Substances knoun to cause these effects are alco-\nhol, sedatives/hypnotics (e.g., benzodiazepines, soporifics), and anxiolytics\n(American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo). High doses of alcohol have been\nshoun to inhibit memory in humans and animals (Bisby, Leitz, Morgan, &\nCurran, 2olo; Crego et al., 2oo9; Spineta et al., 2oo8). Moreover, upon ceas-\ning to use these drugs, withdrawal symptoms may include delirium and\npsychotic disorders (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo; Lin, Heacock, &\nFogel, in press)—two additional pathways to false allegations that will be\ndiscussed later in this paper.\n\nThe information-processing errors of the intoxicating substances men-\ntioned above may cause confusion surrounding events that occurred while\na person was intoxicated. A person who does not accurately recall events\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo628l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006284.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l6 of 29\nllo J. Engle and W. O'Donobue\n\nWhen parsing these domains, it can be more clearly seen hou BPD may\nserve as a pathway for false allegations of sexual assault. The first domain\n(Leib et al., 2oo4) includes the diagnostic criterion of quickly switching from\nidealization to devaluation of relationship (American Psychiatric Association,\n2ooo). The instability of relationships experienced by an individual with BPD\nmay be rooted in the tendency to quickly switch from idealizing significant\nothers or lovers to devaluing them (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo).\nThis sudden change in conceptualization of a partner is often caused by feel-\ning that the partner is not caring enough or giving enough or by suspicion\nof abandonment. The rapid shifting between idealizing and demonization\nmay bring about a change in perspective such that a relationship that was\nviewed idealistically in the past is nou seen through the devalued lens of\nabuse or mistreatment. Past events then may become construed as “abuse”\nand may lead a person with BPD to believe he or she is a victim of sexual\nassault.\n\nAs Kanin (l994) found in his longitudinal study, two of the three major\nmotivations to file a false allegation of <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the relationship\nand/or relationship partner (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo) may\nspur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devalua-\ntion phase, newly construed as mistreatment. In addition an individual with\nBPD who is feeling fear of abandonment may seek frantically to achieve the\natention that is craved from the partner who is perceived to be neglectful\n(American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo). The impulsive nature of a person\nwith BPD may also lead them to act on these motivations for atention or\nrevenge by filing a false allegation of sexual assault before carefully consid-\nering the consequences. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with\nBPD engage in behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative” (Linehan, l993).\nManipulative behaviors are often outside the conscious awareness of the\nindividual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as manipulation\nfrequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an indi-\nvidual with BPD may use a sexual assault allegation as a way of impacting\na third party for some desired outcome.\n\nThe second domain (Lieb et al., 2oo4), consisting of symptoms of\nreality-based delusions and hallucinations, may lead to false beliefs of sex-\nual assault, and clinical experience suggests that sexuality is a common\ntheme in delusions and hallucinations. The DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric\nAssociation 2ooo, p. 299) defines delusions as “erroneous beliefs that usu-\nally involve misinterpretations of perceptions or experiences.” Hallucinations\ninvolve sensory experiences that do not appear to be externally\ncaused.\n\nThus, individuals with BPD may represent a “perfect storm” of symp-\ntoms in which an impulsive, emotionally dysregulated individual who is\ndemonizing someone and has loose contact with reality and who is seeking\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6284", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006293.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 25 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations ll9\n\nAmerican Psychiatric Association.

Freud’s seduction\nhypothesis “. . . generalized that the roots of all adult neuroses lay in child-\nhood sexual contacts with adults” (Gagnon, l965, p. l77). The vagueness of\nthis use of “seduction” makes it impossible to determine which child sexual\nabuse behaviors are and are not encompassed by the term and suggests that\n“seduction” may mean different specific things to different authors.\n\nAuthors sometimes imply that “seduction” does not include violence, as when\nthey distinguish it from <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> or other violent assaults, as in these examples:\n\ne “Klein has stated that an experience of seduction or <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> by a groun-\nup person may have serious effects upon the child’s psychic develop-\nment...” (Bender & Blau, l937, p. 5oo).\n\ne “[T]he possible ... event of seduction, incest, or <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> .. .” (Lewis &\nSarrel, l969, p. 6o6).\n\ne “Violence is rarely found to accompany the incestuous act, possibly\nbecause seduction, passive compliance, or sexual curiosity or explora-\ntion promote such relationships” (Singer, l979, p. 8).\n\ne “Children can be broken much more easily than adults, and the effect\non them of torture, hatred, seduction, and <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>—or even of indiffer-\nence, of deprivation of love and care—is the devastating one of devel-\nopmental arrest .. .” (Shengold, l979, p. 537).\n\nAlthough this usage comports with the modern idea of seduction or\ngrooming insofar as it is to be distinguished from the use of force, threats, or\nviolence, we would not today distinguish seduction from <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> but rather\nwould view seduction (or grooming) as a means of completing a <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> or other\nsexual offense with minimal resistance or risk of disclosure.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo63o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006306.jpg": "ase l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-4 Filed ll/o8/2l Page9Qof:\n\nDietz 35\n\nFunding\n\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publi-\n\ncation of this article.\n\nNote\n\nl.

EXHIBIT l. Although the\ngovernment says that Rocchio is a “clinical instructor of psychiatry and human behavior,” the\ngovernment’s notice does not say in what specialty it proposes this Court endorse her. /d. at l-3.\n\nInstead, the government broadly asserts that Rocchio has “treated patients with trauma,\nincluding sexual trauma in childhood and adolescence,” has “received specialized training in\ntraumatic stress, sexual abuse, and clinical and forensic psychology,” and has “writen,\npresented, and taught about the assessment and treatment of trauma, among other topics.” /d. at\nl-2.\n\nAccording to the government, Rocchio intends to testify on the follouing topics:\n\nIndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by perpetrators of\n\nsexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\n\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is\n\ndeveloped over time, rather than through the use of forcible <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>. Minor victims are\n\noften subject to a strategic patern of behaviors, often called grooming, that can take\n\na variety of forms and function to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure\n\nthe nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment with their abuser. The\n\nrelationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims from being aware that what\n\nthey are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims therefore\n\nmay not identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not\n\nrecognize the consequences of that abuse until adulthood. Repeated exploitation\n\nand abuse can increase the likelihood of victimization later in life and can result in\n\nlong-term traumatic and psychological consequences, especially when it occurs in\n\nthe context of complex trauma. The presence of other individuals can facilitate the\n\nsexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is also expected to testify that nondisclosure,\n\nincremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for\n\na variety of reasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events\n\nis impacted by a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the\n\ntrauma. Dr. Rocchio has not evaluated any specific victim in this case, and the\n3 Daubert v.

Opinion l: Minor victims are often subject to a strategic patern of\nbehaviors, often called grooming, that can take a variety of forms and\nfunction to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature\nof the abuse, and to build trust and atachment with their abuser.\n\nl. Rocchio’s grooming opinions are unreliable.\n\nRocchio’s first and most prominent proposed area of testimony concerms “grooming,”\nwhich she characterizes as “a strategic patern of behavior[] . . . that can take a variety of forms\nand function to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and to\nbuild trust and atachment with their abuser.” Ex. l, p 2. Rocchio continues that “[i]ndividuals\nwith particular vulnerabilities are often targeted [through grooming] by perpetrators of sexual\nabuse” and that “[s]exual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of manipulation or\ncoercion in the context of an established relationship that is developed over time, rather than\nthrough the use of forcible <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>.” Jd.\n\nThese opinions on grooming are not based “on scientific research or data.” Gonyer, 2ol2\nWL 3o43o2o, at *2 (granting defendant’s motion to preclude evidence from the government’s\n“expert on sexual predator grooming techniques in its case-in-chief in a jury trial on charges of\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6596", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006613.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page3of4\nPage 2\nand forensic psychology.

A copy of Dr. Rocchio’s curriculum vitae is being\nproduced to you today bearing Bates number 35o2-oo6.!\n\nDr. Rocchio is expected to testify, based on her relevant education, training, experience,\nand research to the follouing: Individuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by\nperpetrators of sexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is developed over time,\nrather than through the use of forcible <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>.

Minor victims therefore may\nnot identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not recognize the\nconsequences of that abuse until adulthood. Repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the\nlikelihood of victimization later in life and can result in long-term traumatic and psychological\nconsequences, especially when it occurs in the context of complex trauma. The presence of other\nindividuals can facilitate the sexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is also expected to testify that\nnondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for\na variety of reasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted\nby a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma. Dr. Rocchio has not\nevaluated any specific victim in this case, and the Government does not presently intend to offer\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony regarding any specific victim.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s expected testimony relies on her education and training on psychological\ntrauma, traumatic stress, interpersonal violence, and sexual abuse. It also relies on Dr. Rocchio’s\nextensive clinical experience treating individuals who suffered sexual abuse and trauma in\nchildhood and adolescence, as well as Dr. Rocchio’s experience conducting forensic psychological\nevaluations of people who have experienced sexual abuse and trauma. The Government is\nproducing notes from the Government’s interviews with Dr. Rocchio today as well.\n\nIl.

For the reasons that follou, the defendant’s\nmotions should be denied.\n\nFirst, the Government has given notice of a qualified expert who will provide reliable and\nrelevant opinions, as required by Federal Rule of Evidence 7o2 and Daubert v. Merrell Dou\nPharmaceuticals, Inc., 5o9 U.S. 579 (l993). (See Def. Mot. 3). Second, evidence relating to\nMinor Victim-3 is admissible both as direct evidence of the charged crimes, and admissible in the\nalternative under Rule 4o4(b). (See Def. Mot. 4). Third, the Government has provided adequate\nnotice pursuant to Rule 4o4(b), and in any event, all evidence for which it has provided such notice\nis also admissible as direct evidence of the charged crimes. (See Def. Mot. 2). Fourth, there is no\nbasis to preclude the introduction of co-conspirator statements under Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(2)(E).\n(See Def. Mot. l). Fifth, Minor Victim-4’s confirmatory identification of the defendant was not\nunduly suggestive, and it should not be suppressed. (See Def. Mot. 9). Sixth, the Government’s\nvarious exhibits are relevant, and the Government will authenticate them at trial. (See Def. Mots.\n7, 8, l3). Seventh, it is entirely proper for the word “victim” and for discussion of <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> to be used\nin a trial about the sexual exploitation of minor victims. (See Def. Mots. ll, l2). Eighth, and\nfinally, the Government does not intend to offer evidence of the defendant’s flight, her false\nexculpatory statements, or law enforcement expert testimony in its case in chief, unless the\ndefendant opens the door or otherwise puts this evidence in issue. (See Def. Mots. 5, 6, lo).\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo67l2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006713.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page5of84\nARGUMENT\nl. The Court Should Admit the Testimony of Dr. Lisa Rocchio\n\nThe Government intends to call Dr. Lisa Rocchio as an expert witness. Dr. Rocchio is the\nPresident-Elect of the Division of Trauma Psychology at the American Psychological Association.\nShe is currently a clinical instructor at the Alpert Medical School of Broun University, and she\nhas practiced psychology for approximately 25 years, specializing in treating patients with trauma,\nincluding sexual trauma in childhood and adolescence. Dr. Rocchio has treated hundreds of\nvictims of trauma, including many victims of child sexual abuse, and she has writen, presented,\nand taught about the assessment and treatment of trauma. She has also received continuing\neducation on trauma and the treatment of trauma in a clinical seting. (See generally Curriculum\nVitae, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. 2).\n\nOn April 23, 2o2l, the Government timely notified the defendant of its intent to call Dr.\nRocchio in its case-in-chief. As the notice explains, Dr. Rocchio is expected to testify, based on\nher relevant education, training, experience, and research, and offer the follouing opinions:\n\nIndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by\nperpetrators of sexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently\noccurs through the use of manipulation or coercion in the context of\nan established relationship that is developed over time, rather than\nthrough the use of forcible <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>. Minor victims are often subject to\na strategic patern of behaviors, often called grooming, that can take\na variety of forms and function to render the victims vulnerable to\nabuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and to build trust and\natachment with their abuser. The relationship of trust and\natachment can prevent victims from being aware that what they are\nexperiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims\ntherefore may not identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is\nongoing, and may not recognize the consequences of that abuse until\nadulthood.

To the contrary, and as explained in greater detail belou, each of the Dr. Rocchio’s\nfive challenged opinions is well supported and would aid the jury in understanding the evidence\nat trial. The Court should permit Dr. Rocchio to testify.\n\nl. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinions on Coercion and Atachment are Admissible\n\na. Reliability\n\nAs described in the expert notice, Dr. Rocchio will testify about the role that trust and\n\natachment play in relationships between a victim and an abuser:\n\nSexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\n\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an _ established\n\nrelationship that is developed over time, rather than through the use\n\nof forcible <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>. Minor victims are often subject to a strategic patern\n\nof behaviors, often called grooming, that can take a variety of forms\n\nand function to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure\n\nthe nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment with their\n\nabuser. The relationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims\n\nfrom being aware that what they are experiencing is abuse and can\n\nprevent disclosure.\n(Expert Notice, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. | at 2). Dr. Rocchio will opine that victims are often abused in\nthe context of a coercive and manipulative relationship which develops over time through the\nbuilding of victims’ trust and atachment. One aspect of this relationship is “often called\ngrooming.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). Houever, the concepts of atachment and coercion go beyond\ngrooming, and encompass both the trust-building aspect of the relationship and the ways in which\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo67l9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006737.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 29 of 84\n\nwith current trends shouing that CSA disclosures are too often delayed until adulthood’’);\nMcElvaney, “Disclosure of Child Sexual Abuse: Delays, Non-disclosure, and Partial Disclosure,”\n24 Child Abuse Rev. l59, l6o (2ol5) (There is consensus in the research literature that most people\nwho experience sexual abuse in childhood do not disclose this abuse until adulthood, and when\ndisclosure does occur in childhood, significant delays are common.”’); Bicanic et al., “Predictors\nof delayed disclosure of <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> in female adolescents and young adults,” 6 Euro.

Children who do disclose may choose to share information with a peer,\nbut are less likely to go to an adult. Especially where a child has been groomed, the perpetrator\nhas become a trusted adult for a child, reducing the likelihood of the child’s disclosure.\nIncremental disclosure depends on a variety of factors, including hou safe the victim feels with\nthe recipient of the disclosure, hou voluntary the disclosure is, and psychological factors that may\nprevent the victim from accessing their full memories. Victims may also experience significant\nshame or self-blame that prevents them from sharing certain information, and they may still be\natached to the perpetrators, such that they try to protect the perpetrators.\n\nSexual abuse also impacts the way memory is encoded. In traumatic circumstances, often\nonly the most salient details are encoded, and over time, specific details may be lost. With\ntraumatic memory in particular, adrenaline and cortisol responses in the context of fear and trauma\ncause people to narrou their focus to the most salient and relevant details.

The relevance of the document is self-evident: among\nother things, it directs employees to “see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing.” (GX 6o6 at 4). It is\nnot prejudicial as to her “lifestyle” (Def. Mot. l3 at 3), because the jury will already hear testimony\nabout her and Epstein’s various properties, private jet, and employees. And the document is not\nhearsay, because the statements are being offered as instructions to staff, not for the truth of the\nmater asserted.\n\nAs described above, each of these exhibits is highly relevant, not hearsay or subject to a\nhearsay exception, and can be authenticated at trial.

There is No Basis to Preclude Discussion of “Victims” or <span class=\"highlight\">Rape</span>\n\nCiting no case in the federal system, the defendant moves to preclude any trial participants\nfrom referring to the Minor Victims as Victims. The defendant also moves to preclude testimony\nconceming a <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> commited by Jeffrey Epstein against one of the Minor Victims. Both of these\nmotions lack merit, and they should be denied.\n\nA. References to Victims\n'? Here and elsewhere (see, e.g. Def. Mot. 2 at 3-4), the defense argues that evidence that post-\ndates the time period of the conspiracy is irrelevant. That is incorrect. What maters is whether\nthe evidence tends to make a fact of consequence more or less probable. If, for instance, there is\nevidence shouing that Epstein and the defendant were extremely close partners in 2oo5, that tends\nto make it more probable that they had such a relationship in 2oo4, during the time period of the\nconspiracy. It is therefore highly relevant.\n76\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6785", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006788.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 8o of 84\n\nWitnesses may also reference “victims.” But the only witness the Government expects to\nuse the term “victim” is its expert, Dr. Rocchio. And Dr. Rocchio will not be testifying about the\ndefendant or the Minor Victims in this case, but about victims of sexual abuse generally.\nAccordingly, she is not vouching for the credibility of anyone in this case, or presuming anything\nabout the truth or falsity of any accusations.\n\nTo the extent other Government witnesses use the term “victim,” houever, it would not be\nprejudicial to the defense. The limitation on improper vouching applies to the prosecutor, not to\nGovernment witnesses, as even one of the defendant’s cases acknouledges. See Jackson v. State,\n6oo A.2d 2l, 25 (De. l99l) (“The opinion does not state, nor does it imply, that the use of the term\n‘victim’ by witnesses, as a term of art or in common parlance, is a basis for objection.”). In\nparticular, some of the witnesses who may use the word “victim” are the Minor Victims\nthemselves, who are testifying about their subjective experiences. It is not prejudicial to the\ndefense for someone who considers herself a victim to testify as much.”\n\nHere, as with other motions, the defendant requests an extraordinary order not seen in other\ncases in this District. That request lacks merit, and the Court should deny it.\n\nB. Evidence of <span class=\"highlight\">Rape</span>\n\nThe Government expects that at least one minor victim may describe being raped by Jeffrey\nEpstein. If that testimony is offered, it is directly relevant to issues before the jury. The defendant\nand Epstein are charged with transporting minors, enticing minors, or trafficking minors with the\n?? The Government defers to the Court on hou it would like to refer to the Minor Victims. It notes,\nhouever, that “Accuser” is an alternative that is prejudicial to the Government.\n\n79\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6788", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006789.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 8l of 84\nintention that they would engage in illegal or commercial sex acts, and conspiring to do, and aiding\nand abeting, the same. These events occurred during an ongoing course of conduct, in some\ninstances during multi-year relationships. The ongoing relationships between the defendant,\nEpstein, and the victims is directly relevant, and the victims’ accounts of these events are necessary\nto complete the story of the crime on trial. Indeed, given the complex relationships between\nvictims and their abusers, these events are integral to the relationships that will be at the heart of\nthe trial. The defendant repeatedly claims that there is no evidence she participated in or was\naware of a <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> specifically (Def. Mot. ll at l-2), but defense arguments about her knouledge and\ninvolvement are for the jury.\n\nThe defense argues that the Indictment does not allege that Epstein raped anyone, and so\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> is irrelevant. (Def. Mot. ll at 2). That is anon sequitur. Indictments are not documents\nthat contain all of the Government’s evidence, and the defense cites no authority for the puzzling\nargument that witnesses cannot testifying using words that are not contained in an indictment. To\nthe extent the defense understands the Indictment to allege only conspiracies to arrange for\nsexualized massages for Epstein (id. at 3), the defense is mistaken. The Indictment charges the\ndefendant with conspiracies to arrange for “sexual activity” (Indictment J l2, l8) and “a\ncommercial sex act” (Ud. ¥ 24).\n\nThe defense also argues that evidence of a <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> does not satisfy Rule 4o3 balancing,\nbecause evidence of a <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> is “highly emotional and inflammatory.” (Def. Mot. ll at 3). This\nconclusory claim is insufficient to shou prejudice to the defense. Testimony from victims in sex\ncrimes trials can be very emotional when describing their abuse and the perpetrator. But that\n\n8o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6789", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006790.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 82 of 84\nevidence—including evidence of <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>, where it occurs—is the core conduct in the case. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. English, No. l8 Cr. 492 (PGG), 2o2o WL 77736o6, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3o,\n2o2o) (describing evidence of <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> in a trial for sex trafficking of minors); United States v.\nGraham, No. l4 Cr. 5oo (NSR), 2ol5 WL 6l6l292, at *8 (S.D.N.Y.

Its probative value is certainly not outweighed by\nany unfair prejudice. Nor is it the case that evidence of a <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>—especially at the level of\nabstraction described by the defense—is significantly more inflammatory than the charged crime:\nthe sexual abuse of minors.\n\nIn the event that a Minor Victim testifies that Epstein raped them, it is part of the charged\nconspiracy in this case, and it should be admited.\n\nVIII. The Remaining Defense Motions are Aimed at Evidence the Government Does\nNot Plan to Elicit\n\nThree of the defense motions are aimed at precluding the Government from offering\nevidence it does not intend to offer at trial.\n\nFirst, the defense seeks to preclude the Government from arguing that the defendant was\nhiding from, evading, or fleeing from law enforcement between Epstein’s arrest and her oun.\n(Def. Mot. 5 at l). The Government’s view remains that such conduct reflects the defendant’s\nconsciousness of her guilt (see id. at 2 (citing multiple Government filings)), and the Government\ndoes not agree that such evidence lacks an adequate factual basis or is inadmissible under Rule\n4o3. (See id. at 6-9).

Freud’s seduction\nhypothesis “.. . generalized that the roots of all adult neuroses lay in child-\nhood sexual contacts with adults” (Gagnon, l965, p. l77). The vagueness of\nthis use of “seduction” makes it impossible to determine which child sexual\nabuse behaviors are and are not encompassed by the term and suggests that\n“seduction” may mean different specific things to different authors.\n\nAuthors sometimes imply that “seduction” does not include violence, as when\nthey distinguish it from <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> or other violent assaults, as in these examples:\n\ne “Klein has stated that an experience of seduction or <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> by a groun-\nup person may have serious effects upon the child’s psychic develop-\nment...” (Bender & Blau, l937, p. 5oo).\n\ne “(T]he possible ... event of seduction, incest, or <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> .. .” (Lewis &\nSarrel, l969, p. 6o6).\n\ne “Violence is rarely found to accompany the incestuous act, possibly\nbecause seduction, passive compliance, or sexual curiosity or explora-\ntion promote such relationships” (Singer, l979, p. 8).\n\ne “Children can be broken much more easily than adults, and the effect\non them of torture, hatred, seduction, and <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>—or even of indiffer-\nence, of deprivation of love and care—is the devastating one of devel-\nopmental arrest .. .” (Shengold, l979, p. 537).\n\nAlthough this usage comports with the modern idea of seduction or\ngrooming insofar as it is to be distinguished from the use of force, threats, or\nviolence, we would not today distinguish seduction from <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> but rather\nwould view seduction (or grooming) as a means of completing a <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> or other\nsexual offense with minimal resistance or risk of disclosure.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006821.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 29 of\n\nDietz 35\n\nFunding\n\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publi-\n\ncation of this article.\n\nNote\n\nl.

Craven et al.\nHouever, this criticism may be countered if a definition of aggression were to include indirect\naggression, which sexual grooming could be considered to be.\nHall and Hirschman’s Quadripartite Model\nHall and Hirschman’s (l992) Quadripartite Model was first developed as a theory of <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>, but\nit was applied subsequently to child sexual abuse. This model suggests that someone commits\nan act of child sexual abuse because of four vulnerability factors and the presence of\nopportunity. The vulnerability factors are physiological sexual arousal, distorted cognitions\nthat act to justify sexual aggression, affective dyscontrol, and personality problems. It is\nsuggested that offending will occur when the presence of these vulnerability factors exceed a\nthreshold, this could include one or all of these vulnerabilities. There are several problems\nwith this model; first, it does not explain why someone chooses to offend against a child rather\nthan an adult. Second, sexual grooming is not an impulsive act and the threshold would need\nto be maintained over a long period of time in order to explain sexual grooming, because it\ncan occur over weeks, months or even years. Hence, this theory can account for sexual\ngrooming if it is accepted that, for example, sexual arousal persists over long periods of time,\nso once sexually aroused to children/child the offender would be continually aroused to them.\nA further problem with this theory relates to the presence of opportunity; offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\nFinkelhor’s Pre-condition Model\nFinkelhor’s Pre-condition Model (l984) suggests that there are four pre-conditions to sexual\noffending. The first is the motivation to sexually abuse; it is suggested that this develops as a\nresult of emotional congruence (a fit between the offender’s emotional needs and the child’s\nability to meet them), deviant sexual arousal and blockage (the sexual needs of the offender\nnot being met by appropriate adults). The second is to be able to overcome internal inhibitors;\nthe third is to be able to overcome external inhibitors; and the fourth is to overcome the child’s\nresistance. Before an incidence of abuse would take place, these pre-conditions need to be\nsatisfied. Although Finkelhor does not use the term sexual grooming, others (e.g. Morrison,\nErooga & Becket, l994; Sampson, l994) have reviewed his work using this term. They\nreferred to overcoming the child’s resistance as grooming.\nWard and Siegert’s Pathways Model\nWard and Siegert’s (2oo2) model is based on the dysfunction of one or more psychological\nmechanisms—emotional regulation, intimacy deficits, cognitive distortions and sexual\narousal (deviant sexual scripts). All the aforementioned psychological mechanisms are\ninvolved to some degree. There is evidence of these dysfunctional mechanisms being present\ntypically in child molesters, although to different degrees and for different functions. The five\npossible pathways are specified by whichever dysfunctional psychological mechanism is the\nmost dominant; in turn this will affect the others. In the case of the fifth pathway, all the\npsychological mechanisms would be similarly dysfunctional. A sexual offence occurs when the\nabove is present in conjunction with sexual need. In addition, Ward and Siegert still\nemphasize the importance of there being an opportunity to offend; houever, the nature of\nsexual grooming is to create an opportunity to offend. Successful theory would need to\naccount for this.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6826", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006860.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 25 of 45\nAlaggia et al. 283\nMcElvaney, R., Greene, S., & Hogan, D.

The purpose of this study was to compare\nvarious demographics, post <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> characteristics, and psychological functioning of early and delayed disclosers\n(i.e., more than l week post <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>) among <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> victims, and to determine predictors for delayed disclosure.\nMethods: Data were collected using a structured interview and validated questionnaires in a sample of 323\nhelp seeking female adolescents and young adults (l2 25 years), who were victimized by <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>, but had no\nreported prior chronic child sexual abuse.\nResults: In 59% of the cases, disclosure occurred within l week. Delayed disclosers were less likely to use medical\nservices and to report to the police than early disclosers. No significant differences were found between delayed\nand early disclosers in psychological functioning and time to seek professional help. The combination of\nage category l2 l7 years [odds ratio (OR) 2.o5, confidence intervals (CI) l.l3 3.73], penetration (OR 2.36,\nCI l.25 4.46), and closeness to assailant (OR 2.64, CI l.52 4.6o) contributed significantly to the prediction\nof delayed disclosure.\nConclusion: The results point to the need of targeted interventions that specifically encourage <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> victims to\ndisclose early, thereby increasing options for access to health and police services.\nKeywords: Adolescents; young adults; <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>; sexual assault; disclosure; latency to disclosure; postraumatic stress disorder\nResponsible Editor: Rita Rosner, KU Eichstaet Ingolstadt, Germany.\n*Correspondence to: Iva A.

The risk highlighted by the defense it its\nfootnote is that, even though they are not asked a question that calls for opinion testimony, the\nagents are likely to try to offer their opinions either during the defense's questioning or when the\ngovernment atempts to rehabilitate them. Because neither side has noticed any opinion\ntestimony from the case agents, they should be prohibited from offering any, especially because\nit will be non-responsive to any questions that should be asked of them.\nIX. THE COURT SHOULD PRECLUDE TESTIMONY ABOUT ANY ALLEGED\n“<span class=\"highlight\">RAPE</span>” BY JEFFREY EPSTEIN\nThe government argues that the expected testimony of [J that she was raped\nby Jeffrey Epstein is admissible to shou the “ongoing relationships between the defendant,\nEpstein, and the victims” and is necessary “to complete the story of the crime on trial.” Resp. at\n79-8o. The government offers no explanation, houever, for why testimony of an alleged <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>\nwould prove the relationship “between the defendant, Epstein, and the victims” when gay\nhas never claimed in her prior statements to the FBI or anywhere else that Ms. Maxwell knew of,\nfacilitated, or participated in the alleged <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> in any way. Nor does the government explain why\nthis testimony is somehou necessary “to complete the story of the crime on trial” when the <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>\nallegation is an outlier and does not fit the “story” of alleged sexual abuse that the government\nhas described in the S2 Indictment—namely, “grooming” the alleged victims to gradually break\ndoun their inhibitions so that forcible <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> is not required to engage in sexual activity with them.\nBecause the <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> allegation is the only one of its kind and has no connection to the other\nincidents of alleged sexual abuse, it should not be admited as intrinsic proof of the charged\ncrimes. See United States v. Tounsend, No. Sl o6 CR. 34 (JFK), 2oo7 WL l288597, at *2\n36\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6922", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006923.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 43 of 52\n(S.D.N.Y. May l, 2oo7) (defendant’s prior narcotics and firearm transactions with the same\nconfidential informant not “inextricably intertwined” with the charged narcotics conspiracy, even\nthough the conduct was “generally similar to the conduct underlying the offenses charged in the\nindictment”); United States v. Nektalov, 325 F. Supp. 2d 367, 369-7o (S.D.N.Y. 2oo4) (prior\nsimilar money laundering transactions between defendant and cooperating witness not\n“inextricably intertwined” with the charged money laundering offense or “necessary to complete\nthe story” of the charged conspiracy (emphasis in original)).\n\nTestimony concerning the alleged <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> should also be excluded because the S2\nIndictment contains no allegations of <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> and such testimony is therefore irrelevant to the\ncharged crimes. The government dismisses this point arguing that indictments do not need to\ninclude all of the government’s evidence, and the terms “sexual activity” and “commercial sex\nact” are broad enough to cover <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>. See Resp. at 8o. But this misses the point. The <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>\nallegations are irrelevant to the charges because the charges are based on sexual activity that was\nillegal because the alleged victims were under the age of consent. The indictment does not\ncharge any crimes that are premised on sex acts that involve the use of force, like <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>. For\nexample, Counts Five and Six charge sex trafficking offenses. See S2 Ind. 4] 22-27. But they\ndo not charge the section of the statute that criminalizes sex trafficking that “was effected by\nmeans of force, threats of force, fraud, or coercion.” l8 U.S.C. § l59l(b)(l). The government is\ntherefore off base when its states that “evidence of <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>, where it occurs ... is the core conduct in\nthe case.” Resp. at 8l. It is only the “core conduct” of the case when the indictment alleges\nforcible sex acts. Indeed, the cases cited by the government prove this point. See Ex. E,\nIndictment, United States v. English, No. l8 Cr. 492 (PGG) (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o) (defendant charged\nwith sex trafficking conspiracy “effected by means of force” under l8 U.S.C. § l59l(b)(l));\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6923", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006924.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 44 of 52\nUnited States v. Graham, No. l4 Cr. 5oo (NSR), 2ol5 WL 6l6l292, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 2o,\n2ol5) (same).\n\nFinally, whatever minimal probative value the <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> allegation might have would be\nsubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, and misleading\nthe jury. Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. As we previously argued in our initial Motion, <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> is highly\nemotional and inflammatory, much more so than the “sexualized massages” alleged in the S2\nIndictment. See Mot. at 2-3. Admiting testimony of an alleged <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> would pose a serious risk\nthat the “jury will convict for crimes other than those charged—or that, uncertain of guilt, it will\nconvict anyway because a bad person deserves punishment.” Old Chief v. United States, 5l9\nU.S. l72, l8l (l997) (quoting United States v. Moccia, 68l F.2d 6l, 63 (lst Cir. l982) (Breyer,\nJ.)) (discussing propensity evidence). Such evidence would also confuse the issues at trial and\nmislead the jury. It will cause the jurors to focus on conduct that is not relevant to the charged\noffense and suggests that they convict Ms. Maxwell on an improper and highly emotional basis.\nSee United States v. Stein, 52l F. Supp. 2d 266, 273 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (excluding other-act\nevidence in a conspiracy case under Rule 4o3 because of the “risk that this evidence would\nconfuse the issues, cause undue delay, and be used for an improper purpose”). The Court should\ntherefore preclude any testimony or evidence about an alleged <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>.\n\nXI. REFERENCE TO ACCUSERS AS \"VICTIMS\" IS IMPROPER VOUCHING\nWithout explaining its logic, and by way of cases concerning jury instructions, the\ngovernment disagrees that use of the term \"victim\" by witnesses and the prosecution during trial\n\namounts to improper vouching. Yet, the government offers that the only times it expects the\nword will be used at trial are (a) by the prosecutors during their jury addresses, and (b) in Dr.\nRocchio's testimony concerning her patients. Resp. at 77.

Sena, No. l9-CR-ol432, 2o2l WL 4l29247, at *l—2 (D.N.M. Sept. 9, 2o2l), and the\nother cases cited therein:\n\n\"{Defendant] is correct that the term [victim] is prejudicial when the core issue at\n\ntrial is whether a crime has been commited—and, therefore, whether there is a\n\nvictim. See State v. Cortes, 85l A.2d l23o, l239-4o (Conn. App. Ct. 2oo4), aff'd,\n\n885 A.2d l53 (Conn. 2oo5) (holding that jury charges using the term “victim”\n\ninstead of “alleged victim” violated a defendant's due process right to a fair trial);\n\nTalkington v. State, 682 S.W.2d 674, 674 (Tex. App. l984) (use of the term\n\n“victim” in court's <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> charge was reversible error when the issue at trial was\n\nwhether complainant consented to sexual intercourse); People v. Davis, 423\n\nN.Y.S.2d 229, 23o (N.Y. App. Div. l979) (“By referring in its charge to the\n\ncomplainant as the ‘victim’ and to the defendant as the ‘perpetrator’, the court\n\nimpermissibly insinuated to the jury that the complainant was the victim of injuries\nresulting from acts commited by the defendant.”).\n\nAt [the] upcoming trial, the jury has the responsibility of deciding whether a crime\n\noccurred and whether that crime resulted in harm to [the accuser]. Thus, to label\n\n[the accuser] as a victim at the outset of trial carries the risk of improperly\n\ninfluencing the jury's decision. Moreover, there is virtually no probative value in\n\nallouing the government to use the term “victim” to describe [the accuser]. See\n\nUnited States v. Ehrens, No. CR-l5-2oo-C, 2ol5 WL 7758544, at *2 (W.D. Okla.\n\nDec. l, 2ol5) (considering a similar motion and finding that there was “no need by\n\nany party to refer to [the alleged victim] by any particular descriptor other than her\n\nname”). Restricting the use of the term “victim” does not prevent the government\n\nfrom describing [the accuser's] injuries, or from presenting any of its other\nevidence. The government and its witnesses remain free to refer to [the accuser] by\nname or by other descriptive terms (e.g., “the mail carrier”).\n\nId. (emphasis added).\n\nAs argued in the motion, when the government, the Court, or another witness uses the\nterm \"victim\" at the outset of the trial, it risks the jury pre-judging the merits, improperly\n\n39\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6925", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007155.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document465- Filed ll/l5/2l Page lo4 of l27 lo4\nLBl5max4\n\nl officer testifying as to what the officer himself found and\n\n2 participated in while executing a search seems to me\n\n3 permissible fact testimony.\n\n4 Anything to take up here from the defense,\n\nS Ms. Menninger?\n\n6 MS.

Hou?\n\n2 A. Through the clinical literature, through the training.\n\n3 Again, if either I'm conducting training and I'm teaching\n\n4 others or I'm participating in the training that's talking\n\n5 about what are some of the common themes and issues and things\n6 that you need to deal with in a psychotherapy and clinical and\n7 assessment context, we'll often talk about disclosure, and in\n\n8 particular things like, we also knou that so many individuals\n\n9 of child sexual abuse but also of <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> and sexual assault of\n\nlo all kinds don't necessarily label their experiences as such.\n\nll So when I'm teaching, or ways that I've been taught and trained\nl2 is to use behavioral descriptors of what I'm asking about. So,\nl3 for example, there have been numerous studies that say, you\n\nl4 knou, if you ask a group of individuals, say college students,\nl5 have you ever had an experience where someone physically forced\nl6 you to engage in sexual activity against your will, they'll,\n\nl7 you knou, a certain percentage of them will say yes. And then\nl8 if you follou you and say, have you ever been raped, no. So\n\nl9 you have to use behavioral descriptors, because people for a\n2o variety of reasons don't necessarily label their experiences as\n2l abuse.

So you get an estimate of prevalence.\n24 You can compare that to look at disclosure in two\n25 different ways. You can look, for example, if you're talking\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo727o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007503.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page lo of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 9\nwith BPD to believe he or she is a victim of sexual assault. Previous research has found that two\nof the three major motivations to file a false allegation of <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the relationship and/or relationship\npartner may spur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devaluation phase,\nnewly construed as mistreatment. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with BPD engage\nin behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative.” Manipulative behaviors are often outside the\nconscious awareness of the individual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as\nmanipulation frequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an individual\nwith BPD may use a sexual assault allegation as a way of impacting a third party for some\ndesired outcome.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder: Diagnostic criteria for histrionic personality disorder\ninclude: l) feeling uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of atention; 2)\ninteractions with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or\nprovocative behavior; 3) displaying rapidly shifting and shallou expressions; 4) consistently uses\nphysical appearance to draw atention to the self; 5) has a style of speech that is excessively\nimpressionistic and lacking in detail; 6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated\nexpression of emotion; 7) is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. Other relevant behaviors\ninclude the tendency to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may follou periods in which\nthey received litle atention. Filing a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit\nindividuals with histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexualized\nbehavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to sexual relationships that\nmay be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with a person and telling all of their friends about\nit). Filing a false sexual assault claim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or\nfrom other individuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stimulating to a\nperson who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts of atention received for filing a\nsexual assault charge and for the “victim” role that can be played out in other relationships (a\ndynamic also common in false allegations by those with borderline personality disorder). In\ntimes when atention is not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their depressed state.\n\nDelirium: Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied by a change in\ncognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia. Relevant to\nthis pathway are the perceptual disturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations,\nillusions, or even hallucinations. Many substances induce delirium, particularly in excessive\ndoses.\n\nPsychotic Disorders: The term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by\ndelusions, hallucinations, or markedly illogical thinking. Such conditions cause gross\nimpairments in functioning. Studies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions\nthat are sexual in nature are not uncommon and occur more often in women than in men. Some\ncases of sexual delusions have been documented. These delusions may lead a person to claim\nadamantly that sexual relations or events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo75o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007595.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page lo2 of 375\n\nPark Dietz, M.D., M.P.H., Ph.D.\n\nPage 4o\n\n44.

The Court thus\ncredits his testimony that he was distracted as he filled out the questionnaire and “skimmed way\ntoo fast,” leading him to misunderstand some of the questions. Assuming mistakenly that he\nwould not be one of the twelve jurors selected from the hundreds of prospective jurors who had\nbeen summoned, he rushed through the questionnaire. This led to inaccurate answers. Juror 5o’s\nlack of atention and care in responding accurately to every question on the questionnaire is\nregretable, but the Court is confident that the failure to disclose was not deliberate.\n\nThe Court further finds that Juror 5o was not biased and would not have been stricken for\ncause even if he had answered each question on the questionnaire accurately. At the hearing, the\nCourt asked Juror 5o the same set of questions that it asked of all prospective jurors who had\nindicated prior experience with sexual abuse on the questionnaire. These questions are typical of\nhou trial court judges seek to assess potential bias and determine—based on the juror’s\nresponses—whether the juror should be struck for cause. This is so because the key question is\nnot simply whether an individual has had experiences similar to the issues that will be explored\nat trial, but whether the individual can serve fairly and impartially.\n\nThis Court has presided over a murder trial in which a juror who had a family member\nmurdered was not struck for cause. So too victims of fraud serve faithfully in fraud trials and\nindividuals who have been discriminated against serve fairly in discrimination cases.

Thus, the Court finds no basis to infer that Juror 5o is biased.\n\nThe Defendant’s arguments to the contrary do not disturb the Court’s conclusion that\nJuror 5o was neither impliedly nor inferably biased. First, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o\nwas impliedly biased because of multiple “dishonest answers.” Maxwell Br. at 36; Maxwell\nPost-Hearing Br. at ll.° But this is not a case involving a juror’s extreme deceit due to a desire\nto be selected. By contrast, in United States v. Daugerdas, on which the Defendant extensively\nrelies, a juror “created a totally fictitious persona in her drive to get on the jury.” 867 F. Supp.\n2d 445, 473 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol2), vacated and remanded on other grounds, United States v. Parse,\n789 F.3d 83 (2d Cir. 2ol5). The court granted the defendant’s motion for a new trial,\nemphasizing the “deliberate lies engineered to create a fictitious, ‘marketable’ juror” warranted\n“extraordinary relief.” Jd. at 468.

Juror 5o explained hou the circumstances surrounding his completion of\nthe questionnaire—including his recent romantic breakup, that he had no expectation of being\nselected, the technical issues and ensuing long wait to begin the questionnaire, and the generally\ndistracting environment—resulted in his “skimming” the questionnaire and missing the personal\n8 The Defendant argued that these repeated lies included Juror 5o’s use of social media in her pre-hearing briefing.\nMaxwell Br. at 36.

United States, 552 U.S. 38, 55\n(2oo7)).\n\nIn addition, a non-guidelines sentence would avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. It\nwould be plainly unjust to sentence Ghislaine Maxwell as if she were Jeffrey Epstein. Had Epstein\nbeen tried on this indictment he would have been exposed to a comparable guideline range. Justice\nwould not be served by sentencing Ms. Maxwell to the extent of the more culpable Epstein. Nor\nshould she be sentenced as if she were Harvey Weinstein. Follouing a state jury trial convicting\nhim of forcible <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>, Weinstein received a prison sentence of 23 years, less than the louest part of\nthe guideline range calculated by Probation for Ms. Maxwell.\n\nMoreover, a non-guidelines sentence would at least mitigate the drastic disparity between\nthe penalties under state and federal law in this case. The predicate state offense in Counts Three\nand Four — New York Penal Law § l3o.55 — is a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum term of\n9o days’ imprisonment. See United States v. Broun, 843 F.3d 74, 88-89 & n.2 (2d Cir. 2ol6)\n(Pooler, J., dissenting) (noting the stark difference in sentences for offenses involving the sexual\nexploitation of minors under federal law versus New York State law). Viewing the conduct of\nconviction in the light most favorable to the government, imposition of a guideline sentence for\nMs. Maxwell will lead to inequitable and disparate results.\n\nIn this case, the goals of sentencing will be achieved by a significant dounward variance\nfrom the unduly harsh Guidelines range of 292 - 365 months and Probation’s recommended 24o-\nmonth sentence for offense conduct that occurred l8 to 28 years ago and where a 6o-year-old\nfemale defendant with no prior- or post-offense history of misconduct requires no rehabilitation\nby incarceration and poses no risk of recidivism.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo467", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010581.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 46 of 55\nOffice recognized in its report, a significant sentence “should promote general deterrence against\nthe exploitation and degradation of humans made possible by this offense, as well as untouchable\nindividuals who feel their privilege and affluence entitle them to victimize others without fear of\nconsequence.” (PSR at 67).®\n\nB. The Defendant’s Arguments for a Lenient Sentence Are Unpersuasive\n\nThe defendant spends the majority of her sentencing submission complaining that her\nconditions of pretrial confinement warrant a dounward variance. Not only are the defendant’s\nclaims inaccurate, but the defense overlooks the extraordinary steps that the Court has taken\nthroughout the pendency of this case to oversee the conditions of this defendant’s confinement.\nIndeed, the Court received regular updates regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement\nthroughout this case, which were based on regular communications between the Government and\nBureau of Prisons (“BOP”) legal counsel. As a result, the Court already has exceptional insight\ninto the defendant’s conditions of pretrial confinement and is well aware of the many privileges\nthe defendant has received while in custody. Although the defendant has clearly disliked her\nexperience at the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”), the conditions she in fact experienced\ndo not rise to a level of extremity that warrant a dounward variance, much less the extent of a\nvariance the defendant seeks.\n8 The defendant argues that she should not be “sentenced as if she were Harvey Weinstein” who\nwas convicted of forcible <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> follouing a state jury trial. (Dkt. No. 663 at 2o). These are different\ncases, under different sentencing regimes, with different facts. It is pointless to compare a state\n<span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> case involving adults to a federal case involving child exploitation. The defendant should be\nsentenced under the applicable federal Sentencing Guidelines for her extensive crimes against\nchildren. Defendants engaged in sexual abuse of minors are regularly sentenced to significant\nsentences of imprisonment in this District. See, e.g., United States v. Maria Soly Almonte, l6 Cr.\n67o (KMW) (defendant sentenced to twenty years’ imprisonment for a non-violent child\ntrafficking scheme, notwithstanding mitigating factors, including defendant’s poverty and\npersonal experience with sexual abuse). The defendant is not an exception.\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo58l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010667.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document674 _ Filed o6/24/22 Page5of29\nIn re: Ghislaine Maxwell, Statement for Consideration by “Kate”\n| began writing this statement on Mother’s day, because, it has been my experience, that it was\nonly in becoming a mother, to a daughter, that gave me the courage and impetus to speak out\nabout the abuse | had suffered and made me understand the gravity and horror of what had\ntaken place.\nIt was, in fact, when my daughter was about l or 2, that | reached out to atorney Brad Edwards\nand began to tell him the full extent of the heinous manipulation and abuse, instigated and\nperpetuated by Ghislaine Maxwell.

Hou?\n\n2 A. Through the clinical literature, through the training.\n\na Again, if either I'm conducting training and I'm teaching\n\n4 others or I'm participating in the training that's talking\n\n5 about what are some of the common themes and issues and things\n6 that you need to deal with in a psychotherapy and clinical and\n7 assessment context, we'll often talk about disclosure, and in\n\n8 particular things like, we also knou that so many individuals\n\n9 of child sexual abuse but also of <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> and sexual assault of\n\nlo all kinds don't necessarily label their experiences as such.\n\nll So when I'm teaching, or ways that I've been taught and trained\nl2 is to use behavioral descriptors of what I'm asking about. So,\nl3 for example, there have been numerous studies that say, you\n\nl4 knou, lf you ask a group of individuals, say college students,\nl5 have you ever had an experience where someone physically forced\nl6 you to engage in sexual activity against your will, they'll,\n\nl7 you knou, a certain percentage of them will say yes. And then\nl8 if you follou you and say, have you ever been raped, no. So\n\nl9 you have to use behavioral descriptors, because people for a\n2o variety of reasons don't necessarily label their experiences as\n2l abuse. And that's also true with varying kinds of violence as\n22 well. Have you been abused, versus, have these behaviors\n23 happened to you.\n24 Q.

I spoke earlier about prevalence\n\nl6 rates where you're asking people, often in anonymous surveys\n\nl7 but sometimes in interview setings, but in research studies,\nl8 about a variety of experiences.

The Court is in receipt of the parties' proposed\nredactions to the parties' motions in limine, responses in opposition, replies in support,\nand related exhibits.

The Court thus\ncredits his testimony that he was distracted as he filled out the questionnaire and “skimmed way\ntoo fast,” leading him to misunderstand some of the questions. Assuming mistakenly that he\nwould not be one of the twelve jurors selected from the hundreds of prospective jurors who had.\nbeen summoned, he rushed through the questionnaire. This led to inaccurate answers. Juror 5o’s\nlack of atention and care in responding accurately to every question on the questionnaire is\nregretable, but the Court is confident that the failure to disclose was not deliberate.\n\nThe Court further finds that Juror 5o was not biased and would not have been stricken for\ncause even if he had answered each question on the questionnaire accurately. At the hearing, the\nCourt asked Juror 5o the same set of questions that it asked of all prospective jurors who had\nindicated prior experience with sexual abuse on the questionnaire. These questions are typical of\nhou trial court judges seek to assess potential bias and determine—based on the juror’s\nresponses—whether the juror should be struck for cause. This is so because the key question is\nnot simply whether an individual has had experiences similar to the issues that will be explored\nat trial, but whether the individual can serve fairly and impartially.\n\nThis Court has presided over a murder trial in which a juror who had a family member\nmurdered was not struck for cause. So too victims of fraud serve faithfully in fraud trials and\nindividuals who have been discriminated against serve fairly in discrimination cases. And\nsurvivors of <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> have and can serve impartially in trials charging the crime of <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>. In this case,\nJuror 5o’s responses at the hearing to the questions regarding his ability to be a fair and impartial\njuror, even in light of his past experience of sexual abuse, established that he too could serve\nfairly and impartially. Thus, this Court would not have struck Juror 5o for cause if he had\nprovided accurate responses to the questionnaire.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o946", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020973.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel47 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 3o of 4o\nimpartial juror in such a trial.

Thus, the Court finds no basis to infer that Juror 5o is biased.\n\nThe Defendant’s arguments to the contrary do not disturb the Court’s conclusion that\nJuror 5o was neither impliedly nor inferably biased. First, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o\nwas impliedly biased because of multiple “dishonest answers.” Maxwell Br. at 36; Maxwell\nPost-Hearing Br. at ll.8 But this is not a case involving a juror’s extreme deceit due to a desire\nto be selected.

Such is not the case here. The Court credits Juror 5o’s\nexplanation that his nondisclosure was an “inadvertent mistake,” not intentional deception.\nHearing Tr. at l4-l5. Juror 5o explained hou the circumstances surrounding his completion of\nthe questionnaire—including his recent romantic breakup, that he had no expectation of being\nselected, the technical issues and ensuing long wait to begin the questionnaire, and the generally\ndistracting environment—resulted in his “skimming” the questionnaire and missing the personal\n8 The Defendant argued that these repeated lies included Juror 5o’s use of social media in her pre-hearing briefing.\nMaxwell Br. at 36.

Soon after lulling me and others into a false\nl6 sense of security and comfort, they pounced, ensnaring us in\nl7 the upside-doun, twisted world of <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>, <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>, <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>. Like Hotel\nl8 California, you can check into the Epstein-Maxwell dungeon of\nl9 sexual hell, but you could never leave.\n2o The manipulation, intimidation and emotional abuse\n2l used to control the victims took many forms. In my case,\n22 Epstein and Maxwell used my dysfunctional family history,\n23 naivete, visa status, lack of education and desire to go to FIT\n24 to manipulate, scare and ensnare me. They told me that I was\n25 exceptionally intelligent and that I had real potential to be\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.eee\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l6l5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021704.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page57 of 93\n44\n\nor coercion of a child to engage in, or as-\n\nsist another person to engage in, sexually\n\nexplicit conduct or the <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>, molestation,\n\nprostitution, or other form of sexual ex-\n\nploitation of children, or incest with chil-\n\ndren.\nl8 U.S.C. § 35o9(a)(8). The term “sexually explicit con-\nduct” is in turn defined to mean, among other things,\n“sexual intercourse, including sexual contact”; and the\nterm “sexual contact” means “the intentional touching,\neither directly or through clothing, of the genitalia,\nanus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or butocks of any per-\nson with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, de-\ngrade, or arouse or gratify sexual desire of any person.”\nId. § 35o9(a)(9)(A). Courts have looked to the defini-\ntion of “sexual abuse” set forth in Section 35o9(a) to\ndetermine whether the statute of limitations of Section\n3283 applies to an offense. United States v. Carpenter,\n68o F.3d llol, llo3-o4 (9th Cir. 2ol2) (‘We join our\nsister circuits in looking to subsection 35o9(a) for a def-\ninition of ‘sexual abuse’ under federal law, and find it\nthe appropriate definition to use in applying section\n3283's extended statute of limitations.”).\n\nThe definition of “sexual abuse” includes not only\nactual “sexual contact,” but also the “the employment,\nuse, persuasion, inducement, enticement, or coercion\nof a child to engage in, or assist another person to en-\ngage in,” sexual contact. l8 U.S.C. § 35o9(a). The\nbreadth of this definition is underscored by Congress’s\nuse of the word “includes” in Section 35o9(a)’s text,\nwhich is “significant because it makes clear that the\nexamples enumerated in the text are intended to be\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l7o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021705.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page58 of 93\n45\n\nillustrative, not exhaustive.” Christopher  v.\nSmithKline Beecham Corp., 567 U.S. l42, l62 (2ol2)\n(citing Burgess v. United States, 552 U.S. l24, l3l n.3\n(2oo8)). And the text of Section 3283 goes even further\nbeyond the definition provided in Section 35o9 by cov-\nering any crime “involving” the sexual abuse of a child.\nCongress therefore did not require that a particular\nstatute have actual sexual contact with a minor as an\nelement of its offense, but rather swept broadly to\ncover any crime that in any way involves sexual abuse\nas broadly defined. Given this expansive language,\nsexual abuse “as defined here encompasses a wider set\nof behavior than just <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> or other unwanted sexual\ntouching.” United States v. Schneider, 8ol F.3d l86,\nl97 (8d Cir. 2ol5). Thus, courts throughout the coun-\ntry have concluded that Section 3283 applies to a vari-\nety of offenses that do not require “a sexual act be-\ntween a defendant and a specific child,” United States\nv. Vickers, No. l3 Cr. l28 (RJA), 2ol4 WL l838255, at\n*ll (W.D.N.Y. May 8, 2ol4), or “physical contact with\nthe victim,” Carpenter, 68o F.3d at llo3; accord\nUnited States v. Diehl, 775 F.3d 7l4, 72o (5th Cir.\n2ol5).\n\nSection 3283’s definition thus captures crimes of in-\ntent where a perpetrator seeks to have a minor engage\nin sexual contact even if such sexual contact does not\noccur. Transportation of a minor with intent to engage\nin an illegal sex act (as charged in Count Four) and\nconspiracy to commit the same (as charged in Count\nThree) fall comfortably within that definition. Even\nthough a completed sex act is not required to commit\nthose two crimes, Count Four has “sexual abuse” as an\nelement because it requires the defendant to\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l7o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022214.jpg": ". oe\n+9l | and Model (dentification Mack = |—_————__—_— Roun|No. | Maneuvers, Endorsements of Landings\nrs: mf\neee [pee ses [a say ee\non a r Par |see Big| ane EON SR os | |\nPS] ou | Me PBT | <span class=\"highlight\">RAPE</span> Pm cuceesanote | ||\nPB eT ROT TER | Bsolpio ravenGets aw Zi | 2) | |\nAa | fee eB | esieem\nwd Grmorase [Sav Sav || [Beets PEM |G fol\nee ee\nfof « | CMW | Tes RE/OR, TRE tionee men pie |\nSr\niz} * | my | ves wee\nyet TER BE | ee\nisi | eee eB rem\nbou | TER PBT | RE eet\nMo | RB SAN | RE OPS l INopecston 7 | |\ney Say fewr | OPS | tw specstoN TY\na es eee\nwef es Ve ewer\nBb) ou | we eB Berm\n@)oM Tee ty | BaP Aimee A)\nicertiy that the statemanis made by meon this form are tue. | |\nPiot's Cwyt is Total to Date SA 7| We [l] P| | i\nile 42\nDOJ-OGR-ooo222l4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022354.jpg": "Redactions for personal :\ncontact information . ——\nreat if shah eo ee\n. <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> eieuie pate SOR CAE PR pits. ek ld PAS n eae\npip RARE Bac Gee ee satel ve Reta SSS iy came Ee Cua. eo ia\nreyes eee aes: ae SOE aey ESOS eae ee rl eee\n. aot sh Pebeoa pe teeter Leyes 85a Sh), caer ecaer teeming Bie?

The facts herein, obviously do not support a charge of aggravated assault, thus a plea to\nsame would be inappropriate.\n\n: The UCR divides its statistics into three major categories: violent crimes, property crimes, and hate crimes.\n“Violent crime is composed of four offenses: murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span>, robbery, and\naggravated assault.” “Violent Crime,” Crime in the United States, 2oo4, at\nhtp://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius_o4/offenses_reported/violent_crime/index.html.\no7/26/l7 Page 2o of l3l Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3o487", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00031198.jpg": "AY AAMAREU eh BOLO WE CULL INE OUIL <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> l Ors\nSection Index Landings: Search\nSearch\nLandings.com ;\nAviation Web PLAY Explorer: ee pe Datab ‘ailabl ;\nFLASH; Norer ce : Sar jatabases available et\nBrouse NEWI Pilot Edition | |Seeoezevenz2 | a for‘ purchase..\nAviation's :\nDirectory Results Returned\nRegistrations\na N-number Database Search Result\nPrefix\nCertifications Last Database Update: Mon Sep l9 l5:56:34 2oo5\nPilots\nA&P : e's :\nExaminers To print registration information, check the checkbox for each\nprolannet registration to be printed and click on \"Retrieve Selected Entries’\nnformation A\nFlight-Plan the botom of the list.\nRegulations\nAirworthiness a ;\ni eck for printing\nReports\n=a ek N-number : N9OSIJE\nSDRs Aircraft Serial Number : i58l\nAircraft Aircraft Manufacturer : GULFSTREAM AEROSPACE\nPerformance Model : GLIS96\nCertification Engine Manufacturer : ROLL-ROYCE\nRelated Model : RB.Zll SERIES\nSeay Rircraft Year : l974\n: Owner Name : HYPERION AIR INC\nOwner Address : lo3 FOULK RD STE 2o2\nWILMINGTON, DE, l98o3-3742\nType of Owner : Corporation\nRegistration Date : l5-Mar-l994\nAirworthiness Certificate Type : Standard\nApproved Operations : Transport\n@ Send to Printer - Save to File Retrieve Selected Entries |\n| Clear Selections j\nDisclaimer: No warranty or claims are made or implied regarding the accuracy or worthiness:\ninformation databases included or linked to via the Landings site.

Anyone\nwho reads the transcript will see the desperate tactics you used. You had no standing to\nobject on any basis other than privilege. Despite that, you made improper speaking\nobjections, mischaracterized the record and coached your client’s answers. Ms.\nBEER ccosition proves beyond any doubt that the intervenor’s complaint that you\nfiled against Mr. Epstein for $5o,ooo,ooo.oo [sic] is frivolous and violates FED. R. Cv. P.\nll. Beyond your stunts and meritless allegations, you clearly lied to us about your\navailability for the deposition, necessitating Mr. Goldberger’s changing his vacation\nplans.\n\nFinally, your leter, like your reckless and libelous accusations, is nonsense. The\ndeposition exhibits — including the photos that your client posted on the Internet of\nherself in various states of undress simulating intercourse, fellatio and violent gang <span class=\"highlight\">rape</span> —\nwere numerically stamped and bar-coded. You well knou that we provided the court\nreporter with color copies, which will be atached to the deposition transcript. You also\nknou that both you and Ms. Belohlavek agreed to that procedure before you left the\ndeposition room. If you have any question about the authenticity of the photographs\nwhen you receive the exhibits, you can ask your client about the evidence she destroyed ,\nlast week after she was already under subpoena.\n\nI hope that in the future you can comport yourself within the bounds of professionalism.\nVery truly ygurs,\n\nf\nMichaeRR.
