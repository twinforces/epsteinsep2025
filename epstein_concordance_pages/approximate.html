The Court\nwill not dismiss the indictment on Maxwell’s bare\nassertion that numerous witnesses are engaged in a\nperjurious conspiracy against her. And the Court will\ntake all appropriate steps to ensure that the pretrial\npublicity in this case does not compromise Maxwell’s\nright to a fair and impartial jury.\n\nThe Court thus concludes that Maxwell has failed to\nestablish actual prejudice from the Government’s\ndelay in bringing charges. She may renew her motion\nif the factual record at trial shous otherwise. On the\npresent record, neither the applicable statute of\nlimitations nor due process bars the charges here.\n\nIII. The indictment describes the charged offenses\n\nwith specificity\n\nMaxwell seeks to dismiss the Mann Act counts for\nlack of specificity or in the alternative to compel the\nGovernment to submit a bill of particulars providing\ngreater detail of the charges. The Court concludes that\nthe charges in the Sl superseding indictment are clear\nenough.\n\nUnder Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7, an\nindictment must contain “a plain, concise, and definite\nwriten statement of the essential facts constituting\nthe offense charged.” The indictment must be specific\nenough to inform the defendant of the charges and\nallou the defendant to plead double jeopardy in a later\nprosecution based on the same events. United States v.\nStavroulakis, 952 F.2d 686, 693 (2d Cir. l992). “Under\nthis test, an indictment need do litle more than to\ntrack the language of the statute charged and state the\ntime and place (in <span class=\"highlight\">approximate</span> terms) of the alleged\ncrime.” United States. v.

In addition to dismissal, “Rule 7(f) of\nthe Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure permits a\ndefendant to seek a bill of particulars in order to\nidentify with sufficient particularity the nature of\nthe charge pending against him, thereby enabling\ndefendant to prepare for trial, to prevent surprise, and\nto interpose a plea of double jeopardy should he be\nprosecuted a second time for the same offense.” United\nStates v. Bortnovusky, 82o F.2d 572, 574 (2d Cir. l987).\n\nThe Sl superseding indictment sets out the elements of\neach charged crime and the facts supporting each\nelement. Nonetheless, Maxwell contends that the\nindictment is too vague because it refers to open-ended\ntime periods, describes conduct like “grooming” and\n“befriending” that is not inherently criminal, and does\nnot identify the alleged victims by name.\n\nMaxwell’s first argument fails because the\nGovernment need only describe the time and place of\ncharged conduct “in <span class=\"highlight\">approximate</span> terms.” Tramunti,\n5l3 F.2d at ll8. The details are subject to proof at\ntrial. “[T]he Second Circuit routinely upholds the ‘on\nor about’ language used to describe the windou of\nwhen a violation occurred.” United States v.

Nersesian, 824 F.2d l294, l323 (2d Cir. l987)).\n“This is especially true in cases of sexual abuse of\nchildren: allegations of sexual abuse of underage\nvictims often proceed without specific dates of the\noffenses.” United States v. Young, No. o8-cr-285 (KMK),\n2oo8 WL 4l78l9o, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 4, 2oo8)\n(collecting cases).

United States, 369 U.S. 749 (l962)). Similarly, “where an indictment charges a\ncrime that depends in turn on violation of another statute, the indictment must identify the\nunderlying offense.” United States v. Pirro, 2l2 F.3d 86, 93 (2d Cir. 2ooo). When delineating the\ncontours of this narrou category of crimes requiring additional specificity in an indictment, the\nSecond Circuit has previously found that the failure to name a specific victim of fraud does not\nrender an indictment inadequate under this standard. See Stringer, 73o F.3d at l27. In other words,\nabsent some affirmative indication that additional specificity is required when charging a particular\nstatute, there is no basis to conclude that an indictment need contain more than the elements of the\noffense and the <span class=\"highlight\">approximate</span> time and place of the alleged violation. See Wey, 2ol7 WL 23765l\nat *5 (declining to “depart from the usual sufficiency framework” where defendant “cites no\nauthority” suggesting that the statutes at issue fall into the narrou exception to the general rule\nwhen considering motion to dismiss for lack of specificity).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nBecause each of the four counts at issue—Counts One, Two, Three, and Four—clearly lays\nout each element of the charged offense and adequately informs the defendant of the accusations\nagainst her, the Indictment easily satisfies the standard for sufficiency. Tellingly, the defendant\ndoes not claim that any of these counts fails to allege an essential element or to track the language\nof the relevant statute. Nor could she, as the face of the Indictment not only contains each and\nevery essential element of the crimes charged, but also goes beyond the basic requirements for\npleading each charge by providing additional factual background. Instead, the defendant baldly\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ll3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003115.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8l of 239\n\nis particularly instructive here. See 386 F. Supp.3d at 366. In denying the motion to dismiss,\nJudge Marrero found Stringer’s holding “that the identity of a victim was not required to be\ncontained in an indictment, despite the centrality of the victim’s identity to the charge” to be\nequally applicable in a case involving sex trafficking charges. /d. at 369. The same logic follous\nhere. The use of pseudonyms to refer to the minor victims of sexual abuse in Counts One through\nFour is no more prejudicial to the defendant here than the absence of victim identities was to the\ndefendants in Kidd or Stringer. This is especially so when the Government has already provided\nthe defendant with the birth month and year of each victim, provided discovery regarding each\nvictim, and has repeatedly indicated that it will provide the defendant with the names of its\nwitnesses, including the minor victims referenced in the Indictment, four weeks in advance of trial.\nSuch disclosure will ensure that the defendant is readily able to bar future prosecutions for the\nsame offense, and together with the elements of each crime and additional details contained in in\nthe Indictment, is more than sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.\n\nSecond, the Indictment “state[s] the time and place (in <span class=\"highlight\">approximate</span> terms)” of the conduct\nalleged in Counts One through Four. Stavroulakis, 952 F.2d at 693 (quoting Tramunti, 5l3 F.2d\nat ll3). In particular, Counts One through Four each allege that the defendant engaged in a\ncontinuing course of conduct involving the enticement and transportation of minors with intent to\ncommit illegal sex acts, as well as conspiracies to do so, between in or about l994 and in or about\nl997. See Indictment 7 l, 6, 7, 9-ll, l3, l5-l7, l9. Courts in the Second Circuit have consistently\nupheld indictments containing a range of time rather than a specific date. See, e.g., Kidd, 386. F.\nSupp. 3d at 369 (“[Th]le Second Circuit routinely upholds the ‘on or about’ language used to\ndescribe the windou of when a violation occurred.” (citing United States v.

Indeed, “[b]Jecause minors often are not capable of\nremembering the exact dates when the alleged acts occurred, ‘fairly large time windous in the\ncontext of child abuse prosecutions are not in conflict with constitutional notice requirements.’”\nYoung, 2oo8 WL 4l78l9o, at *2 (quoting Valentine v. Konteh, 395 F.3d 626, 632 (6th Cir. 2oo5)).\nThe same is true here. The minor victims in this case cannot reasonably be expected to recall the\nexact dates when particular instances of abuse took place during their adolescence. This is\nespecially so for Minor Victim-l, who experienced numerous instances of abuse over multiple\nyears of her youth. Providing the <span class=\"highlight\">approximate</span> ranges of dates during which the offenses took\nplace fully satisfies the requirements of an adequately pled charging instrument. The defendant\ncites no authority to the contrary, and her motion to dismiss should accordingly be denied.\n\nThird, the Indictment lists in clear detail the allegations relevant to each element of every\ncriminal statute for which she is charged. Beyond simply “parroting the language of a federal\ncriminal statute,” Resendiz-Ponce, 549 U.S. at lo8, the Indictment provides extensive detail\n\nl55\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ll6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003142.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o8 of 239\neC\nee\nee\nee\nee\nee\nee\nee\nee and the Government has provided the defense with the\nbirth month and year of each minor victim.”\n\nIn other words, as the Government has previously indicated, the discovery provides the\ndefendant with more than sufficient information about the three minor victims to permit her to\nprepare for trial. The discovery also provides the defense the ability to identify specific private\nplane flights that are relevant to the Indictment. Any remaining detail regarding the specifics of\nabuse, particular interactions, and additional trips will come from witness testimony.

The\ngovernment therefore cannot argue, as it does in its opposition, that the information provided in\nthe Indictment and the discovery produced to date are sufficient for Ms. Maxwell to understand\nthe nature of the charges against her, especially when only a small fraction of the discovery\npertains to the time period charged in the Indictment.

To assist the defense in reviewing this discovery, the same day that the S2\nIndictment was returned, the Government provided the defense with a list of particular Bates\nranges that relate specifically to Minor Victim-4 and the charges contained in Counts Five and Six.\nAs a result, the Government has identified particularly relevant pieces of evidence regarding these\ncharges for the defense. (See Dkt. No. l88 at 3-4). This evidence includes, among other things,\nportions of message pads seized from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence referencing messages left\nby Minor Victim-4 during the period charged in Counts Five and Six; phone records reflecting\ncalls made by another Epstein employee to Minor Victim-4; Federal Express records reflecting a\nshipment from Epstein’s address in New York to Minor Victim-4; and contemporary photographs\nof Minor Victim-4. The Government has also provided the defense with Minor Victim-4’s birth\nmonth and year. Additionally, the defense has flight records for Epstein’s private plane, reflecting\nwhen Epstein, the defendant, and other employees traveled to and from Palm Beach on the plane\nduring the period charged in Counts Five and Six. In other words, the discovery provides the\ndefendant with more than sufficient information about Minor Victim-4 to permit her to prepare for\ntrial.\n\nSimilar to the other three minor victims referenced in the S2 Indictment, any remaining\ndetail regarding the specifics of abuse and particular interactions will come from witness\ntestimony.

The Court\nwill not dismiss the indictment on Maxwell’s bare\nassertion that numerous witnesses are engaged in a\nperjurious conspiracy against her. And the Court will\ntake all appropriate steps to ensure that the pretrial\npublicity in this case does not compromise Maxwell’s\nright to a fair and impartial jury.\n\nThe Court thus concludes that Maxwell has failed to\nestablish actual prejudice from the Government’s\ndelay in bringing charges. She may renew her motion\nif the factual record at trial shous otherwise. On the\npresent record, neither the applicable statute of\nlimitations nor due process bars the charges here.\n\nIII. The indictment describes the charged offenses\n\nwith specificity\n\nMaxwell seeks to dismiss the Mann Act counts for\nlack of specificity or in the alternative to compel the\nGovernment to submit a bill of particulars providing\ngreater detail of the charges. The Court concludes that\nthe charges in the Sl superseding indictment are clear\nenough.\n\nUnder Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7, an\nindictment must contain “a plain, concise, and definite\nwriten statement of the essential facts constituting\nthe offense charged.” The indictment must be specific\nenough to inform the defendant of the charges and\nallou the defendant to plead double jeopardy in a later\nprosecution based on the same events. United States v.\nStavroulakis, 952 F.2d 686, 693 (2d Cir. l992). “Under\nthis test, an indictment need do litle more than to\ntrack the language of the statute charged and state the\ntime and place (in <span class=\"highlight\">approximate</span> terms) of the alleged\ncrime.” United States. v. Tramunti, 5l3 F.2d lo87, ll3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooool36", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000137.tif": "74a\n\n(2d Cir. l975). In addition to dismissal, “Rule 7(f) of\nthe Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure permits a\ndefendant to seek a bill of particulars in order to\nidentify with sufficient particularity the nature of\nthe charge pending against him, thereby enabling\ndefendant to prepare for trial, to prevent surprise, and\nto interpose a plea of double jeopardy should he be\nprosecuted a second time for the same offense.” United\nStates v. Bortnovusky, 82o F.2d 572, 574 (2d Cir. l987).\n\nThe Sl superseding indictment sets out the elements of\neach charged crime and the facts supporting each\nelement. Nonetheless, Maxwell contends that the\nindictment is too vague because it refers to open-ended\ntime periods, describes conduct like “grooming” and\n“befriending” that is not inherently criminal, and does\nnot identify the alleged victims by name.\n\nMaxwell’s first argument fails because the\nGovernment need only describe the time and place of\ncharged conduct “in <span class=\"highlight\">approximate</span> terms.” Tramunti,\n5l3 F.2d at ll8. The details are subject to proof at\ntrial. “[T]he Second Circuit routinely upholds the ‘on\nor about’ language used to describe the windou of\nwhen a violation occurred.” United States v. Kidd, 386\nF. Supp. 3d 364, 369 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (quoting United\nStates v. Nersesian, 824 F.2d l294, l323 (2d Cir. l987)).\n“This is especially true in cases of sexual abuse of\nchildren: allegations of sexual abuse of underage\nvictims often proceed without specific dates of the\noffenses.” United States v. Young, No. o8-cr-285 (KMK),\n2oo8 WL 4l78l9o, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 4, 2oo8)\n(collecting cases). As here, these cases frequently\ninvolve alleged abuse spanning a lengthy period of\ntime, and witnesses who were victimized as children\nmay struggle to recall the precise dates when abuse\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooool37", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022770.tif": "Page 227\nl right.
