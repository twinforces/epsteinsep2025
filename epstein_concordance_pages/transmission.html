In light of the fact that the Opinion includes potentially confidential\ninformation that should not be filed on the public docket, the Court will permit the\nparties 48 hours to propose any redactions to the Courts Opinion and Order and to\njustify those redactions by reference tothe Second Circuits decision in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo(2d Cir. 2oo6). After determining which, if\nany, portions of the Opinion and Order should be redacted, the Court will file the\nOpinion and Order on the public docket. As a result, the Court concludes that the\nGovernment has met its burden of persuasion that the Defendant poses a flight risk and\nthat pretrial detention continues to be warranted.

On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard\nfor Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the\nground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3)\nprovides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only\nby court order,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can\nmove to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nConsistent with the Rule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court\nrequired defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or\nconfidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also\ngave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the\nsubpoena as required by Rule l7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.\nRay, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o)\n(\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the\nvictim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing\nof objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections.

Presumably the government will argue that any reliance on Epstein testifying is\nspeculative because he may have asserted a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-\nincrimination. See United States v. Capone, 683 F.2d 582, 589 (lst Cir. l982). Not so. Epstein\nwas indicted in 2ol9. Any privilege against self-incrimination would have been lost as a result of\nhis acquital or final conviction prior to any trial in this mater.\n\nB. Paula Epstein.\n\nPaula Epstein was Jeffrey Epstein’s mother. She died in April 2oo4. Had this prosecution\nbeen brought in a timely manner, Ms. Epstein would have testified that Ms. Maxwell spent\nconsiderable time with her while in the Palm Beach, Florida area. Ms. Epstein would have\ntestified that she did not observe Ms. Maxwell with any Accusers between l994 and l997. Ms.\nEpstein would have provided accurate information about Ms. Maxwell’s relationship with Mr.\nEpstein, dates and times that she was with Ms. Maxwell, and presented a compelling counter to\nthe specious allegations that Ms. Maxwell traveled for purposes of grooming accusers for Mr.\nEpstein. Ms. Epstein would have been able to portray Ms. Maxwell as a caring and\ncompassionate human being and would have discussed the many days that the two were together.\nShe would have testified that Ms. Maxwell was her caregiver when she was sick and injured.\n\nC. Michael Casey.\n\nMr. Casey died on August 9, 2ol7. Mr. Casey was the agent of the person believed to be,\nbut not identified by the government, Accuser-l. Mr. Casey had knouledge about Accuser-l’s\ninteractions with Jeffrey Epstein and the lack of any interaction with Ms. Maxwell. Mr. Casey,\nwere he available to testify, would establish the whereabouts of Accuser-l during the relevant\ntime periods and Ms. Maxwell’s absence from those locations.

On June 8, 2o2o, houever, the Government sought and obtained a |\nthird superseding Indictment from a grand jury siting in the District’s White Plains courthouse. |\n(Schulte Br, at 2; Gov’t Opp. Br. at 2.) The Indictment charges Schulte with nine criminal\ncounts relating to his alleged <span class=\"highlight\">transmission</span> of national defense information to WikiLeaks. (ECF |\n4o5.) According to the Government, the White Plains grand jury that returned the superseding |\nIndictment was the sole grand jury empaneled at the time. (Gov’t Opp. Br. at l4.) :\nIl.

(ECF 435.) He primarily |\ncontends that the White Plains grand jury venire—from which the Indictment was obtained—did\nnot reflect a fair cross-section of the African American and Hispanic American populations in :\nthe community. And he contends that these effects are symptomatic of the exclusionary\nprocesses that are inherent in the District’s jury selection system. Relatedly, Schulte argues that\nthe Government’s decision to seek the Indictment from White Plains was improperly made.\nIll. The District’s Jury Plan\nTo understand Schulte’s claims, it is necessary to orient ourselves to some background\nknouledge of the District’s jury selection process. Under the JSSA, each federal district court\nmust “devise and place in operation a writen plan for random selection of grand and petit\njurors.” 28 U.S.C, § l863(a). The District’s jury selection plan (“Jury Plan”), which has been in\nexistence since 2oo9, provides the blueprint for the random selection of grand and petit jurors\nthroughout the District.

Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase,\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate <span class=\"highlight\">transmission</span> of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.*°? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “‘we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment.

(Sternheim, Bobbi) (Entered: o3/23/2o2l)\n\no3/24/2o2l | l72 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard\nfor Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the\nground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3)\nprovides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only\nby court order,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can\nmove to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nConsistent with the Rule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court\nrequired defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or\nconfidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also\ngave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the\nsubpoena as required by Rule l7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.\nRay, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o)\n(\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the\nvictim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing\nof objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm\nmay reply within three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation | on this Order).\nCounsel shall confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO\nORDERED.

The Court also\ngave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the\nsubpoena as required by Rule l7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.\nRay, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o)\n(\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the\nvictim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing\nof objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm\nmay reply within three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation | on this Order).\nCounsel shall confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO\nORDERED.

On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket.

If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6).

In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing.

On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard for\nRule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the ground\nthat it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3) provides that \"\n[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of personal or\nconfidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only by court\norder,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional circumstances, the\ncourt must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can move to quash or\nmodify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3). Consistent with the\nRule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court required defense counsel\nto provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or confidential information may be\ndisclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also gave the alleged victims an\nopportunity to object to or request modifications of the subpoena as required by Rule\nl7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter from the law firm indicating that\nit can provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or confidential information may\nbe elicited by the subpoena. The law firm shall provide notice to any such alleged victims\nit represents. In that leter, the law firm also interposed substantial objections on behalf of\nthe law firm and the alleged victims it represents. Those objections are functionally the\nequivalent of a motion to quash, even though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the\nCourt can receive adversarial briefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion\nto quash, the law firm shall enter an appearance and file its objections on the public\ndocket. See United States v. Ray, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo\n(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o) (\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal\nor confidential information about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given\nnotice to the victim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the\nCourt will then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on\ngrounds that Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing,\nthe law firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer with\ndefense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the objections.\nThe law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or before March\n26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing of objections,\ndefense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm may reply within\nthree days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation l on this Order). Counsel shall\nconfer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO ORDERED.

Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate <span class=\"highlight\">transmission</span> of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.” Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was... [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\n253 l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who . .. induces... any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of interstate .. .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate... commerce. . .
