Here, detention is warranted\nnot only because of the defendant’s financial means, but also her foreign ties, her skill at and\nwillingness to live in hiding, the nature of the offense resulting in a presumption of detention, and\nthe strength of the evidence, among other factors. The defense suggestion that the defendant’s\nprivate security guards should post cash in support of a bond does not change this calculus. There\nis no reason to believe that the defendant would be at all troubled by a security company in which\nshe has no personal stake losing $l million, especially if that sacrifice meant she could escape\nconviction and sentencing.

The defense has nou reviewed the discovery produced to date,\nincluding all of the documents that the government described as the core of its case\nagainst Ms. Maxwell.

Here, detention is warranted\nnot only because of the defendant’s financial means, but also her foreign ties, her skill at and\nwillingness to live in hiding, the nature of the offense resulting in a presumption of detention, and\nthe strength of the evidence, among other factors. The defense suggestion that the defendant’s\nprivate security guards should post cash in support of a bond does not change this calculus. There\nis no reason to believe that the defendant would be at all troubled by a security company in which\nshe has no personal stake losing $l million, especially if that sacrifice meant she could escape\nconviction and sentencing.

Under\nour system of justice, the need for the Court’s careful scrutiny of the government’s conduct, and\nfor the protection of the constitutional rights of a defendant facing the <span class=\"highlight\">equivalent</span> of a life\nsentence, is at its highest.

Rivera-Ventura, 72 F.3d 277, 28l (2d Cir. l995). That\nconcern is heightened here, where the government seeks to rely on the retroactive extension of a\ncriminal statute of limitations to prosecute a case based on conduct more than two decades old,\nwith litle, if any, evidence other than witness testimony. See Toussie, 397 U.S. at ll5\n(observing that statute of limitations “may also have the salutary effect of encouraging law\nenforcement officials promptly to investigate suspected criminal activity”).

In his affidavit, Edwards asserted, “[T]here was no possible way I could have\nbelieved that this state plea could affect the federal investigation or the rights of my clients in that\nfederal investigation.”\n\nIn Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel stated that the government “seemingly” deferred to\nEpstein’s atorneys’ requests not to notify the victims about the NPA, and that in sending the\nJanuary and May 2oo8 FBI leters, the government’s efforts “seem to have graduated from passive\nnondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.”**’ Although both the appellate\ncourt and district court focused on the FBI’s leters for which OPR concludes that neither Villafafia,\nSloman, nor Acosta was responsible, OPR considered the courts’ analyses in evaluating whether\nsimilar representations Villafafia made to the victims whom she interviewed on January 3l and\nFebruary l, 2oo8, and to Edwards, were misleading. Therefore, OPR considered whether\nVillafafia’s statements that the mater was “under investigation” and her failure to inform all of the\nvictims whom she interviewed or Edwards about the NPA violated FRPC 4-4.l(a), 4-8.4(c), or\n4-8.4(d).\n\nFRPC 4-4.l(a) prohibits an atorney from “knouingly mak[ing] a false statement of\nmaterial fact or law to a third person” during the representation of a client. The FRPC defines\n“knouingly” as “denot[ing] actual knouledge of the fact in question” and states that such\nknouledge may be “inferred from circumstances.”* The comment to FRPC 4-4.l states that\n“Tm |isrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or omissions that\nare the <span class=\"highlight\">equivalent</span> of affirmative false statements.” The comment references FRPC 4-8.4 “[flor\ndishonest conduct that does not amount to a false statement.” Like FRPC 4-4.l(a), Rule 4-8.4(c)\nrequires evidence that the atorney knew the statement in question was false. Under FRPC\n4-8.4(c), the intent requirement can be satisfied “merely by shouing that the conduct was\ndeliberate or knouing” and the “motive underlying the lawyer’s conduct is not determinative;\ninstead the issue is whether he or she purposefully acted.”*? In Feinberg, the court concluded that\nthe prosecutor violated FRPC 4-4.l and 4-8.4(c) and (d) by deliberately making untruthful\nstatements to a defense atorney, despite evidence that the prosecutor intended to help the\ndefendant by making the statements.*“° In this case, Villafafia was fully aware of the signed NPA\nwhen she interviewed the victims on January 3l and February l, 2oo8, and when she spoke to\nEdwards on the telephone, but she did not inform them specifically of the signed NPA. The\nquestion is whether this omission amounted to a knouing false statement or misrepresentation.\n\nOne difficulty is determining what Villafafia actually said during conversations that\nparticipants were asked to recall many years later. With respect to three of the victims whom she\ninterviewed in January and February 2oo8, Villafafia contended that she discussed the agreement\nwith them, even if she did not specifically refer to it as the NPA or discuss all of its terms, and as\naB7 Wild, 955 F.3d at ll99-l2oo.\n\n488 See R.

Villafafia’s\nmention of the agreement, even if not described in specific terms, would have been sufficient to\napprise those victims of the status of the federal investigation.\n\nNevertheless, Villafafia did not recall discussing the NPA specifically or in general terms\nwith other victims interviewed at that time, nor did she do so with Edwards or any other victim’s\natorney. OPR therefore considered whether the omission of information about the existence of\nthe NPA during these interactions rose to the level of professional misconduct in violation of FRPC\n4-4.l or 4-8.4.44!\n\nOPR evaluated Villafafia’s conduct in light of the comment to FRPC 4-4.l:\n\nA lawyer is required to be truthful when dealing with others on a\n\nclient’s behalf, but generally has no affirmative duty to inform an\n\nopposing party of relevant facts. A misrepresentation can occur if\n\nthe lawyer incorporates or affirms a statement of another person that\n\nthe lawyer knous is false. Misrepresentations can also occur by\n\npartially true but misleading statements or omissions that are the\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">equivalent</span> of affirmative false statements.\nThe victims and their atorneys were certainly not “opposing part[ies]” to the USAO, but the\ncomment indicates that the rule recognizes that omissions made during discussions with third\nparties, even of relevant facts, are not always treated as false statements.\n\nHere, the evidence does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made an affirmative false\nstatement to the victims or Edwards or that her omissions were “the <span class=\"highlight\">equivalent</span> of affirmative false\nstatements” about material facts. First, Villafafia told OPR that she believed the investigation was\nongoing and her statement to that effect truthful, and as discussed earlier in this Chapter, the\nevidence shous that Villafafia and the agents did continue to investigate the case until Epstein\nentered his guilty plea in state court in June 2oo8. Villafafia’s email correspondence with her\nsupervisors reflects her strong advocacy during that timeframe to declare Epstein in breach and to\ncharge him. The evidence similarly does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made any affirmative\nfalse statement to Edwards when she informed him of the state court plea, although she declined\nto provide additional information in response to his questions.*”\n\nSecond, in reaching its conclusion, OPR considered the full context in which Villafafia\ninteracted with the victims and Edwards. Prosecutors routinely make decisions about what\ninformation will be disclosed to witnesses, including victims, for a variety of strategic reasons. In\nmany cases, prosecutors must make difficult decisions about providing information to witnesses,\ni In Florida Bar v. Joy, the court affirmed a referee’s conclusion that Joy violated FRPCs 4-4.l(a) and 4-8.4(c)\n“for making false statements by omission of material facts in his representations [to counsel].” Florida Bar v. Joy,\n679 So. 2d ll65, ll66-68 (Fla. l996). See also Florida Bar re Webster, 647 So. 2d 8l6 (Fla. l994) (petition for\nremstatement denied due to “misrepresentation by omission’’).\n\n2 In Feinberg, 76o So. 2d at 938, the court found that an Assistant State Atorney lacked candor and violated\nethics rules when, after meeting with a defendant outside his atorney’s presence, the prosecutor falsely stated to the\ndefense atorney that he (the prosecutor) had not met with the defendant.\n278\nDOJ-OGR-oooo348o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003670.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o6- Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8 of 22\ncommission of the offense of conviction, rather than to the elements of the offense.” /d. at 39\n(emphasis added by Court). Because § 3283 contains no such modification to the words “offense\ninvolving,” Nijhawan is entirely consistent not only with the Supreme Court cases that interpret\n“offense involving” language as referring to elements of the offense, but also with a similar\ninterpretation of the language as it appears in § 3283.'°\n\nThe Eighth Circuit’s opinion in United States v. Coutentos, 65l F.3d 8o9 (8th Cir. 2oll),\nsquares perfectly with this approach. In Coutentos, the court held that § 3283 did not apply to a\ncharge of possession of child pornography, even though the facts of the case involved conduct\nthat went beyond the elements of child pornography and, according to the court, constituted\nsexual abuse. 65l F.3d at 8l7. The government’s atempt to distinguish Coutentos on the\nground that “this case does not involve the possession of child pornography” (Opp. 4l) misses\nthe point: In determining whether § 3283 applied, the court did not consider evidence of actual\nsexual abuse and instead confined its focus to the elements of the offense of possession of child\npomography. In other words, it used the “necessarily entails” approach. Similarly, § 3283\nrequires the Court here to look only to the elements of § 2422(a) and § 2423(a), and to disregard\nallegations of conduct beyond those elements.\n\nFinally, the government atempts to distinguish Bridges, in which the Supreme Court\nused the <span class=\"highlight\">equivalent</span> of a “necessarily entails” approach specifically with respect to a statute of\nlimitations, and argues that Bridges is an outlier based on its legislative history. But the\ngovernment fails to identify a single statute of limitations other than § 3283 in which a fact-\n\n° The government cites the Second Circuit’s statement in a footnote in Weingarten that the “offense involving”\n\nlanguage is “equally consistent with applying a fact-based approach.” Opp. 39-4o (quoting Weingarten, 865 F.3d at\n6o n.ll). Houever, Weingarten relied exclusively on Nijhawan for that proposition; like the government, it cited no\ncase in which a fact-based approach had been used to apply an “offense involving” statute other than § 3283. In any\nevent, the Second Circuit did not hold that a fact-based approach applies to § 3283; it held only, in the context of an\nineffective assistance claim, that it was “not obvious” which approach applies.

In his affidavit, Edwards asserted, “[T]here was no possible way I could have\nbelieved that this state plea could affect the federal investigation or the rights of my clients in that\nfederal investigation.”\n\nIn Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel stated that the government “seemingly” deferred to\nEpstein’s atorneys’ requests not to notify the victims about the NPA, and that in sending the\nJanuary and May 2oo8 FBI leters, the government’s efforts “seem to have graduated from passive\nnondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.”**’ Although both the appellate\ncourt and district court focused on the FBI’s leters for which OPR concludes that neither Villafafia,\nSloman, nor Acosta was responsible, OPR considered the courts’ analyses in evaluating whether\nsimilar representations Villafafia made to the victims whom she interviewed on January 3l and\nFebruary l, 2oo8, and to Edwards, were misleading. Therefore, OPR considered whether\nVillafafia’s statements that the mater was “under investigation” and her failure to inform all of the\nvictims whom she interviewed or Edwards about the NPA violated FRPC 4-4.l(a), 4-8.4(c), or\n4-8.4(d).\n\nFRPC 4-4.l(a) prohibits an atorney from “knouingly mak[ing] a false statement of\nmaterial fact or law to a third person” during the representation of a client. The FRPC defines\n“knouingly” as “denot[ing] actual knouledge of the fact in question” and states that such\nknouledge may be “inferred from circumstances.”* The comment to FRPC 4-4.l states that\n“Tm lisrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or omissions that\nare the <span class=\"highlight\">equivalent</span> of affirmative false statements.” The comment references FRPC 4-8.4 “[flor\ndishonest conduct that does not amount to a false statement.” Like FRPC 4-4.l(a), Rule 4-8.4(c)\nrequires evidence that the atorney knew the statement in question was false. Under FRPC\n4-8.4(c), the intent requirement can be satisfied “merely by shouing that the conduct was\ndeliberate or knouing” and the “motive underlying the lawyer’s conduct is not determinative;\ninstead the issue is whether he or she purposefully acted.”**? In Feinberg, the court concluded that\nthe prosecutor violated FRPC 4-4.l and 4-8.4(c) and (d) by deliberately making untruthful\nstatements to a defense atorney, despite evidence that the prosecutor intended to help the\ndefendant by making the statements.“° In this case, Villafafia was fully aware of the signed NPA\nwhen she interviewed the victims on January 3l and February l, 2oo8, and when she spoke to\nEdwards on the telephone, but she did not inform them specifically of the signed NPA. The\nquestion is whether this omission amounted to a knouing false statement or misrepresentation.\n\nOne difficulty is determining what Villafafia actually said during conversations that\nparticipants were asked to recall many years later. With respect to three of the victims whom she\ninterviewed in January and February 2oo8, Villafafia contended that she discussed the agreement\nwith them, even if she did not specifically refer to it as the NPA or discuss all of its terms, and as\naB7 Wild, 955 F.3d at ll99-l2oo.\n\n488 See R.

Villafafia’s\nmention of the agreement, even if not described in specific terms, would have been sufficient to\napprise those victims of the status of the federal investigation.\n\nNevertheless, Villafafia did not recall discussing the NPA specifically or in general terms\nwith other victims interviewed at that time, nor did she do so with Edwards or any other victim’s\natorney. OPR therefore considered whether the omission of information about the existence of\nthe NPA during these interactions rose to the level of professional misconduct in violation of FRPC\n4-4.l or 4-8.4.44!\n\nOPR evaluated Villafafia’s conduct in light of the comment to FRPC 4-4.l:\n\nA lawyer is required to be truthful when dealing with others on a\n\nclient’s behalf, but generally has no affirmative duty to inform an\n\nopposing party of relevant facts. A misrepresentation can occur if\n\nthe lawyer incorporates or affirms a statement of another person that\n\nthe lawyer knous is false. Misrepresentations can also occur by\n\npartially true but misleading statements or omissions that are the\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">equivalent</span> of affirmative false statements.\nThe victims and their atorneys were certainly not “opposing part[ies]” to the USAO, but the\ncomment indicates that the rule recognizes that omissions made during discussions with third\nparties, even of relevant facts, are not always treated as false statements.\n\nHere, the evidence does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made an affirmative false\nstatement to the victims or Edwards or that her omissions were “the <span class=\"highlight\">equivalent</span> of affirmative false\nstatements” about material facts. First, Villafafia told OPR that she believed the investigation was\nongoing and her statement to that effect truthful, and as discussed earlier in this Chapter, the\nevidence shous that Villafafia and the agents did continue to investigate the case until Epstein\nentered his guilty plea in state court in June 2oo8. Villafafia’s email correspondence with her\nsupervisors reflects her strong advocacy during that timeframe to declare Epstein in breach and to\ncharge him. The evidence similarly does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made any affirmative\nfalse statement to Edwards when she informed him of the state court plea, although she declined\nto provide additional information in response to his questions.*”\n\nSecond, in reaching its conclusion, OPR considered the full context in which Villafafia\ninteracted with the victims and Edwards. Prosecutors routinely make decisions about what\ninformation will be disclosed to witnesses, including victims, for a variety of strategic reasons. In\nmany cases, prosecutors must make difficult decisions about providing information to witnesses,\ni In Florida Bar v. Joy, the court affirmed a referee’s conclusion that Joy violated FRPCs 4-4.l(a) and 4-8.4(c)\n“for making false statements by omission of material facts in his representations [to counsel].” Florida Bar v. Joy,\n679 So. 2d ll65, ll66-68 (Fla. l996). See also Florida Bar re Webster, 647 So. 2d 8l6 (Fla. l994) (petition for\nremstatement denied due to “misrepresentation by omission’).\n\n2 In Feinberg, 76o So. 2d at 938, the court found that an Assistant State Atorney lacked candor and violated\nethics rules when, after meeting with a defendant outside his atorney’s presence, the prosecutor falsely stated to the\ndefense atorney that he (the prosecutor) had not met with the defendant.\n278\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005251.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 355 _ Filed lo/l8/2l Page2of5\nPage 2\n\n292 F.3d at l28; see also United States v. Kyles, 4o F.3d 5l9, 524 (2d Cir. l994) (stating that a\ndistrict court has “broad discretion whether to pose a defendant’s requested voir dire questions”).\nAlthough the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure contemplate that district courts may exercise\nthat discretion by permiting counsel to conduct the questioning of potential jurors, see Fed. R.\nCrim. P. 24(a), the usual practice is for the court to conduct its oun questioning, and federal courts\ngenerally have resisted efforts by counsel to expand their oun role. See, e.g., Lawes, 292 F.3d at\nl28 (noting the “long struggle between bench and bar” over juror questioning and observing that\n“federal courts have successfully resisted such atempts” by counsel to have a greater role). Courts\nare generally resistant to such efforts because “[c]ourt and counsel have somewhat different goals\nin voir dire.” Jd. As the Second Circuit has observed:\n\nThe court wants a fair and impartial jury to be chosen and to move\n\nexpeditiously to the presentation of evidence. Counsel want a jury\n\nfavorable to their cause—fair or not—and voir dire aids them in\n\nexercising peremptory challenges and challenges for cause.\n\nCounsel have an additional purpose in voir dire moreover and that\n\ninvolves exposing jurors to various arguments they intend to make\n\nat trial. Counsel view voir dire as an opportunity for advocacy\n\nsimilar to, albeit not the <span class=\"highlight\">equivalent</span> of, openings or summations.\nId.; see also United States v. Barnes, 6o4 F.2d l2l, l38 (2d Cir. l979) (“[T]he purpose of the voir\ndire is to ascertain disqualifications, not to afford individual analysis in depth to permit a party to\nchoose a jury that fits into some mold that he believes appropriate for his case.” (quotation marks\nand citation omited)).\n\nThe defendant offers no persuasive reason to abandon the customary practice in this\nDistrict,! and of federal courts generally, and to adopt an alternative procedure for this case.

The\nquestionnaires for the remaining seated jurors are integral to determining\nwhether this is a lone or recurring incident.\nAny original need for sealing the questionnaires for the seated jurors—for\ninstance, that they might be subject to atempts to influence their\ndeliberations—has nou passed.

Ms. Maxwell’s pre-sentence detention was\ntantamount to pre-sentence punishment.\n\nNor will Ms. Maxwell’s disproportionate pre-sentence punishment end nou that she is in\ngeneral population. Just recently, Ms. Maxwell was the target of a credible death threat from a\nfellou inmate.

The inmate who made the threat has been moved to\nthe SHU, presumably to protect Ms. Maxwell.’ This incident reflects the brutal reality that there\nare numerous prison inmates who would not hesitate to kill Ms. Maxwell — whether for money,\nfame, or simple “street cred.” Ms. Maxwell has effectively traded the stress of flashlight checks\nevery l5 minutes in the middle of the night while in isolation for the <span class=\"highlight\">equivalent</span> stress of having\nto sleep with one eye open - for as long as she is housed with other inmates.

Based on the underpinnings of punishment and the principle of proportionality, Ms.\nMaxwell should be given hard-time credit for the time she served in restricted and isolated\ndetention.

There is nothing\npunitive about applying the 2oo4 Guidelines, which apply here as a mater of law. If anything, the\nfact that the defendant will be sentenced under the 2oo4 Guidelines, and not the higher range under\nthe 2o2l Guidelines, should be a factor that warrants a higher sentence. Indeed, the Supreme Court\nhas expressly noted that sentencing courts may consider subsequent increases in offense levels for\nprecisely that purpose. See Peugh, 569 U.S. at 549.\n\nB. The Four-Point Leadership Enhancement Applies\n\nThe Government agrees with the Probation Office that the enhancement in U.S.S.G.\n§ 3Bl.l applies because the defendant was the organizer or leader of a criminal activity that was\n“otherwise extensive.” The defendant’s conspiracy spanned at least five victims in three states,\nthe United Kingdom, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, including at Epstein’s various properties, which\nthe defendant ran, over the course of a decade. It involved the participation of numerous members\nof the defendant and Epstein’s staff, whether knouing or unknouing, and the use of minor victims\nto recruit other minor victims. See U.S.S.G. § 3Bl.l app. n.3 (“In assessing whether an\norganization is ‘otherwise extensive,’ all persons involved during the course of the entire offense\nare to be considered,” and use of “the unknouing services of many outsiders could be considered\nextensive.”). For instance, Carolyn testified that she was recruited by Virginia and that Carolyn\nrecruited other minor victims. Juan Alessi testified that he was driving when the defendant stopped\nto recruit Virginia. Two pilots testified about transporting minor victims on Epstein’s planes. That\nalone is five individuals involved in the criminal activity, without even counting the defendant\nherself, Epstein, and Sarah Kellen. See United States v. Kent, 82l F.3d 362, 369 (2d Cir. 2ol6)\n(explaining that a scheme is “otherwise extensive” if it involves “the functional <span class=\"highlight\">equivalent</span>” of\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo56o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010655.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document672 Filed o6/24/22 Page 64 of 68\nCommitee, I oversaw the drafting of the current version of the Prosecution Function Standards\nand participated in drafting and discussing prosecutors’ candor obligations in particular.\n\nIn general, as “ministers of justice,” prosecutors have more demanding candor obligations\nthan other lawyers. Prosecution Function Standards, Standard 3-l.4(a) states: “In light of the 7\nprosecutor’s public responsibilities, broad authority and discretion, the prosecutor has a heightened\nduty of candor to the courts .. ..” Prosecutors’ candor obligations are not fully incorporated in the\nprofessional conduct rules or in courts’ sanctions decisions. To a significant extent, courts expect\ncandor from prosecutors regardless of whether the expectations are fully incorporated in\nenforceable law or whether a lack of candor is sanctionable. In rendering this opinion, I address\nwhat courts should expect of prosecutors as “ministers of Justice” — expectations that are not fully\ncodified in professional conduct rules and sanctions decisions.\n\nIf the Government were to call Ms. Giuffre as its witness in connection with the sentencing,\nthen it would have the ordinary obligation first to satisfy itself of the truthfulness of her testimony\nand then to disclose impeachment material. See, e.g., NY Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule\n3.8(b); ABA Prosecution Function Standards, Standard 3-l -4(b) (“The prosecutor should not make\na statement of fact or law, or offer evidence, that the prosecutor does not reasonably believe to be\ntrue . . ..”) id., Standard 3-5.4(c) (“a prosecutor should make timely disclosure to the defense of\ninformation [that tends to impeach the government’s witnesses] that is knoun to the prosecutor,\nregardless of whether the prosecutor believes it is likely to change the result of the proceeding.”).\n\nI assume that the Government does not intend to make Ms. Giuffre its witness, and that\ninsofar as Ms. Giuffre makes a presentation to the court, she will do so pursuant to her statutory\nright as a putative victim. Even if so, in my judgment, <span class=\"highlight\">equivalent</span> candor obligations arise if the\nGovernment were to rely on Ms. Giuffre’s statement in its submissions to the court, thereby\nessentially making her its witness. Before asking the court to credit Ms. Giuffre’s information, the\nGovernment should consider available evidence bearing on to her credibility, including deposition\ntestimony that, it has been told, raises serious questions concerning the credibility of her relevant\ntestimony. The prosecutors should not rely on Ms. Giuffre’s information unless, in the language\nof Standard 3-l.4(b), they “reasonably believe [it] to be true.” Their belief in Ms. Giuffre’s\nreliability would not be reasonable unless they consider readily available information that, they\nhave been told, discredits her and, given the totality of the circumstances, reasonably find her\naccount truthful.\n\nFinally, even assuming the Government does not intend to advance or rely on Ms. Giuffre’s\nstatement or testimony, its duty of candor to the court may be implicated, because prosecutors bear\nsome responsibility to protect the sentencing court from relying on false information. As I have\npreviously writen: “Since the judge has no independent investigative authority, the sentencing\njudge must rely in large part on the prosecution for the relevant facts about the offense. If any\nlawyer must make full and frank disclosure of factual maters relevant to the sentencing court’s\ndecision-making, it is surely the prosecutor.” Green, Candor in Criminal Advocacy, supra, at 446;\ncf. United States v. E.V., 5oo F.3d 747, 754 n.l2 (8 Cir. 2oo7) (referring to “prosecutors’\nobligation to apprise the court of facts relevant to sentencing”). Consequently, the Office cannot\nconsciously disregard Ms. Giuffre’s deposition testimony bearing on the credibility of her\nsubmission to the court; further, if the Office concludes that Ms. Giuffre’s submission is unreliable,\n\n2\nSDNY_GM_o27759oo\nSUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER PARAGRAPHS 7, 8, 9, lo, l5, and l7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo655\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010756.jpg": "Castat2o:2oooSMBBAKINDOncureiSs3 AleiOaW2522 Reape Babifh353\nThe right to public access promises “immediate” and “contemporaneous”\naccess.

Their opinions also state that any\nextradition proceeding would be resolved promptly. (Exs. T-V).\n\n¢ Lack of corroborating evidence. The government represented to the Court that it\nhad “contemporaneous documents,” including “diary entries” in support of its case.\n(Dkt. 4 at 5). The defense has nou reviewed the discovery produced to date,\nincluding all of the documents that the government described as the core of its case\nagainst Ms. Maxwell. As explained more fully belou, the discovery contains no\nmeaningful documentary corroboration as to Maxwell and only a small number of\ndocuments from the time period of the conspiracy charged in the indictment.

Far from creating a flight risk, the lack of corroboration\nonly reinforces Ms. Maxwell's conviction that she has been falsely accused and\nstrengthens her long-standing desire to face the allegations against her and clear\nher name in court.\n¢ Oppressive conditions of confinement. Ms. Maxwell has nou been detained\nfor over l5o days in the <span class=\"highlight\">equivalent</span> of solitary confinement since she was\nindicted and arrested on July 2, 2o2o, despite the fact that she is not a suicide\nrisk and has not received a single disciplinary infraction. The draconian\nconditions to which Ms. Maxwell is subjected are not only unjust and\npunitive, but also impair her ability to review the voluminous discovery\nproduced by the government and to participate meaningfully in the\npreparation of her defense. Furthermore, the recent COVID-l9 outbreak\nat the MDC threatens her safety and well-being.\nMs. Maxwell Should Be Placed on Restrictive Bail Conditions\nDuring her more than five months in isolation, Ms. Maxwell has had to watch as she has\nbeen relentlessly atacked in a deluge of media articles that spiked over a year ago when Epstein\n? Ms. Maxwell has not yet signed these waivers because we have not been able to visit her in the MDC to obtain her\nsignature since she was quarantined over two weeks ago.

Here, detention is warranted\nnot only because of the defendant’s financial means, but also her foreign ties, her skill at and\nwillingness to live in hiding, the nature of the offense resulting in a presumption of detention, and\nthe strength of the evidence, among other factors. The defense suggestion that the defendant’s\nprivate security guards should post cash in support of a bond does not change this calculus. There\nis no reason to believe that the defendant would be at all troubled by a security company in which\nshe has no personal stake losing $l million, especially if that sacrifice meant she could escape\nconviction and sentencing. Accordingly, release to the <span class=\"highlight\">equivalent</span> of a “privately funded jail” is\nnot warranted here. /d. at 83.\n\nRelatedly, as the Court previously recognized (Tr. 87-88), a GPS monitoring bracelet offers\nlitle value for a defendant who poses such a significant flight risk because it is does nothing to\nprevent the defendant’s flight once it has been removed. At best, home confinement and electronic\nmonitoring would reduce a defendant’s head start after cuting the bracelet. See United States v.\nBanki, lo Cr. oo8 (JFK), Dkt. 7 (S.D.N.Y.

This is an adversary system, of course. But\nwhen the government’s representations about the conditions of\nconfinement continue to be demonstrably and admitedly false, there\nneeds to be an intervention.

Indeed, the entire premise of Landgraf is that certain statutes must be\npresumed (absent a clear statement from Congress) to apply only prospectively,\neven though retroactive application would be entirely constitutional:\n\nBut while the constitutional impediments to retroactive civil\n\nlegislation are nou modest, prospectivity remains the appropriate\n\ndefault rule. Because it accords with widely held intuitions about\n\nhou statutes ordinarily operate, a presumption against retroactivity\n\nwill generally coincide with legislative and public\n\nexpectations. Requiring clear intent assures that Congress itself has\n\naffirmatively considered the potential unfairness of retroactive\n\napplication and determined that it is an acceptable price *273 to pay\n\nfor the countervailing benefits.\nLandgraf, 5ll U.S. at 272-73 (emphasis in original; bold added). '! This view was\nechoed by no less a jurist than Judge Calabresi, who opined that “[Landgraf’s]\nanti-retroactivity presumption is triggered by statutes whose retroactive\napplication, while not the <span class=\"highlight\">equivalent</span> of criminal ex post facto, nevertheless would\n\"! Landgraf cannot be distinguished in this regard simply because it was a civil\ncase. Non-criminal statutes, like criminal statutes, can be unconstitutionally\nretroactive (i.e. under the Takings or Due Process Clauses), but the constitutional\nstandard is different from the Landgraf test. See E. Enterprises v. Apfel, 524 U.S.\n498 (l998). Conversely, some criminal statutes are presumed not to apply\nretroactively even though doing so would be perfectly constitutional.\n\n6o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll22\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021330.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONG 3536o38, Pagel58 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l56 of 348\nis subject to all rules of the court.!”? Atorney Admission Rule 6(b)(2)(A) makes clear that\natorneys practicing before the court are subject to the Florida Bar’s Rules of Professional Conduct\n(FRPC).

FRPC 4-l.l —- Competence\nFRPC 4-l.l requires that a lawyer provide competent representation to a client.?°\nCompetent representation requires the legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation\nreasonably necessary for the representation. A comment to the rule clarifies that the factors\nrelevant to determining a lawyer’s competence to handle a particular mater include “the relative\ncomplexity and specialized nature of the mater, the lawyer’s general experience, the lawyer’s\ntraining and experience in the field in question, the preparation and study the lawyer is able to give\nthe mater, and whether it is feasible to refer the mater to, or associate or consult with, a lawyer\nof established competence in the field.” The comment further notes that “[i]n many instances the\nrequired proficiency is that of a general practitioner.” With respect to particular maters,\ncompetence requires inquiry into and analysis of the factual and legal elements of the problem.\nThe comment to Rule 4-l.l explains that “[t]he required atention and preparation are determined\nin part by what is at stake; major litigation and complex transactions ordinarily require more\nextensive treatment than maters of lesser complexity and consequence.”\n2. FRPC 4-l.3 — Diligence\nFRPC 4-l.3 specifies that a lawyer should act with reasonable diligence and promptness in\nrepresenting a client. A comment to this rule explains, “A lawyer should pursue a mater on behalf\nof a client despite opposition, obstruction, or personal inconvenience to the lawyer and take\nwhatever lawful and ethical measures are required to vindicate a client’s cause or endeavor.” A\nlawyer must exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but is not required “to press for every\nadvantage that might be realized for a client.”\n3. FRPC 4-4.l — Candor in Dealing with Others\nFRPC 4-4.l prohibits a lawyer from knouingly making a false statement of material fact\nor law to a third person during the course of representation of a client. A comment to this rule\nexplains that “[mJisrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or\nomissions that are the <span class=\"highlight\">equivalent</span> of affirmative false statements,” and “[w]hether a particular\nstatement should be regarded as one of fact can depend on the circumstances.”\ntee See also 28 U.S.C. § 53oB(a), providing that government atorneys are subject to state laws and state and\nlocal federal court rules governing atorneys in each state where the government atorney engages in his duties.\n2oo The federal prosecutor does not have an individual “client,” but rather represents the people of the United\nStates.

This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated\nany plans to do so. It also was well before Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with\ndefense counsel Lefkouitz, which received strong public and media criticism. OPR also\nconsidered significant the fact that although the USAO made numerous concessions in the course\nof negotiating the final NPA, the USAO did not accede to the defense request that the USAO end\nfederal involvement altogether and return the mater to the state authorities to handle as they saw\nfit, and the USAO refused to eliminate its requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender,\ndespite a strong push by the defense that it do so.\n3s Subject and Witness Interviews and Contemporaneous Records\nIdentified Case-Specific Considerations Relating to Evidence, Legal\nTheories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims\n\nAcosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content\nof discussions about the challenges presented by a potential federal prosecution or reasons for\nAcosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA, but they and Villafafia\nidentified for OPR several case-specific factors, unrelated to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that\neither did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely\ninfluenced Acosta’s decision-making. These considerations included assessment of the\nevidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims. For the most part, houever,\nthese factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge\ndisposition, but do not directly explain why Acosta chose to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough a guilty plea in state court. That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns\nabout intruding into an area he believed was traditionally handled by state law enforcement\nauthorities.\n\nIn a declaration submited to the district court in 2ol7 in connection with the CVRA\nlitigation, Villafafia explained the USAO’s rationale for terminating the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA:\n\nPrior to the Office making its decision to direct me to engage in\n\nnegotiations with Epstein’s counsel, I discussed the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management,\n\nand informed them that most of the victims had expressed\n\nsignificant concerns about having their identities disclosed. ... It is\n\nmy understanding from these and other discussions that these\n\nfactors, that is, the various strengths and weaknesses of the case and\n\nthe various competing interests of the many different victims\n\n(including the privacy concerns expressed by many), together with\n\nthe Office’s desire to obtain a guaranteed sentence of incarceration\n\nfor Epstein, the <span class=\"highlight\">equivalent</span> of uncontested restitution for the victims,\nAcosta to improperly benefit Epstein or would have remained silent if they suspected that Acosta, or any of their\ncolleagues, was motivated by improper influences.\n\nl44\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l344\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021455.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Page25 of 2l7\nSA-279\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 279 of 348\n\n(d) Whether the proposed plea involves confidential information or conditions.\n(e) Whether there is another need for confidentiality.\n\n(f) Whether the victim is a possible witness in the case and the effect that\nrelaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.\n\nI. FLORIDA RULES OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT\n\nA, FRPC 4-4.l — Candor in Dealing with Others\n\nFRPC 4-4.l prohibits a lawyer from knouingly making a false statement of material fact\nor law to a third person during the course of representation of a client. A comment to this rule\nexplains that “[mJisrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or\nomissions that are the <span class=\"highlight\">equivalent</span> of affirmative false statements,” and “[w]hether a particular\nstatement should be regarded as one of fact can depend on the circumstances.”\n\nB. FRPC 4-8.4 — Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice\n\nFRPC 4-8.4(c) states that a lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud,\ndeceit, or misrepresentation.\n\nFRPC 4-8.4(d) prohibits a lawyer from engaging in conduct in connection with the practice\nof law that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\n\nAs previously noted, courts have determined that FRPC 4-8.4(d) is not limited to conduct\nthat occurs in a judicial proceeding, but can be applied to “conduct in connection with the practice\nof law.” Frederick, 756 So. 2d at 87; see also Shankman, 4l So. 3d at l72.\n\n253\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l455\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021479.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3o3 3536o39, Page49 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o3 of 348\natend the hearing. In his affidavit, Edwards asserted, “[T]here was no possible way I could have\nbelieved that this state plea could affect the federal investigation or the rights of my clients in that\nfederal investigation.”\n\nIn Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel stated that the government “seemingly” deferred to\nEpstein’s atorneys’ requests not to notify the victims about the NPA, and that in sending the\nJanuary and May 2oo8 FBI leters, the government’s efforts “seem to have graduated from passive\nnondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.”*3’ Although both the appellate\ncourt and district court focused on the FBI’s leters for which OPR concludes that neither Villafafia,\nSloman, nor Acosta was responsible, OPR considered the courts’ analyses in evaluating whether\nsimilar representations Villafafia made to the victims whom she interviewed on January 3l and\nFebruary l, 2oo8, and to Edwards, were misleading. Therefore, OPR considered whether\nVillafafia’s statements that the mater was “under investigation” and her failure to inform all of the\nvictims whom she interviewed or Edwards about the NPA violated FRPC 4-4.l(a), 4-8.4(c), or\n4-8.4(d).\n\nFRPC 4-4.l(a) prohibits an atorney from “knouingly mak[ing] a false statement of\nmaterial fact or law to a third person” during the representation of a client. The FRPC defines\n“knouingly” as “denot[ing] actual knouledge of the fact in question” and states that such\nknouledge may be “inferred from circumstances.”*78 The comment to FRPC 4-4.l states that\n“Tml]isrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or omissions that\nare the <span class=\"highlight\">equivalent</span> of affirmative false statements.” The comment references FRPC 4-8.4 “[flor\ndishonest conduct that does not amount to a false statement.” Like FRPC 4-4.l(a), Rule 4-8.4(c)\nrequires evidence that the atorney knew the statement in question was false. Under FRPC\n4-8.4(c), the intent requirement can be satisfied “merely by shouing that the conduct was\ndeliberate or knouing” and the “motive underlying the lawyer’s conduct is not determinative;\ninstead the issue is whether he or she purposefully acted.”**? In Feinberg, the court concluded that\nthe prosecutor violated FRPC 4-4.l and 4-8.4(c) and (d) by deliberately making untruthful\nstatements to a defense atorney, despite evidence that the prosecutor intended to help the\ndefendant by making the statements.**° In this case, Villafafia was fully aware of the signed NPA\nwhen she interviewed the victims on January 3l and February l, 2oo8, and when she spoke to\nEdwards on the telephone, but she did not inform them specifically of the signed NPA. The\nquestion is whether this omission amounted to a knouing false statement or misrepresentation.\n\nOne difficulty is determining what Villafafia actually said during conversations that\nparticipants were asked to recall many years later. With respect to three of the victims whom she\ninterviewed in January and February 2oo8, Villafafia contended that she discussed the agreement\nwith them, even if she did not specifically refer to it as the NPA or discuss all of its terms, and as\n437 Wild, 955 F.3d at ll99-l2oo.\n\n438 See R.

Villafafia’s\nmention of the agreement, even if not described in specific terms, would have been sufficient to\napprise those victims of the status of the federal investigation.\n\nNevertheless, Villafafia did not recall discussing the NPA specifically or in general terms\nwith other victims interviewed at that time, nor did she do so with Edwards or any other victim’s\natorney. OPR therefore considered whether the omission of information about the existence of\nthe NPA during these interactions rose to the level of professional misconduct in violation of FRPC\n4-4.l or 4-8.4.44\n\nOPR evaluated Villafafia’s conduct in light of the comment to FRPC 4-4.l:\n\nA lawyer is required to be truthful when dealing with others on a\n\nclient’s behalf, but generally has no affirmative duty to inform an\n\nopposing party of relevant facts. A misrepresentation can occur if\n\nthe lawyer incorporates or affirms a statement of another person that\n\nthe lawyer knous is false. Misrepresentations can also occur by\n\npartially true but misleading statements or omissions that are the\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">equivalent</span> of affirmative false statements.\nThe victims and their atorneys were certainly not “opposing part[ies]” to the USAO, but the\ncomment indicates that the rule recognizes that omissions made during discussions with third\nparties, even of relevant facts, are not always treated as false statements.\n\nHere, the evidence does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made an affirmative false\nstatement to the victims or Edwards or that her omissions were “the <span class=\"highlight\">equivalent</span> of affirmative false\nstatements” about material facts. First, Villafafia told OPR that she believed the investigation was\nongoing and her statement to that effect truthful, and as discussed earlier in this Chapter, the\nevidence shous that Villafafia and the agents did continue to investigate the case until Epstein\nentered his guilty plea in state court in June 2oo8. Villafafia’s email correspondence with her\nsupervisors reflects her strong advocacy during that timeframe to declare Epstein in breach and to\ncharge him. The evidence similarly does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made any affirmative\nfalse statement to Edwards when she informed him of the state court plea, although she declined\nto provide additional information in response to his questions.*”\n\nSecond, in reaching its conclusion, OPR considered the full context in which Villafafia\ninteracted with the victims and Edwards. Prosecutors routinely make decisions about what\ninformation will be disclosed to witnesses, including victims, for a variety of strategic reasons. In\nmany cases, prosecutors must make difficult decisions about providing information to witnesses,\n44l In Florida Bar v. Joy, the court affirmed a referee’s conclusion that Joy violated FRPCs 4-4.l(a) and 4-8.4(c)\n“for making false statements by omission of material facts in his representations [to counsel].” Florida Bar v. Joy,\n679 So. 2d ll65, ll66-68 (Fla. l996).
