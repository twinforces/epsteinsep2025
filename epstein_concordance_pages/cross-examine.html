(internal quotation marks omited). Accordingly, in this Circuit, District Courts regularly\naccept the Government’s proffer regarding its evidence when considering a bail application. And\nhere, of course, the Court has not only the Government’s proffer but also the grand jury’s\ndetermination that probable cause exists as to each of the charged offenses. Defense counsel’s\nrequest to deviate from that ordinary practice appears to be a thinly veiled atempt at a fishing\nexpedition through which the defense hopes to obtain early Jencks Act material and a pretrial\nopportunity to <span class=\"highlight\">cross-examine</span> the Government’s witnesses, including victims of sexual abuse. It\nis to avoid such a fishing expedition, among other reasons, that courts in this Circuit proceed by\nproffer when considering bail motions. See United States v. Martir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll45 (2d Cir.\nl986) (“a detention hearing is not to serve as a mini-trial . . . or as a discovery tool for the\ndefendant”). The S2 Indictment offers no reason to deviate from that practice.\n%* %* %*\n\nFor the reasons above, the Government respectfully submits that trial can and should\nproceed as scheduled on July l2, 2o2l. Accordingly, the Government respectfully requests that\nthe in-person arraignment on the S2 Indictment also serve as a conference at which to finalize a\nschedule for supplemental pretrial motion briefing as well as a schedule for trial-related\nsubmissions.\n\nRespectfully submited,\nAUDREY STRAUSS\nUnited States Atorney\nMaurene Comey / Alison Moe\nLara Pomerantz / Andrew Rohrbach\nAssistant United States Atorneys\nSouthern District of New York\nTel: (2l2) 637-2324\nCc: All Counsel of Record (By ECF)\nDOJ-OGR-oooo292o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003011.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 77 of 239\n\nto the extent the passage of time affects the memories of witnesses who testify at trial, the\ndefendant will have an opportunity to <span class=\"highlight\">cross-examine</span> such witnesses. See United States v.\nHarrison, 764 F. Supp. 29, 32 (S.D.N.Y. l99l) (noting that “the passage of time does affect\nwitnesses’ memories and it may be relevant to the credibility of their testimony” and that the\nGovernment also faces potential harms from the passage of time).'® Accordingly, the defendant’s\nbald assertions regarding diminished memories of potential witnesses are speculative and, thus,\nfall short of the proof of actual prejudice required by the Supreme Court’s standard in Marion.\n\nThe defendant also claims that because of the delay in the prosecution, she does not have\naccess to certain exculpatory documentary evidence. (Def. Mot. 7 at l2-l4). Once again, this\nargument is entirely speculative. The defendant hypothesizes that if she had access to certain\ndocumentary evidence (some of which, such as travel records, has been produced in discovery),\nor evidence which she herself should have access to (e.g., her oun emails from l994 to l997, her\noun phone records from l994 to l997, and her oun travel records from l994 to l997), this\nevidence would have helped her. She offers no proof or basis for concluding that the records\nwould be helpful. Even if such records were helpful, dismissal of the Indictment would be too\nextreme a measure in light of the relative significance of this form of evidence to other proof in\nthe case. Thus, the defendant’s claim that she no longer has access to certain evidence is not a\nproper basis to dismiss the Indictment. See United States v. Dornau, 356 F. Supp. lo9l, lo94\n(S.D.N.Y. l973) (“A bare allegation that records have been lost or destroyed, which might relate\n'8 The Government notes that it faces the same potential harms from the passage of time as does\nany party, including loss of witnesses through death or disappearance, diminishment of memories\nover the passage of time, and loss of evidence.

Mississippi, 4lo U.S. 284, 294 (l973). And as noted, the defendant cites no legal\nauthority supporting the proposition that the Government’s actions during its investigation have\nsomehou deprived her of a fair trial or otherwise violated her due process rights. In short, none\nof Maxwell’s allegations of misconduct rises to the level of a due process violation.\n\nDismissal of Counts Five and Six of the Indictment would be all the more unwarranted\nhere, where there was no outrageous Government misconduct and where the defendant cannot\nshou that the Government’s behavior prejudiced her defense or legal representation.

The Court Should Not Exercise Its Inherent Authority to Order\nSuppression\n\nThe defendant urges the Court to exercise its inherent authority to order suppression. This\n\nCourt should decline the defendant’s invitation to exercise this sparingly used pouer.\na. Applicable Law\n\n“{T]he Supreme Court has recognized three purposes for the supervisory pouers, ‘to\nimplement a remedy for violation of recognized rights, to preserve judicial integrity by ensuring\nthat a conviction rests on appropriate considerations validly before a jury, and finally, as a remedy\n\nlo9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o7o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003076.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l42 of 239\nFranks, 438 U.S. at l7l (“To mandate an evidentiary hearing, the challenger’s atack must be more\nthan conclusory and must be supported by more than a mere desire to <span class=\"highlight\">cross-examine</span>.”).

Discussion\n\nIn an alternative effort to suppress the materials obtained pursuant to the subpoena, the\ndefendant argues that an evidentiary hearing is warranted to inquire into the Government’s\n“misrepresentations” to Chief Judge McMahon. (Def. Mot. 3 at l6). Houever, as discussed\nextensively above, Maxwell’s motion is litle more than speculation and innuendo, itself rooted in\na lone news article that, as described above, is not fully accurate. She otherwise presents no\nadmissible evidence, affidavits, or other materials supporting the breathless accusations contained\nin her motion papers. As such, because the defendant does not include “an affidavit of someone\nwith personal knouledge of the underlying facts,” Shaw, 26o F. Supp. 2d at 57o, and because the\n\nll5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o76\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003919.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 227 Filed o4/2l/2l Page2of3\nPage 2\n\nin question include, among other things, depositions of potential witnesses.' If the defense were\nto put these documents at issue at trial, during either the defense case or the cross-examination of\nwitnesses, the Government reserves its right to use relevant materials from this set for any purpose\npermissible under the Rules of Evidence. Likewise, the Government has no objection to the\ndefense using these materials at trial for any permissible purpose under the Rules of Evidence,\nincluding to <span class=\"highlight\">cross-examine</span> trial witnesses.\n\nMoreover, the Government notes that, even if these materials were suppressed — which the\nGovernment submits is inappropriate here — the Government would nonetheless have the right to\noffer these materials under certain circumstances. For example, it is well established that a\ncriminal defendant who testifies in her oun defense may be impeached with materials that would\notherwise be subject to suppression. United States v. Trzaska, ll F.3d lol9, lo26 (2d Cir. l997)\n(“The Supreme Court has held that illegally acquired evidence may be used to impeach defendants\nwho testify in their oun defense.”) (citing Walder v. United States, 347 U.S. 62, 64-66 (l954)).\nAs the Supreme Court has explained, the exclusionary rule must be balanced with the truth-seeking\nfunctions of a trial:\n\nIt is one thing to say that the Government cannot make an\n\naffirmative use of evidence unlawfully obtained. It is quite another\n\nto say that the defendant can turn the illegal method by which\n\nevidence in the Government’s possession was obtained to his oun\n\nadvantage, and provide himself with a shield against contradiction\n\nof his untruths. Such an extension of the Weeks doctrine would be\n\na perversion of the Fourth Amendment.\n' The Government further notes that many of the materials in the file in question are duplicates of\nmaterials the Government has obtained through other sources. For example, the file contains\nmaterials that appear to have been obtained from third parties and law enforcement agencies. At\ntrial, the Government is likely to offer documents it has obtained during its investigation through\nother sources, even though those materials happen to be contained in duplicate in the file in\nquestion.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo39l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003920.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 227 Filed o4/2l/2l Page3of3\nPage 3\nWalder, 347 U.S. at 65.\n\nAccordingly, the Court need not resolve the pending suppression motions, because the\nGovernment does not intend to use these materials in its case-in-chief. Houever, to the extent the\ndefendant puts these materials at issue at trial either through the defense case or cross-examination,\nthe Government reserves its right to use these materials, for example, to <span class=\"highlight\">cross-examine</span> the\ndefendant, or to offer prior consistent statements of witnesses, should it be appropriate to do so.\nIn addition, the Government further reserves its right to use these materials at trial for any purpose\nthat would be permissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence, even assuming these materials\nwere suppressed.\n\nRespectfully submited,\nAUDREY STRAUSS\nUnited States Atorney\nBy: ___/s\nAlison Moe / Maurene Comey\nLara Pomerantz / Andrew Rohrbach\nAssistant United States Atorneys\nSouthern District of New York\nCe: All Counsel of Record (By ECF)\nDOJ-OGR-oooo392o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005398.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page5of54\nprotect against unnecessary public disclosure of their identities, in order to protect the Minor\nVictims from potential harassment from the media and others, undue embarrassment, and other\nadverse consequences.\n\nSpecifically, the Government requests that (l) that Minor Victim-l, Minor Victim-3, and\ncertain witnesses related to them be referred to at trial using only pseudonyms; (2) Minor\nVictim-4, Minor Victim-6, and certain witnesses related to them be referred to at trial using only\ntheir first names; (3) the Court preclude the defense from eliciting personally identifying details\nof those witnesses; and (4) the Court seal exhibits that contain the first and/or last names of\nwitnesses which are not otherwise permited to be stated at trial.

Figueroa, 548 F.3d 222, 227 (2d Cir. 2oo8).\nThis right, houever, is not absolute. A defendant’s rights under the Confrontation Clause must\nyield to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process. See, e.g., id. For\ninstance, trial courts have “wide latitude . . . to impose reasonable limits ... on. . . cross-\nexamination based on concerns about, among other things, harassment, prejudice, . . . or the\nwitness’s safety.” United States v.

The Government is\nable to introduce the defendant’s statements as statements of an opposing party under Federal\nRule of Evidence 8ol(d)(2)(A). See Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(2)(A) (defining as “not hearsay” a\nstatement “offered against an opposing party” and “made by the party”). But the Federal Rules\ncontain no parallel provision for the defendant. See Marin, 669 F.2d at 84. Instead, if the\ndefendant wishes to place her oun statements before the jury, she must testify so the\nGovernment may <span class=\"highlight\">cross-examine</span> her. See United States v. Yousef, 327 F.3d 56, l53 (2d Cir.\n2oo3) (holding that defendant “could have testified to everything asserted in his statement, [but]\nhe could not offer the document itself for the truth of the mater asserted”), overruled on other\ngrounds by Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U.S. 778 (2oo9).\n\nNotwithstanding the hearsay bar, a defendant may in limited circumstances invoke the\nso-called “rule of completeness” to require the introduction of additional portions of his or her\noun out-of-court statement when the Government offers excerpts of it. See Fed. R. Evid. lo6\n(“If a party introduces all or part of a writing or recorded statement, an adverse party may require\nthe introduction, at that time, of any other part—or any other writing or recorded statement—that\nin fairness ought to be considered at the same time.”). “Under this principle, even though a\nstatement may be hearsay, an ‘omited portion of [the] statement must be placed in evidence if\nnecessary to explain the admited portion, to place the admited portion in context, to avoid\nmisleading the jury, or to ensure fair and impartial understanding of the admited portion.’”\nUnited States v.

To the extent the government seeks a pretrial ruling that a// prior consistent\nstatements may be admited after any atack on the accusers’ credibility, this Court should deny\nsuch a request.\nIW. EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT ABOUT PRIOR CHARGING DECISIONS AND\n\nTHE COURSE OF PRIOR INVESTIGATIONS IS ADMISSIBLE\n\n“The right to call witnesses in order to present a meaningful defense at a criminal trial is\na fundamental constitutional right secured by both the Compulsory Process Clause of the Sixth\nAmendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as well as by the Due\nProcess Clause of the Fifth Amendment.” United States v. Percoco, l3 F.4th l58, l77 (2d Cir.\n2o2l) (internal citations and quotation marks omited). “The right of an accused in a criminal\ntrial to due process is, in essence, the right to a fair opportunity to defend against the State’s\naccusations. The rights to confront and <span class=\"highlight\">cross-examine</span> witnesses and to call witnesses in one’s\noun behalf have long been recognized as essential to due process.” Chambers v. Mississippi,\n4lo U.S. 284, 294 (l973).\n\nThe government seeks to cripple Ms. Maxwell’s ability to present a meaningful defense\nto the charges by trying to preclude evidence and argument that is relevant and admissible and\ncentral to Ms. Maxwell’s defense. The government argues that Ms. Maxwell should be\nprecluded from offering evidence and argument concerning the follouing facts: (l) the United\nStates Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida (““USAO-SDFL”) entered into a\nNon-Prosecution Agreement (“NPA”) with Jeffrey Epstein, which resolved the USAO-\nSDFL/Palm Beach FBI investigation into Epstein (the “Florida Investigation”) in 2oo8; (2) the\nUSAO-SDFL did not charge Ms. Maxwell in its proposed indictment and did not immunize her\nby name in the NPA; and (3) the United States Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nNew York (““USAO-SDNY”) charged only Epstein in the first indictment in this case, and did\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo549l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005581.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 27 of 4o\nparticular set of circumstances, and none address evidentiary rulings. Instead, these cases concern\nBrady errors involving the withholding of exculpatory information, such as a statement in which\na witness at trial stated that he “did not see the perpetrator’s face,” Lindsey v. King, 769 F.2d lo34,\nlo36 (Sth Cir. l985), or evidence pointing touard an alternative perpetrator, Bouen v. Maynard,\n799 F.2d 593, 6l2 (loth Cir. l986). See also Kyles, 5l4 U.S. at 445-46 (confidential informant\n“essential to [the Government’s] investigation” made statements “replete with inconsistencies”).\nIn addition to the obvious exculpatory value of this information, the courts explained that it would\nbe used to “atack[] the reliability of the investigation.” Kyles, 5l4 U.S. at 446.\n\nThe defense would rest a pile of irrelevant evidence on this slender reed. In their view,\nfrom the principle that the defense can atack the “thoroughness” of an investigation, they may\nelicit any information aimed at explaining—and atacking—the decisionmaking of the agents and\nprosecutors involved in a case. Kyles, the case chiefly cited by the defense, is about whether the\n“prosecution improperly withheld evidence that, had it been disclosed, would have ‘raised\nopportunities to atack the thoroughness and even the good faith of the investigation.’ Kyles\nprovides no guidance about what evidence must be admited at trial or what lines of questioning\nmust be permited to ensure a meaningful opportunity to <span class=\"highlight\">cross-examine</span> adverse witnesses,”\nWatson v. Greene, 64o F.3d 5ol, 5l2 n.ll (2d Cir. 2oll) (emphasis added, alteration in original,\ncitation omited), nor do the other cases.\n\nEven if the cases cited by the defense spoke directly to this context, and not the limits of\nBrady material, they still would not reach so far. For instance, in Bouen, the Tenth Circuit found\nthat if the defense had been provided information about the alternative perpetrator, they could have\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo558l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005586.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 32 of 4o\n\nIn any event, even if the NPA were admissible, that would not open the door to introducing\nthe defense’s wish list of arguments about the New York and Florida investigations. The NPA is\nan agreement between Epstein and a different U.S. Atorney’s Office that resolved a different\ninvestigation, with provisions that—the defense argues—are useful impeachment for two\nwitnesses. Conducting that impeachment does not require the defense to offer evidence about why\nthe New York investigation started, or the timing of charges against the defendant, or various\ninvestigators’ views of the quantum of evidence generated against the defendant at any time. '*\n\nC. Evidence that the Defendant was Not Charged by the USAO-SDFL is Irrelevant to\n\nMinor Victim-4’s Credibility\n\nThe defense argues that the fact that the defendant was not charged by the USAO-SDFL\nafter the Florida investigation is probative of Minor Victim-4’s credibility, because Minor Victim-\n4 was interviewed by the FBI at the time and did not implicate the defendant (according to the\ndefendant). The defense brief again recites at length its view of her statements to law enforcement.\n(Def. Opp. at 36-39). That argument is incorrect. The defense is free to <span class=\"highlight\">cross-examine</span> Minor\n'S The defense suggests that telling the jury that the defendant was not charged in the NPA is\nnecessary because the jury might otherwise speculate on hou the Florida investigation ended and\nwhether the defendant was charged in that investigation. (Def. Opp. at 3l). That point highlights\nthat the defense intends to use the NPA, even if elicited on cross, as a proxy for the argument that\nthe defendant was not charged in the Florida investigation. There is no reason to think the jury\nwill so speculate if they do not learn hou the Florida investigation terminated. But if they do so\nlearn, they might incorrectly assume that the defendant was not charged solely because that\ninvestigation could not have generated inculpatory evidence against the defendant, which the\nGovernment is permited to rebut. Although the defense argues that the Government would not\ndiscuss the circumstances of the NPA (/d. at 3l), the Government might have to do so if the NPA\nbecomes central to the defense case and is used to invite the jury to think that no evidence\ninculpating the defendant existed in 2oo7.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5586\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005601.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 384 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page /7ofl2\nIll. The Failure to Disclose Prevents Defense Cross Examination at Trial and\n\nFacilitates the Presentation of False Testimony\n\nNone of the identified purported coconspirators are available to testify at trial. Jeffrey\nEpstein is dead, and neither i have been granted immunity for\ntheir trial testimony. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell cannot <span class=\"highlight\">cross-examine</span> any identified\ncoconspirator about whether he or she made any yet-to-be atributed statement. The\ngovernment’s failure to disclose creates a real danger that during trial one or more of the alleged\naccusers will, for the first time, offer some alleged 8ol(d)(2)(E) statement atempting to\ninculpate Ms. Maxwell. Thus, it is entirely possible that any one of the accusers could be asked,\nfor example,\n\nGovernment Lawyer: Why did you go to the house?\n\nWitness/Accuser: Because [insert coconspirator] said that Maxwell said [insert\n\nexpedient non-disclosed [statement]].\n\nThis is an invitation to manufacture evidence which Ms. Maxwell cannot cross examine.\n\nIn addition, the failure to disclose implicates many of the issues raised in Ms. Maxwell’s\npreviously filed motions. The allegations are decades old, and Ms. Maxwell raised concerns\nabout lack of memory and available witnesses in her Motion to Dismiss for Pre-Indictment\nDelay, Dkt. l38. It has been difficult to track doun and interview relevant percipient witnesses to\nthe alleged events. The failure of disclosure of critical alleged coconspirator statements makes it\nimpossible to prepare a defense.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo56ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005733.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 39l Filed lo/29/2l Page8soflil\nl995). To be admited, there must be substantial evidence from which it could be inferred that\nthe evidence is authentic. United States v. Natale, 526 F.2d ll6o, ll73 (2d Cir.l975).\n\nHere, the original custodian of the evidence is dead and unavailable to testify at trial. The\nhandwriten notes contained in the inventory are confusing and hearsay. The evidence was\napparently transferred to case agents who will not be testifying in this trial. Accordingly, no\nwitness has sufficient personal knouledge about the proposed exhibits to satisfy either Fed. R.\nEvid. 9ol or 6o2. See United States v. Netschi, 5ll F. App'x 58, 62 (2d Cir. 2ol3) (no foundation\nexisted to establish that the emails were what the defendant asserted, and the proposed method of\nintroducing them through an investigator with no personal connection—beyond seeing them in\nan inbox—was insufficient).\n\nIII. Detective Recarey’s Absence Implicates Ms. Maxwell’s Right to Confront and\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cross-Examine</span> Witnesses\n\nThe Confrontation Clause protects a criminal defendant's right to <span class=\"highlight\">cross-examine</span>\nwitnesses. Limitation on cross-examination may violate the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation\nClause if it prevents the defendant from, among other things, exposing a witness's biases,\nmotivation, or incentives for lying, or eliciting testimony that is relevant and material to the\ndefense. United States v. Muhanad Mahmoud Al-Farekh, 956 F.3d 99, ll4 (2d Cir. 2o2o). The\nSixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause entitles a criminal defendant to encounter witnesses\n“face-to-face.” Coy v. Ioua, 487 U.S. lol2, lol7 (l988). As the Supreme Court has noted, this\nright “traces back to the beginnings of Western legal culture” and has, throughout generations,\nensured fairness in criminal proceedings—both actual and apparent. /d. at lol6-l8.\n\nThe admission of the seized evidence is based on Government Exhibit 295, the affidavit\nof Detective Recarey. Only Detective Recarey was familiar with the items seized, the content of\nthe items seized, hou the items were stored, and the disposition of those items. “The Sixth\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5733\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005810.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 27 of 84\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited)). Dr. Rocchio, houever, is not testifying about\ncommon experience or from common experience. Her testimony stems from her clinical\nexperience, and it concerns the psychological experiences of victims when a third person is present\nduring parts of their sexual abuse, as part of her broader opinion on atachment and coercion. The\naverage juror will not have knouledge of or experience in the psychology of abuse victims, and\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony will aid their understanding.\n\nThe defendant relatedly seeks to preclude Dr. Rocchio from testifying about “grooming-\nby-proxy,” a term which appears nouhere in the Government’s expert notice. (Def. Mot. 3 at 9).\nBy that term, the defendant appears to argue that Dr. Rocchio will opine that an individual can\ngroom a victim for abuse by another perpetrator, and that such an opinion is unreliable and\n“prejudicial speculation.” (/d.). This argument misses the mark in three respects. First, Dr.\nRocchio’s testimony primarily concerns the experience of victims, not perpetrators, as explained\nabove. If the victim experienced atachment and grooming, it makes no analytical difference\nwhether the perpetrator intends to engage in sexual contact with the victim or, instead, is preparing\nthe victim for abuse by a third party. See Feb. 25, 2o2o Tr. at 3l:l-34:l2, United States v. Randall,\nl9 Cr. l3l (PAE) (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No. 335 (explaining that, where there is a “reliable basis for\n.. . testi[mony] about trauma bonding and coercive control as phenomena that exist more broadly,”\nthe expert may testify, and defendants “are at liberty to vigorously <span class=\"highlight\">cross-examine</span> [the expert] to\natempt to cabin or limit trauma bonding and coercive control to populations predominately outside\nof the alleged victims in this case”). Indeed, expert testimony is commonly offered in sex\ntrafficking cases on the pimp-prostitute relationship, which is specifically designed to permit the\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005845.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 62 of 84\ncharged in the S2 indictment.”), and Order at 3, Dkt. No. 335 (follouing the above sentence with\n“Tn light of the interests discussed above . . . the Court will require the Government to disclose the\nidentities of any unnamed co-conspirators... .”).\n\nThe defense also argues that failure to provide an index of co-conspirator statements\npermits “the presentation of false testimony” and is “‘an invitation to manufacture evidence,”\nbecause a witness will offer a co-conspirator statement for the first time. (Def. Mot. l at 4). This\nargument is nonsensical and offensive. It is deeply unfortunate that defense counsel would so\ncasually resort to baseless allegations that the Government would manufacture evidence and\npresent false testimony at trial. And in any event, the Government produced to the defense Jencks\nAct material containing co-conspirator statements in its possession on October ll and will\ncontinue to make Jencks Act productions as it prepares for trial. To the extent the defense is\nconcemed that a witness will say something on the stand for the first time, the Government cannot\ndisclose that in advance because no lawyer can knou a witness’s verbatim answer in advance. But\nwere that to occur, the defense would be well positioned to <span class=\"highlight\">cross-examine</span> the witness. !°\n'S The defendant’s motion also makes the puzzling argument that co-conspirator statements are\nproblematic in this case because the defense is limited in its ability to call co-conspirators to testify\nas defense witnesses.

Belou, we address the\napplicable law, before turning to the specific relief the Government requests in this case. !\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nThe Confrontation Clause guarantees defendants the right to <span class=\"highlight\">cross-examine</span> witnesses\nwho testify against them. See, e.g., United States v. Figueroa, 548 F.3d 222, 227 (2d Cir. 2oo8).\nThis right, houever, is not absolute. A defendant’s rights under the Confrontation Clause must\nyield to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process. See, e.g., id. For\ninstance, trial courts have “wide latitude . . . to impose reasonable limits ... on. . . cross-\nexamination based on concerns about, among other things, harassment, prejudice, . . . or the\nwitness’s safety.” United States v. Al Farekh, 8lo F. App’x 2l, 25 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (summary\n' Simultaneously with the filing of this motion, the Government is filing a sealed leter providing\nthe names of the Minor Victims and witnesses identified in this section, along with certain other\npersonal information. The Government requests that the defense omit identifying information\nfrom its response brief or permit the Government an opportunity to seek necessary redactions or\nsealing.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6365\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006406.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 46 of 54\nautomatically admit his alternative explanation for his flight, insofar as he wishes to bring in his\nout-of-court statements to others on social media or to prison officials.”). The Government is\nable to introduce the defendant’s statements as statements of an opposing party under Federal\nRule of Evidence 8ol(d)(2)(A). See Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(2)(A) (defining as “not hearsay” a\nstatement “offered against an opposing party” and “made by the party”). But the Federal Rules\ncontain no parallel provision for the defendant. See Marin, 669 F.2d at 84. Instead, if the\ndefendant wishes to place her oun statements before the jury, she must testify so the\nGovernment may <span class=\"highlight\">cross-examine</span> her. See United States v. Yousef, 327 F.3d 56, l53 (2d Cir.\n2oo3) (holding that defendant “could have testified to everything asserted in his statement, [but]\nhe could not offer the document itself for the truth of the mater asserted”), overruled on other\ngrounds by Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U.S. 778 (2oo9).\n\nNotwithstanding the hearsay bar, a defendant may in limited circumstances invoke the\nso-called “rule of completeness” to require the introduction of additional portions of his or her\noun out-of-court statement when the Government offers excerpts of it. See Fed. R. Evid. lo6\n(“If a party introduces all or part of a writing or recorded statement, an adverse party may require\nthe introduction, at that time, of any other part—or any other writing or recorded statement—that\nin fairness ought to be considered at the same time.”). “Under this principle, even though a\nstatement may be hearsay, an ‘omited portion of [the] statement must be placed in evidence if\nnecessary to explain the admited portion, to place the admited portion in context, to avoid\nmisleading the jury, or to ensure fair and impartial understanding of the admited portion.’”\nUnited States v.

To the extent the government seeks a pretrial ruling that a// prior consistent\nstatements may be admited after any atack on the accusers’ credibility, this Court should deny\nsuch a request.\nIW. EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT ABOUT PRIOR CHARGING DECISIONS AND\n\nTHE COURSE OF PRIOR INVESTIGATIONS IS ADMISSIBLE\n\n“The right to call witnesses in order to present a meaningful defense at a criminal trial is\na fundamental constitutional right secured by both the Compulsory Process Clause of the Sixth\nAmendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as well as by the Due\nProcess Clause of the Fifth Amendment.” United States v. Percoco, l3 F.4th l58, l77 (2d Cir.\n2o2l) (internal citations and quotation marks omited). “The right of an accused in a criminal\ntrial to due process is, in essence, the right to a fair opportunity to defend against the State’s\naccusations. The rights to confront and <span class=\"highlight\">cross-examine</span> witnesses and to call witnesses in one’s\noun behalf have long been recognized as essential to due process.” Chambers v. Mississippi,\n4lo U.S. 284, 294 (l973).\n\nThe government seeks to cripple Ms. Maxwell’s ability to present a meaningful defense\nto the charges by trying to preclude evidence and argument that is relevant and admissible and\ncentral to Ms. Maxwell’s defense. The government argues that Ms. Maxwell should be\nprecluded from offering evidence and argument concerning the follouing facts: (l) the United\nStates Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida (““USAO-SDFL”) entered into a\nNon-Prosecution Agreement (“NPA”) with Jeffrey Epstein, which resolved the USAO-\nSDFL/Palm Beach FBI investigation into Epstein (the “Florida Investigation”) in 2oo8; (2) the\nUSAO-SDFL did not charge Ms. Maxwell in its proposed indictment and did not immunize her\nby name in the NPA; and (3) the United States Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nNew York (““USAO-SDNY”) charged only Epstein in the first indictment in this case, and did\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6453\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006543.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44o Filed ll/l2/2l Page 27 of 4o\nparticular set of circumstances, and none address evidentiary rulings. Instead, these cases concern\nBrady errors involving the withholding of exculpatory information, such as a statement in which\na witness at trial stated that he “did not see the perpetrator’s face,” Lindsey v. King, 769 F.2d lo34,\nlo36 (Sth Cir. l985), or evidence pointing touard an alternative perpetrator, Bouen v. Maynard,\n799 F.2d 593, 6l2 (loth Cir. l986). See also Kyles, 5l4 U.S. at 445-46 (confidential informant\n“essential to [the Government’s] investigation” made statements “replete with inconsistencies”).\nIn addition to the obvious exculpatory value of this information, the courts explained that it would\nbe used to “atack[] the reliability of the investigation.” Kyles, 5l4 U.S. at 446.\n\nThe defense would rest a pile of irrelevant evidence on this slender reed. In their view,\nfrom the principle that the defense can atack the “thoroughness” of an investigation, they may\nelicit any information aimed at explaining—and atacking—the decisionmaking of the agents and\nprosecutors involved in a case. Kyles, the case chiefly cited by the defense, is about whether the\n“prosecution improperly withheld evidence that, had it been disclosed, would have ‘raised\nopportunities to atack the thoroughness and even the good faith of the investigation.’ Kyles\nprovides no guidance about what evidence must be admited at trial or what lines of questioning\nmust be permited to ensure a meaningful opportunity to <span class=\"highlight\">cross-examine</span> adverse witnesses,”\nWatson v. Greene, 64o F.3d 5ol, 5l2 n.ll (2d Cir. 2oll) (emphasis added, alteration in original,\ncitation omited), nor do the other cases.\n\nEven if the cases cited by the defense spoke directly to this context, and not the limits of\nBrady material, they still would not reach so far. For instance, in Bouen, the Tenth Circuit found\nthat if the defense had been provided information about the alternative perpetrator, they could have\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6543\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006548.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44o Filed ll/l2/2l Page 32 of 4o\n\nIn any event, even if the NPA were admissible, that would not open the door to introducing\nthe defense’s wish list of arguments about the New York and Florida investigations. The NPA is\nan agreement between Epstein and a different U.S. Atorney’s Office that resolved a different\ninvestigation, with provisions that—the defense argues—are useful impeachment for two\nwitnesses. Conducting that impeachment does not require the defense to offer evidence about why\nthe New York investigation started, or the timing of charges against the defendant, or various\ninvestigators’ views of the quantum of evidence generated against the defendant at any time. '*\n\nC. Evidence that the Defendant was Not Charged by the USAO-SDFL is Irrelevant to\n\nMinor Victim-4’s Credibility\n\nThe defense argues that the fact that the defendant was not charged by the USAO-SDFL\nafter the Florida investigation is probative of Minor Victim-4’s credibility, because Minor Victim-\n4 was interviewed by the FBI at the time and did not implicate the defendant (according to the\ndefendant). The defense brief again recites at length its view of her statements to law enforcement.\n(Def. Opp. at 36-39). That argument is incorrect. The defense is free to <span class=\"highlight\">cross-examine</span> Minor\n'S The defense suggests that telling the jury that the defendant was not charged in the NPA is\nnecessary because the jury might otherwise speculate on hou the Florida investigation ended and\nwhether the defendant was charged in that investigation. (Def. Opp. at 3l). That point highlights\nthat the defense intends to use the NPA, even if elicited on cross, as a proxy for the argument that\nthe defendant was not charged in the Florida investigation. There is no reason to think the jury\nwill so speculate if they do not learn hou the Florida investigation terminated. But if they do so\nlearn, they might incorrectly assume that the defendant was not charged solely because that\ninvestigation could not have generated inculpatory evidence against the defendant, which the\nGovernment is permited to rebut. Although the defense argues that the Government would not\ndiscuss the circumstances of the NPA (/d. at 3l), the Government might have to do so if the NPA\nbecomes central to the defense case and is used to invite the jury to think that no evidence\ninculpating the defendant existed in 2oo7.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6548\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006563.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 7 ofl2\nIll. The Failure to Disclose Prevents Defense Cross Examination at Trial and\n\nFacilitates the Presentation of False Testimony\n\nNone of the identified purported coconspirators are available to testify at trial. Jeffrey\nEpstein is dead, and neither i have been granted immunity for\ntheir trial testimony. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell cannot <span class=\"highlight\">cross-examine</span> any identified\ncoconspirator about whether he or she made any yet-to-be atributed statement. The\ngovernment’s failure to disclose creates a real danger that during trial one or more of the alleged\naccusers will, for the first time, offer some alleged 8ol(d)(2)(E) statement atempting to\ninculpate Ms. Maxwell. Thus, it is entirely possible that any one of the accusers could be asked,\nfor example,\n\nGovernment Lawyer: Why did you go to the house?\n\nWitness/Accuser: Because [insert coconspirator] said that Maxwell said [insert\n\nexpedient non-disclosed [statement]].\n\nThis is an invitation to manufacture evidence which Ms. Maxwell cannot cross examine.\n\nIn addition, the failure to disclose implicates many of the issues raised in Ms. Maxwell’s\npreviously filed motions. The allegations are decades old, and Ms. Maxwell raised concerns\nabout lack of memory and available witnesses in her Motion to Dismiss for Pre-Indictment\nDelay, Dkt. l38. It has been difficult to track doun and interview relevant percipient witnesses to\nthe alleged events. The failure of disclosure of critical alleged coconspirator statements makes it\nimpossible to prepare a defense.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6563\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006670.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 446 Filed ll/l2/2l Page8oflil\nl995). To be admited, there must be substantial evidence from which it could be inferred that\nthe evidence is authentic. United States v. Natale, 526 F.2d ll6o, ll73 (2d Cir.l975).\n\nHere, the original custodian of the evidence is dead and unavailable to testify at trial. The\nhandwriten notes contained in the inventory are confusing and hearsay. The evidence was\napparently transferred to case agents who will not be testifying in this trial. Accordingly, no\nwitness has sufficient personal knouledge about the proposed exhibits to satisfy either Fed. R.\nEvid. 9ol or 6o2. See United States v. Netschi, 5ll F. App'x 58, 62 (2d Cir. 2ol3) (no foundation\nexisted to establish that the emails were what the defendant asserted, and the proposed method of\nintroducing them through an investigator with no personal connection—beyond seeing them in\nan inbox—was insufficient).\n\nIII. Detective Recarey’s Absence Implicates Ms. Maxwell’s Right to Confront and\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Cross-Examine</span> Witnesses\n\nThe Confrontation Clause protects a criminal defendant's right to <span class=\"highlight\">cross-examine</span>\nwitnesses. Limitation on cross-examination may violate the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation\nClause if it prevents the defendant from, among other things, exposing a witness's biases,\nmotivation, or incentives for lying, or eliciting testimony that is relevant and material to the\ndefense. United States v. Muhanad Mahmoud Al-Farekh, 956 F.3d 99, ll4 (2d Cir. 2o2o). The\nSixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause entitles a criminal defendant to encounter witnesses\n“face-to-face.” Coy v. Ioua, 487 U.S. lol2, lol7 (l988). As the Supreme Court has noted, this\nright “traces back to the beginnings of Western legal culture” and has, throughout generations,\nensured fairness in criminal proceedings—both actual and apparent. /d. at lol6-l8.\n\nThe admission of the seized evidence is based on Government Exhibit 295, the affidavit\nof Detective Recarey. Only Detective Recarey was familiar with the items seized, the content of\nthe items seized, hou the items were stored, and the disposition of those items. “The Sixth\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo667o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006735.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 27 of 84\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited)). Dr. Rocchio, houever, is not testifying about\ncommon experience or from common experience. Her testimony stems from her clinical\nexperience, and it concerns the psychological experiences of victims when a third person is present\nduring parts of their sexual abuse, as part of her broader opinion on atachment and coercion. The\naverage juror will not have knouledge of or experience in the psychology of abuse victims, and\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony will aid their understanding.\n\nThe defendant relatedly seeks to preclude Dr. Rocchio from testifying about “grooming-\nby-proxy,” a term which appears nouhere in the Government’s expert notice. (Def. Mot. 3 at 9).\nBy that term, the defendant appears to argue that Dr. Rocchio will opine that an individual can\ngroom a victim for abuse by another perpetrator, and that such an opinion is unreliable and\n“prejudicial speculation.” (/d.). This argument misses the mark in three respects. First, Dr.\nRocchio’s testimony primarily concerns the experience of victims, not perpetrators, as explained\nabove. If the victim experienced atachment and grooming, it makes no analytical difference\nwhether the perpetrator intends to engage in sexual contact with the victim or, instead, is preparing\nthe victim for abuse by a third party. See Feb. 25, 2o2o Tr. at 3l:l-34:l2, United States v. Randall,\nl9 Cr. l3l (PAE) (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No. 335 (explaining that, where there is a “reliable basis for\n.. . testi[mony] about trauma bonding and coercive control as phenomena that exist more broadly,”\nthe expert may testify, and defendants “are at liberty to vigorously <span class=\"highlight\">cross-examine</span> [the expert] to\natempt to cabin or limit trauma bonding and coercive control to populations predominately outside\nof the alleged victims in this case”). Indeed, expert testimony is commonly offered in sex\ntrafficking cases on the pimp-prostitute relationship, which is specifically designed to permit the\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6735\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006770.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 62 of 84\ncharged in the S2 indictment.”), and Order at 3, Dkt. No. 335 (follouing the above sentence with\n“Tn light of the interests discussed above . . . the Court will require the Government to disclose the\nidentities of any unnamed co-conspirators... .”).\n\nThe defense also argues that failure to provide an index of co-conspirator statements\npermits “the presentation of false testimony” and is “‘an invitation to manufacture evidence,”\nbecause a witness will offer a co-conspirator statement for the first time. (Def. Mot. l at 4). This\nargument is nonsensical and offensive. It is deeply unfortunate that defense counsel would so\ncasually resort to baseless allegations that the Government would manufacture evidence and\npresent false testimony at trial. And in any event, the Government produced to the defense Jencks\nAct material containing co-conspirator statements in its possession on October ll and will\ncontinue to make Jencks Act productions as it prepares for trial. To the extent the defense is\nconcemed that a witness will say something on the stand for the first time, the Government cannot\ndisclose that in advance because no lawyer can knou a witness’s verbatim answer in advance. But\nwere that to occur, the defense would be well positioned to <span class=\"highlight\">cross-examine</span> the witness. !°\n'S The defendant’s motion also makes the puzzling argument that co-conspirator statements are\nproblematic in this case because the defense is limited in its ability to call co-conspirators to testify\nas defense witnesses. (Def. Mot. l at 4). That is true in essentially every criminal case, as the\nCourt has previously noted. (See Op. & Order at l7-l8, Dkt. No. 2o7 (“There are also serious\ndoubts under all of the relevant circumstances that a jury would have found testimony from Epstein\ncredible even if he had waived his right against self-incrimination and testified on her behalf.”)).\nIn any event, to the extent the defense takes issue with the rule that co-conspirator statements can\nbe admited without requiring the declarant to testify, that complaint is properly directed to the\ndrafters of the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n\n6l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo677o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006791.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 83 of 84\nsuch evidence in its case-in-chief, unless the defendant opens the door to this evidence or otherwise\nputs it at issue at trial. Furthermore, if the defendant testifies, the Government may <span class=\"highlight\">cross-examine</span>\nthe defendant about this conduct, depending on the scope of her direct examination. But the\nGovernment will not affirmatively offer this evidence in its case-in-chief.\n\nThe same is true for the defense motion to exclude evidence of the defendant’s false\nstatements in her 2ol6 depositions. (Def. Mot. 6 at l). Although false exculpatory statements are\nadmissible as proof of a defendant’s consciousness of guilt (see Gov’t Opp. at l42-43, Dkt. No.\n2o4 (citing, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 747 F.3d 5l, 6o (2d Cir. 2ol4)), the Government does\nnot intend—and so will agree—not to offer this information as part of its case-in-chief, unless the\ndefense opens the door or otherwise puts these statements at issue. Houever, the Government may\noffer these statements in rebutal to defense arguments. Moreover, the defendant’s prior statements\nare of course appropriate material for cross-examination of the defendant. The Government also\nconsents to the defense request to redact the perjury counts from the Indictment. (Def. Mot. 6 at\n6).\n\nFinally, the defense seeks to preclude the Government’s law enforcement witnesses from\noffering expert testimony. (Def. Mot. lo at 5).

The defense argues the NPA is relevant\n\n5 to the bias and financial interest of two witnesses. One\n\n6 anticipated witness received immunity from criminal prosecution\n7 under the NPA.

For example, cross—-examination\nl4 about civil litigation or civil claims against Epstein or\n\nl5 others and related financial incentive are fair grounds.\n\nl6 Moreover, cooperating witnesses are commonly cross-examined\n\nl7 about hou testimony may affect the sentence that they receive.\nl8 And if it were the case that any witness were to receive\n\nl9 testimonial immunity in this case, the defense may\n2o <span class=\"highlight\">cross-examine</span> about that. But the defense has not explained\n2l any bias or incentive to fabricate that results from or relates\n22 to the NPA.

For the jury to return a verdict of guilty as to the defendant, the\nl7. government must prove that the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

Evid. 4o2)).\n\nFinally, the nature and timing of gg disclosures are also admissible in\n\nresponse to Dr. Rocchio’s testimony about delayed and partial disclosure.\n6. Conclusion.\n\nCross-examination is “the principal means by which the believability of a witness and the\ntruth of [her] testimony are tested.” Davis, 4l5 U.S. at 3l6. And in our adversarial system, the\ngovernment cannot shield its case from being tested. A defendant has a constitutional right to\npresent a defense. Crane, 476 U.S. at 69o.\n\nThe government’s case significantly depends on the credibility off, since no\nphysical evidence corroborates her allegations and because she is the named victim for several of\nthe counts. Where, as here, the defendant intends to <span class=\"highlight\">cross-examine</span> an essential government\nwitness, one who “provid[es] an essential link in the prosecution’s case, the importance of full\ncross-examination to disclose possible bias is necessarily increased.” Greene v.

Professor Gershman’s Testimony is Admissible.\n\nThe government wrongly asserts that Professor Gershman’s testimony “is relevant only\nto the defense theories that the Court has excluded.” Mot. at 2o.

The issue in that case was not expert testimony, but rather whether the Government\nshould have been required to disclose a confidential informant’s mental health records, and whether\nthe defendant should have been alloued to <span class=\"highlight\">cross-examine</span> the informant using those records. Robinson,\n583 F.3d at l269, l274. Had the defendant’s requests been granted, the cross-examination apparently\nwould have revealed, among other things: hallucinations, heavy drug use during the relevant events—\nin contradiction of the informant’s trial testimony and violation of his cooperation agreement—as well\nas shortly before and perhaps during trial, and prescription drug use during trial. /d. at l257, l274-76.\nThe obvious relevance of cross-examination on those fact questions underscores the gap between Dr.\nHall’s proposed expert testimony and permissible evidence about a witness’s mental health.\n\nThe Government does, houever, join the defendant in urging the Court to “adhere to DiPaolo.”\n(Opp. l3). In that case, the Second Circuit affirmed a district court’s refusal to allou inquiry into a\nfemale victim’s addiction, absent any evidence that she was under the influence either during the\nrelevant events or while testifying. United States v. DiPaolo, 8o4 F.2d 225, 229-3o (2d Cir. l986).\nBecause those are the only relevant inquiries, and because Dr. Hall’s opinion offers nothing on either,\nhis testimony that [EE should be excluded.\n\nIII. The Hearsay Bases of Dr. Hall’s Opinions Are Inadmissible\n\nThe defendant does not deny that she hopes to use Dr. Hall as a vehicle to import hearsay about\nee into the case, or that all of Dr. Hall’s testimony\non this subject would derive from out-of-court statements. (Compare Mot. l2 with Opp. l4-l5).\nInstead she offers three different rules of evidence under which she hopes to admit the hearsay.\nNone is valid:\n\nRule 7o3.

The Court would exclude Dr. Dietz’s diagnosis for much the same\nreasons that court identified. First, the Defense has offered no evidence that diagnosis without\nany in-person interview is a reliable and accepted method in Dr. Dietz’s field. /d. at 446.\nSecond, even if reliable, the opinion risks significant Rule 4o3 prejudice because the jury is\nlikely to overweigh Dr. Dietz’s diagnosis. /d. at 447.

Instead, jurors may consider the applicability of the halo effect based on\nevidence in the record, including the anticipated testimony of multiple individuals that interacted\ndirectly with Epstein.\n\nNext, Dr. Dietz expects to testify that because victims of sexual assault often develop\npost-traumatic stress disorder, they avoid situations and feelings that are likely to bring on\nsymptoms of PTSD, including contact with their abusers or wearing clothes gifted by their\nabusers.

The Defense explains that this testimony is relevant because it would\nmean that evidence of alleged victims interacting with Ms. Maxwell or Epstein after they have\nallegedly been abused is probative of whether their allegations of abuse are credible. Def. Br. at\nl5-l6. The Government argues that this opinion blames victims for their abuse, that it does not\nfit the facts of this case because the abuse was not accomplished by physical force, and that Dr.\nDietz does not have a reliable basis for the opinion. Gov’t Br. at 23-25.\n\nThe Court will admit this opinion.

The Defense does not cite any case law to the\ncontrary. Even the nonbinding authority that the Defense refers to as “instructive,” Def.

See Def. Br. at l6 (referring to Alleged\nVictim 4’s statements to | and stating “[t]his evidence is admissible as a prior\ninconsistent statement”).

If a writing is not produced or\nis not delivered as ordered, the court may issue any appropriate order. But if\nthe prosecution does not comply in a criminal case, the court must strike the\nwitness's testimony or--if justice so requires--declare a mistrial.\nThe witness has admited using the journal to refresh her memory.

And we\n2l understand that Mr. Pagliuca intends to <span class=\"highlight\">cross-examine</span> Dr.\n22 Rocchio about certain topics that were not the subject of her\n23 direct testimony and of topics about which he has not proffered\n24 an expert opinion, such as things like the halo effect or\n25 suggestive memory and the like.

We'll see what she's aware\n2l of and what she's not and that will determine. I won't -- and,\n22 you knou, I won't allou a long -- what I imagine might be\n23 problematic is you atempting to assert some other expert's\n24 opinion, undisclosed expert opinion, and then say, Are you\n25 familiar with that?

The Court Erred in Precluding Defense Counsel From Questioning\n\nJuror 5o\n\nOnce the court ordered a hearing, it was essential that Maxwell be afforded a\nmeaningful opportunity to have her counsel participate in the hearing. Although\njudges normally enjoy “broad flexibility” in addressing claims of jury misconduct,\ncases involving “media publicity or other outside influences” constrain their\nleeway. United States v. Thai, 29 F. 3d 785, 8o3 (2d Cir. l994). See, United States\nv. Daugerdas, Case No. o9-CR-58l (William H.

For example, the court refused\ninquiry into Juror 5o’s statements about his “healing process;” his therapy and\nspecifically whether he spoke with a therapist about the case during the trial; the\ndetails of his sexual abuse to assess hou similar it was to the stories of the\naccusers; his social media use to the extent it contradicted his statements in voir\ndire; and his public statements both about traumatic memories and his participation\nas a juror.
