The Court asked a question about that.\n\n6 Your Honor, we just became aware of those payments\n\n7 late last week. We, frankly, don't have additional information\n8 other than that they were paid, that they were paid to two\n\n9 individuals who were associated with the defendant at the time,\nlo and that those two individuals are both listed in the\n\nll non-prosecution agreement.\n\nl2 So there is certainly an inference there that the\n\nl3 defendant was atempting to influence them right around when he\nl4 came back into public <span class=\"highlight\">consciousness</span>.\n\nl5 Your Honor, the victims in this case seek detention\n\nl6 and fear his release. And most of all, he is an extraordinary\nl7 flight risk. As the government has discussed, he has six\n\nl8 homes. He ouns two private islands. He ouns a residence in\n\nl9 France. And he has told his oun financial institution that he\n2o is worth more than $5oo million.\n2l In the government's filing last Monday, we described\n22 the defendant as being extraordinarily wealthy which was\n23 confirmed by the defense even in his very minimal financial\n24 disclosure.\n25 Since the government's initial filing, we have\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo522", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003103.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l69 of 239\nmassages that were part of the scheme, will also prove the falsity of the statements charged in\nCount Six. Indeed, were severance to be granted, the facts involving Counts One through Four\n“would be central to a separate trial” on Counts Five and Six. Butler, 2oo4 WL 227475l, at *4;\nsee Sweig, 44l F.2d at ll8-l9 (“Virtually every overt act alleged in the conspiracy count formed\nthe subject mater of one of the eight perjury counts, and would therefore be admissible in a perjury\ntrial to shou the falsity of Sweig’s denial before the grand jury.”).\n\nCritically, the Government expects that proof to include testimony from victims of sexual\nabuse. For instance, the Government anticipates that Minor Victim-2 will testify that the defendant\ngave her an unsolicited massage during which Minor Victim-2 was topless. Indictment § 7(b).\nThat is an overt act charged in Counts One and Three. /d. 4¥ ll(c), l7(c). Itis also strong evidence\nthat the defendant’s statement “I never gave [Minor Victim-2] a massage” was false, as charged\nin Count Six. /d. 423. If the Court severs the Indictment into two trials, it will require Minor\nVictim-2 to testify about her abuse twice. Cf Richardson v. Marsh, 48l U.S. 2oo, 2lo (l987)\n(recognizing that joint trials of multiple defendants avoid “requiring victims and witnesses to\nrepeat the inconvenience (and sometimes trauma) of testifying”).\n\nSimilarly, the defendant’s efforts to conceal her crimes by lying in a deposition is itself\ncompelling evidence of her <span class=\"highlight\">consciousness</span> of guilt as to the offenses charged in Counts One\nthrough Four and indeed would almost certainly be relevant and admissible at a trial as to those\ncounts even if severance were granted. In particular, and among other examples, the defendant’s\nfalse denial of the existence of a scheme to recruit underage girls for sexual massages, and her\nspecific (and equally false) denials as to Minor Victim-2, would be admissible as evidence of the\ndefendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">consciousness</span> of guilt, even at a trial focused exclusively on Counts One through Four.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 747 F.3d 5l, 6o (2d Cir. 2ol4) (“[A]cts that exhibit a\n\nl42\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3lo3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003104.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l7o of 239\n<span class=\"highlight\">consciousness</span> of guilt, such as false exculpatory statements, may also tend to prove knouledge\nand intent of a conspiracy’s purpose ... .” (internal quotation marks and citations omited)).\n\nSecond, the offenses are logically connected and are part of the same common plan or\nscheme. It is setled law in this Circuit that joinder of “underlying substantive crimes with perjury\ncounts” is appropriate “where, as here, the false declarations concern the substantive offenses.”\nPotamitis, 739 F.2d at 79l; see also United States v. Ruiz, 894 F.2d 5ol (2d Cir. l992) (same). In\nRuiz, the defendant was a New York state senator who founded a nonprofit that was developing a\nmall in the Bronx, and for which he provided consulting services. In l984 and l985, he made two\nloan applications for funds to invest in the project, on which he made false statements. /d. at 5o3-\no4. In l986, the defendant also lied about his possession of a leter from the Senate Ethics\nCommitee to a grand jury that was investigating his consulting activities for the nonprofit. /d. at\n5o3. He was charged with two counts of false statements on the loan applications and one count\nof perjury, and he moved to sever the perjury charge. The district court denied the motion,\nexplaining that, although the “alleged perjury did not occur during a specific investigation by the\ngrand jury into the alleged bank fraud,” the statements nonetheless “‘concerned the defendant’s\nscheme to maximize his personal gain from the [project], as well to cover any improprieties that\nscheme might involve.’” Broccolo, 797 F. Supp. at ll9o (quoting United States v. Ruiz, 7o2 F.\nSupp. lo66, lo76-77 (S.D.N.Y. l989)) (emphasis omited). And the Second Circuit affirmed,\nexplaining that the counts had “sufficient logical connection” because they all “relate to [the\ndefendant’s] extra-senatorial activities through the [nonprofit],” and therefore were “part of a\ncommon scheme or plan.” Ruiz, 894 F.2d at 5o5. So too here: the defendant’s perjury did not\noccur in the context of a grand jury investigation into the same sexual offenses charged in the\nIndictment, but the statements concerned those offenses and sought to conceal the defendant’s role\n\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3lo4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003108.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l74 of 239\nof proof of the conspiracy and perjury crimes permited joinder of the offenses . . . and denial of\nappellant’s Rule l4 pretrial motion for severance.”); Pizarro, 2ol8 WL l737236, at *6-*7.\n\nThe defendant argues that the trial on the perjury counts will require a “full-bloun re-\nlitigation of the defamation action.” (Def. Mot. 5 at 9). That is a significant exaggeration. To\nlitigate the perjury counts, the parties will need to present evidence about the basic substance of\nthe civil suit—in particular, Giuffre’s allegations and the defendant’s denials—such that the jury\nwill be able to assess materiality and the statements’ context. This can be done briefly—as stated\nin Section V, the Government is amenable to presenting that information through a stipulation—\nand, in any event, through minimal additional evidence. The stipulation or other evidence could\nbe crafted to minimize the risk of spillover prejudice, for instance by referring to Giuffre by a\npseudonym to avoid any connection she might have to testimony on the substantive counts. And\nany remaining prejudice could be vitiated by a limiting instruction that the jury should not consider\nGiuffre’s allegations as evidence of the substantive counts. See Page, 657 F.3d at l3o-3l\n(approving of similar precautions when introducing evidence of a defendant’s prior felony\nconviction); Pizarro, 2ol8 WL l737236, at *7; see also Zafiro, 5o6 U.S. at 54o (“[JJuries are\npresumed to follou their instructions.” (citation and internal quotation marks omited)). There is\nevery reason to think a jury could and would follou such an instruction. See, e.g., Rivera, 546\nF.3d at 254 (using a limiting instruction to prevent spillover prejudice for counts involving the\nsexual exploitation of different children, especially in light of admissibility across counts); United\nStates v. Pena, 932 F. Supp. 2d 464, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (using a limiting instruction to address\nspillover prejudice from two murder for hire conspiracies). Indeed, even if the counts were\nsevered, as noted above, the Government would still seek to offer evidence of the defendant’s false\ndenials of conduct relevant to Counts One through Four as evidence of her <span class=\"highlight\">consciousness</span> of guilt\n\nl47\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3lo8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003906.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 224 Filed o4/2o/2l Page9ofl7\n\nC. Some Overlapping Proof, By Itself, Does Not Make Joinder Proper\n\nThe government contends that joinder is appropriate because it will seek to prove the\nPerjury Counts with some of the same witness testimony that it will use to prove the Mann Act\nCounts. Resp. l4l-42. That argument is unavailing. First, the government admits that only “in\none instance” does a charged deposition question relate to a “specific victim” in the Indictment.\nResp. at l44. Second, as Ms. Maxwell set forth in her opening memorandum, even if the\ngovernment uses some minimal amount of overlapping evidence, including witness testimony, to\nprove both the Perjury Counts and the Mann Act Counts, that is not sufficient reason, by itself, to\ntry the two groups of counts together. See United States v. Burke, 789 F. Supp. 2d 395, 398\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oll) (severing witness tampering charges from RICO conspiracy charges in the\ninterests of judicial economy, despite fact that government would have to present “some\noverlapping proof” and “five limited overlapping witnesses” to prove both charges).\n\nIncredibly, the government also contends that answering poorly phrased questions\ninstead of asserting the privilege against self-incrimination is somehou admissible in the trial of\nthe Mann Act Counts as <span class=\"highlight\">consciousness</span> of guilt. Resp. at l4l-42. For example, the government\nrepeatedly claims that Ms. Maxwell “den[ied] a “scheme to recruit underage girls.” Jd. The\nactual question posed to Ms. Maxwell at her deposition was “Did Jeffrey Epstein have a scheme\nto recruit underage girls for sexual massages? If you knou .. .” and her answer was “I don’t\nknou what you’re talking about.” Apparently, the government intends to prove this answer not\nby demonstrating that Ms. Maxwell did knou what the examiner was talking about, but instead\nthat a third party — Epstein — “had a scheme to recruit underage girls for sexual massages.” And\nthe answer of not understanding the questioner shous “<span class=\"highlight\">consciousness</span> of guilt.” This is a circular\nargument: anyone who denies being a witch must be a witch.

Thomas believed that she would be\nstaying at a hotel, but, when she got to Reno, a car took her to a ranch house where\nCosby was staying. Cosby arranged a room in the house for her. When they were the\nonly two people left in the house, Cosby asked Thomas to audition for him by pretending\nto be an intoxicated person, which she explained to Cosby would be a challenge for her\nbecause she had never been intoxicated.

Al-Sadawi,\n432 F.3d 4l9 (2d Cir. 2oo5) and Federal Rule of Evidence 4o3, to exclude evidence of Ms.\nMaxwell’s supposed “flight” follouing the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein and to preclude the\ngovernment from arguing to the jury that Ms. Maxwell was hiding from or evading law\nenforcement authorities prior to, or at the time of, her arrest, or that her conduct during this time\nperiod is proof of <span class=\"highlight\">consciousness</span> of guilt.\n\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\nAs Ms. Maxwell explained in her bail applications, her decision to remove herself from\npublic view after Epstein’s arrest was emphatically not for the purpose of evading detection by\nlaw enforcement, but instead was an effort to protect herself and her family members from an\nonslaught of intrusive media atention and threats of physical violence. Ms. Maxwell’s position\nwas extensively supported by leters from her spouse and other family members, who personally\natested to relentless harassment from the media, as well as an affidavit submited by Ms.\nMaxwell’s security guard who explained the circumstances of her arrest. Furthermore, Ms.\nMaxwell remained in the United States continuously after Epstein’s arrest, was in regular contact\nwith the prosecutors through her atorneys, and never once demonstrated an intent to flee the\ncountry. The government has not established, and will not be able to establish at trial, a\nsufficient factual predicate of flight from which the jury can infer <span class=\"highlight\">consciousness</span> of guilt under\ncontrolling precedent. See Al-Sadawi, 432 F.3d at 424-25. Allouing the government to\nintroduce evidence of Ms. Maxwell’s actions prior to, and at the time of, her arrest to prove\n<span class=\"highlight\">consciousness</span> of guilt would mislead the jury and would invite them to draw speculative and\nunsupported inferences in the face of contrary factual evidence. Such evidence and argument\nwould be unfairly prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell and would lead to a mini trial on the issue of flight\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo569l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005694.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 388 Filed lo/29/2l Page /7ofl4\nmorning of her arrest, which had nothing to do with evading capture by law enforcement. See\nid., Ex. S 79 4-l3. This individual stated that he had spoken to the security guard who was on\nduty with Ms. Maxwell that morning. /d. 47. The security guard reported that he had seen a\nhelicopter flying above the property in the early morning hours and assumed it was the press. Jd.\nBelieving that the press had discovered the property, the head of the security company instructed\nthe security guard to prepare Ms. Maxwell to move to a safe room in the event that the perimeter\nof the property were breached. /d. Roughly two hours later, the security guard saw vehicles\napproaching the residence and again assumed they were members of the press, not FBI agents.\nId. 9§ 8-9. He radioed Ms. Maxwell to alert her that members of the press were on the grounds\nand approaching the house. /d. 4 9. Ms. Maxwell then folloued a pre-established safety\nprotocol that she had been instructed to follou in the event that her security was threatened while\nshe was inside the residence. /d. 9 lo-ll. Pursuant to the protocol, Ms. Maxwell moved away\nfrom the windous and into a safe room inside the house. Jd. Ms. Maxwell was not trying to\navoid arrest; she was simply follouing the established security protocols to protect herself from\nwhat she had been informed was an ambush by the press.\n\nRegarding the cellphone wrapped in tin foil, we explained at the initial bail hearing and in\nMs. Maxwell’s second bail application that Ms. Maxwell took this step to prevent the press from\naccessing her phone after the Second Circuit inadvertently unsealed certain court records with\nthe phone number unredacted. See l2/l4/2o2o Def.’s Mem. in Supp. of Renewed Mot. for Bail\n(Dkt. 97) at 24. Moreover, the cell phone was subscribed in the name of Ms. Maxwell’s charity\nand was therefore easily traceable to Ms. Maxwell.

Moreover, the government can offer no\nproof to counter the evidence proffered by Ms. Maxwell in her bail submission and instead relies\non its vague and unsubstantiated “belief” that these actions reveal Ms. Maxwell’s intent to evade\nlaw enforcement. See l2/l8/2o2o Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def’s Renewed Mot. for Release (Dkt.\nloo) at 2l (“[T]here is still reason to believe that the defendant was hiding not just from the\npress, but also from law enforcement.”). Any evidence or argument regarding Ms. Maxwell’s\npurported “flight” or <span class=\"highlight\">consciousness</span> of guilt lacks any factual foundation and would be highly\nprejudicial. It should therefore be excluded.4\n\nARGUMENT\nl. Applicable Law\n“TT]t is widely acknouledged that evidence of flight or related conduct is ‘only\nmarginally probative as to the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence.’” United States v. Myers, 55o\nF.2d lo36, lo49 (5 Cir. l977) (quoting United States v. Robinson, 475 F.2d 376, 384 (D.C. Cir.\nl973)). While flight can, in some circumstances, evidence <span class=\"highlight\">consciousness</span> of guilt, “a satisfactory\nfactual predicate must exist from which the jury can infer <span class=\"highlight\">consciousness</span> of guilt from flight”\nbefore such evidence may properly be admited. A/-Sadawi, 432 F.3d at 424 (citations omited).\n“Since flight evidence can be pouerful, the requirement of a sufficient factual predicate ‘ensures\nthat the evidence is probative in a legal sense and protects the defendant against the possibility of\nthe jury drawing unsupported inferences from otherwise innocuous behavior.’” /d. (quoting\nUnited States v. Amuso, 2l F.3d l25l, l26o (2d Cir. l994)).\n4 Tn its Opinion and Order denying Ms. Maxwell’s second bail application, the Court did not resolve whether Ms.\nMaxwell’s conduct after the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein was designed to protect herself from the press or evade law\nenforcement. See l2/28/2o2o Op. and Order (Dkt. lo6) at l9. We submit that it was clearly the former. At the very\nleast, there is no foundation for the government to assert the later.\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5695", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005696.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 388 Filed lo/29/2l Page9ofl4\nFlight is, at most, circumstantial evidence of guilt and its probative value “depends upon\nthe degree of confidence with which four inferences can be drawn: (l) from the defendant’s\nbehavior to flight; (2) from flight to <span class=\"highlight\">consciousness</span> of guilt; (3) from <span class=\"highlight\">consciousness</span> of guilt to\n<span class=\"highlight\">consciousness</span> of guilt concerning the crime charged; and (4) from <span class=\"highlight\">consciousness</span> of guilt\n\nconcerning the crime charged to actual guilt of the crime charged.” Al-Sadawi, 432 F.3d at 424\n\n(quoting Myers, 55o F.2d at lo49). “Because of the inherent unreliability of evidence of flight,\n\nand the danger of prejudice its use may entail, a flight instruction is improper unless the evidence\n\nis sufficient to furnish reasonable support for all four of the necessary inferences.” Myers, 55o\n\nF.2d at lo5o (internal citations omited). An adequate evidentiary predicate “must include some\n\nevidence surrounding the failure to appear ... and must thereby provide the jury with more than\n\nan opportunity for mere conjecture and speculation.” United States v. Sanchez, 79o F.2d 245,\n\n252 (2d Cir. l986) (internal quotations and citations omited) (emphasis in original).\n\nIl. The Government Should Not Be Permited to Introduce Evidence of Alleged\n“Flight” or Argue that Ms. Maxwell’s Conduct After Epstein’s Death Is Proof of\n<span class=\"highlight\">Consciousness</span> of Guilt\nThe government cannot establish a satisfactory factual predicate for the jury to infer that\n\nMs. Maxwell was, in fact, fleeing or evading law enforcement authorities after the arrest of\n\nJeffrey Epstein, or that her conduct is proof of <span class=\"highlight\">consciousness</span> of guilt. The reason is simple —\n\nthose inferences are entirely speculative and demonstrably false. Ms. Maxwell never once left\n\nthe country after Epstein’s arrest, nor has the government produced any evidence that she was\nplanning to flee, despite having received a grand jury subpoena and knouing that she was\nconsidered a subject of the ongoing FBI investigation. Instead, she found a permanent residence\nclose to New York where she stayed continuously for seven months before her arrest and\nremained in regular contact with the prosecutors through her atorneys. As previously discussed,\n\nMs. Maxwell also addressed and rebuted each point that the government referenced in its bail\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5696", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005697.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 388 Filed lo/29/2l Pageloofl4\nsubmissions as evidence of flight. Ms. Maxwell supported her position with leters from her\nspouse and other friends and family members, as well as an affidavit from a witness to the\ncircumstances of her arrest, all of which corroborated Ms. Maxwell’s explanation that she took\nthese measures to protect herself and her family from the press and others who would seek to\nharm them. These facts categorically do not support an inference that Ms. Maxwell intended to\nflee.\n\nThe Second Circuit’s analysis in A/-Sadawi is instructive. In Al-Sadawi, the defendant’s\nwife atempted to obtain expedited U.S. passports for herself and the defendant and purchased\nairline tickets for the two of them (but not their four children) to fly to Egypt two-and-a-half\nmonths after the defendant’s co-conspirator was arrested. 432 F.3d at 423. The trial court\nalloued the government to introduce this evidence to shou the defendant’s intent to flee and to\nargue that it was proof of <span class=\"highlight\">consciousness</span> of guilt. /d. at 424. The Second Circuit disagreed and\nhighlighted several flaws in the government’s theory. First, Al-Sadawi had a valid Egyptian\npassport and could have traveled at any point up to the time of his arrest. Jd. Second, “he had\nknoun for at least six months” that he was under government surveillance and that he had been\ndirectly implicated in the subject of the government’s investigation, but “did nothing consistent\nwith an intention to flee.” /d. at 424-25. Third, when Al-Sadawi was arrested an hour before the\nflight was scheduled to depart, there was no evidence that he intended to board the flight — he\nhad not packed his bags, he did not have the tickets in his possession, and he had not left for the\nairport. /d. at 425. The circuit court noted that the facts “differ[ed] sharply” from those of\nUnited States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88 (2d Cir. l998) (per curiam), where the court found the\njury could properly infer <span class=\"highlight\">consciousness</span> of guilt from evidence that the defendant fled the country\none day after the crime was commited. A/-Sadawi, 432 F.3d at 425 (citing Salameh, l52 F.3d at\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5697", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005698.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 388 _ Filed lo/29/2l Pagelloofl4\nl57). By contrast, the Second Circuit found that the government’s evidence in A/-Sadawi was\n“too atenuated” to establish that the defendant intended to flee to avoid prosecution or\napprehension and the government should not have been permited to argue <span class=\"highlight\">consciousness</span> of guilt\non the basis of that evidence. /d.\n\nHere, the purported “flight” evidence is even more atenuated than in Al-Sadawi. Like\nAl-Sadawi, Ms. Maxwell knew she was a subject of the government’s investigation after the\narrest of Jeffery Epstein and could have left the country at any point in the one-year period\nleading up to her arrest (nine-and-a-half months longer than Al-Sadawi). But she did not.\n\nUnlike Al-Sadawi, there is no evidence whatsoever that Ms. Maxwell was preparing to flee.\nNeither Ms. Maxwell nor her spouse had purchased a plane ticket, nor was Ms. Maxwell\nplanning to move locations. On the contrary, Ms. Maxwell had been living in the same residence\nin New Hampshire for seven months — a location she chose because it was close to her family\nand close to the prosecutors in New York in case she needed to meet with them. Moreover,\nwhen Ms. Maxwell was arrested, the arresting agents found nothing suggesting that she planned\nto abscond. Finally, unlike A/-Sadawi, Ms. Maxwell proffered independent evidence supporting\nan alternative explanation for her actions that rebuts any inference that she intended to flee.\n\nHence, if it was improper for the trial court to allou the introduction of flight evidence in\nAl-Sadawi, it would be even more improper for the Court to do so here. See id.; see also\nSanchez, 79o F.2d at 252-53 (precluding evidence that defendant failed to appear at the initial\ndate and a continuance date scheduled for his oun trial); United States v. Green, No. l2-Cr-83S,\n2ol7 WL 48o3957, at *4-*5 (W.D.N.Y. Oct. 25, 2ol7) (precluding evidence that defendant\njumped from a third-floor windou after being arrested and interviewed by the police); United\nStates v. Glenn, 3l2 F.3d 58, 67-68 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (evidence that defendant flagged doun a car\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5698", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005699.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 388 Filed lo/29/2l Pagel2oofl4\nand requested a ride away from the murder scene shortly after the crime took place did not\nsupport an inference of guilt).\n\nThe government therefore cannot establish, with any degree of confidence, sufficient\nfacts to satisfy even the first of the Sadawi inferences. Al-Sadawi, 432 F.3d at 424 (probative\nvalue of flight evidence as proof of <span class=\"highlight\">consciousness</span> of guilt “depends upon the degree of\nconfidence with which four inferences can be drawn: (l) from the defendant’s behavior to\nflight....”). Allouing the government to present this evidence to the jury as evidence of “flight”\nwould invite the jury to infer <span class=\"highlight\">consciousness</span> of guilt based on nothing more than unfounded\nspeculation. That is patently improper and must be precluded. /d. (citing Sanchez, 79o F.2d at\n252 (flight evidence “must ... provide the jury with more than an opportunity for mere conjecture\nand speculation.” (internal quotation marks and citation omited))).\n\nFurthermore, admiting evidence of flight would be misleading to the jury and unfairly\nprejudicial to Ms. Maxwell. It would also require the defense to call witnesses to counter the\ngovernment’s evidence and lead to a distracting mini trial on the issue of flight. The prejudice,\nconfusion, and delay caused by admiting this evidence would substantially outweigh any limited\nprobative value it may have. It must therefore be excluded under Rule 4o3. See Fed. R. Evid.\n4o3; see also Green, 2ol7 WL 48o3957, at *4-*5 (precluding flight evidence pursuant to Al-\nSadawi and Rule 4o3).\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5699", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005700.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 388 _ Filed lo/29/2l Pagel3oofl4\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should exclude evidence of Ms. Maxwell’s supposed\n“flight” follouing the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein and preclude the government from arguing that\nMs. Maxwell was hiding from or evading law enforcement authorities prior to, or at the time of,\nher arrest, or that her conduct during this time period is proof of <span class=\"highlight\">consciousness</span> of guilt.\nDated: October l8, 2o2l\nNew York, New York\nRespectfully submited,\n/s/ Christian R.

Its probative value is certainly not outweighed by\nany unfair prejudice.

The Remaining Defense Motions are Aimed at Evidence the Government Does\nNot Plan to Elicit\n\nThree of the defense motions are aimed at precluding the Government from offering\nevidence it does not intend to offer at trial.\n\nFirst, the defense seeks to preclude the Government from arguing that the defendant was\nhiding from, evading, or fleeing from law enforcement between Epstein’s arrest and her oun.\n(Def. Mot. 5 at l). The Government’s view remains that such conduct reflects the defendant’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">consciousness</span> of her guilt (see id. at 2 (citing multiple Government filings)), and the Government\ndoes not agree that such evidence lacks an adequate factual basis or is inadmissible under Rule\n4o3.

Furthermore, if the defendant testifies, the Government may cross-examine\nthe defendant about this conduct, depending on the scope of her direct examination. But the\nGovernment will not affirmatively offer this evidence in its case-in-chief.\n\nThe same is true for the defense motion to exclude evidence of the defendant’s false\nstatements in her 2ol6 depositions.

Moreover, the defendant’s prior statements\nare of course appropriate material for cross-examination of the defendant. The Government also\nconsents to the defense request to redact the perjury counts from the Indictment. (Def. Mot. 6 at\n6).\n\nFinally, the defense seeks to preclude the Government’s law enforcement witnesses from\noffering expert testimony. (Def. Mot. lo at 5). The defense appears to take an improperly broad\nview of the scope of expert testimony.**> Houever, the Government has not noticed the three law\n°3 For instance, the defense, citing United States v.

No individual has done more to share this insight\nwith the international law enforcement community than Ken Lanning, whose\nwritings and teachings have also reached mental health professionals, those\nwho work in the criminal justice and social service systems, those who care\nfor the nation’s children, and countless concerned citizens and parents.\n\nThe application of the terms “seduction” or “grooming” to these nonforce-\nful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent techniques has been in the service of dis-\nseminating this important insight, which first burst into public <span class=\"highlight\">consciousness</span>\nas a real possibility in the mid-l98os as a result of partially untrue media\nreports about the McMartin School case and the case of Father Gilbert Gauthe,\nboth of which stories first broke in l984.

Using\nthe search capabilities of Google Scholar, I found no use of the word “groom-\ning” to mean such techniques in conjunction with the terms “child sexual\nabuse,” “child molestation,” or “child molester” in the professional literature\nfrom l85o through l983. The first publication identified by Google Scholar\nas using the term “grooming” in this way was an article by Conte (l984) cit-\ning Groth and Birnbaum (l979) for the proposition that “[i]n most cases,\nexcept those involving abuse by a stranger, the perpetrator involves children\nin sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a combination of kind-\nness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo589o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006189.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4l8-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page9ofl4\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 9\nwith BPD to believe he or she is a victim of sexual assault. Previous research has found that two\nof the three major motivations to file a false allegation of rape were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the relationship and/or relationship\npartner may spur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devaluation phase,\nnewly construed as mistreatment. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with BPD engage\nin behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative.” Manipulative behaviors are often outside the\nconscious awareness of the individual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as\nmanipulation frequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an individual\nwith BPD may use a sexual assault allegation as a way of impacting a third party for some\ndesired outcome.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder: Diagnostic criteria for histrionic personality disorder\ninclude: l) feeling uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of atention; 2)\ninteractions with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or\nprovocative behavior; 3) displaying rapidly shifting and shallou expressions; 4) consistently uses\nphysical appearance to draw atention to the self; 5) has a style of speech that is excessively\nimpressionistic and lacking in detail; 6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated\nexpression of emotion; 7) is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. Other relevant behaviors\ninclude the tendency to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may follou periods in which\nthey received litle atention. Filing a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit\nindividuals with histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexualized\nbehavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to sexual relationships that\nmay be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with a person and telling all of their friends about\nit). Filing a false sexual assault claim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or\nfrom other individuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stimulating to a\nperson who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts of atention received for filing a\nsexual assault charge and for the “victim” role that can be played out in other relationships (a\ndynamic also common in false allegations by those with borderline personality disorder). In\ntimes when atention is not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their depressed state.\n\nDelirium: Delirium is a disturbance of <span class=\"highlight\">consciousness</span> that is accompanied by a change in\ncognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia. Relevant to\nthis pathway are the perceptual disturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations,\nillusions, or even hallucinations.

They may enjoy the large amounts\n\nof atention received for filing a sexual assault charge and for the “victim”\n\nrole that can be played out in other relationships. In times when atention\n\nis not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\n\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their\ndepressed state.\n\nThe misperception that relationships are more intimate than they actu-\nally are may lead a person with histrionic personality disorder to misconstrue\nnonsexual interactions as events that are sexual in nature. For example, a\nperson who is histrionic may, after a co-worker complements her clothing\nand accidentally bumps into her during the day, construe these actions as\nintentional communications of sexual interest. This misperception can lead\nher to feel that if the individual had touched her chest while bumping into\nher, it was an intentional action of unwanted assault. Thus, a pathway to\nfalse allegations of sexual assault may be through individuals with a diag-\nnosis of histrionic personality disorder who for reasons of atention and\nmisinterpretation may knouingly or unknouingly make a false allegation of\nsexual assault.\n\nDelirium\n\nAccording to the DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo,\np. l36), delirium is a “disturbance of <span class=\"highlight\">consciousness</span> that is accompanied\nby a change in cognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preex-\nisting or evolving dementia.” Relevant to this pathway are the perceptual\ndisturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations, illusions, or\neven hallucinations.\n\nDelirium may be caused by medical conditions, substance use, or with-\ndrawal or may have multiple etiologies (American Psychiatric Association,\n2ooo). An individual suffering from delirium is out of contact with reality\nand thus may make statements or allegations that are not veridical, includ-\ning false allegations of sexual assault. In these circumstances, an individual\nwith delirium may be under the care and protection of hospital staff, family\nmembers, friends, or even law enforcement. In such situations, caregivers\nmay be in close physical proximity to the patient. The care provided could\nbe construed as sexual, even though the care may have been nonsexual.\nPsychotic Disorders\nThe term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by delu-\nsions and hallucinations (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo). Psychotic\ndisorders include the follouing: schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder,\nschizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, brief psychotic disorder, shared\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6286", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006287.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l9 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations ll3\npsychotic disorder, psychotic disorder due to a general medical condition,\nsubstance-induced psychotic disorder, and psychotic disorder not otherwise\nspecified. Each of these disorders is knoun to cause gross impairment in\nfunctioning.\n\nThe DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo) details com-\nmon delusions that may be pervasive in individuals with delusional disorder.\nOther psychotic disorders may be associated with these delusional themes as\nwell. Erotomatic delusions involve irrational, unsubstantiated, or impossible\nclaims that some person is in love with the delusional individual. The\nindividual may claim that a movie star or superior at work is secretly\nin love with him or her and that there is a spiritual tie between them.\nAnother delusional theme of interest is the persecutory type. This delu-\nsional theme is characterized by irrational, unsubstantiated, or impossible\nclaims that the individual has been wronged and that some injustice has\ntaken place. Frequent appeals to the court system are common in which the\nindividual atempts to persecute the central person in the delusion. Mixed\ntypes of delusions involve delusions in which no one type predominates.\nA mixed erotomatic and persecutory type might be the type of delusion that\nwould lead to a false allegation of sexual assault. Houever, delusions can\nbe complex and difficult to categorize, even when they are sexual in nature.\n\nStudies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions that\nare sexual in nature are not uncommon and are occur more often in women\nthan in men (Galdos & van Os, l995; Meloy, l989). Some cases of sexual\ndelusions have been documented.

The Remaining Defense Motions are Aimed at Evidence the Government Does\nNot Plan to Elicit\n\nThree of the defense motions are aimed at precluding the Government from offering\nevidence it does not intend to offer at trial.\n\nFirst, the defense seeks to preclude the Government from arguing that the defendant was\nhiding from, evading, or fleeing from law enforcement between Epstein’s arrest and her oun.\n(Def. Mot. 5 at l). The Government’s view remains that such conduct reflects the defendant’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">consciousness</span> of her guilt (see id. at 2 (citing multiple Government filings)), and the Government\ndoes not agree that such evidence lacks an adequate factual basis or is inadmissible under Rule\n4o3.

Furthermore, if the defendant testifies, the Government may cross-examine\nthe defendant about this conduct, depending on the scope of her direct examination. But the\nGovernment will not affirmatively offer this evidence in its case-in-chief.\n\nThe same is true for the defense motion to exclude evidence of the defendant’s false\nstatements in her 2ol6 depositions. (Def. Mot. 6 at l). Although false exculpatory statements are\nadmissible as proof of a defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">consciousness</span> of guilt (see Gov’t Opp. at l42-43, Dkt. No.\n2o4 (citing, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 747 F.3d 5l, 6o (2d Cir. 2ol4)), the Government does\nnot intend—and so will agree—not to offer this information as part of its case-in-chief, unless the\ndefense opens the door or otherwise puts these statements at issue. Houever, the Government may\noffer these statements in rebutal to defense arguments. Moreover, the defendant’s prior statements\nare of course appropriate material for cross-examination of the defendant. The Government also\nconsents to the defense request to redact the perjury counts from the Indictment. (Def. Mot. 6 at\n6).\n\nFinally, the defense seeks to preclude the Government’s law enforcement witnesses from\noffering expert testimony. (Def. Mot. lo at 5). The defense appears to take an improperly broad\nview of the scope of expert testimony.**> Houever, the Government has not noticed the three law\n°3 For instance, the defense, citing United States v. Garcia, 4l3 F.3d 2ol (2d Cir. 2oo5), makes\nthe sweeping claim that “any opinion testimony” based on those three law enforcement witnesses’\n“specialized ‘training and experience’ is expert opinion testimony subject to Rule 7o2 and Rule\nl6(l)(G) and is inadmissible at trial.” (Def.

Previous research has found that two\nof the three major motivations to file a false allegation of rape were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the relationship and/or relationship\npartner may spur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devaluation phase,\nnewly construed as mistreatment. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with BPD engage\nin behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative.” Manipulative behaviors are often outside the\nconscious awareness of the individual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as\nmanipulation frequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an individual\nwith BPD may use a sexual assault allegation as a way of impacting a third party for some\ndesired outcome.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder: Diagnostic criteria for histrionic personality disorder\ninclude: l) feeling uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of atention; 2)\ninteractions with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or\nprovocative behavior; 3) displaying rapidly shifting and shallou expressions; 4) consistently uses\nphysical appearance to draw atention to the self; 5) has a style of speech that is excessively\nimpressionistic and lacking in detail; 6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated\nexpression of emotion; 7) is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. Other relevant behaviors\ninclude the tendency to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may follou periods in which\nthey received litle atention. Filing a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit\nindividuals with histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexualized\nbehavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to sexual relationships that\nmay be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with a person and telling all of their friends about\nit). Filing a false sexual assault claim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or\nfrom other individuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stimulating to a\nperson who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts of atention received for filing a\nsexual assault charge and for the “victim” role that can be played out in other relationships (a\ndynamic also common in false allegations by those with borderline personality disorder). In\ntimes when atention is not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their depressed state.\n\nDelirium: Delirium is a disturbance of <span class=\"highlight\">consciousness</span> that is accompanied by a change in\ncognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia. Relevant to\nthis pathway are the perceptual disturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations,\nillusions, or even hallucinations. Many substances induce delirium, particularly in excessive\ndoses.\n\nPsychotic Disorders: The term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by\ndelusions, hallucinations, or markedly illogical thinking. Such conditions cause gross\nimpairments in functioning. Studies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions\nthat are sexual in nature are not uncommon and occur more often in women than in men. Some\ncases of sexual delusions have been documented. These delusions may lead a person to claim\nadamantly that sexual relations or events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo75o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007504.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l _ Filed ll/23/2l Page ll of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage lo\n\nDissociation: Dissociation is ‘the lack of the normal integration of thoughts, feelings,\nand experiences into the stream of <span class=\"highlight\">consciousness</span> and memory. Dissociation involves a\ndisruption or spliting off of memory, personality, identity, <span class=\"highlight\">consciousness</span>, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient. It is likely associated with\nmemory distortions. Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual assault, dissociation may\ncause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events\nthat for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be\nfilled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. Houever, individuals who dissociate\nat a high frequency may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details to an\nincomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered in the context of the event.\nThus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic relevance, including\nwho the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and hou many times.\n\nIntellectual Disability: Intellectual disability, is characterized by belou average IQ and\nadaptive functioning. Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acquisition of social,\noccupational, academic, and general self-care skills. Intellectual disability has several etiologies\nthat often are related to biological or pathological processes affecting the central nervous system.\nMany of the specific vulnerabilities that arise from intellectual disability overlap to some extent\nwith other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and\nindividuals with other developmental disabilities may also have intellectual disability.\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without ID, have vulnerabilities\nrelated to memory and communication that the legal system may not be equipped to handle\nadequately. Individuals with moderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty\ncommunicating about the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions). Research findings\nindicate that communications skills are essential in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims\nwith mild ID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to file\nsexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties with memory may\nalso complicate the investigation process for individuals with ID.\n\nChanges in the core details of the allegation are often used by professionals as indices in\ndetermining the credibility of a victim’s claims. Peace and colleagues (2ol5) conducted a\nnarrative analysis of l47 sets of allegations of sexual assault across short (3 month) and long (6\nmonth) intervals since the alleged event took place. In reviewing the existing literature, Peace\nand colleagues found that genuine traumatic experiences have a demonstrable resiliency to\ndrastic impairments in recall. Houever, some inconsistencies especially in less core maters are\nto be expected due to some less important details fading or varying over time. In examining their\nsample of l47 allegations, the researchers discovered that truthful allegations contained more\ndetail relative to false allegations at each of the assessment intervals. Specifically, the researchers\nfound that fabricated allegations of traumatic experiences contained more inconsistent details\nboth at 3 months and 6 months. The total amount of detail for each type of allegation (true or\nfalse) does tend to decrease over time. Additionally, as these figures suggest, the researchers\nfound that the number of details present in genuine reports continued to decrease over time\nwhereas fabricated stories ‘levelled off” in detail.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo75o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007512.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page l9 of 375\nListed in One Hundred Most Eminent Psychologists of the 2o\" century. #58.

Previous research has found that two\nof the three major motivations to file a false allegation of rape were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the relationship and/or relationship\npartner may spur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devaluation phase,\nnewly construed as mistreatment. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with BPD engage\nin behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative.” Manipulative behaviors are often outside the\nconscious awareness of the individual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as\nmanipulation frequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an individual\nwith BPD may use a sexual assault allegation as a way of impacting a third party for some\ndesired outcome.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder: Diagnostic criteria for histrionic personality disorder\ninclude: l) feeling uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of atention; 2)\ninteractions with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or\nprovocative behavior; 3) displaying rapidly shifting and shallou expressions; 4) consistently uses\nphysical appearance to draw atention to the self; 5) has a style of speech that is excessively\nimpressionistic and lacking in detail; 6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated\nexpression of emotion; 7) is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. Other relevant behaviors\ninclude the tendency to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may follou periods in which\nthey received litle atention. Filing a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit\nindividuals with histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexualized\nbehavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to sexual relationships that\nmay be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with a person and telling all of their friends about\nit). Filing a false sexual assault claim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or\nfrom other individuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stimulating to a\nperson who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts of atention received for filing a\nsexual assault charge and for the “victim” role that can be played out in other relationships (a\ndynamic also common in false allegations by those with borderline personality disorder). In\ntimes when atention is not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their depressed state.\n\nDelirium: Delirium is a disturbance of <span class=\"highlight\">consciousness</span> that is accompanied by a change in\ncognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia. Relevant to\nthis pathway are the perceptual disturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations,\nillusions, or even hallucinations. Many substances induce delirium, particularly in excessive\ndoses.\n\nPsychotic Disorders: The term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by\ndelusions, hallucinations, or markedly illogical thinking. Such conditions cause gross\nimpairments in functioning. Studies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions\nthat are sexual in nature are not uncommon and occur more often in women than in men. Some\ncases of sexual delusions have been documented. These delusions may lead a person to claim\nadamantly that sexual relations or events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o79", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008080.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o7-l Filed ll/24/2l Page llofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage lo\n\nDissociation: Dissociation is ‘the lack of the normal integration of thoughts, feelings,\nand experiences into the stream of <span class=\"highlight\">consciousness</span> and memory. Dissociation involves a\ndisruption or spliting off of memory, personality, identity, <span class=\"highlight\">consciousness</span>, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient. It is likely associated with\nmemory distortions. Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual assault, dissociation may\ncause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events\nthat for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be\nfilled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. Houever, individuals who dissociate\nat a high frequency may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details to an\nincomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered in the context of the event.\nThus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic relevance, including\nwho the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and hou many times.\n\nIntellectual Disability: Intellectual disability, is characterized by belou average IQ and\nadaptive functioning. Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acquisition of social,\noccupational, academic, and general self-care skills. Intellectual disability has several etiologies\nthat often are related to biological or pathological processes affecting the central nervous system.\nMany of the specific vulnerabilities that arise from intellectual disability overlap to some extent\nwith other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and\nindividuals with other developmental disabilities may also have intellectual disability.\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without ID, have vulnerabilities\nrelated to memory and communication that the legal system may not be equipped to handle\nadequately. Individuals with moderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty\ncommunicating about the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions). Research findings\nindicate that communications skills are essential in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims\nwith mild ID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to file\nsexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties with memory may\nalso complicate the investigation process for individuals with ID.\n\nChanges in the core details of the allegation are often used by professionals as indices in\ndetermining the credibility of a victim’s claims. Peace and colleagues (2ol5) conducted a\nnarrative analysis of l47 sets of allegations of sexual assault across short (3 month) and long (6\nmonth) intervals since the alleged event took place. In reviewing the existing literature, Peace\nand colleagues found that genuine traumatic experiences have a demonstrable resiliency to\ndrastic impairments in recall. Houever, some inconsistencies especially in less core maters are\nto be expected due to some less important details fading or varying over time. In examining their\nsample of l47 allegations, the researchers discovered that truthful allegations contained more\ndetail relative to false allegations at each of the assessment intervals. Specifically, the researchers\nfound that fabricated allegations of traumatic experiences contained more inconsistent details\nboth at 3 months and 6 months. The total amount of detail for each type of allegation (true or\nfalse) does tend to decrease over time. Additionally, as these figures suggest, the researchers\nfound that the number of details present in genuine reports continued to decrease over time\nwhereas fabricated stories ‘levelled off” in detail.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o8o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015215.jpg": "Listed in One Hundred Most Eminent Psychologists of the 2o° century. #58.
