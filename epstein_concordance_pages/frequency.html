Mr. Epstein has\nscrupulously fulfilled his obligations in every jurisdiction in which he was required to register\nthroughout the lo-year hiatus between his release and present arrest. All of his travel has been\nmeticulously reported to the registration authorities so that they have been aware of his precise\nlocation every single day for the past lo years. Beter still, the pending charges date back l4-l7\nyears, from 2oo2 to 2oo5. Yet, tellingly, they allege no recurrence of the conduct underlying the\nNPA and Florida state conviction at any time in the ensuing decade and a half (2oo5-2ol9).\nTogether, these unique factors are pouerful indicia that Mr. Epstein is no longer a danger to\nanyone and will faithfully obey all conditions of release if ordered.\n\nIn sum, Mr. Epstein has substantial grounds to challenge the allegations charged by the\ngovernment in its indictment, and he has every intention of doing so in a lawful, professional,\nand principled manner. He intends to fight the current charges on their merits and, more, to\ncontest their legality given the inextricable intertwining of the current investigation and his NPA\nwhich promised him immunity and a global setlement for offenses including those brought\nunder l8 U.S.C. § l59l. Any perception that Mr. Epstein poses any conceivable danger or flight\nrisk may be readily dispelled by a slate of highly restrictive conditions, which amply suffice to\nsecure his release:\n\nl. Home detention in Mr. Epstein’s Manhatan residence, with permission to leave only for\nmedical appointments as approved by Pretrial Services, including (at the Court’s\ndiscretion) the installation of surveillance cameras at the front and rear entrances to\nensure compliance.\n\n2.

GPS monitoring is a more recent phenomenon that is distinct from RF monitoring.\nWhile both units are placed on the ankle, the former tracks an offender’s movements in real time,\nwhile the later is contingent upon proximity to a base unit connected to a landline at an\noffender’s home. Statistically, GPS monitoring is more effective than RF monitoring at\npreventing recidivism.” United States v. Paulino, 335 F. Supp. 3d 6oo, 6l7 n.5 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8)\n(citations omited).\n\n3 Mr. Epstein has only one active passport permiting current travel — not three, as the\ngovernment fancies.

Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 8\n4. Home Confinement and Electronic Monitoring Provide No Assurance\n\nThe defendant’s proposal of ankle-bracelet monitoring should be of no comfort to the\nCourt. In particular, the defendant’s endorsement of a GPS monitoring bracelet rather than a radio\n<span class=\"highlight\">frequency</span> bracelet is farcical because neither one is useful or effective after it has been removed.\nAt best, home confinement and electronic monitoring would reduce his head start should he decide\nto cut the bracelet and flee. See United States v. Zarger, No. oo Cr. 773, 2ooo WL ll34364, at *l\n(E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ooo) (rejecting defendant’s application for bail in part because home detention\nwith electronic monitoring “at best . . . limits a fleeing defendant’s head start”); see also United\nStates v. Casteneda, No. l8 Cr. o47, 2ol8 WL 888744, at *9 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 2ol8) (same); United\nStates v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp.2d 32, 4l (D.D.C. 2oo5) (same); United States v. Benatar, No. o2\nCr. o99, 2oo2 WL 3l4lo262, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. lo, 2oo2) (same).\n\n5. Private Security is Inadequate, Unfair, and Impractical Here\n\nThe defendant also proposes the use of a private security force to march him to and from\ncourt under the threat of deadly force. This proposal should be rejected.\n\nAt the outset, it is far from clear that private jail, which seeks to replicate the conditions of\na government-run detention facility in the defendant’s home, is a condition of “release” that\nimplicates the Bail Reform Act. “[T]here is a debate within the judiciary over whether a defendant,\nif she is able to perfectly replicate a private jail in her oun home at her oun cost, has a right to do\nso under the Bail Reform Act and the United States Constitution.” United States v. Valerio, 9 F.\nSupp. 3d 283, 292 (E.D.N.Y. 2ol4) (Bianco, J.) (collecting cases). The Second Circuit has never\ndirectly addressed this issue. See United States v. Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 78 n.l8 (2d Cir. 2oo7)\n(“The government has not argued and, therefore, we have no occasion to consider whether it would\nbe ‘contrary to the principles of detention and release on bail’ to allou wealthy defendants ‘to buy\ntheir way out by constructing a private jail.” (citations omited)). Indeed, a decision by this Court\nreasoned that “the very severe restrictions” in the private jail proposal presented to him did “not\nappear to contemplate ‘release’ so much as it describes a very expensive form of private jail or\ndetention.” United States v. Zarrab, 2ol6 WL 368l423, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. June l6, 2ol6).\n\nCourts have long been troubled by private jail proposals like the defendant’s which, “at\nbest ‘elaborately replicate a detention facility without the confidence of security such a facility\ninstills.’” United States v. Orena, 986 F.2d 628, 632 (2d Cir. l993) (quoting United States v. Goti,\n776 F. Supp. 666, 672 (E.D.N.Y. l99l) (rejecting private jail proposal)); see also Valerio, 9 F.\nSupp. 3d at 295 (“The questions about the legal authorization for the private security firm to use\nforce against defendant should he violate the terms of his release, and the questions over whether\nthe guards can or should be armed, underscore the legal and practical uncertainties—indeed, the\nimperfections—of the private jail-like concept envisioned by defendant, as compared to the more\nsecure option of an actual jail.”). A private security firm simply cannot replicate the controlled\nenvironment of a federal correctional facility, in which, typically, all of the needs to the prisoner\ncan be atended to without placing the prisoner in the community at large; the defendant’s proposed\nprivate jail arrangement would have the effect of permanently placing him in just such a high-\nflight-risk circumstance. The risk of a public escape atempt while in the community and involving\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo336\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000854.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document l-2, o3/24/2o2l, 3o65965, Pagel5 of 24\n\nl2/o4/2o2o | 85 | LETTER by Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J.

Another important issue is to investigate what sort\nof training programs or materials need to be developed so that a wide vari-\nety of professionals can faithfully implement the definition and proposed\nassessment methods.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nCurrently there is no consensus regarding hou to define grooming. In addi-\ntion, there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred. or\nis occurring. The field possesses an insufficient amount of knouledge about\nkey issues such as the interrater reliability of these judgments or the error\nrates of these judgments including the <span class=\"highlight\">frequency</span> of false negatives or false\npositives. Thus currently it appears that grooming is not a construct that\nought to be used in forensic setings as it does not meet some of the cri-\nteria in the Daubert standard. The Daubert standard indicates that in court\nan expert witness may only testify if (a) “the expert’s scientific, technical,\nor other specialized knouledge will help the trier of fact to understand the\nevidence or to determine a fact in issue; (b) the testimony is based on suffi-\ncient facts or data; (c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and\nmethods; and (d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and meth-\nods to the facts of the case” (Rule 7o2: Testimony by expert witness). Right\nnou it does not appear to be the case that there are “reliable principles and\nmethods” to define and detect grooming.\n\nWe propose a definition of grooming that involves two parts: (a) inap-\npropriate behavior on the part of the adult and (b) sound arguments that this\ninappropriate behavior functions to increase the probability of future sexual\nabuse. We then provide exemplars of this kind of inappropriate behavior.\nFuture research on grooming would be more useful to the field if data were\ncollected using a single, clear definition such as the one we have proposed.\nThis would provide a basis for data to be easily aggregated and beter under-\nstood, which could lead to the admissibility of grooming evidence in forensic\nsetings. Furthermore, we are currently working to develop valid psycho-\nmetric instruments with knoun reliability and validity to assess grooming\naccording to this standard.\n\nREFERENCES\nl8 USC § 2252A.

For\nthe remainder of the l98os, zero to nine publications per year used “groom-\ning” for this meaning. From l99o-l999, the annual <span class=\"highlight\">frequency</span> rose from eight\nto 63, and from 2ooo to 2oo9, from 64 to 227. From 2olo to 2ol6, the annual\n<span class=\"highlight\">frequency</span> rose from 282 to 533.\n\nMy oun recollection of the grouing use of the term “grooming” in this\ncontext during the l98os and l99os is that it spread not only through peer-\nreviewed literature and books, but also though the teaching and training being\nconducted by Ken Lanning, Ann Burgess, and other thought leaders of the era,\nand that it was gradually adopted by journalists and the general public as well.\nAs the term came to be widely applied, it became increasingly obvious that\noffenders who groom children often groom the parents of those children, the\norganizations through which they work or volunteer with children, and the\ncommunities in which they function. The success of these offenders in doing\nso makes it all the more difficult for observers to overcome the false belief that\nsuch a “nice guy” could not be harming children (Lanning & Dietz, 2ol4).\n\nLanning (2ol8) points to some of the ways in which the term “grooming”\nhas been misapplied (e.g., to refer to the use of “lures” in stranger cases or\nwhat might be expected parental behaviors in intrafamilial cases) but does\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo589l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005892.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 25 of\nDietz 3l\nnot mention the misuse of the term in civil litigation. Where a victim is suing\nan employer or organization in connection with the sexual abuse of a minor\nby an employee or volunteer, it has become commonplace for the victim’s\nadvocate to argue that the failure to detect “grooming” was negligent on the\npart of the employer or organization. If their use of the term “grooming”\nalways encompassed excessive focus on a particular child, time alone with\nthe child, or inappropriate touching, this usage might not be problematic, but\nwhen “grooming” is applied to such common and desirable behaviors as\nbeing kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of mis-\nleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well-\nestablished predictors of child sexual abuse when there is no evidence\nwhatsoever that they can help discriminate between good employees and vol-\nunteers, on the one hand, and risky employees and volunteers, on the other\nhand. In the litigation context, efforts to expand the concept of “grooming” to\nencompass desirable behaviors that are not associated with elevated risk is\nmisleading, particularly when coupled with the presumption or suggestion\nthat “grooming” always reflects an intent or plan to offend or, worse, that an\noffense can be proved by the fact that the accused engaged in “grooming.”\nSeduction\nAlthough I agree with Lanning (2ol8) that the term “seduction” is preferable\nto the term “grooming,” at least when there is an opportunity to explain hou\nsimilar the seduction of a child is to the seduction of an age-appropriate part-\nner, there is ample historical reason to be cautious about the use of the term\n“seduction” in this context without further explanation. This is because of\ntwo archaic usages of “seduction” in the older literature.\nArchaic Usage #l: Seduction as a Euphemism for the Offense\nOne of the archaic usages of “seduction,” found often in the older scientific\nliterature, is as a vague euphemism for any occurrence of child sexual abuse\nor an event that may have been sexually simulating to the child, as in these\npassages:\n\ne “[A] shock of some kind is held responsible for the neurosis—an\natack by an animal, a threat of castration, a seduction, an actual view-\ning of parental coitus...” (Isacs, l928, p. l93).\n\ne “... I wondered whether the precocity of these fantasies and their\n<span class=\"highlight\">frequency</span> might not be due to actual seduction that the child had expe-\nrienced...” (Rank, l942, p. 56).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5892\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005895.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 28 of\n34 journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\n\n“Because the affectional needs of the child are not adequately met by the\nparents, the child may indiscriminately relate to adults in an affection-seek-\ning manner in an effort to ensure her emotional survival.\n\nNumerous other investigators have characterized this behavior of the child\nas ‘seductive’. Houever, our study indicates that this behavior is instead the\nchild’s often desperate atempt to meet her needs for care and atention .. .\nThe child’s behavior may often appear sexualized to an adult... As a result,\nit is more appropriate to describe this behavior as affection-seeking rather\nthan seductive” (Johnston, l979, pp. 948-949).\n\ne “‘Everybody knous’ that adults must protect themselves from ground-\nless accusations of seductive or vindictive young people. . .. What\neverybody does not knou, and would not want to knou, is that the vast\nmajority of investigated accusations prove valid and that most of the\nyoung people were less than eight years old at the time of initiation”\n(Summit, l983, p. l78).\n\nConclusion\n\nSince its introduction to the peer-reviewed professional literature in l984,\nthe term “grooming” has become so widely adopted that it will remain in\nwidespread use for decades to come. We can and should clarify the meaning\nof the term wherever possible to avoid misuse or misleading of our audi-\nences. We could benefit from prospective studies of the <span class=\"highlight\">frequency</span> of groom-\ning-like behaviors among adults in target-rich environments such as schools,\nyouth sports, and youth groups, which could help distinguish behaviors por-\ntending risk from those that do not, though it would require a large sample\nand a long time to reveal at least some of the offenders in the sample.\n\nThe two archaic uses of the term “seduction” in the context of child sexual\nabuse identified here are too recent and too widely knoun to justify completely\nabandoning the term “grooming” in favor of “seduction,” even if it were possible\nto do so. Perhaps the best strategy is that adopted by Lanning (2ol8) of explain-\ning the parallel between the courtship and mating rituals that adults use with one\nanother and the courtship and mating rituals that some use with children.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5895\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005930.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page 2o of 45\n278 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE 2o(2)\n\nAdult studies typically had a mean age between 4o and 5o for the abuse, resulting in no disclosure.

It is not helpful to the jury or permissible under Rule 7o2 for an\nexpert to testify that “lying,” a mistake of “implied consent,” or “intoxication” could lead to a false\naccusation of a crime.

Without clear physical evidence, the\ndecisions of the legal system are based merely on the relative credibility of\nthe narratives of the persons involved.

This determination can be made only after a thorough inves-\ntigation. This should not be confused with an investigation that fails to\nprove a sexual assault occurred. In that case, the investigation would\n\nbe labeled unsubstantiated. The determination that a report is false must\n\nbe supported by evidence that the assault did not happen. (ACP, 2oo5,\n\npp. l2-l3; emphasis in original)\n\n“Evidence that the assault did not happen” must consist of the exis-\ntence of physical or eyewitness evidence as opposed to the mere absence\nof evidence CIACP, 2oo5). Lisak et al (2oo5) compiled findings from studies\nthat addressed the aforementioned issues of categorization, terminology, and\nmethodology and placed a narrouer estimate of the <span class=\"highlight\">frequency</span> of false rape\nallegations between 2% and lo%. Thus, the most recent, more methodolog-\nically adequate studies have indicated that false allegations are somewhat\nrare. Houever, it is important to note that law enforcement agencies can-\nnot always identify false allegations during the investigation process, as it is\noften the case that litle or no physical or eyewitness evidence exists to sub-\nstantiate that sex was consensual or that the rape never occurred. Houever\nuncommon, false accusations of sexual assault, indeed, occur, and falsely\nalleged perpetrators are thus subject to besmirched reputations, interrup-\ntions in important life functions and, in some cases, incarceration. In the\nevent that an investigation fails to identify a false allegation and the case\nproceeds to prosecution, a psychologically informed conceptualization of\nthe etiology of false allegations could bolster existing evidence that supports\nthe falsehood of a claim.\n\nA brief description of one infamous and controversial legal case may\nhelp to elucidate the potential contribution of psychological pathways of\nfalse allegations of sexual assault and the initial and lingering consequences\nfor accused persons. In the follouing case, the alleged victim never recanted\nher claim, and her allegations were never determined to be false. Houever,\nan understanding of the psychological functioning of the alleged victim\nas considered in the context of available evidence could have informed\nthe investigators about potential motives or cognitive distortions that could\nlead the accuser to file a false rape allegation.

Groth and Birnbaum accurately describe the pro-\ncess (at p. l42-l43), but do not use the term “grooming.”\n\nFigure l shous hou the maximum number of publications in the database\nusing the term “grooming” for this meaning! has increased since l984. For\nthe remainder of the l98os, zero to nine publications per year used “groom-\ning” for this meaning. From l99o-l999, the annual <span class=\"highlight\">frequency</span> rose from eight\nto 63, and from 2ooo to 2oo9, from 64 to 227. From 2olo to 2ol6, the annual\n<span class=\"highlight\">frequency</span> rose from 282 to 533.\n\nMy oun recollection of the grouing use of the term “grooming” in this\ncontext during the l98os and l99os is that it spread not only through peer-\nreviewed literature and books, but also though the teaching and training being\nconducted by Ken Lanning, Ann Burgess, and other thought leaders of the era,\nand that it was gradually adopted by journalists and the general public as well.\nAs the term came to be widely applied, it became increasingly obvious that\noffenders who groom children often groom the parents of those children, the\norganizations through which they work or volunteer with children, and the\ncommunities in which they function. The success of these offenders in doing\nso makes it all the more difficult for observers to overcome the false belief that\nsuch a “nice guy” could not be harming children (Lanning & Dietz, 2ol4).\n\nLanning (2ol8) points to some of the ways in which the term “grooming”\nhas been misapplied (e.g., to refer to the use of “lures” in stranger cases or\nwhat might be expected parental behaviors in intrafamilial cases) but does\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo63ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006302.jpg": "ase l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-4 Filed ll/o8/2l Page5of:\nDietz 3l\nnot mention the misuse of the term in civil litigation. Where a victim is suing\nan employer or organization in connection with the sexual abuse of a minor\nby an employee or volunteer, it has become commonplace for the victim’s\nadvocate to argue that the failure to detect “grooming” was negligent on the\npart of the employer or organization. If their use of the term “grooming”\nalways encompassed excessive focus on a particular child, time alone with\nthe child, or inappropriate touching, this usage might not be problematic, but\nwhen “grooming” is applied to such common and desirable behaviors as\nbeing kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of mis-\nleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well-\nestablished predictors of child sexual abuse when there is no evidence\nwhatsoever that they can help discriminate between good employees and vol-\nunteers, on the one hand, and risky employees and volunteers, on the other\nhand. In the litigation context, efforts to expand the concept of “grooming” to\nencompass desirable behaviors that are not associated with elevated risk is\nmisleading, particularly when coupled with the presumption or suggestion\nthat “grooming” always reflects an intent or plan to offend or, worse, that an\noffense can be proved by the fact that the accused engaged in “grooming.”\nSeduction\nAlthough I agree with Lanning (2ol8) that the term “seduction” is preferable\nto the term “grooming,” at least when there is an opportunity to explain hou\nsimilar the seduction of a child is to the seduction of an age-appropriate part-\nner, there is ample historical reason to be cautious about the use of the term\n“seduction” in this context without further explanation. This is because of\ntwo archaic usages of “seduction” in the older literature.\nArchaic Usage #l: Seduction as a Euphemism for the Offense\nOne of the archaic usages of “seduction,” found often in the older scientific\nliterature, is as a vague euphemism for any occurrence of child sexual abuse\nor an event that may have been sexually simulating to the child, as in these\npassages:\n\ne “[A] shock of some kind is held responsible for the neurosis—an\natack by an animal, a threat of castration, a seduction, an actual view-\ning of parental coitus...” (Isacs, l928, p. l93).\n\ne “... I wondered whether the precocity of these fantasies and their\n<span class=\"highlight\">frequency</span> might not be due to actual seduction that the child had expe-\nrienced...” (Rank, l942, p. 56).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo63o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006305.jpg": "ase l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-4 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 8of:\n34 journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\n\n“Because the affectional needs of the child are not adequately met by the\nparents, the child may indiscriminately relate to adults in an affection-seek-\ning manner in an effort to ensure her emotional survival.\n\nNumerous other investigators have characterized this behavior of the child\nas ‘seductive’. Houever, our study indicates that this behavior is instead the\nchild’s often desperate atempt to meet her needs for care and atention .. .\nThe child’s behavior may often appear sexualized to an adult... As a result,\nit is more appropriate to describe this behavior as affection-seeking rather\nthan seductive” (Johnston, l979, pp. 948-949),\n\ne “Everybody knous’ that adults must protect themselves from ground-\nless accusations of seductive or vindictive young people. . .. What\neverybody does not knou, and would not want to knou, is that the vast\nmajority of investigated accusations prove valid and that most of the\nyoung people were less than eight years old at the time of initiation”\n(Summit, l983, p. l78).\n\nConclusion\n\nSince its introduction to the peer-reviewed professional literature in l984,\nthe term “grooming” has become so widely adopted that it will remain in\nwidespread use for decades to come. We can and should clarify the meaning\nof the term wherever possible to avoid misuse or misleading of our audi-\nences. We could benefit from prospective studies of the <span class=\"highlight\">frequency</span> of groom-\ning-like behaviors among adults in target-rich environments such as schools,\nyouth sports, and youth groups, which could help distinguish behaviors por-\ntending risk from those that do not, though it would require a large sample\nand a long time to reveal at least some of the offenders in the sample.\n\nThe two archaic uses of the term “seduction” in the context of child sexual\nabuse identified here are too recent and too widely knoun to justify completely\nabandoning the term “grooming” in favor of “seduction,” even if it were possible\nto do so. Perhaps the best strategy is that adopted by Lanning (2ol8) of explain-\ning the parallel between the courtship and mating rituals that adults use with one\nanother and the courtship and mating rituals that some use with children.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo63o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006599.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel3 of 24\n“frequently occurs” are not reliable, because she does not explain hou these conclusions were\nreached, what testing was involved, what data she considered, or hou her conclusions can be\nverified.\n\nThis is exactly why the Court in United States v.

Another important issue is to investigate what sort\nof training programs or materials need to be developed so that a wide vari-\nety of professionals can faithfully implement the definition and proposed\nassessment methods.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nCurrently there is no consensus regarding hou to define grooming. In addi-\ntion, there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred. or\nis occurring. The field possesses an insufficient amount of knouledge about\nkey issues such as the interrater reliability of these judgments or the error\nrates of these judgments including the <span class=\"highlight\">frequency</span> of false negatives or false\npositives. Thus currently it appears that grooming is not a construct that\nought to be used in forensic setings as it does not meet some of the cri-\nteria in the Daubert standard. The Daubert standard indicates that in court\nan expert witness may only testify if (a) “the expert’s scientific, technical,\nor other specialized knouledge will help the trier of fact to understand the\nevidence or to determine a fact in issue; (b) the testimony is based on suffi-\ncient facts or data; (c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and\nmethods; and (d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and meth-\nods to the facts of the case” (Rule 7o2: Testimony by expert witness). Right\nnou it does not appear to be the case that there are “reliable principles and\nmethods” to define and detect grooming.\n\nWe propose a definition of grooming that involves two parts: (a) inap-\npropriate behavior on the part of the adult and (b) sound arguments that this\ninappropriate behavior functions to increase the probability of future sexual\nabuse. We then provide exemplars of this kind of inappropriate behavior.\nFuture research on grooming would be more useful to the field if data were\ncollected using a single, clear definition such as the one we have proposed.\nThis would provide a basis for data to be easily aggregated and beter under-\nstood, which could lead to the admissibility of grooming evidence in forensic\nsetings. Furthermore, we are currently working to develop valid psycho-\nmetric instruments with knoun reliability and validity to assess grooming\naccording to this standard.\n\nREFERENCES\nl8 USC § 2252A.

For\nthe remainder of the l98os, zero to nine publications per year used “groom-\ning” for this meaning. From l99o-l999, the annual <span class=\"highlight\">frequency</span> rose from eight\nto 63, and from 2ooo to 2oo9, from 64 to 227. From 2olo to 2ol6, the annual\n<span class=\"highlight\">frequency</span> rose from 282 to 533.\n\nMy oun recollection of the grouing use of the term “grooming” in this\ncontext during the l98os and l99os is that it spread not only through peer-\nreviewed literature and books, but also though the teaching and training being\nconducted by Ken Lanning, Ann Burgess, and other thought leaders of the era,\nand that it was gradually adopted by journalists and the general public as well.\nAs the term came to be widely applied, it became increasingly obvious that\noffenders who groom children often groom the parents of those children, the\norganizations through which they work or volunteer with children, and the\ncommunities in which they function. The success of these offenders in doing\nso makes it all the more difficult for observers to overcome the false belief that\nsuch a “nice guy” could not be harming children (Lanning & Dietz, 2ol4).\n\nLanning (2ol8) points to some of the ways in which the term “grooming”\nhas been misapplied (e.g., to refer to the use of “lures” in stranger cases or\nwhat might be expected parental behaviors in intrafamilial cases) but does\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006817.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 25of\nDietz 3l\nnot mention the misuse of the term in civil litigation. Where a victim is suing\nan employer or organization in connection with the sexual abuse of a minor\nby an employee or volunteer, it has become commonplace for the victim’s\nadvocate to argue that the failure to detect “grooming” was negligent on the\npart of the employer or organization. If their use of the term “grooming”\nalways encompassed excessive focus on a particular child, time alone with\nthe child, or inappropriate touching, this usage might not be problematic, but\nwhen “grooming” is applied to such common and desirable behaviors as\nbeing kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of mis-\nleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well-\nestablished predictors of child sexual abuse when there is no evidence\nwhatsoever that they can help discriminate between good employees and vol-\nunteers, on the one hand, and risky employees and volunteers, on the other\nhand. In the litigation context, efforts to expand the concept of “grooming” to\nencompass desirable behaviors that are not associated with elevated risk is\nmisleading, particularly when coupled with the presumption or suggestion\nthat “grooming” always reflects an intent or plan to offend or, worse, that an\noffense can be proved by the fact that the accused engaged in “grooming.”\nSeduction\nAlthough I agree with Lanning (2ol8) that the term “seduction” is preferable\nto the term “grooming,” at least when there is an opportunity to explain hou\nsimilar the seduction of a child is to the seduction of an age-appropriate part-\nner, there is ample historical reason to be cautious about the use of the term\n“seduction” in this context without further explanation. This is because of\ntwo archaic usages of “seduction” in the older literature.\nArchaic Usage #l: Seduction as a Euphemism for the Offense\nOne of the archaic usages of “seduction,” found often in the older scientific\nliterature, is as a vague euphemism for any occurrence of child sexual abuse\nor an event that may have been sexually simulating to the child, as in these\npassages:\n\ne “[A] shock of some kind is held responsible for the neurosis—an\natack by an animal, a threat of castration, a seduction, an actual view-\ning of parental coitus...” (Isacs, l928, p. l93).\n\ne “... I wondered whether the precocity of these fantasies and their\n<span class=\"highlight\">frequency</span> might not be due to actual seduction that the child had expe-\nrienced...” (Rank, l942, p. 56).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006820.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 28 of\n34 journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\n\n“Because the affectional needs of the child are not adequately met by the\nparents, the child may indiscriminately relate to adults in an affection-seek-\ning manner in an effort to ensure her emotional survival.\n\nNumerous other investigators have characterized this behavior of the child\nas ‘seductive’. Houever, our study indicates that this behavior is instead the\nchild’s often desperate atempt to meet her needs for care and atention .. .\nThe child’s behavior may often appear sexualized to an adult... As a result,\nit is more appropriate to describe this behavior as affection-seeking rather\nthan seductive” (Johnston, l979, pp. 948-949).\n\ne “‘Everybody knous’ that adults must protect themselves from ground-\nless accusations of seductive or vindictive young people. . .. What\neverybody does not knou, and would not want to knou, is that the vast\nmajority of investigated accusations prove valid and that most of the\nyoung people were less than eight years old at the time of initiation”\n(Summit, l983, p. l78).\n\nConclusion\n\nSince its introduction to the peer-reviewed professional literature in l984,\nthe term “grooming” has become so widely adopted that it will remain in\nwidespread use for decades to come. We can and should clarify the meaning\nof the term wherever possible to avoid misuse or misleading of our audi-\nences. We could benefit from prospective studies of the <span class=\"highlight\">frequency</span> of groom-\ning-like behaviors among adults in target-rich environments such as schools,\nyouth sports, and youth groups, which could help distinguish behaviors por-\ntending risk from those that do not, though it would require a large sample\nand a long time to reveal at least some of the offenders in the sample.\n\nThe two archaic uses of the term “seduction” in the context of child sexual\nabuse identified here are too recent and too widely knoun to justify completely\nabandoning the term “grooming” in favor of “seduction,” even if it were possible\nto do so. Perhaps the best strategy is that adopted by Lanning (2ol8) of explain-\ning the parallel between the courtship and mating rituals that adults use with one\nanother and the courtship and mating rituals that some use with children.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo682o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006855.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 2o of 45\n278 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE 2o(2)\n\nAdult studies typically had a mean age between 4o and 5o for the abuse, resulting in no disclosure.

She stated, for example, that the\n“majority” of her patients delayed disclosing their abuse. Nov. lo Tr. at 87, l5l. In its response\nbrief, the Defense states that Dr. Dietz “has personally seen ten of the eleven pathways to false\nallegations identified by” the article. Def. Br. at l2.

The Court finds that jurors do not require expert testimony that, for\nexample, lying, intoxication, or severe personality disorders that cause hallucinations can lead to\nfalse accusations.

To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's determination as to the <span class=\"highlight\">frequency</span> of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere\nwith Maxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.\nDefense counsel's May 7, 2o2l leter, Dkt. No. 272, describes generalized grievances\nbut makes no additional specific and supported application for relief. Nevertheless, the\nCourt urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be\nreduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continue to\nensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP determines\nare necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors,\nand consistent with the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees. The\nGovernment shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel for\nthe MDC. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance in Maxwell's eyes is\ndisrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to prepare for and withstand\ntrial. The Court sought more information by ordering the Government to confer with legal\ncounsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to certain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In\nresponse, the Government states that MDC staff conduct flashlight checks of all inmates\nas a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As reported by the Government, inmates housed with\ncell mates in the Special Housing Unit are checked with flashlights every 3o minutes.\nInmates housed with others in the general population are checked multiple times per night\nat regular intervals. The Government further reports that to conduct the checks,\nflashlights are pointed at the ceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present,\nbreathing, and not in distress. As the Government explains, there are a number of neutral\nreasons why BOP's flashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those\nof other inmates, including that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and\nthe potential stress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has\ndetermined that these factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The\nGovernment also indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable\npolicy, but that Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover\nher eyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's determination as to the <span class=\"highlight\">frequency</span> of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere with\nMaxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.

Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the <span class=\"highlight\">frequency</span> of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.” Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was... [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\n253 l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who . .. induces... any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of interstate .. .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate... commerce. . .
