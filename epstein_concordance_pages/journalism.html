Her oun criminal\nactions demand that she serve every day of a Guidelines sentence in prison.\n\nI. Background\n\nA. The Investigation\n\nThe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York opened its investigation\ninto Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators in late November 2ol8. The investigation was\nprompted by investigative <span class=\"highlight\">journalism</span>, and not, as the defendant claims, by civil litigants who\npressed for criminal charges. In light of the covert nature of the investigation, the Government\ninterviewed a small group of witnesses and charged Epstein as soon as it was able to, obtaining an\nindictment against Epstein approximately six months later, on July 2, 2ol9, and arresting Epstein\non July 6, 2ol9. (PSR ¥ 2l). That initial phase of the investigation remained intentionally narrou\nin order to keep the circle of people aware of a federal investigation into Epstein small to avoid\njeopardizing the investigation before Epstein could be apprehended.\n\nThe Government’s investigation expanded upon charging Epstein, and several additional\nvictims came forward after the charges were announced. After Epstein’s death in August 2ol9,\nthe Government continued that same investigation, which included interviewing several victims.\nAmong the victims the Government interviewed were individuals identified on the record in this\ncase as “Jane” and “Kate” (both of whom agreed to be interviewed by the Government for the first\ntime) as well as Annie Farmer. The Government obtained the original Indictment against the\ndefendant—which related to the abuse of Jane, Kate, and Annie Farmer—in late June 2o2o. In\nMarch 2o2l, the Government obtained a superseding indictment charging the defendant—which\nadded counts relating to the defendant’s abuse of an additional minor victim, Carolyn—based on\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo54o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015133.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Pagelof3l\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\n2o Cr. 33o (PAE)\n~ OPINION & ORDER\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL,\nDefendant.\nPAUL A.
