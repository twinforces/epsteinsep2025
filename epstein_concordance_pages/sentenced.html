The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and secking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court.

Similarly, where the judgment of conviction has already\nbeen entered on multiplicitous counts, that right is protected by vacating the convictions on all but\none count. /d.\n\nThe Second Circuit has clarified that District Courts should not rule on a motion to dismiss\na charge on multiplicity grounds until the time of sentencing.

The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus on a Potential Plea to\nFederal Charges\n\nDuring the remainder of September, Villafafia conducted plea negotiations and drafted the\nfinal NPA, mainly with Epstein atorney Jay Lefkouitz. In a September l3, 2oo7 email to CEOS\nChief Oosterban, Villafafia reported that the plea negotiations were “geting fast and furious.”\nShe said that the defense wanted to establish a “‘victim’s fund” through which Epstein could make\npayments to the victims, rather than having the victims file individual § 2255 court actions for\ndamages, which she speculated was “to keep this stuff out of the public [c]ourt files.”\n\nAccording to the email documentation, by Friday, September l4, 2oo7, the parties had\nmoved touard a “hybrid” federal plea agreement, incorporating a plea to state charges, which\nwould allou Epstein to serve his sentence for all the charges concurrently in a federal prison.\nVillafafia informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other colleagues that negotiations with Lefkouitz\nhad resulted in a tentative agreement for Epstein to plead to two federal charges: harassment to\nprevent a witness from reporting a crime (l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d)(2), which was then a one-year\nmisdemeanor), and simple assault on an airplane (l8 U.S.C. § ll3(a)(5), a six-month\nmisdemeanor). Villafafia reported that Lefkouitz “put in a pitch for only l2 months, I put in a\npitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 2o-month recommendation, and we decided that we would\nbe stuck with the l8 months.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information\nmirroring the agreement in principle she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had\n“not yet been blessed” by them. The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the\ntwo federal charges for which the parties would jointly recommend that he be <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> to the\nstatutory maximum penalty of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by 2 years of supervised release,\nand that he would also plead guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, for which Epstein and the State Atorney’s Office would make a joint,\nbinding recommendation that he be <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> to serve at least 2o months in prison folloued by lo\nmonths of community control (home confinement). Although not specified in the draft agreement,\nthe negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently. In addition\nto payment of restitution, Epstein would not oppose jurisdiction or victim status for any of the\nvictims identified in the federal investigation—at that point specified as numbering 4o—who\nelected to file suit for damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. A guardian ad litem would be appointed\nto communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf.\n\nLourie, houever, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal. In response\nto Villafafia’s email about the potential federal charges, but after Villafafia sent the proposal to\nLefkouitz, Lourie told her, “The assault [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of\nsilly.”'\"! Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the assault\ncharge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.” Acosta responded, “If we\nneed[,] let’s find a different charge.” On Saturday, September l5, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLefkouitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “goten some negative reaction\nul The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ . . . on [one of his female\nassistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR-oooo327o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003272.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 96 of 348\nevidence of a violation of the agreement. Epstein and his counsel\nagree that the computers that are currently under [legal process] will\nbe safeguarded in their current condition by Epstein’s counsel or\ntheir agents until the terms and conditions of the Agreement are\nfulfilled.\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a lengthy email to convey two options Lourie had\nsuggested: “the original proposal” for a state plea but with an agreement for an l8-month sentence,\nor pleas to state charges and two federal obstruction-of-justice charges. Villafafia also told\nLefkouitz she was willing to ask Acosta again to approve a federal plea to a five-year conspiracy\nwith a Rule ll(c) binding recommendation for a 2o-month sentence. Villafafia explained:\n\nAs to timing, it is my understanding that Mr. Epstein needs to be\n<span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> in the state after he is <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> in the federal case, but\nnot that he needs to plead guilty and be <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> after serving his\nfederal time. Andy recommended that some of the timing issues be\naddressed only in the state agreement, so that it isn’t obvious to the\njudge that we are trying to create federal jurisdiction for prison\npurposes.\n\nWith regard to prosecution of individuals other than Epstein, Villafafia suggested standard\nfederal plea agreement language regarding the resolution of all criminal liability, ‘and I will\nmention ‘co-conspirators,’ but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes\nand all of the other persons that we could charge.” Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to\ninclude a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-conspirators, who at the time she understood\nto be the four women named in the proposed agreement, because the USAO was not interested in\nprosecuting those individuals if Epstein entered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, “[W]e considered\nEpstein to be the top of the food chain, and we wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone\nelse.” She did not consider the possibility that Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed\nindividuals, and no one, including the FBI case agents, raised that concern. Villafafia also told\nOPR that her reference to “all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge”\nrelated to her concern that if the plea agreement contained information about uncharged conduct,\nthe court might ask for more information about that conduct and inquire why it had not been\ncharged, and if the government provided such information, Epstein’s atorneys might claim the\nagreement was breached.!\"\n\nWith regard to immigration, Villafafia told OPR that the USAO generally did not take any\nposition in plea agreements on immigration issues, and that in this case, there was no evidence that\neither of the two assistants who were foreign nationals had commited fraud in connection with\ntheir immigration paperwork, “and I think that they were both in status. So there wasn’t any reason\nM3 OPR understood Villafafia’s concern to be that if the government were required to respond to a court’s inquiry\ninto additional facts, Epstein would object that the government was trying to cast him in a negative light in order to\ninfluence the court to impose a sentence greater than the agreed-upon term.\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3272", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003284.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo8 of 348\n\nAt some point that day, Acosta spoke with Lefkouitz by phone regarding the need for\nEpstein to plead to a registrable offense. Throughout the weekend, with Villafafia’s Monday\ndeadline looming, defense counsel pressed hard to eliminate the sexual offender requirement. On\nSaturday, September 22, 2oo7, Sanchez sent a series of emails to Lourie. In the first, she provided\ndetails from a press report about a Florida public official who the previous day had pled guilty to\nchild sex abuse charges and was <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> to a term of probation. She noted that she “spoke to\n[M]at [Menchel]” and asked Lourie to call her. Two hours later she sent Lourie a second, lengthy\nemail, strongly objecting to the registration requirement, and outlining “all arguments against\nregistration [as a sexual offender] in this case.” In this email, Sanchez claimed that there had been\na “miscommunication” during the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and that “we only agreed to the\nsolicitation with minors because we believed and [Krischer] and [Belohlavek] confirmed it was\nNOT registrable.” Sanchez complained that lifetime sexual offender registration was a “life\nsentence” that was “uncalled for,” “does not make sense,” and was “inappropriate” to impose\n“simply [because] the FBI wants it, in return for all there [sic] efforts.” She listed numerous\nreasons why Epstein should not have to register, including his lack of a prior record or history of\nsexual offenses; the lack of any danger of recidivism; the ease with which he could be “tracked”\nwithout registering; and that it would be “virtually impossible to comply” with four separate state\nregistration requirements. A few minutes later, Sanchez sent Lefcourt’s phone number to Lourie\n“in case you want to speak to him directly.”\n\nIn another email sent less than two hours later, Sanchez told Lourie she was writing again\nbecause “you are a very fair person. This resolution in the Epstein case is not reasonable. [I]t is a\nresult of a misunderstanding at a meeting.” She stated that Epstein’s atorneys had “consistently\nemphasized their goal of l8 months in a federal camp” and “[e]veryone knew that a registerable\noffense precluded” a camp designation. Sanchez added, “Therefore it would have been wholly\ninconsistent with that primary goal of [Epstein’s] safety to lightly concede to registration at that\nmeeting.” Sanchez concluded, “[I]mposing a life sentence on him is not something anyone will\neventually be proud of. Please reconsider and help me get a fair result.”\n\nLourie responded to none of the Sanchez emails, but he did reach out to Acosta for a phone\nconversation. By email late that night, at lo:26 p.m., Lefkouitz asked Lourie to phone him.\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta—with copies to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia—\nto “follou up on our conversation Friday,” asking Acosta again to reconsider the requirement that\nEpstein plead to a registrable offense. Lefkouitz wrote that there had been a “misunderstanding”\nat the September l2, 2oo7 meeting:\n\nBefore the meeting, Mr. Krischer and Ms. Belohlavek, a sex\n\nprosecutor for l3 years, told us that solicitation of a minor . . . is not\n\naregisterable offense. Houever, as it turned out, [it] is a registerable\n\noffense and our discussion at the meeting was based on a mistaken\n\nassumption. We suggest that Mr. Epstein enter two pleas—one to\n\nthe Indictment and a second to a non-registerable charge.\nhas offered to buy me a cup of coffee. I have had coffee with no one.” Krischer told OPR that the “reasons” to which\nhe referred related to the pressure he had been geting from Chief Reiter about the Epstein case.\n\n82\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3284", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003285.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo9 of 348\nLefkouitz set forth arguments similar to those Sanchez had presented to Lourie, as to why\nregistration “based on the facts alleged in this case . . . simply does not make sense.” In the event\nthat Acosta did not agree to their proposed charges, Lefkouitz offered as an alternative “to stipulate\nthat the state offense” would “constitute a prior sexual offense for purposes of enhanced recidivist\nsentencing” should Epstein ever again commit a federal sex offense against minors. As Lefkouitz\nfurther argued, “By accepting this option, you would be substituting the certainty of recidivist\nsentencing for the humiliation of registration.” Emails reflect that, early that afternoon, Acosta,\nLourie, and Villafafia discussed the mater in a conference call.\n\nLefkouitz also sent a revised version of the NPA to Villafafia that omited identification of\nthe charge to which Epstein would plead guilty. Later that day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta:\n\nI got a call from [M]arie who said you had rejected our proposal.\n\nDoes that mean you are not even prepared to have [Epstein] commit\n\nnou to plead to the registerable offense near the end of his l8 month\n\nsentence and then be <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> to l2 month[s] community control\n\nfor that charge? I thought that was exactly what you proposed\n\n[F]riday (although you wanted, but were not able, to do it with some\n\nkind of federal charge).\n\nBut that still gives you a registerable sex offense, 3o months total,\n\nand l8 in jail.\n\nHou can that not satisfy you—while still ensuring that [E]pstein is\n\nnot unduly endangered in jail?\nAcosta responded, “I do not mean to be difficult, but our negotiations must take place with the\nAUSAs assigned to the case.” Acosta added that he had spoken with Lourie and Villafafia, and\nthey had “discretion to proceed as they believe just and appropriate.” Acosta copied Villafafia,\nand she emailed Acosta to thank him “‘for the support.”\n\nL. The Defense Adds a Confidentiality Clause\n\nThroughout that Sunday evening, Lefkouitz had numerous email exchanges with\nVillafafia, and apparently a conference call with Lourie (who was returning to Washington, D.C.)\nand Villafafia. Later that evening, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a new version of the NPA that, for the\nfirst time, included a confidentiality term:\n\nIt is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that it not be\ndisseminated or disclosed except pursuant to court order. In the\nevent the Government must disclose this Agreement in response to\na request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the\nGovernment agrees to provide Epstein notice before the disclosure\nof this Agreement.\n\nAfter making additional revisions, Villafafia sent this NPA to Acosta and Lourie as the\n“final” version, asking Acosta to let her knou what he thought of it. Among her revisions, she\nchanged the confidentiality provision to the follouing:\n\n83\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3285", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003286.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page llo of 348\nThe parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part of\nany public record.

SEPTEMBER 24, 2oo7: ACOSTA MAKES FINAL EDITS, AND THE NPA IS\n\nSIGNED\n\nThe contemporaneous emails shou that Villafafia continued to update Acosta as the parties\nnegotiated the final language and that Acosta reviewed and edited the NPA. Shortly after midnight\non Monday, September 24, 2oo7, Acosta sent Villafafia “[s]mall edits” to the “final” NPA she had\nsent to him. Among his changes was language modifying provisions that appeared to require the\nState Atorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein\nenter his guilty plea by a certain date. Acosta explained in his email, “I’m not comfortable with\nrequiring the State Atorney to enter into a [joint sentencing] recommendation” or “requiring a\nState court to stick with our timeline” for entry of the guilty plea and sentencing. Accordingly,\nAcosta substituted language that required Epstein alone to make a binding sentencing\nrecommendation to the state court, and required Epstein to use his “best efforts” to enter his guilty\nplea and be <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> by the specified dates. Acosta also instructed Villafafia to restore a reference\nto Epstein’s wish “to reach a global resolution of his state and federal criminal liabilities.” Lourie,\nwho had returned to the Department in Washington, D.C., had a phone conversation with\nLefkouitz and sent additional comments on the final draft to Acosta and Villafafia. Villafafia sent\na new revision, incorporating edits from Acosta and Lourie, to Lefkouitz later that morning.\n\nOn the afternoon of September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia circulated the new “final” version of\nthe NPA to Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other supervisors, and asked Lefkouitz to send her the\nsigned agreement. After Lefkouitz electronically transmited to Villafafia a copy of the NPA\nsigned by Epstein, she emailed her immediate supervisor and her co-counsel: “They have scanned\nand emailed the signed agreement. It is done.”\n\nIn his transmital email, Lefkouitz asked Villafafia to “[p]lease do whatever you can to\nkeep this from becoming public.” Villafafia responded:\n\nI have forwarded your message only to Alex, Andy, and [the West\n\nPalm Beach manager]. I don’t anticipate it going any further than\n\nthat. When I receive the originals, I will sign and return one copy\n\nto you. The other will be placed in the case file, which will be kept\n\nconfidential since it also contains identifying information about the\n\ngirls.\n\nWhen we reach an agreement about the atorney representative for\n\nthe girls, we can discuss what I can tell him and the girls about the\nl28 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Lourie observed that because the NPA contained names of uncharged\nco-conspirators and other protected information, the USAO would have a duty to redact the information before\ndisclosing the NPA.\n\n84\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3286", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003288.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll2 of 348\nit had identified as victims.'°!

The USAO had no objection to Epstein self-reporting\nto begin serving his sentence by January 4, 2oo8.\n\nImmunity: The USAO would not initiate criminal charges against “any potential\nco-conspirator of Epstein,” including four named personal assistants.\n\nOther: Epstein was obligated to undertake discussions with the State Atorney’s\nOffice to ensure compliance with this agreement.\n\nEpstein waived his right to appeal.\n\nEpstein agreed that he would not be afforded any benefits with respect to\ngain time or other rights, opportunities, and benefits not available to any\nother inmate.\n\nThe federal investigation would be suspended and all pending legal process\nheld in abeyance unless and until Epstein violated any term of the\nagreement. Evidence “requested by or directly related to” the pending legal\nprocess, “including certain computer equipment,” would be kept inviolate\nuntil all the NPA terms had been satisfied.\n\nBreach: The USAO would be required to notify Epstein of any alleged breach of the\nagreement within 9o days of the expiration of the term of home\nconfinement, and would be required to initiate prosecution within 6o days\nthereafter.\n\nDisclosure: The parties “anticipate[d]” that the agreement would not be made part of\nany public record, and if the USAO received a Freedom of Information Act\nrequest or compulsory process commanding disclosure of the agreement, it\nwould provide notice to Epstein before making any disclosure. !*\n\nThat evening, Lefkouitz emailed Lourie to express concern about the notification he\nunderstood would be given to Chief Reiter, stating, “I am very concerned about leaks unduly\nprejudicing Jeffrey [Epstein] in the media.”!°? He added, “I have enjoyed working with you on\nHe The USAO had not informed the defense of the victims’ identities at this point. The parties anticipated that\nthe USAO would send Epstein’s atorneys a list of victims when Epstein fulfilled his obligation under the NPA to\nenter his state guilty pleas.\n\nl32 The final NPA is atached as Exhibit 3 to this Report.\nl33 On October 3, 2oo7, the Miami FBI media officer notified the USAO that the New York Post had reported\nthat federal authorities were not going to pursue federal charges against Epstein. According to the Post, Epstein would\nplead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes, “in a deal that will send him to prison for about l8 months,” folloued\nby “a shorter period of house confinement,” and, according to “sources,” federal authorities had “agreed to drop their\n86\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3288", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003303.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l27 of 348\nscheduled January 4, 2oo8 plea hearing. As soon became apparent, Acosta was unable to achieve\nan expedited review so that Epstein could plead guilty and be <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> by\nJanuary 4, 2oo8, and the plea and sentencing date was rescheduled. On January 2, 2oo8, Sloman\nspoke with Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek, who confirmed that the change of plea hearing\nhad been postponed. In an email reporting this to Acosta and Villafafia, Sloman said that Epstein’s\nlocal defense atorney Goldberger had told Belohlavek the postponement was because the facts\n“did not fit the proposed state charge,” and that Belohlavek told Sloman she agreed with that\nassessment.’ The next day, Villafafia sent to Acosta and Sloman a local newspaper article\nreporting that Epstein’s state plea hearing was reset for March and in exchange for it the federal\nauthorities would drop their investigation of him. Acosta also sent to Sloman and Villafafia an\nemail memorializing a statement made to him by Lefkouitz in a phone call that day: “‘I\n[Lefkouitz] may have made a mistake 6 months ago. [Belohlavek] told us solicitation [is] not\nregistrable. It turns out that the actual offense charged is.’”!®°\n\n5. January 7, 2oo8: Acosta and Sloman Meet with Sanchez, Who Makes\nAdditional Allegations of USAO Misconduct\n\nOn January 7, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman met with defense atorney Sanchez at her request.\nAccording to meeting notes made by Sloman, among other things, Sanchez alleged that the\nUSAO’s media spokesperson had improperly disclosed details of the Epstein case to a national\nnews reporter, and Sanchez “suggested that the USAO could avoid any potential ugliness in DC\nby agreeing to a watered-doun resolution for Epstein.” After Acosta excused himself to atend\nanother meeting and Sloman refused to speak further with Sanchez “without a witness present,”\nshe left. Later that day, Acosta and Sloman spoke by phone with Starr, Lefkouitz, and Sanchez,\nwho expressed concern about the “leak” to the news media, reiterated their objections to the NPA,\nand pressed for the “‘watered-doun resolution,” which they specified would mean allouing Epstein\nto plead to a charge of coercion instead of procurement, avoid serving time in jail, and not register\nas a sexual offender. A note in the margin of Sloman’s handwriten notes of the conversation\nreads: “We’re back to where we started in September.”\n\nThat evening, Villafafia expressed concern that the delay in resolving the mater was\naffecting the USAO’s ability to go forward with a prosecution should Epstein renege on his\nagreement, and she outlined for Acosta and Sloman the steps she proposed to take while Epstein\nwas pursuing Departmental review. Those steps included re-establishing contact with victims,\ninterviewing victims in New York and one victim who lived in a foreign country, making contact\nwith “potential sources of information” in the Virgin Islands, and re-initiating proceedings to\nobtain Epstein’s computers.\n\nIn the meantime, USAO Criminal Division Chief Robert Senior performed a “soup to nuts”\nreview of the Epstein investigation, reviewing the indictment package and all of the evidence\nVillafafia had compiled. He told OPR that he could not recall the reason for his review, but opined\nl5? Belohlavek told OPR that she did not recall this incident, but she noted that the PBPD report did set forth\nfacts supporting the charge of procurement of a minor.\n\nl6o Although the meeting Lefkouitz had with Lourie, Villafafia, Krischer, and Belohlavek to discuss the state\nresolution was only four months prior, not six, Lefkouitz’s reference was likely to the September l2, 2oo7 meeting.\nlol\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003312.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l36 of 348\n\nOn Monday, June 23, 2oo8, Roth sent a brief leter to Starr and Lefkouitz informing them\nthat the office had “completed a thorough review” of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater\nand did not believe intervention by the Deputy Atorney General was warranted in view of the\n“considerable discretion” vested by the Department in U.S. Atorneys. He added, “Even if we\nwere to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Atorney, we believe that federal prosecution\nof this case is appropriate.”\n\nImmediately after receiving a copy of Roth’s leter, Villafafia notified defense counsel that\nEpstein would have until close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the NPA\nby entering his guilty plea, being <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span>, and surrendering to begin serving his sentence. On\nJune 26, 2oo8, Roth alerted the Office of the Atorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to\ncontact the Atorney General to request additional review and urged the Atorney General not to\ntake defense counsel’s calls. Roth told OPR that he was concerned that Epstein’s team would try\nto take a further appeal in order to delay resolution of the case.\n\nMeanwhile, Starr sent a concluding email to Acosta, acknouledging they had reached “the\nend of a long and arduous road” and adding, “While Iam obviously very unhappy at what I believe\nis the government’s treatment of my client, aman whom I have come to deeply admire, I recognize\nthat we have filed and argued our ‘appellate motions’ and lost. ... I would like to have .. . some\nclosure with you on this mater so that in the years to come, neither of us will harbor any ill will\nover the mater.”\n\nX. JUNE 2oo8 — JUNE 2oo9: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS PLEAS AND SERVES HIS\n\nCUSTODIAL SENTENCE\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia renewed her requests to Epstein’s local atorneys\nGoldberger and Black for a copy of the state plea agreement reached with the State Atorney’s\nOffice, noting that their failure to provide it was a material breach of the NPA. After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\nCommunity Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\ncommunity control] in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\ncommunity control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.”!”\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\n\nV2 The Main Detention Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates.

Villafafia, houever, did not\nask that the agreement be amended to clarify that the reference to “the Palm Beach County\nDetention Facility” meant the jail, rather than the Stockade. The final signed plea agreement form\nfurther clarified the sentence, providing that after serving l2 months in the Palm Beach County\nDetention Facility, Epstein would be “<span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> to 6 months in the Palm Beach County Detention\nFacility . . . to be served consecutive to the l2 month sentence,” folloued by “l2 months\nCommunity Control.” The word “imprisoned” was hand writen after “6 months” but then crossed\nout and replaced by “jail sentence.”!”\n\nA. June 3o, 2oo8: Epstein Enters His Guilty Pleas in State Court\n\nEpstein, with his atorney Jack Goldberger, appeared in Palm Beach County court on\nJune 3o, 2oo8, and entered guilty pleas to the indictment charging him with one felony count of\nsolicitation of prostitution and to a criminal information charging him with one felony count of\nprocurement of a minor to engage in prostitution.'’4 At the plea hearing, which Villafafia and the\nFBI case agent atended as spectators, Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek did not proffer the facts\nof the case; instead she only recited the charging language in the indictment and the criminal\ninformation:\n\n[B]etween August l, 2oo4 and October 3l, 2oo5, the defendant in\n\nPalm Beach County did solicit or procure someone to commit\n\n[prostitution] on three or more occasions. And .. . between\n\nAugust l, 2oo4 and October 9, 2oo5, the defendant did procure a\n\nminor under the age of l8 to commit prostitution in Palm Beach\n\nCounty also.!”\n\nThe court found this to be “a sufficient factual basis to support the pleas,” and engaged in\na colloquy with Belohlavek regarding Epstein’s victims:\n\nThe Court: Are there more than one victim?\n\nMs. Belohlavek: There’s several.\nhtp://www.pbso.org/inside-pbso/corrections/general/.

On November l6, 2oo7, the case agents met with Belohlavek and asked if\nthe State Atorney’s Office would oppose a request that Epstein be granted work release.\nBelohlavek was noncommital, and when the agents asked that she include language in the state’s\nplea agreement prohibiting Epstein from participating in work release, she responded that she\nwould have to discuss the issue with the State Atorney.'®° Krischer later told OPR that work\nrelease was “within the control of the Sheriffs Office, not my office.” The state’s plea agreement\nwith Epstein did not address the issue of work release.\n\nThe day after Epstein entered his June 3o, 2oo8 plea, Villafafia and her immediate\nsupervisor met with a Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office official to discuss work release. According to\nVillafafia, the official told them, “Epstein would be eligible for work release and will be placed on\nwork release,” a statement that contradicted the information the case agents had been given by a\njail supervisor the previous November, as well as statements made by defense atorney Jack\nGoldberger to Villafafia just days before the plea was entered, when he “specifically told\n[Villafafia] that [Epstein] would nor get work release.” Villafafia alerted the Sheriff's Office\nofficial that although Epstein told the court during his plea proceeding that he had worked “every\nday” for a “couple of years” at the “Florida Science Foundation,” that entity did not even exist\nuntil November 2oo7.'®! Moreover, the address Epstein provided to the court for the “Florida\nScience Foundation” was the office of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia and her\nsupervisor asked that the Sheriffs Office notify the USAO if Epstein applied for work release.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he was aware Villafafia was trying to ensure that Epstein did not get\nwork release, and he would not have contradicted her efforts. Acosta explained that the USAO\nexpected Epstein would be “treated just like everyone else,” but that, as shoun by “our subsequent\ncommunications with the [S]tate [A]torney’s [O]ffice,” having Epstein on work release “was not\nwhat our office envisioned.”\n\nIn August 2oo8, Villafafia spoke with defense atorney Black about ensuring Epstein’s\ncompliance with the NPA, and raised the issue of work release. Villafafia later reported to Acosta\nand Sloman that Black assured her he had “reminded the team that . . . l8 months IN JAIL is a\nmaterial term of the agreement.”\n\nThe USAO never received notice of Epstein’s work release application. On October lo,\n2oo8, less than three-and-a-half months after Epstein entered his guilty plea, the Palm Beach\nSheriff's Office placed him into the work release program, permiting him to leave the Stockade\nl7? According to Sloman, Krischer explained that even without registration Epstein would be “treated” as a “sex\noffender” and that “just like any other sex offender, he can petition the court for work release.”\nl8D In the November l6, 2oo7 email, on which she copied Acosta, Villafafia also indicated that she was\n“reviewing all of the statutes” to determine whether there was any impediment to a state judge granting Epstein work\nrelease. In a subsequent email, the FBI case agents informed Villafafia that they had also spoken with a “jail\nsupervisor,” who advised them that although Epstein, as a sexual offender, would not qualify for work release, the\njudge could nevertheless order him placed on work release if he was <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> to a year or less of incarceration.\n\nl8l During the plea hearing, Epstein told the court he was “President” of the Florida Science Foundation, it had\nbeen in existence for l5 years, and he worked there “every day.” Plea Hearing Transcript at 27-29.\nll4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33l6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003329.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l53 of 348\nflexibility to decline to bring a particular charge based on a “good faith doubt” that the law or\nevidence supports the charge.\n\nZi Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens\n\nOn April 28, l995, the Atorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors\nentitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly\nbecome involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States. In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated administrative deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\n\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\nextraordinary circumstances exist. Accordingly, absent such\ncircumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a\ntee, l98\ncrime.\n\nStipulated administrative deportation orders can be based “on the conviction for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)(), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\n\nC. Case Law\n\nl. Prosecutorial Discretion\n\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\ndiscretion in deciding whether and whom to prosecute. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP Enforcement Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\n\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3329", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003330.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l54 of 348\nthe prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\n<span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. Jd. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\nDe Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts. First, defendants have challenged the voluntariness of the resulting plea\nl28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo333o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003384.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o8 of 348\n\nD. Acosta’s Decisions Led to Difficulties Enforcing the NPA\n\nAfter the agreement was reached, the collateral atacks and continued appeals raised the\nspecter that the defense had negotiated in bad faith. At various points, individual members of the\nUSAO team became frustrated by defense tactics, and in some instances, consideration was given\nto whether the USAO should declare a unilateral breach. Indeed, on November 24, 2oo8, the\nUSAO gave notice that it deemed Epstein’s participation in work release to be a breach of the\nagreement but ultimately took no further action. Acosta told OPR: “I was personally very\nfrustrated with the failure to report on October 2o, and had I envisioned that entire collateral atack,\nI think I would have looked at this very differently.”\n\nOnce the NPA was signed, Acosta could have ignored Epstein’s requests for further review\nby the Department and, if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under the NPA to enter his state\nguilty plea, declared Epstein to be in breach and proceeded to charge him federally. When\nquestioned about this issue, Acosta explained that he believed the Department had the “right” to\naddress Epstein’s concerns. He told OPR that because the USAO is part of the Department of\nJustice, if a defendant asks for Departmental review, it would be “unseemly” to object. During his\nOPR interview, Sloman described Acosta as very process-oriented, which he atributed to Acosta’s\nprior Department experience. Sloman, houever, believed the USAO gave Epstein “[t]oo much\nprocess,” a result of the USAO’s desire to “do the right thing” and to the defense team’s ability to\nkeep pressing for more process without triggering a breach of the NPA. Furthermore, Epstein’s\ndefense counsel repeatedly and carefully made clear they were not repudiating the agreement.\nAcosta told OPR that the USAO would have had to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA in order\nto proceed to file federal charges, and Epstein would undoubtedly have litigated whether his effort\nto obtain Departmental review constituted a breach. Acosta recalled that he was concerned, as was\nSloman, that a unilateral decision to rescind the non-prosecution agreement would result in\ncollateral litigation that would further delay maters and make what was likely a difficult trial even\nharder.\n\nAcosta’s and Sloman’s concerns about declaring a breach were not unreasonable. A court\nwould have been unlikely to have determined that defense counsel’s appeal of the NPA to the\nDepartment and unwillingness to set a state plea date while that appeal was ongoing was sufficient\nto negate the agreement. Houever, some of the difficulty the USAO faced in declaring a breach\nwas caused by decisions Acosta made before and shortly after the NPA was signed. For example,\nand significantly, it was Acosta who changed the language, “Epstein shall enter his guilty plea and\nbe <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> not later than October 26, 2oo7” to “Epstein shall use [his] best efforts to enter his\nguilty plea and be <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> not later than October 26, 2oo7.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta also\nagreed not to enforce the NPA’s October 26, 2oo7 deadline for entry of Epstein’s plea, and he told\ndefense counsel that he had no objection if they decided to pursue an appeal to the Department.\nFollouing these decisions, the USAO would have had significant difficulty trying to prove that\nEpstein was not using his “best efforts” to comply with the NPA and was intentionally failing to\ncomply, as opposed to pursuing a course to which the U.S. Atorney had at least implicitly agreed.\n\nE. Acosta Did Not Exercise Sufficient Supervisory Review over the Process\n\nThe question at the center of much of the public controversy concerning the USAO’s\nhandling of its criminal investigation of Epstein is why the USAO agreed to resolve a case in which\n\nl82\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3384", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003417.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 24l of 348\nin Courtroom llF at the Palm Beach County Courthouse, 2o5 North\nDixie Highway, West Palm Beach, Florida.

Marie and... the agents . . . were keeping the victims apprised at some\nlevel.”\n\nOn December 7, 2oo7, Villafafia prepared leters containing the above information to be\nsent to multiple victims and emailed Acosta and Sloman, requesting permission to send them.*!®\nSloman, houever, had that day received a leter from Sanchez, advising that Epstein’s plea hearing\nwas scheduled for January 4, 2oo8, and requesting that the USAO “hold off” sending the victim\nnotification leters until “we can further discuss the contents.” Also that day, Starr and Lefkouitz\nsubmited to Acosta the two lengthy “independent ethics opinions” supporting the defense\narguments against the federal investigation and the NPA’s use of l8 U.S.C. § 2255. Sloman\nresponded to Villafafia’s request with an email instructing her to “Hold the leter.”?!’ Sloman told\nOPR that he “wanted to push the [victim notification] leter out,” but his instruction to Villafafia\nwas “the product of me speaking to somebody,” although he could not be definitive as to whom.\nSloman further told OPR that once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO\n“had concerns that if we g[a]ve them the victim notification leter . . . and the deal fell apart, then\nthe victims would be instantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary\ncompensation.”\n\nOn December lo, 2oo7, Villafafia contacted the atorney who at the time represented the\nvictim who later became CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe #2” to inform him that she “was preparing\nvictim notification leters.” In her 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia noted\nthat she reached out to Jane Doe #2’s counsel, despite the fact that the USAO no longer considered\n2l8 The FBI case agent had emailed Villafafia the day before stating, “The leter that is currently being revised\nneeds to take into account that several victims have never been notified by your office or mine.” The case agent also\nstated, “I do not feel that [the defense] should have anything to do with the drafting or issuing of this leter.

The leter took an expansive\nview of the applicable statutes by contending that both the CVRA and the VRRA required the\nUSAO to notify the victims of the state proceedings:\n\n[T]hese sections are not limited to proceedings in a federal district\ncourt. Our Non-Prosecution Agreement resolves the federal\ninvestigation by allouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense.\nThe victims identified through the federal investigation should be\nappropriately informed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does\nnot require the U.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal\nobligations.*!®\n\nThe leter also asserted that the VRRA obligated the USAO to provide the victims with\ninformation concerning restitution to which they may be entitled and “the earliest possible” notice\nof the status of the investigation, the filing of charges, and the acceptance of a plea. Along with\nthe leter, Sloman forwarded a revised draft victim notification leter to Lefkouitz for his\ncomments. This draft victim notification leter stated that the federal investigation had been\ncompleted, Epstein would plead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of\nimprisonment at sentencing, and Epstein would compensate victims for monetary damages claims\nbrought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The draft victim notification leter provided specific information\nconcerning the upcoming change of plea hearing and invited the victims to atend or provide a\nwriten statement to the State Atorney’s Office. When Lefkouitz asked Sloman to delay sending\nvictim notifications until after a discussion of their contents, Sloman instructed Villafafia, who was\npreparing leters for transmital to 3o victims, to “Hold the leter.’ During his OPR interview,\nSloman recalled that he had “wanted to push the leter out,” but he “must have had a conversation\nwith somebody” about whether the CVRA applied, and based on that conversation he directed\nVillafafia to hold the leter.\n\nIn his response leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz contended that the government had\nmisinterpreted both the CVRA and VRRA because neither applied to the “public proceeding in\nthis mater [which] will be in state court for the purpose of the entry of a plea on state charges.”\nAl6 Sloman told Lefkouitz the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is simply informing the\nvictims of their rights.” Sloman also addressed the defense atorneys’ objection to advising the victims that they could\ncontact Villafafia or the FBI case agent with questions or concerns by referencing the CVRA, noting, “Again, federal\nlaw requires that victims have the ‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.”\n\n266\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3468", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003473.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 297 of 348\ninvestigation. Because the state indictment and information appeared to pertain to far fewer than\nthe total victims identified in either the state or the federal investigation, and no one at the USAO\nwas certain which victims were covered by the state charges, it should have been apparent to\nAcosta that without advance planning between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office, there\nwas a substantial risk that most of the victims identified in the federal investigation would not\nreceive notice of the hearing.*” Notification to the broadest possible number of identified victims\ncould only have been successful if there was appropriate communication between the USAO and\nthe state prosecutors, communication that had previously been lacking regarding other significant\nissues relating to Epstein. Villafafia and Sloman’s hastily arranged effort to enlist in the\nnotification process PBPD Chief Reiter, who likely played litle role in complying with the state’s\nvictim notification obligations in a typical case, was not an adequate substitute for careful planning\nand coordination with the State Atorney’s Office.*”°\n\nEven if the State Atorney’s Office had notified all of the identified victims of the upcoming\nplea hearing, there was no guarantee that such notification would have included information that\nthe state plea was resolving not just the state’s investigation of Epstein, but the federal investigation\nas well. The State Atorney was not obligated by state statutes to inform the victims of the status\nof the federal investigation, and there was litle reason to assume Krischer, or one of his staff,\nwould voluntarily do so, thereby puting the State Atorney’s Office in the position of fielding\nvictim questions and concerns about the outcome. Furthermore, as both the USAO and the defense\nhad differing views as to who could lawfully participate in the state plea hearing, there is no\nindication that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia took steps to confirm that, if victims appeared, they\ncould actually participate in the state court proceeding when they were not victims of the charged\ncrimes. *7/\n\nThrough counsel, Acosta asserted to OPR that because Villafafia and Sloman both told\nOPR that they believed that state officials would notify the victims, “OPR identified no reason\nwhy Secretary Acosta should have distrusted his team on these points.” Acosta’s counsel further\n425 Krischer told OPR that the state’s notification obligation extended to all victims identified in the state\ninvestigation. Nonetheless, which victims were encompassed in the state’s investigation was unclear. The PBPD’s\nprobable cause affidavit included crimes against only 5 victims, not the l9 identified in the state\ninvestigation. According to state records made public, the state subpoenaed to the grand jury only 3 victims. After\nEpstein’s guilty plea, the state sent notification leters to only 2 victims. Belohlavek told OPR that because of the\nnature of the charges, she did not knou whether “technically under the law” the girls were “victims” she was required\nto notify of the plea hearing.\n\nW6 The State Atorney’s Office had its oun procedures and employees who handled victim notification, and\nBelohlavek told OPR that the Chief of the Police Department would not regularly play a role in the state victim\nnotification process.\n\n427 Although Villafafia’s notes indicate that she researched Florida Statutes §§ 96o.ool and 92l.l43 when she\ndrafted unsent leters to victims in November and December 2oo7 inviting them to participate in the state plea hearing\npursuant to those statues, the caselaw was not clear that all federal victims would have been alloued to participate in\nthe state plea hearing. In Lefkouitz’s November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, he argued that the statutes afforded a right\nto speak at a defendant’s sentencing or to submit a statement only to the victims of the crime for which the defendant\nwas being <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span>.

The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and secking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court. After the initial filings and\nhearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil\ncases against Epstein.\n\n2 Emergency Victim’s Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim’s [sic] Rights Act, l8 U.S.C.

The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus on a Potential Plea to\nFederal Charges\n\nDuring the remainder of September, Villafafia conducted plea negotiations and drafted the\nfinal NPA, mainly with Epstein atorney Jay Lefkouitz. In a September l3, 2oo7 email to CEOS\nChief Oosterban, Villafafia reported that the plea negotiations were “geting fast and furious.”\nShe said that the defense wanted to establish a “‘victim’s fund” through which Epstein could make\npayments to the victims, rather than having the victims file individual § 2255 court actions for\ndamages, which she speculated was “to keep this stuff out of the public [c]ourt files.”\n\nAccording to the email documentation, by Friday, September l4, 2oo7, the parties had\nmoved touard a “hybrid” federal plea agreement, incorporating a plea to state charges, which\nwould allou Epstein to serve his sentence for all the charges concurrently in a federal prison.\nVillafafia informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other colleagues that negotiations with Lefkouitz\nhad resulted in a tentative agreement for Epstein to plead to two federal charges: harassment to\nprevent a witness from reporting a crime (l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d)(2), which was then a one-year\nmisdemeanor), and simple assault on an airplane (l8 U.S.C. § ll3(a)(5), a six-month\nmisdemeanor). Villafafia reported that Lefkouitz “put in a pitch for only l2 months, I put in a\npitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 2o-month recommendation, and we decided that we would\nbe stuck with the l8 months.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information\nmirroring the agreement in principle she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had\n“not yet been blessed” by them. The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the\ntwo federal charges for which the parties would jointly recommend that he be <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> to the\nstatutory maximum penalty of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by 2 years of supervised release,\nand that he would also plead guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, for which Epstein and the State Atorney’s Office would make a joint,\nbinding recommendation that he be <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> to serve at least 2o months in prison folloued by lo\nmonths of community control (home confinement). Although not specified in the draft agreement,\nthe negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently. In addition\nto payment of restitution, Epstein would not oppose jurisdiction or victim status for any of the\nvictims identified in the federal investigation—at that point specified as numbering 4o—who\nelected to file suit for damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. A guardian ad litem would be appointed\nto communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf.\n\nLourie, houever, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal. In response\nto Villafafia’s email about the potential federal charges, but after Villafafia sent the proposal to\nLefkouitz, Lourie told her, “The assault [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of\nsilly.”!!! Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the assault\ncharge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.” Acosta responded, “If we\nneed[,] let’s find a different charge.” On Saturday, September l5, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLefkouitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “goten some negative reaction\nul The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ . . . on [one of his female\nassistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4392", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004394.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 97 of 349\nevidence of a violation of the agreement. Epstein and his counsel\nagree that the computers that are currently under [legal process] will\nbe safeguarded in their current condition by Epstein’s counsel or\ntheir agents until the terms and conditions of the Agreement are\nfulfilled.\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a lengthy email to convey two options Lourie had\nsuggested: “the original proposal” for a state plea but with an agreement for an l8-month sentence,\nor pleas to state charges and two federal obstruction-of-justice charges. Villafafia also told\nLefkouitz she was willing to ask Acosta again to approve a federal plea to a five-year conspiracy\nwith a Rule ll(c) binding recommendation for a 2o-month sentence. Villafafia explained:\n\nAs to timing, it is my understanding that Mr. Epstein needs to be\n<span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> in the state after he is <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> in the federal case, but\nnot that he needs to plead guilty and be <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> after serving his\nfederal time. Andy recommended that some of the timing issues be\naddressed only in the state agreement, so that it isn’t obvious to the\njudge that we are trying to create federal jurisdiction for prison\npurposes.\n\nWith regard to prosecution of individuals other than Epstein, Villafafia suggested standard\nfederal plea agreement language regarding the resolution of all criminal liability, ‘and I will\nmention ‘co-conspirators,’ but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes\nand all of the other persons that we could charge.” Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to\ninclude a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-conspirators, who at the time she understood\nto be the four women named in the proposed agreement, because the USAO was not interested in\nprosecuting those individuals if Epstein entered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, “[W]e considered\nEpstein to be the top of the food chain, and we wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone\nelse.” She did not consider the possibility that Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed\nindividuals, and no one, including the FBI case agents, raised that concern. Villafafia also told\nOPR that her reference to “all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge”\nrelated to her concern that if the plea agreement contained information about uncharged conduct,\nthe court might ask for more information about that conduct and inquire why it had not been\ncharged, and if the government provided such information, Epstein’s atorneys might claim the\nagreement was breached.!'?\n\nWith regard to immigration, Villafafia told OPR that the USAO generally did not take any\nposition in plea agreements on immigration issues, and that in this case, there was no evidence that\neither of the two assistants who were foreign nationals had commited fraud in connection with\ntheir immigration paperwork, “and I think that they were both in status. So there wasn’t any reason\nM3 OPR understood Villafafia’s concern to be that if the government were required to respond to a court’s inquiry\ninto additional facts, Epstein would object that the government was trying to cast him in a negative light in order to\ninfluence the court to impose a sentence greater than the agreed-upon term.\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4394", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004406.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page lo9 of 349\n\nAt some point that day, Acosta spoke with Lefkouitz by phone regarding the need for\nEpstein to plead to a registrable offense. Throughout the weekend, with Villafafia’s Monday\ndeadline looming, defense counsel pressed hard to eliminate the sexual offender requirement. On\nSaturday, September 22, 2oo7, Sanchez sent a series of emails to Lourie. In the first, she provided\ndetails from a press report about a Florida public official who the previous day had pled guilty to\nchild sex abuse charges and was <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> to a term of probation. She noted that she “spoke to\n[M]at [Menchel]” and asked Lourie to call her. Two hours later she sent Lourie a second, lengthy\nemail, strongly objecting to the registration requirement, and outlining “all arguments against\nregistration [as a sexual offender] in this case.” In this email, Sanchez claimed that there had been\na “miscommunication” during the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and that “we only agreed to the\nsolicitation with minors because we believed and [Krischer] and [Belohlavek] confirmed it was\nNOT registrable.” Sanchez complained that lifetime sexual offender registration was a “life\nsentence” that was “uncalled for,” “does not make sense,” and was “inappropriate” to impose\n“simply [because] the FBI wants it, in return for all there [sic] efforts.” She listed numerous\nreasons why Epstein should not have to register, including his lack of a prior record or history of\nsexual offenses; the lack of any danger of recidivism; the ease with which he could be “tracked”\nwithout registering; and that it would be “virtually impossible to comply” with four separate state\nregistration requirements. A few minutes later, Sanchez sent Lefcourt’s phone number to Lourie\n“in case you want to speak to him directly.”\n\nIn another email sent less than two hours later, Sanchez told Lourie she was writing again\nbecause “you are a very fair person. This resolution in the Epstein case is not reasonable. [I]t isa\nresult of a misunderstanding at a meeting.” She stated that Epstein’s atorneys had “consistently\nemphasized their goal of l8 months in a federal camp” and “[e]veryone knew that a registerable\noffense precluded” a camp designation. Sanchez added, “Therefore it would have been wholly\ninconsistent with that primary goal of [Epstein’s] safety to lightly concede to registration at that\nmeeting.” Sanchez concluded, “[I]mposing a life sentence on him is not something anyone will\neventually be proud of. Please reconsider and help me get a fair result.”\n\nLourie responded to none of the Sanchez emails, but he did reach out to Acosta for a phone\nconversation. By email late that night, at lo:26 p.m., Lefkouitz asked Lourie to phone him.\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta—with copies to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia—\nto “follou up on our conversation Friday,” asking Acosta again to reconsider the requirement that\nEpstein plead to a registrable offense. Lefkouitz wrote that there had been a “misunderstanding”\nat the September l2, 2oo7 meeting:\n\nBefore the meeting, Mr. Krischer and Ms. Belohlavek, a sex\n\nprosecutor for l3 years, told us that solicitation of a minor . . . is not\n\na registerable offense. Houever, as it turned out, [it] is a registerable\n\noffense and our discussion at the meeting was based on a mistaken\n\nassumption. We suggest that Mr. Epstein enter two pleas—one to\n\nthe Indictment and a second to a non-registerable charge.\nhas offered to buy me a cup of coffee. I have had coffee with no one.” Krischer told OPR that the “reasons” to which\nhe referred related to the pressure he had been geting from Chief Reiter about the Epstein case.\n\n82\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44o6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004407.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page llo of 349\nLefkouitz set forth arguments similar to those Sanchez had presented to Lourie, as to why\nregistration “based on the facts alleged in this case . . . simply does not make sense.” In the event\nthat Acosta did not agree to their proposed charges, Lefkouitz offered as an alternative “to stipulate\nthat the state offense” would “constitute a prior sexual offense for purposes of enhanced recidivist\nsentencing” should Epstein ever again commit a federal sex offense against minors. As Lefkouitz\nfurther argued, “By accepting this option, you would be substituting the certainty of recidivist\nsentencing for the humiliation of registration.” Emails reflect that, early that afternoon, Acosta,\nLourie, and Villafafia discussed the mater in a conference call.\n\nLefkouitz also sent a revised version of the NPA to Villafafia that omited identification of\nthe charge to which Epstein would plead guilty. Later that day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta:\n\nI got a call from [M]arie who said you had rejected our proposal.\n\nDoes that mean you are not even prepared to have [Epstein] commit\n\nnou to plead to the registerable offense near the end of his l8 month\n\nsentence and then be <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> to l2 month[s] community control\n\nfor that charge? I thought that was exactly what you proposed\n\n[F]riday (although you wanted, but were not able, to do it with some\n\nkind of federal charge).\n\nBut that still gives you a registerable sex offense, 3o months total,\n\nand l8 in jail.\n\nHou can that not satisfy you—while still ensuring that [E]pstein is\n\nnot unduly endangered in jail?\nAcosta responded, “I do not mean to be difficult, but our negotiations must take place with the\nAUSAs assigned to the case.” Acosta added that he had spoken with Lourie and Villafafia, and\nthey had “discretion to proceed as they believe just and appropriate.” Acosta copied Villafafia,\nand she emailed Acosta to thank him “for the support.”\n\nL. The Defense Adds a Confidentiality Clause\n\nThroughout that Sunday evening, Lefkouitz had numerous email exchanges with\nVillafafia, and apparently a conference call with Lourie (who was returning to Washington, D.C.)\nand Villafafia. Later that evening, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a new version of the NPA that, for the\nfirst time, included a confidentiality term:\n\nIt is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that it not be\ndisseminated or disclosed except pursuant to court order. In the\nevent the Government must disclose this Agreement in response to\na request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the\nGovernment agrees to provide Epstein notice before the disclosure\nof this Agreement.\n\nAfter making additional revisions, Villafafia sent this NPA to Acosta and Lourie as the\n“final” version, asking Acosta to let her knou what he thought of it. Among her revisions, she\nchanged the confidentiality provision to the follouing:\n\n83\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44o7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004408.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll of 349\nThe parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part of\nany public record.

SEPTEMBER 24, 2oo7: ACOSTA MAKES FINAL EDITS, AND THE NPA IS\n\nSIGNED\n\nThe contemporaneous emails shou that Villafafia continued to update Acosta as the parties\nnegotiated the final language and that Acosta reviewed and edited the NPA. Shortly after midnight\non Monday, September 24, 2oo7, Acosta sent Villafafia “[s]mall edits” to the “final” NPA she had\nsent to him. Among his changes was language modifying provisions that appeared to require the\nState Atorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein\nenter his guilty plea by a certain date. Acosta explained in his email, “I’m not comfortable with\nrequiring the State Atorney to enter into a [joint sentencing] recommendation” or “requiring a\nState court to stick with our timeline” for entry of the guilty plea and sentencing. Accordingly,\nAcosta substituted language that required Epstein alone to make a binding sentencing\nrecommendation to the state court, and required Epstein to use his “best efforts” to enter his guilty\nplea and be <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> by the specified dates. Acosta also instructed Villafafia to restore a reference\nto Epstein’s wish “to reach a global resolution of his state and federal criminal liabilities.” Lourie,\nwho had returned to the Department in Washington, D.C., had a phone conversation with\nLefkouitz and sent additional comments on the final draft to Acosta and Villafafia. Villafafia sent\na new revision, incorporating edits from Acosta and Lourie, to Lefkouitz later that morning.\n\nOn the afternoon of September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia circulated the new “final” version of\nthe NPA to Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other supervisors, and asked Lefkouitz to send her the\nsigned agreement. After Lefkouitz electronically transmited to Villafafia a copy of the NPA\nsigned by Epstein, she emailed her immediate supervisor and her co-counsel: “They have scanned\nand emailed the signed agreement. It is done.”\n\nIn his transmital email, Lefkouitz asked Villafafia to “[p]lease do whatever you can to\nkeep this from becoming public.” Villafafia responded:\n\nI have forwarded your message only to Alex, Andy, and [the West\n\nPalm Beach manager]. I don’t anticipate it going any further than\n\nthat. When I receive the originals, I will sign and return one copy\n\nto you. The other will be placed in the case file, which will be kept\n\nconfidential since it also contains identifying information about the\n\ngirls.\n\nWhen we reach an agreement about the atorney representative for\n\nthe girls, we can discuss what I can tell him and the girls about the\nl28 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Lourie observed that because the NPA contained names of uncharged\nco-conspirators and other protected information, the USAO would have a duty to redact the information before\ndisclosing the NPA.\n\n84\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004410.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll3 of 349\nit had identified as victims.'°!

The USAO had no objection to Epstein self-reporting\nto begin serving his sentence by January 4, 2oo8.\n\nImmunity: The USAO would not initiate criminal charges against “any potential\nco-conspirator of Epstein,” including four named personal assistants.\n\nOther: Epstein was obligated to undertake discussions with the State Atorney’s\nOffice to ensure compliance with this agreement.\n\nEpstein waived his right to appeal.\n\nEpstein agreed that he would not be afforded any benefits with respect to\ngain time or other rights, opportunities, and benefits not available to any\nother inmate.\n\nThe federal investigation would be suspended and all pending legal process\nheld in abeyance unless and until Epstein violated any term of the\nagreement. Evidence “requested by or directly related to” the pending legal\nprocess, “including certain computer equipment,” would be kept inviolate\nuntil all the NPA terms had been satisfied.\n\nBreach: The USAO would be required to notify Epstein of any alleged breach of the\nagreement within 9o days of the expiration of the term of home\nconfinement, and would be required to initiate prosecution within 6o days\nthereafter.\n\nDisclosure: The parties “anticipate[d]” that the agreement would not be made part of\nany public record, and if the USAO received a Freedom of Information Act\nrequest or compulsory process commanding disclosure of the agreement, it\nwould provide notice to Epstein before making any disclosure. !*\n\nThat evening, Lefkouitz emailed Lourie to express concern about the notification he\nunderstood would be given to Chief Reiter, stating, “I am very concerned about leaks unduly\nprejudicing Jeffrey [Epstein] in the media.”!°? He added, “I have enjoyed working with you on\nHe The USAO had not informed the defense of the victims’ identities at this point. The parties anticipated that\nthe USAO would send Epstein’s atorneys a list of victims when Epstein fulfilled his obligation under the NPA to\nenter his state guilty pleas.\n\nl32 The final NPA is atached as Exhibit 3 to this Report.\nl33 On October 3, 2oo7, the Miami FBI media officer notified the USAO that the New York Post had reported\nthat federal authorities were not going to pursue federal charges against Epstein. According to the Post, Epstein would\nplead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes, “in a deal that will send him to prison for about l8 months,” folloued\nby “a shorter period of house confinement,” and, according to “sources,” federal authorities had “agreed to drop their\n86\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004425.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l28 of 349\nscheduled January 4, 2oo8 plea hearing. As soon became apparent, Acosta was unable to achieve\nan expedited review so that Epstein could plead guilty and be <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> by\nJanuary 4, 2oo8, and the plea and sentencing date was rescheduled. On January 2, 2oo8, Sloman\nspoke with Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek, who confirmed that the change of plea hearing\nhad been postponed. In an email reporting this to Acosta and Villafafia, Sloman said that Epstein’s\nlocal defense atorney Goldberger had told Belohlavek the postponement was because the facts\n“did not fit the proposed state charge,” and that Belohlavek told Sloman she agreed with that\nassessment.’ The next day, Villafafia sent to Acosta and Sloman a local newspaper article\nreporting that Epstein’s state plea hearing was reset for March and in exchange for it the federal\nauthorities would drop their investigation of him. Acosta also sent to Sloman and Villafafia an\nemail memorializing a statement made to him by Lefkouitz in a phone call that day: “‘I\n[Lefkouitz] may have made a mistake 6 months ago. [Belohlavek] told us solicitation [is] not\nregistrable. It turns out that the actual offense charged is.’”!°°\n\n5. January 7, 2oo8: Acosta and Sloman Meet with Sanchez, Who Makes\nAdditional Allegations of USAO Misconduct\n\nOn January 7, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman met with defense atorney Sanchez at her request.\nAccording to meeting notes made by Sloman, among other things, Sanchez alleged that the\nUSAO’s media spokesperson had improperly disclosed details of the Epstein case to a national\nnews reporter, and Sanchez “suggested that the USAO could avoid any potential ugliness in DC\nby agreeing to a watered-doun resolution for Epstein.” After Acosta excused himself to atend\nanother meeting and Sloman refused to speak further with Sanchez “without a witness present,”\nshe left. Later that day, Acosta and Sloman spoke by phone with Starr, Lefkouitz, and Sanchez,\nwho expressed concern about the “leak” to the news media, reiterated their objections to the NPA,\nand pressed for the ‘“‘watered-doun resolution,” which they specified would mean allouing Epstein\nto plead to a charge of coercion instead of procurement, avoid serving time in jail, and not register\nas a sexual offender. A note in the margin of Sloman’s handwriten notes of the conversation\nreads: “We’re back to where we started in September.”\n\nThat evening, Villafafia expressed concern that the delay in resolving the mater was\naffecting the USAO’s ability to go forward with a prosecution should Epstein renege on his\nagreement, and she outlined for Acosta and Sloman the steps she proposed to take while Epstein\nwas pursuing Departmental review. Those steps included re-establishing contact with victims,\ninterviewing victims in New York and one victim who lived in a foreign country, making contact\nwith “potential sources of information” in the Virgin Islands, and re-initiating proceedings to\nobtain Epstein’s computers.\n\nIn the meantime, USAO Criminal Division Chief Robert Senior performed a “soup to nuts”\nreview of the Epstein investigation, reviewing the indictment package and all of the evidence\nVillafafia had compiled. He told OPR that he could not recall the reason for his review, but opined\nl5? Belohlavek told OPR that she did not recall this incident, but she noted that the PBPD report did set forth\nfacts supporting the charge of procurement of a minor.\n\nl6o Although the meeting Lefkouitz had with Lourie, Villafafia, Krischer, and Belohlavek to discuss the state\nresolution was only four months prior, not six, Lefkouitz’s reference was likely to the September l2, 2oo7 meeting.\nlol\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4425", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004434.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l37 of 349\n\nOn Monday, June 23, 2oo8, Roth sent a brief leter to Starr and Lefkouitz informing them\nthat the office had “completed a thorough review” of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater\nand did not believe intervention by the Deputy Atorney General was warranted in view of the\n“considerable discretion” vested by the Department in U.S. Atorneys. He added, “Even if we\nwere to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Atorney, we believe that federal prosecution\nof this case is appropriate.”\n\nImmediately after receiving a copy of Roth’s leter, Villafafia notified defense counsel that\nEpstein would have until close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the NPA\nby entering his guilty plea, being <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span>, and surrendering to begin serving his sentence. On\nJune 26, 2oo8, Roth alerted the Office of the Atorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to\ncontact the Atorney General to request additional review and urged the Atorney General not to\ntake defense counsel’s calls. Roth told OPR that he was concerned that Epstein’s team would try\nto take a further appeal in order to delay resolution of the case.\n\nMeanwhile, Starr sent a concluding email to Acosta, acknouledging they had reached “the\nend of a long and arduous road” and adding, “While Iam obviously very unhappy at what I believe\nis the government’s treatment of my client, aman whom I have come to deeply admire, I recognize\nthat we have filed and argued our ‘appellate motions’ and lost. ... I would like to have .. . some\nclosure with you on this mater so that in the years to come, neither of us will harbor any ill will\nover the mater.”\n\nX. JUNE 2oo8 — JUNE 2oo9: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS PLEAS AND SERVES HIS\n\nCUSTODIAL SENTENCE\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia renewed her requests to Epstein’s local atorneys\nGoldberger and Black for a copy of the state plea agreement reached with the State Atorney’s\nOffice, noting that their failure to provide it was a material breach of the NPA. After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\nCommunity Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\ncommunity control] in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\ncommunity control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.’”!””\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\n\nV2 The Main Detention Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates.

Villafafia, houever, did not\nask that the agreement be amended to clarify that the reference to “the Palm Beach County\nDetention Facility” meant the jail, rather than the Stockade. The final signed plea agreement form\nfurther clarified the sentence, providing that after serving l2 months in the Palm Beach County\nDetention Facility, Epstein would be “<span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> to 6 months in the Palm Beach County Detention\nFacility . . . to be served consecutive to the l2 month sentence,” folloued by “l2 months\nCommunity Control.” The word “imprisoned” was hand writen after “6 months” but then crossed\nout and replaced by “jail sentence.”!”\n\nA. June 3o, 2oo8: Epstein Enters His Guilty Pleas in State Court\n\nEpstein, with his atorney Jack Goldberger, appeared in Palm Beach County court on\nJune 3o, 2oo8, and entered guilty pleas to the indictment charging him with one felony count of\nsolicitation of prostitution and to a criminal information charging him with one felony count of\nprocurement of a minor to engage in prostitution.'”4 At the plea hearing, which Villafafia and the\nFBI case agent atended as spectators, Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek did not proffer the facts\nof the case; instead she only recited the charging language in the indictment and the criminal\ninformation:\n\n[B]etween August l, 2oo4 and October 3l, 2oo5, the defendant in\n\nPalm Beach County did solicit or procure someone to commit\n\n[prostitution] on three or more occasions.

On November l6, 2oo7, the case agents met with Belohlavek and asked if\nthe State Atorney’s Office would oppose a request that Epstein be granted work release.\nBelohlavek was noncommital, and when the agents asked that she include language in the state’s\nplea agreement prohibiting Epstein from participating in work release, she responded that she\nwould have to discuss the issue with the State Atorney.'®° Krischer later told OPR that work\nrelease was “within the control of the Sheriffs Office, not my office.” The state’s plea agreement\nwith Epstein did not address the issue of work release.\n\nThe day after Epstein entered his June 3o, 2oo8 plea, Villafafia and her immediate\nsupervisor met with a Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office official to discuss work release. According to\nVillafafia, the official told them, “Epstein would be eligible for work release and will be placed on\nwork release,” a statement that contradicted the information the case agents had been given by a\njail supervisor the previous November, as well as statements made by defense atorney Jack\nGoldberger to Villafafia just days before the plea was entered, when he “specifically told\n[Villafafia] that [Epstein] would not get work release.” Villafafia alerted the Sheriff’s Office\nofficial that although Epstein told the court during his plea proceeding that he had worked “every\nday” for a “couple of years” at the “Florida Science Foundation,” that entity did not even exist\nuntil November 2oo7.'*! Moreover, the address Epstein provided to the court for the “Florida\nScience Foundation” was the office of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia and her\nsupervisor asked that the Sheriffs Office notify the USAO if Epstein applied for work release.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he was aware Villafafia was trying to ensure that Epstein did not get\nwork release, and he would not have contradicted her efforts. Acosta explained that the USAO\nexpected Epstein would be “treated just like everyone else,” but that, as shoun by “our subsequent\ncommunications with the [S]tate [A]torney’s [O]ffice,” having Epstein on work release “was not\nwhat our office envisioned.”\n\nIn August 2oo8, Villafafia spoke with defense atorney Black about ensuring Epstein’s\ncompliance with the NPA, and raised the issue of work release. Villafafia later reported to Acosta\nand Sloman that Black assured her he had “reminded the team that .. . l8 months IN JAIL is a\nmaterial term of the agreement.”\n\nThe USAO never received notice of Epstein’s work release application. On October lo,\n2oo8, less than three-and-a-half months after Epstein entered his guilty plea, the Palm Beach\nSheriff's Office placed him into the work release program, permiting him to leave the Stockade\nl7? According to Sloman, Krischer explained that even without registration Epstein would be “treated” as a “sex\noffender” and that “just like any other sex offender, he can petition the court for work release.”\nl8D In the November l6, 2oo7 email, on which she copied Acosta, Villafafia also indicated that she was\n“reviewing all of the statutes” to determine whether there was any impediment to a state judge granting Epstein work\nrelease. In a subsequent email, the FBI case agents informed Villafafia that they had also spoken with a “jail\nsupervisor,” who advised them that although Epstein, as a sexual offender, would not qualify for work release, the\njudge could nevertheless order him placed on work release if he was <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> to a year or less of incarceration.\n\nl8l During the plea hearing, Epstein told the court he was “President” of the Florida Science Foundation, it had\nbeen in existence for l5 years, and he worked there “every day.” Plea Hearing Transcript at 27-29.\nll4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4438", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004451.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l54 of 349\nflexibility to decline to bring a particular charge based on a “good faith doubt” that the law or\nevidence supports the charge.\n\nZi Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens\n\nOn April 28, l995, the Atorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors\nentitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly\nbecome involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States. In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated administrative deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\n\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\n\nextraordinary circumstances exist. Accordingly, absent such\n\ncircumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\n\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\n\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\n\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a\nerm, “*\n\nStipulated administrative deportation orders can be based “on the conviction for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)(), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\n\nC. Case Law\n\nl. Prosecutorial Discretion\n\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\ndiscretion in deciding whether and whom to prosecute. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP Enforcement Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\n\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo445l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004452.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l55 of 349\nthe prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\n<span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. /d. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\nDe Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts.

Acosta’s Decisions Led to Difficulties Enforcing the NPA\n\nAfter the agreement was reached, the collateral atacks and continued appeals raised the\nspecter that the defense had negotiated in bad faith. At various points, individual members of the\nUSAO team became frustrated by defense tactics, and in some instances, consideration was given\nto whether the USAO should declare a unilateral breach. Indeed, on November 24, 2oo8, the\nUSAO gave notice that it deemed Epstein’s participation in work release to be a breach of the\nagreement but ultimately took no further action. Acosta told OPR: “I was personally very\nfrustrated with the failure to report on October 2o, and had I envisioned that entire collateral atack,\nI think I would have looked at this very differently.”\n\nOnce the NPA was signed, Acosta could have ignored Epstein’s requests for further review\nby the Department and, if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under the NPA to enter his state\nguilty plea, declared Epstein to be in breach and proceeded to charge him federally. When\nquestioned about this issue, Acosta explained that he believed the Department had the “right” to\naddress Epstein’s concerns. He told OPR that because the USAO is part of the Department of\nJustice, if a defendant asks for Departmental review, it would be “unseemly” to object. During his\nOPR interview, Sloman described Acosta as very process-oriented, which he atributed to Acosta’s\nprior Department experience. Sloman, houever, believed the USAO gave Epstein “[t]oo much\nprocess,” a result of the USAO’s desire to “do the right thing” and to the defense team’s ability to\nkeep pressing for more process without triggering a breach of the NPA. Furthermore, Epstein’s\ndefense counsel repeatedly and carefully made clear they were not repudiating the agreement.\nAcosta told OPR that the USAO would have had to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA in order\nto proceed to file federal charges, and Epstein would undoubtedly have litigated whether his effort\nto obtain Departmental review constituted a breach. Acosta recalled that he was concerned, as was\nSloman, that a unilateral decision to rescind the non-prosecution agreement would result in\ncollateral litigation that would further delay maters and make what was likely a difficult trial even\nharder.\n\nAcosta’s and Sloman’s concerns about declaring a breach were not unreasonable. A court\nwould have been unlikely to have determined that defense counsel’s appeal of the NPA to the\nDepartment and unwillingness to set a state plea date while that appeal was ongoing was sufficient\nto negate the agreement. Houever, some of the difficulty the USAO faced in declaring a breach\nwas caused by decisions Acosta made before and shortly after the NPA was signed. For example,\nand significantly, it was Acosta who changed the language, “Epstein shall enter his guilty plea and\nbe <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> not later than October 26, 2oo7” to “Epstein shall use [his] best efforts to enter his\nguilty plea and be <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> not later than October 26, 2oo7.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta also\nagreed not to enforce the NPA’s October 26, 2oo7 deadline for entry of Epstein’s plea, and he told\ndefense counsel that he had no objection if they decided to pursue an appeal to the Department.\nFollouing these decisions, the USAO would have had significant difficulty trying to prove that\nEpstein was not using his “best efforts” to comply with the NPA and was intentionally failing to\ncomply, as opposed to pursuing a course to which the U.S. Atorney had at least implicitly agreed.\n\nE. Acosta Did Not Exercise Sufficient Supervisory Review over the Process\n\nThe question at the center of much of the public controversy concerning the USAO’s\nhandling of its criminal investigation of Epstein is why the USAO agreed to resolve a case in which\n\nl82\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004539.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 242 of 349\nin Courtroom llF at the Palm Beach County Courthouse, 2o5 North\nDixie Highway, West Palm Beach, Florida.

Marie and... the agents . . . were keeping the victims apprised at some\nlevel.”\n\nOn December 7, 2oo7, Villafafia prepared leters containing the above information to be\nsent to multiple victims and emailed Acosta and Sloman, requesting permission to send them.*!®\nSloman, houever, had that day received a leter from Sanchez, advising that Epstein’s plea hearing\nwas scheduled for January 4, 2oo8, and requesting that the USAO “hold off’ sending the victim\nnotification leters until “we can further discuss the contents.” Also that day, Starr and Lefkouitz\nsubmited to Acosta the two lengthy “independent ethics opinions” supporting the defense\narguments against the federal investigation and the NPA’s use of l8 U.S.C. § 2255. Sloman\nresponded to Villafafia’s request with an email instructing her to “Hold the leter.”?!’ Sloman told\nOPR that he “wanted to push the [victim notification] leter out,” but his instruction to Villafafia\nwas “the product of me speaking to somebody,” although he could not be definitive as to whom.\nSloman further told OPR that once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO\n“had concerns that if we g[a]ve them the victim notification leter .. . and the deal fell apart, then\nthe victims would be instantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary\ncompensation.”\n\nOn December lo, 2oo7, Villafafia contacted the atorney who at the time represented the\nvictim who later became CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe #2” to inform him that she “was preparing\nvictim notification leters.” In her 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia noted\nthat she reached out to Jane Doe #2’s counsel, despite the fact that the USAO no longer considered\n2l8 The FBI case agent had emailed Villafafia the day before stating, “The leter that is currently being revised\nneeds to take into account that several victims have never been notified by your office or mine.” The case agent also\nstated, “I do not feel that [the defense] should have anything to do with the drafting or issuing of this leter. My\nprimary concern is that we meet our federal obligations to the victims in accordance with federal law.”\n\n3l7 Villafafia told OPR that she did not recall asking Sloman for an explanation for not sending the leters; rather,\nshe “just remember[ed] puting them all in the Redweld and puting them in a drawer and being disgusted.”\n2l5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4539", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004548.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 25l of 349\nif you have additional questions which invelve this mater, please coniact the office listed above, When\nyou cail, please previde the file number located af the top of this lelter.

The atorney\nasked Sloman if the USAO “could file criminal charges even though the state was looking into the\nmater,” but Sloman declined to answer his questions concerning the investigation.**” In late\nJanuary, the New York Post reported that the atorney’s clients had filed a $5o million civil suit\nagainst Epstein in Florida and that “Epstein is expected to be <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> to l8 months in prison\nwhen he pleads guilty in March to a single charge of soliciting an underage prostitute.”**°\n\nBetween January 3l, 2oo8, and May 28, 2oo8, the FBI, with the prosecutors, interviewed\nadditional victims and reinterviewed several who had been interviewed before the NPA was\nsigned.*** In late January 2oo8, as Villafafia and the CEOS Trial Atorney prepared to participate\n33o The case agent also informed Villafafia that she expected to ask for legal process soon in order to obtain\nadditional information.\nal The CEOS Trial Atorney told OPR that she was under the impression that she was brought in to help prepare\nfor the trial because the “plea had fallen through.”\n\nA82 Because Sloman and the atorney were former legal practice partners, Sloman reported the interaction to\nAcosta, and the USAO reported the incident to OPR shortly thereafter.

The leter took an expansive\nview of the applicable statutes by contending that both the CVRA and the VRRA required the\nUSAO to notify the victims of the state proceedings:\n\n[T]hese sections are not limited to proceedings in a federal district\ncourt. Our Non-Prosecution Agreement resolves the federal\ninvestigation by allouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense.\nThe victims identified through the federal investigation should be\nappropriately informed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does\nnot require the U.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal\nobligations.*!®\n\nThe leter also asserted that the VRRA obligated the USAO to provide the victims with\ninformation concerning restitution to which they may be entitled and “the earliest possible” notice\nof the status of the investigation, the filing of charges, and the acceptance of a plea. Along with\nthe leter, Sloman forwarded a revised draft victim notification leter to Lefkouitz for his\ncomments. This draft victim notification leter stated that the federal investigation had been\ncompleted, Epstein would plead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of\nimprisonment at sentencing, and Epstein would compensate victims for monetary damages claims\nbrought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The draft victim notification leter provided specific information\nconcerning the upcoming change of plea hearing and invited the victims to atend or provide a\nwriten statement to the State Atorney’s Office. When Lefkouitz asked Sloman to delay sending\nvictim notifications until after a discussion of their contents, Sloman instructed Villafafia, who was\npreparing leters for transmital to 3o victims, to “Hold the leter.’ During his OPR interview,\nSloman recalled that he had “wanted to push the leter out,” but he “must have had a conversation\nwith somebody” about whether the CVRA applied, and based on that conversation he directed\nVillafafia to hold the leter.\n\nIn his response leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz contended that the government had\nmisinterpreted both the CVRA and VRRA because neither applied to the “public proceeding in\nthis mater [which] will be in state court for the purpose of the entry of a plea on state charges.”\nAl6 Sloman told Lefkouitz the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is simply informing the\nvictims of their rights.” Sloman also addressed the defense atorneys’ objection to advising the victims that they could\ncontact Villafafia or the FBI case agent with questions or concerns by referencing the CVRA, noting, “Again, federal\nlaw requires that victims have the ‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.”\n\n266\nDOJ-OGR-oooo459o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004595.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 298 of 349\ninvestigation. Because the state indictment and information appeared to pertain to far fewer than\nthe total victims identified in either the state or the federal investigation, and no one at the USAO\nwas certain which victims were covered by the state charges, it should have been apparent to\nAcosta that without advance planning between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office, there\nwas a substantial risk that most of the victims identified in the federal investigation would not\nreceive notice of the hearing.*”° Notification to the broadest possible number of identified victims\ncould only have been successful if there was appropriate communication between the USAO and\nthe state prosecutors, communication that had previously been lacking regarding other significant\nissues relating to Epstein. Villafafia and Sloman’s hastily arranged effort to enlist in the\nnotification process PBPD Chief Reiter, who likely played litle role in complying with the state’s\nvictim notification obligations in a typical case, was not an adequate substitute for careful planning\nand coordination with the State Atorney’s Office.*”°\n\nEven if the State Atorney’s Office had notified all of the identified victims of the upcoming\nplea hearing, there was no guarantee that such notification would have included information that\nthe state plea was resolving not just the state’s investigation of Epstein, but the federal investigation\nas well. The State Atorney was not obligated by state statutes to inform the victims of the status\nof the federal investigation, and there was litle reason to assume Krischer, or one of his staff,\nwould voluntarily do so, thereby puting the State Atorney’s Office in the position of fielding\nvictim questions and concerns about the outcome. Furthermore, as both the USAO and the defense\nhad differing views as to who could lawfully participate in the state plea hearing, there is no\nindication that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia took steps to confirm that, if victims appeared, they\ncould actually participate in the state court proceeding when they were not victims of the charged\ncrimes. #7\n\nThrough counsel, Acosta asserted to OPR that because Villafafia and Sloman both told\nOPR that they believed that state officials would notify the victims, “OPR identified no reason\nwhy Secretary Acosta should have distrusted his team on these points.” Acosta’s counsel further\n425 Krischer told OPR that the state’s notification obligation extended to all victims identified in the state\ninvestigation. Nonetheless, which victims were encompassed in the state’s investigation was unclear. The PBPD’s\nprobable cause affidavit included crimes against only 5 victims, not the l9 identified in the state\ninvestigation. According to state records made public, the state subpoenaed to the grand jury only 3 victims. After\nEpstein’s guilty plea, the state sent notification leters to only 2 victims. Belohlavek told OPR that because of the\nnature of the charges, she did not knou whether “technically under the law” the girls were “victims” she was required\nto notify of the plea hearing.\n\nW6 The State Atorney’s Office had its oun procedures and employees who handled victim notification, and\nBelohlavek told OPR that the Chief of the Police Department would not regularly play a role in the state victim\nnotification process.\n\n427 Although Villafafia’s notes indicate that she researched Florida Statutes §§ 96o.ool and 92l.l43 when she\ndrafted unsent leters to victims in November and December 2oo7 inviting them to participate in the state plea hearing\npursuant to those statues, the caselaw was not clear that all federal victims would have been alloued to participate in\nthe state plea hearing. In Lefkouitz’s November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, he argued that the statutes afforded a right\nto speak at a defendant’s sentencing or to submit a statement only to the victims of the crime for which the defendant\nwas being <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span>. In April 2oo8, a Florida District Court of Appeal ruled against a defendant who argued that\nFlorida Statute § 92l.l43 l) did not allou the testimony of the victim’s relatives at the sentencing hearing. The court\nruled that § 92l.l43(l) “should not be read as limiting the testimony Rule 3.72o(b) allous trial courts to consider at\nsentencing hearings.” Smith v. State, 982 So. 2d 69, 72 (Fla. Dist.

On appeal to this Court, Zuber argued\nthat he was “induced by the specific promise made by the Commonwealth,” which\nultimately turned out to be a “false and empty one.” /d.

Further, if the address book\nwere a forgery, it would have provided Mr. Rodriguez with a complete defense in his criminal\ncase: the defendant could not have impaired a grand jury investigation by “concealing” a forged\ndocument.

The “added tabs” the defendant mentions are literally\nsticky notes atached to certain pages, likely added by law enforcement after they seized the book\nfrom Mr. Rodriguez.

David Parse, et al., o9 Cr. 58l (WHP)\nDear Judge Pauley:\n\nThis leter is respectfully submited on behalf of David Parse, who is scheduled to\nbe <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> for tax-related crimes on March 22, 2ol3. For the reasons discussed belou, we\nbelieve that a non-incarcerative sentence would be a fair and parsimonious one. See United\nStates v. Dorvee, 6l6 F.3d l74, l82 (2d Cir. 2olo)(“it is the sentencing court’s duty to impose a\nsentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with the specific purposes set forth\nat l8 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)”).\n\nA. Background\n\nDavid Parse was born in Detroit, Michigan, on December 7, l96l. He was the\nyoungest of five children of Sylvia and Henry Parse. A World War II veteran, David's father\nworked two jobs for most of his life. He was a mailman by day, and a factory worker at night.\nDavid’s mother worked part-time as a laundress in a local restaurant. The two parents instilled\nWASHINGTON, DC NEW YORK TAMPA BALTIMORE\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo95o6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009588.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 26 of5l\nher motion, that these counts are “virtually identical.” (Def. Mot. at 22). But charges that cover\ndifferent schemes under different statutes are not “virtually identical.” The Court should reject\nthis argument.\nA. Applicable Law\n\nThe Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution “protects against\nmultiple punishments for the same offense.” North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 7ll, 7l7 (l969).\nAccordingly, a defendant cannot be <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> for multiplicitous charges covering the same crime.\n“An indictment is multiplicitous when it charges a single offense as an offense multiple times, in\nseparate counts, when, in law and fact, only one crime has been commited.” United States v.\nChacko, l69 F.3d l4o, l45 (2d Cir. l999); see also United States v. Jones, 482 F.3d 6o, 72 (2d\nCir. 2oo6) (“A claim of multiplicity cannot succeed, houever, ‘unless the charged offenses are the\nsame in fact and in law.’” (quoting United States v. Estrada, 32o F.3d l73, l8o (2d Cir. 2oo3)).\nAlthough the Double Jeopardy Clause does not protect against simultaneous prosecutions for the\nsame offense, a defendant has a right not to be punished twice for the same crime. United States\nv. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 35o, 355 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (per curiam). Accordingly, “[i]f the jury convicts\non more than one multiplicitous count, the defendant’s right not to suffer multiple punishments for\nthe same offense will be protected by having the court enter judgment on only one of the\nmultiplicitous counts.” /d. Similarly, where the judgment of conviction has already been entered\non multiplicitous counts, that right is protected by vacating the convictions on all but one\nmultiplicitous count. Id.\n\n“For purposes of a multiplicity analysis, the determinative issue is not whether the same\nconduct underlies separate counts, but whether the offense charged in one count is the same as the\n25\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9588", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009940.jpg": "Cadac PAROS ORE DARN mea a iad PRS DELP ab athe 8 Sf af 767\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, v\nFebruary l5, 2ol2 PAUL M.

For the reasons discussed belou, we\nbelieve that a non-incarcerative sentence would be a fair and parsimonious one. See United\nStates v. Dorvee, 6l6 F.3d l74, l82 (2d Cir. 2olo)(“it is the sentencing court’s duty to impose a\nsentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with the specific purposes set forth\nat l8 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)”).\n\nA. Background\n\nDavid Parse was born in Detroit, Michigan, on December 7, l96l. He was the\nyoungest of five children of Sylvia and Henry Parse. A World War II veteran, David's father\nworked two jobs for most of his life. He was a mailman by day, and a factory worker at night.\nDavid’s mother worked part-time as a laundress in a local restaurant.

The 2oo3 Guidelines Apply to the Offense Conduct\n\nBefore determining the applicable sentencing range, the Court must first resolve the\nthreshold issue of whether the 2oo3 Guidelines or the 2oo4 Guidelines applies to the criminal\nconduct in this case. It is well-setled that it is a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause for a\nsentencing court to apply a version of the Guidelines that did not come into effect until after the\ncriminal conduct was complete if it provides for a higher sentencing range. See Peugh v. United\nStates, 569 U.S. 53o, 532-33 (2ol3) (“[T]here is an ex post facto violation when a defendant is\n<span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> under Guidelines promulgated after he commited his criminal acts and the new\nversion provides a higher applicable Guidelines sentencing range than the version in place at the\ntime of the offense.”).\n\nThere is no dispute that the 2oo4 Guidelines, which took effect on November l, 2oo4,\ncall for a much harsher sentence than the 2oo3 Guidelines. If the Court applied all of the same\n! This memorandum sets forth arguments concerning the proper Guidelines calculation. Ms. Maxwell’s arguments\nfor why the Court should grant a substantial dounward variance from the advisory Guidelines range are addressed in\na separate submission entitled Sentencing Memorandum on Behalf of Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo422", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010425.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 _ Filed o6/l5/22 Page 8 of 29\n\nIn each of these cases, the ex post facto violation resulted from an increase in the\napplicable statutory penalty, as opposed to the applicable sentencing range under the Guidelines.\nHouever, the Supreme Court has clearly held that it is also a violation of the Ex Post Facto\nClause to apply a later version of the Guidelines that increases the recommended sentencing\nrange if the criminal conduct was complete before the later version took effect. See Peugh, 569\nU.S. at 532-33 (“[T]here is an ex post facto violation when a defendant is <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> under\nGuidelines promulgated after he commited his criminal acts and the new version provides a\nhigher applicable Guidelines sentencing range than the version in place at the time of the\noffense.”). An ex post facto violation is an ex post facto violation regardless of whether the\nincreased penalty resulted from a change in the statute or a change in the Guidelines. Hence, if\nthe end date of the offense conduct dictates whether it is permissible to apply a later Guidelines\nbook consistent with the Ex Post Facto Clause, the jury must find that fact.\n\nHere, the S2 Indictment alleges only that the criminal conduct ended “in or about 2oo4”\nand does not specify whether the conduct continued into November and December 2oo4. Nor\nwas the jury asked to make a specific finding as to the end date of the offense conduct. Because\nthe jury did not make the necessary factual finding, the Court cannot apply the 2oo4 Guidelines\nand must instead apply the 2oo3 Guidelines.°\n\nB. The Trial Record Is Insufficient to Support a Finding that the Offense\n\nConduct Continued Past November l, 2oo4.\n\nEven if the Court can determine the end date of the offense conduct for Guidelines\n\npurposes, the record does not support a finding that the conduct extended past November l,\n3 Although the issue is properly framed as an ex post facto issue, it would also violate Ms. Maxwell’s Sixth\nAmendment rights for the Court, and not the jury, to determine when the offense conduct ended. See Apprendi v.\nNew Jersey, 53o U.S. 466 (2ooo); Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296 (2oo4); United States v. Booker, 543 U.S.\n22o (2oo5); see also Julian, 427 F.3d at 482 (failure to have the jury determine the end date of the conspiracy for ex\npost facto purposes was a violation of the defendant’s Sixth Amendment rights).\n\n4\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo425", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010452.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 663 Filed o6/l5/22 Page6of77\ngovernment added to the demonization of Ms. Maxwell by calling her a “villain” on the day of her\narrest.*\n\nBut in sentencing Ms. Maxwell, the Court cannot be influenced by this inexorable\ndrumbeat of public condemnation calling for her to be locked away for good. The Court cannot\nheal the wounds caused by Epstein by heaping on Ms. Maxwell’s shoulders the pain of every one\nof his victims, the outrage of society, the public scorn of the community, and then driving her out\nof the community forever. While that may assuage the public and give the perception that “justice\nwas done,” that is not justice. That is scapegoating. Ms. Maxwell must be <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> on the record\nbefore the Court and not these external pressures.\n\nGhislaine Maxwell’s Arrest and Detention\n\nAt dawn on July 2, 2o2o, a team of more than a dozen FBI agents arrested Ms. Maxwell at\nthe New Hampshire home where she had taken refuge after Epstein’s death to escape the upsurge\nof highly intrusive media coverage that had engulfed her and her family. She had relocated alone,\nseparating from her family to safeguard her husband and two young stepchildren and to secure the\npersonal safety of her family and herself. At that time, Ms. Maxwell was the target of numerous\ndeath threats and threats of violence and was being hunted by the press. One media outlet even\noffered a $lo,ooo bounty for information about her whereabouts. Tragically, this experience was\nnot new for Ms. Maxwell. Decades earlier, when Ms. Maxwell was just a child and her father was\na Member of Parliament, U.K. authorities found a “hit list” of potential kidnapping/assassination\ntargets in a safehouse used by the Irish Republican Army. Ms. Maxwell’s name was first on the\nlist. This unnerving experience has haunted her, heightening her vigilance and concerns about the\nwelfare and safety of her young stepchildren, who were being hounded by the media at school and\n* htps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7J4ReLHvag, at 2:o9-2:l5.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo452", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010467.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 663 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 2l of 77\nwho have been found guilty of dissimilar conduct.”) (citing Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 55\n(2oo7)).\n\nIn addition, a non-guidelines sentence would avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. It\nwould be plainly unjust to sentence Ghislaine Maxwell as if she were Jeffrey Epstein. Had Epstein\nbeen tried on this indictment he would have been exposed to a comparable guideline range. Justice\nwould not be served by sentencing Ms. Maxwell to the extent of the more culpable Epstein. Nor\nshould she be <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> as if she were Harvey Weinstein. Follouing a state jury trial convicting\nhim of forcible rape, Weinstein received a prison sentence of 23 years, less than the louest part of\nthe guideline range calculated by Probation for Ms. Maxwell.\n\nMoreover, a non-guidelines sentence would at least mitigate the drastic disparity between\nthe penalties under state and federal law in this case. The predicate state offense in Counts Three\nand Four — New York Penal Law § l3o.55 — is a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum term of\n9o days’ imprisonment. See United States v. Broun, 843 F.3d 74, 88-89 & n.2 (2d Cir. 2ol6)\n(Pooler, J., dissenting) (noting the stark difference in sentences for offenses involving the sexual\nexploitation of minors under federal law versus New York State law). Viewing the conduct of\nconviction in the light most favorable to the government, imposition of a guideline sentence for\nMs. Maxwell will lead to inequitable and disparate results.\n\nIn this case, the goals of sentencing will be achieved by a significant dounward variance\nfrom the unduly harsh Guidelines range of 292 - 365 months and Probation’s recommended 24o-\nmonth sentence for offense conduct that occurred l8 to 28 years ago and where a 6o-year-old\nfemale defendant with no prior- or post-offense history of misconduct requires no rehabilitation\nby incarceration and poses no risk of recidivism.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo467", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010475.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document663_ Filed o6/l5/22 Page 29 of 77\nAlthough legally presumed innocent, she was humiliated and treated in a way that even\nestablished guilt cannot justify.

Despite\ncomplaints made by Ms. Maxwell and her counsel, the MDC and BOP officials retained unchecked\nauthority to incarcerate her as they pleased on conditions that constituted unusual punishment for\na non-violent pretrial detainee who posed no threat to herself or others.

Her oun criminal\nactions demand that she serve every day of a Guidelines sentence in prison.\n\nI. Background\n\nA. The Investigation\n\nThe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York opened its investigation\ninto Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators in late November 2ol8. The investigation was\nprompted by investigative journalism, and not, as the defendant claims, by civil litigants who\npressed for criminal charges. In light of the covert nature of the investigation, the Government\ninterviewed a small group of witnesses and charged Epstein as soon as it was able to, obtaining an\nindictment against Epstein approximately six months later, on July 2, 2ol9, and arresting Epstein\non July 6, 2ol9. (PSR ¥ 2l). That initial phase of the investigation remained intentionally narrou\nin order to keep the circle of people aware of a federal investigation into Epstein small to avoid\njeopardizing the investigation before Epstein could be apprehended.\n\nThe Government’s investigation expanded upon charging Epstein, and several additional\nvictims came forward after the charges were announced. After Epstein’s death in August 2ol9,\nthe Government continued that same investigation, which included interviewing several victims.\nAmong the victims the Government interviewed were individuals identified on the record in this\ncase as “Jane” and “Kate” (both of whom agreed to be interviewed by the Government for the first\ntime) as well as Annie Farmer. The Government obtained the original Indictment against the\ndefendant—which related to the abuse of Jane, Kate, and Annie Farmer—in late June 2o2o. In\nMarch 2o2l, the Government obtained a superseding indictment charging the defendant—which\nadded counts relating to the defendant’s abuse of an additional minor victim, Carolyn—based on\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo54o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010553.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Pagel8of55\n\nIn a memorandum dated June l5, 2o22, the defendant urges the Court to adopt a sentencing\nrange of 5l to 63 months’ imprisonment, which reflects a small fraction of the applicable\nsentencing Guidelines range. The defendant reaches this lou number by disputing four aspects of\nthe Probation Office’s calculation. For the reasons set forth belou, the Court should reject the\ndefendant’s Guidelines objections in their entirety. It would be both strange and anomalous for\nthe Sentencing Guidelines to recommend such a short sentence for a defendant who spent years\nsexually exploiting teenage girls. The Sentencing Guidelines do not provide for a such an\noutcome.\n\nA. The 2oo4 Sentencing Guidelines Manual Applies\n\nIn the ordinary course, the Sentencing Guidelines instruct courts to use the Guidelines\nManual in effect on the date that the defendant is <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span>, which here would result in applying\nthe 2o2l Guidelines Manual (the “2o2l Manual”). U.S.S.G. § lBl.ll(a). Where, as here, the\ncurrent Guidelines Manual provides a higher range than the Manual in effect at the time of the\noffense conduct, using the current manual would violate the Ex Post Facto clause. U.S.S.G.\n§ lBl.ll(b)(l); Peugh v. United States, 569 U.S. 53o, 544 (2ol3). Here, the 2o2l Manual calls\nfor a substantially higher guidelines calculation than the Government seeks. For example, under\nthe 2o2l Manual, the base offense level would be 3o before any enhancements are applied,\nwhereas the 2oo4 Sentencing Guidelines Manual (the “2oo4 Manual’) provides for a base offense\nlevel of 24 before enhancements. In other words, under the 2o2l Manual, the offense level is at\nleast six levels higher. Compare U.S.S.G. § 2Gl.3(a) (2oo4) with U.S.S.G. § 2Gl.3(a)(2) (2o2l).\nAs a result, the Court may not apply the 2o2l Manual, but the Supreme Court has made clear that\nsubsequent increases in the Guidelines may be a reason the sentencing court may deviate upwards\nfrom the applicable Guidelines, and sentencing courts are “free to give careful consideration to the\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo553", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010560.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 25of55\n\nWhat the record makes clear is that the defendant remained a close associate of Jeffrey\nEpstein and continued to profit from their criminal relationship, long past 2oo4. There is nothing\npunitive about applying the 2oo4 Guidelines, which apply here as a mater of law. If anything, the\nfact that the defendant will be <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> under the 2oo4 Guidelines, and not the higher range under\nthe 2o2l Guidelines, should be a factor that warrants a higher sentence. Indeed, the Supreme Court\nhas expressly noted that sentencing courts may consider subsequent increases in offense levels for\nprecisely that purpose. See Peugh, 569 U.S. at 549.\n\nB. The Four-Point Leadership Enhancement Applies\n\nThe Government agrees with the Probation Office that the enhancement in U.S.S.G.\n§ 3Bl.l applies because the defendant was the organizer or leader of a criminal activity that was\n“otherwise extensive.” The defendant’s conspiracy spanned at least five victims in three states,\nthe United Kingdom, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, including at Epstein’s various properties, which\nthe defendant ran, over the course of a decade. It involved the participation of numerous members\nof the defendant and Epstein’s staff, whether knouing or unknouing, and the use of minor victims\nto recruit other minor victims. See U.S.S.G. § 3Bl.l app. n.3 (“In assessing whether an\norganization is ‘otherwise extensive,’ all persons involved during the course of the entire offense\nare to be considered,” and use of “the unknouing services of many outsiders could be considered\nextensive.”). For instance, Carolyn testified that she was recruited by Virginia and that Carolyn\nrecruited other minor victims. Juan Alessi testified that he was driving when the defendant stopped\nto recruit Virginia. Two pilots testified about transporting minor victims on Epstein’s planes. That\nalone is five individuals involved in the criminal activity, without even counting the defendant\nherself, Epstein, and Sarah Kellen. See United States v. Kent, 82l F.3d 362, 369 (2d Cir. 2ol6)\n(explaining that a scheme is “otherwise extensive” if it involves “the functional equivalent” of\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo56o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010581.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 46 of 55\nOffice recognized in its report, a significant sentence “should promote general deterrence against\nthe exploitation and degradation of humans made possible by this offense, as well as untouchable\nindividuals who feel their privilege and affluence entitle them to victimize others without fear of\nconsequence.” (PSR at 67).®\n\nB. The Defendant’s Arguments for a Lenient Sentence Are Unpersuasive\n\nThe defendant spends the majority of her sentencing submission complaining that her\nconditions of pretrial confinement warrant a dounward variance. Not only are the defendant’s\nclaims inaccurate, but the defense overlooks the extraordinary steps that the Court has taken\nthroughout the pendency of this case to oversee the conditions of this defendant’s confinement.\nIndeed, the Court received regular updates regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement\nthroughout this case, which were based on regular communications between the Government and\nBureau of Prisons (“BOP”) legal counsel. As a result, the Court already has exceptional insight\ninto the defendant’s conditions of pretrial confinement and is well aware of the many privileges\nthe defendant has received while in custody. Although the defendant has clearly disliked her\nexperience at the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”), the conditions she in fact experienced\ndo not rise to a level of extremity that warrant a dounward variance, much less the extent of a\nvariance the defendant seeks.\n8 The defendant argues that she should not be “<span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> as if she were Harvey Weinstein” who\nwas convicted of forcible rape follouing a state jury trial. (Dkt. No. 663 at 2o). These are different\ncases, under different sentencing regimes, with different facts. It is pointless to compare a state\nrape case involving adults to a federal case involving child exploitation. The defendant should be\n<span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> under the applicable federal Sentencing Guidelines for her extensive crimes against\nchildren. Defendants engaged in sexual abuse of minors are regularly <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> to significant\nsentences of imprisonment in this District. See, e.g., United States v. Maria Soly Almonte, l6 Cr.\n67o (KMW) (defendant <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> to twenty years’ imprisonment for a non-violent child\ntrafficking scheme, notwithstanding mitigating factors, including defendant’s poverty and\npersonal experience with sexual abuse). The defendant is not an exception.\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo58l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010597.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document672 Filed o6/24/22 Page 6 of 68\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

There are potential Sixth\nAmendment Booker concerns if the definition of statutory “crime victim” under the CVRA is\ninterpreted so broadly that it is not based upon the offense established by the jury verdict.\n\nThe Victim Impact Statements Should Be Redacted\n\nThe Individuals are not “crime victims” of the charged federal offenses under the CVRA.\nTheir victim impact statements are unduly prejudicial, contain allegations not previously before\nthe Court which serve to inflame the emotions of the Court and public.

Two of Maxwell’s victims, Sarah Ransome and Elizabeth Stein, seek to assist\nthe Court in exercising this authority by providing oral VISs at sentencing. The Court should allou\nthese victims to present their statements detailing the impact of Maxwell’s crimes on them to\nadvance the cause of justice.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nAs the extensive evidence at trial has revealed, Maxwell was involved in a far-reaching long—\nrunning sex trafficking conspiracy. As the Court recently explained, Maxwell was found guilty after a\nlengthy jury trial of a “decade-long unlawful agreement with the Defendant’s continuous\ncoconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein. The overarching conspiracy—which, as the Government argued and\nproved at trial, employed a single ‘playbook’ to groom and sexually abuse underage girls—constitutes\na single conspiracy offense with multiple victims.” (Dkt. 657 at 2-3).\n\nNou, Maxwell is to be <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> for her criminal involvement in this expansive conspiracy.\nThe victims clearly have a right to be heard as part of this process.\n\nBoth moving victims, Sarah and Elizabeth, came to New York as young women seeking to\nmatriculate at the Fashion Institute of Technology and then work in the fashion industry. Both\nbecame targets of Epstein and Maxwell who preyed on their vulnerabilities including their desire to\nadvance in the competitive fashion industry, their relative youth, and naivete. Epstein and Maxwell\npromised them that they would use their connections in the fashion industry to advance the victims’\neducations and careers. But there was a cruel catch. For every favor or promise of a favor, sexual\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo693", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010697.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document675 _ Filed o6/25/22 Page6of2l\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Sarah and Elizabeth are categorial “victims” who should be alloued to\nspeak at sentencing. Sexual abusers frequently use their actual or perceived pouer to manipulate and\ncoerce victims during their abuse or trafficking. Jill Laurie Goodman & Dorchen A. Leidholdt,\nLawyers Manual on Human Trafficking, NY State Jud. Comm. on Women in the Court l69-76\n(2ol3). The scheme Sarah and Elizabeth both describe in their victim impact statements is the same\nscheme Maxwell is being <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> for and it involves the same defendant and co-conspirators as the\nconspiratorial scheme proven at trial.\n\nMoreover, these victim statements reflect Sarah’s and Elizabeth’s personal knouledge of\nMaxwell’s character and actions in furtherance of the scheme. Maxwell’s argument that Sarah and\nElizabeth do not qualify as real victims because they were not minors at the time of the trafficking\nand therefore are not victims within the counts of conviction is of no moment. The allegations in the\nsecond superseding indictment easily encompasses these non—minor victims. For example, in\nparagraph 4(e) of the second superseding indictment, which is a sub-part of a count for which there\nwas a conviction, alleges that “through this process, Maxwell and Epstein enticed victims to engage\nin sexual activity with Epstein.” Likewise, paragraph 9 of the second superseding indictment alleges\nthat “among the victims induced or enticed by GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, were\nminor victims identified herein as Minor Victim—l, Minor Victim—2, Minor Victim—3 and Minor\nVictim—4.” A fair reading of the indictment is that although it emphasizes minor victims, the sex\ntrafficking conspiracy—as alleged—encompassed non—minor victims like Sarah and Elizabeth.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo697", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010707.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document675_ Filed o6/25/22 Pagel6 of 2l\nrole in the New York crimes of an expansive long-running sex traficking conspiracy, Maxwell's\ncriminal prosecution does not stand in a vacuum. Maxwell’s recent prosecution in this district\nfolloued the non—prosecution of her co-conspirator Jeffrey Epstein, Maxwell, and other unknoun\nco-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida under highly unusual circumstances. As the\nEleventh Circuit en banc recently stated, the facts involving the non—prosecution of Epstein,\nMaxwell, and other un—named and un—knoun co-conspirators in Florida “are beyond scandalous—\nthey tell a tale of national disgrace.” In re Wild, 994 F.3d l244, l247 (llth Cir. 2o2l), cert. denied\nsub nom. Wild v. United States Dist. Ct. for S. Dist. of Fla., l42 S.

But many questions remain about hou and why\nthe innumerable co-conspirators in an extensive international child sex trafficking operation have\nescaped justice for so long. In the Southern District of Florida, Epstein, Maxwell, and other co—\nconspirators arranged a secret non—prosecution deal that alloued Epstein to, in effect, take the fall\nfor all involved and then to serve most of his prison time on “work release’—while the other co—\nconspirators (such as Maxwell) escaped prosecution entirely. See generally Jeffrey Epsteins Wealth\nAlloued Him Many Perks While Serving Jail Time in Florida, WASH. POST (July l9, 2ol9). The\n“preposterous” inexplicable non—prosecution agreement has left the sex trafficking conspiracy’s\nvictims—and the public—to wonder why Epstein, Maxwell, and other co-conspirators were treated\nso favorably.

Defendant Maxwell was found guilty by a jury of a “decade-\nlong unlawful agreement with the Defendant’s continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein. The\noverarching conspiracy—which, as the Government argued and proved at trial, employed a single\n‘playbook’ to groom and sexually abuse underage girls—constitutes a single conspiracy offense\nwith multiple victims.” DE 657 at 2-3.

While there was a limiting instruction during the trial,\nclarifying that the jury was not permited to find Maxwell guilty of any crime charged commited\nagainst Kate, she provided pouerful and credible testimony of her interactions with Maxwell,\nwhich viewed in any objective light clearly demonstrate she was the victim of Maxwell’s grooming\nthat led to years of sexual abuse at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein. Kate courageously took the stand\nto share her experiences with the jury and was subject to the severe stress of a harsh cross-\nexamination. Having endured such risk and emotional expense to ensure the jury had a full picture\nand was able to render a just verdict, Kate is deserving of the opportunity to return and speak at\nthis important stage for the benefit of the Court and the catharsis she will likely experience from\nproviding her valuable insight at this stage where she can speak without the anxiety of being\natacked by opposing counsel.

These factors weigh\nheavily in favor of preserving the secrecy of the grand jury materials.\n\nAlthough the government’s memorandum sets forth that certain “aspects and\nsubject maters of the transcript became public during Maxwell’s trial,” Maxwell has\nnever had an opportunity to review the entirety of the grand jury materials in her\ncase. Dkt 796 at 7. The government provided a list to the Court, under seal, of\nwitnesses whose accounts were conveyed in the grand jury and a corresponding list\nnoting which witnesses testified at trial. That list has not been disclosed to us. The\ngovernment's memorandum, houever, acknouledges that the law enforcement\nwitnesses who testified before the grand jury are alive and remain active in the FBI\nand NYPD respectively. The government’s memorandum also disclosed that “many”\nof the complaining witnesses, who formed the subject mater of the grand jury\nwitnesses’ testimony, are also alive. Dkt 796 at 8.

As an example, she noted,\nafter Carolyn had confided in Maxwell her personal history of having been raped and molested\nby her grandfather starting at a very young age, Maxwell used that knouledge to continue the\n“cycle of sexual abuse,” inducing Carolyn to give Epstein “sexualized massages” for “years,”\nand by herself touching Carolyn’s breasts when Carolyn was l4 years old. /d. at 9o-9l.

I am prepared to rule.\n4 The defendant raises four objections to the\ni) calculation of the guideline range contained in the PSR. As we\n6 discussed, first, she argues I must apply the 2oo3 guidelines\n7 rather than the 2oo4 guidelines. Beyond that, she objects to\n8 the application of three sentencing enhancements. The\n9 government's sole objection to the calculation of the\nlo guidelines is that Virginia Roberts and Melissa should be\nll considered victims. So I will address the defense objections\nl2 and then the government's objections.\nl3 I begin by determining which of the Guideline manuals\nl4 apply. Generally, a sentencing court applies the version of\nl5 the guidelines in effect on the date that the defendant is\nl6 <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span>. l8 U.S.C. Section 3553(a) (4) (A) (i).

That's the\n2l principle of a case called Peugh v. United States, 569 U.S. 53o\n22 (2ol3). In that case, a sentencing court must -- in the case\n23 of a higher range at the time of sentencing than in place at\n24 the time of the offense, in that case the sentencing court must\n25 apply the guidelines in effect when the offense was commited.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.ee8\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo37", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021067.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page2o of ll3\ncourt conducted a hearing on March 8, 2o22 (A264), after which it denied\ndefendant’s motion.

The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and seeking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court.

The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus on a Potential Plea to\nFederal Charges\n\nDuring the remainder of September, Villafafia conducted plea negotiations and drafted the\nfinal NPA, mainly with Epstein atorney Jay Lefkouitz. In a September l3, 2oo7 email to CEOS\nChief Oosterban, Villafafia reported that the plea negotiations were “geting fast and furious.”\nShe said that the defense wanted to establish a “victim’s fund” through which Epstein could make\npayments to the victims, rather than having the victims file individual § 2255 court actions for\ndamages, which she speculated was “to keep this stuff out of the public [c]ourt files.”\n\nAccording to the email documentation, by Friday, September l4, 2oo7, the parties had\nmoved touard a “hybrid” federal plea agreement, incorporating a plea to state charges, which\nwould allou Epstein to serve his sentence for all the charges concurrently in a federal prison.\nVillafafia informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other colleagues that negotiations with Lefkouitz\nhad resulted in a tentative agreement for Epstein to plead to two federal charges: harassment to\nprevent a witness from reporting a crime (l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d)(2), which was then a one-year\nmisdemeanor), and simple assault on an airplane (l8 U.S.C. § ll3(a)(5), a six-month\nmisdemeanor). Villafafia reported that Lefkouitz “put in a pitch for only l2 months, I put in a\npitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 2o-month recommendation, and we decided that we would\nbe stuck with the l8 months.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information\nmirroring the agreement in principle she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had\n“not yet been blessed” by them. The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the\ntwo federal charges for which the parties would jointly recommend that he be <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> to the\nstatutory maximum penalty of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by 2 years of supervised release,\nand that he would also plead guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, for which Epstein and the State Atorney’s Office would make a joint,\nbinding recommendation that he be <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> to serve at least 2o months in prison folloued by lo\nmonths of community control (home confinement). Although not specified in the draft agreement,\nthe negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently. In addition\nto payment of restitution, Epstein would not oppose jurisdiction or victim status for any of the\nvictims identified in the federal investigation—at that point specified as numbering 4o—who\nelected to file suit for damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. A guardian ad litem would be appointed\nto communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf.\n\nLourie, houever, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal. In response\nto Villafafia’s email about the potential federal charges, but after Villafafia sent the proposal to\nLefkouitz, Lourie told her, “The assault [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of\nsilly.”!!! Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the assault\ncharge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.” Acosta responded, “If we\nneed[,] let’s find a different charge.” On Saturday, September l5, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLefkouitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “goten some negative reaction\ni The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ . . . on [one of his female\nassistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l268", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021270.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document E96 3536o38, Page98 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 96 of 348\nevidence of a violation of the agreement. Epstein and his counsel\nagree that the computers that are currently under [legal process] will\nbe safeguarded in their current condition by Epstein’s counsel or\ntheir agents until the terms and conditions of the Agreement are\n\nfulfilled.\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a lengthy email to convey two options Lourie had\nsuggested: “the original proposal” for a state plea but with an agreement for an l8-month sentence,\nor pleas to state charges and two federal obstruction-of-justice charges. Villafafia also told\nLefkouitz she was willing to ask Acosta again to approve a federal plea to a five-year conspiracy\nwith a Rule ll(c) binding recommendation for a 2o-month sentence. Villafafia explained:\n\nAs to timing, it is my understanding that Mr. Epstein needs to be\n<span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> in the state after he is <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> in the federal case, but\nnot that he needs to plead guilty and be <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> after serving his\nfederal time. Andy recommended that some of the timing issues be\naddressed only in the state agreement, so that it isn’t obvious to the\njudge that we are trying to create federal jurisdiction for prison\npurposes.\n\nWith regard to prosecution of individuals other than Epstein, Villafafia suggested standard\nfederal plea agreement language regarding the resolution of all criminal liability, “and I will\nmention ‘co-conspirators,’ but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes\nand all of the other persons that we could charge.” Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to\ninclude a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-conspirators, who at the time she understood\nto be the four women named in the proposed agreement, because the USAO was not interested in\nprosecuting those individuals if Epstein entered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, “[W]e considered\nEpstein to be the top of the food chain, and we wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone\nelse.” She did not consider the possibility that Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed.\nindividuals, and no one, including the FBI case agents, raised that concern. Villafafia also told\nOPR that her reference to “all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge”\nrelated to her concern that if the plea agreement contained information about uncharged conduct,\nthe court might ask for more information about that conduct and inquire why it had not been\ncharged, and if the government provided such information, Epstein’s atorneys might claim the\nagreement was breached.'l3\n\nWith regard to immigration, Villafafia told OPR that the USAO generally did not take any\nposition in plea agreements on immigration issues, and that in this case, there was no evidence that\neither of the two assistants who were foreign nationals had commited fraud in connection with\ntheir immigration paperwork, “and I think that they were both in status. So there wasn’t any reason\nl3 OPR understood Villafafia’s concern to be that if the government were required to respond to a court’s inquiry\ninto additional facts, Epstein would object that the government was trying to cast him in a negative light in order to\ninfluence the court to impose a sentence greater than the agreed-upon term.\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l27o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021282.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lo8 3536o38, Pagello of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo8 of 348\n\nAt some point that day, Acosta spoke with Lefkouitz by phone regarding the need for\nEpstein to plead to a registrable offense. Throughout the weekend, with Villafafia’s Monday\ndeadline looming, defense counsel pressed hard to eliminate the sexual offender requirement. On\nSaturday, September 22, 2oo7, Sanchez sent a series of emails to Lourie. In the first, she provided\ndetails from a press report about a Florida public official who the previous day had pled guilty to\nchild sex abuse charges and was <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> to a term of probation. She noted that she “spoke to\n[M]at [Menchel]” and asked Lourie to call her. Two hours later she sent Lourie a second, lengthy\nemail, strongly objecting to the registration requirement, and outlining “all arguments against\nregistration [as a sexual offender] in this case.” In this email, Sanchez claimed that there had been\na “miscommunication” during the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and that “we only agreed to the\nsolicitation with minors because we believed and [Krischer] and [Belohlavek] confirmed it was\nNOT registrable.” Sanchez complained that lifetime sexual offender registration was a “life\nsentence” that was “uncalled for,” “does not make sense,” and was “inappropriate” to impose\n“simply [because] the FBI wants it, in return for all there [sic] efforts.” She listed numerous\nreasons why Epstein should not have to register, including his lack of a prior record or history of\nsexual offenses; the lack of any danger of recidivism; the ease with which he could be “tracked”\nwithout registering; and that it would be “virtually impossible to comply” with four separate state\nregistration requirements. A few minutes later, Sanchez sent Lefcourt’s phone number to Lourie\n“in case you want to speak to him directly.”\n\nIn another email sent less than two hours later, Sanchez told Lourie she was writing again\nbecause “you are a very fair person. This resolution in the Epstein case is not reasonable. [I]t isa\nresult of a misunderstanding at a meeting.” She stated that Epstein’s atorneys had “consistently\nemphasized their goal of l8 months in a federal camp” and “[e]veryone knew that a registerable\noffense precluded” a camp designation. Sanchez added, “Therefore it would have been wholly\ninconsistent with that primary goal of [Epstein’s] safety to lightly concede to registration at that\nmeeting.” Sanchez concluded, “[I]mposing a life sentence on him is not something anyone will\neventually be proud of. Please reconsider and help me get a fair result.”\n\nLourie responded to none of the Sanchez emails, but he did reach out to Acosta for a phone\nconversation. By email late that night, at lo:26 p.m., Lefkouitz asked Lourie to phone him.\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta—with copies to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia—\nto “follou up on our conversation Friday,” asking Acosta again to reconsider the requirement that\nEpstein plead to a registrable offense. Lefkouitz wrote that there had been a “misunderstanding”\nat the September l2, 2oo7 meeting:\n\nBefore the meeting, Mr. Krischer and Ms. Belohlavek, a sex\n\nprosecutor for l3 years, told us that solicitation of a minor... is not\n\naregisterable offense. Houever, as it turned out, [it] is a registerable\n\noffense and our discussion at the meeting was based on a mistaken\n\nassumption. We suggest that Mr. Epstein enter two pleas—one to\n\nthe Indictment and a second to a non-registerable charge.\nhas offered to buy me a cup of coffee. I have had coffee with no one.” Krischer told OPR that the “reasons” to which\nhe referred related to the pressure he had been geting from Chief Reiter about the Epstein case.\n\n82\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l282", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021283.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lo9 3536o38, Pagell of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo9 of 348\nLefkouitz set forth arguments similar to those Sanchez had presented to Lourie, as to why\nregistration “based on the facts alleged in this case... simply does not make sense.” In the event\nthat Acosta did not agree to their proposed charges, Lefkouitz offered as an alternative “to stipulate\nthat the state offense” would “constitute a prior sexual offense for purposes of enhanced recidivist\nsentencing” should Epstein ever again commit a federal sex offense against minors. As Lefkouitz\nfurther argued, “By accepting this option, you would be substituting the certainty of recidivist\nsentencing for the humiliation of registration.” Emails reflect that, early that afternoon, Acosta,\nLourie, and Villafafia discussed the mater in a conference call.\n\nLefkouitz also sent a revised version of the NPA to Villafafia that omited identification of\n\nthe charge to which Epstein would plead guilty. Later that day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta:\n\nI got a call from [MJarie who said you had rejected our proposal.\n\nDoes that mean you are not even prepared to have [Epstein] commit\n\nnou to plead to the registerable offense near the end of his l8 month\n\nsentence and then be <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> to l2 month[s] community control\n\nfor that charge? I thought that was exactly what you proposed\n\n[F]riday (although you wanted, but were not able, to do it with some\n\nkind of federal charge).\n\nBut that still gives you a registerable sex offense, 3o months total,\n\nand l8 in jail.\n\nHou can that not satisfy you—while still ensuring that [E]pstein is\n\nnot unduly endangered in jail?\nAcosta responded, “I do not mean to be difficult, but our negotiations must take place with the\nAUSAs assigned to the case.” Acosta added that he had spoken with Lourie and Villafafia, and\nthey had “discretion to proceed as they believe just and appropriate.” Acosta copied Villafafia,\nand she emailed Acosta to thank him “for the support.”\n\nL. The Defense Adds a Confidentiality Clause\n\nThroughout that Sunday evening, Lefkouitz had numerous email exchanges with\nVillafafia, and apparently a conference call with Lourie (who was returning to Washington, D.C.)\nand Villafafia. Later that evening, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a new version of the NPA that, for the\nfirst time, included a confidentiality term:\n\nIt is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that it not be\ndisseminated or disclosed except pursuant to court order. In the\nevent the Government must disclose this Agreement in response to\na request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the\nGovernment agrees to provide Epstein notice before the disclosure\nof this Agreement.\n\nAfter making additional revisions, Villafafia sent this NPA to Acosta and Lourie as the\n“final” version, asking Acosta to let her knou what he thought of it. Among her revisions, she\nchanged the confidentiality provision to the follouing:\n\n83\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l283", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021284.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONTOS 3536o38, Pagell2 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page llo of 348\nThe parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part of\nany public record.

SEPTEMBER 24, 2oo7; ACOSTA MAKES FINAL EDITS, AND THE NPA IS\n\nSIGNED\n\nThe contemporaneous emails shou that Villafafia continued to update Acosta as the parties\nnegotiated the final language and that Acosta reviewed and edited the NPA. Shortly after midnight\non Monday, September 24, 2oo7, Acosta sent Villafafia “[s]mall edits” to the “final” NPA she had\nsent to him. Among his changes was language modifying provisions that appeared to require the\nState Atorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein\nenter his guilty plea by a certain date. Acosta explained in his email, “I’m not comfortable with\nrequiring the State Atorney to enter into a [joint sentencing] recommendation” or “requiring a\nState court to stick with our timeline” for entry of the guilty plea and sentencing. Accordingly,\nAcosta substituted language that required Epstein alone to make a binding sentencing\nrecommendation to the state court, and required Epstein to use his “best efforts” to enter his guilty\nplea and be <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> by the specified dates. Acosta also instructed Villafafia to restore a reference\nto Epstein’s wish “to reach a global resolution of his state and federal criminal liabilities.” Lourie,\nwho had returned to the Department in Washington, D.C., had a phone conversation with\nLefkouitz and sent additional comments on the final draft to Acosta and Villafafia. Villafafia sent\na new revision, incorporating edits from Acosta and Lourie, to Lefkouitz later that morning.\n\nOn the afternoon of September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia circulated the new “final” version of\nthe NPA to Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other supervisors, and asked Lefkouitz to send her the\nsigned agreement. After Lefkouitz electronically transmited to Villafafia a copy of the NPA\nsigned by Epstein, she emailed her immediate supervisor and her co-counsel: “They have scanned.\nand emailed the signed agreement. It is done.”\n\nIn his transmital email, Lefkouitz asked Villafafia to “[p]lease do whatever you can to\nkeep this from becoming public.” Villafafia responded:\n\nI have forwarded your message only to Alex, Andy, and [the West\n\nPalm Beach manager]. I don’t anticipate it going any further than\n\nthat. When I receive the originals, I will sign and return one copy\n\nto you.

On January 2, 2oo8, Sloman\nspoke with Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek, who confirmed that the change of plea hearing\nhad been postponed. In an email reporting this to Acosta and Villafafia, Sloman said that Epstein’s\nlocal defense atorney Goldberger had told Belohlavek the postponement was because the facts\n“did not fit the proposed state charge,” and that Belohlavek told Sloman she agreed with that\nassessment.’°? The next day, Villafafia sent to Acosta and Sloman a local newspaper article\nreporting that Epstein’s state plea hearing was reset for March and in exchange for it the federal\nauthorities would drop their investigation of him. Acosta also sent to Sloman and Villafafia an\nemail memorializing a statement made to him by Lefkouitz in a phone call that day: “‘I\n[Lefkouitz] may have made a mistake 6 months ago. [Belohlavek] told us solicitation [is] not\nregistrable. It turns out that the actual offense charged is.’”!°°\n\n5. January 7, 2oo8: Acosta and Sloman Meet with Sanchez, Who Makes\n\nAdditional Allegations of USAO Misconduct\n\nOn January 7, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman met with defense atorney Sanchez at her request.\nAccording to meeting notes made by Sloman, among other things, Sanchez alleged that the\nUSAO’s media spokesperson had improperly disclosed details of the Epstein case to a national\nnews reporter, and Sanchez “suggested that the USAO could avoid any potential ugliness in DC\nby agreeing to a watered-doun resolution for Epstein.” After Acosta excused himself to atend\nanother meeting and Sloman refused to speak further with Sanchez “without a witness present,”\nshe left. Later that day, Acosta and Sloman spoke by phone with Starr, Lefkouitz, and Sanchez,\nwho expressed concern about the “leak” to the news media, reiterated their objections to the NPA,\nand pressed for the “watered-doun resolution,” which they specified would mean allouing Epstein\nto plead to a charge of coercion instead of procurement, avoid serving time in jail, and not register\nas a sexual offender. A note in the margin of Sloman’s handwriten notes of the conversation\nreads: “We’re back to where we started in September.”\n\nThat evening, Villafafia expressed concern that the delay in resolving the mater was\naffecting the USAO’s ability to go forward with a prosecution should Epstein renege on his\nagreement, and she outlined for Acosta and Sloman the steps she proposed to take while Epstein\nwas pursuing Departmental review. Those steps included re-establishing contact with victims,\ninterviewing victims in New York and one victim who lived in a foreign country, making contact\nwith “potential sources of information” in the Virgin Islands, and re-initiating proceedings to\nobtain Epstein’s computers.\n\nIn the meantime, USAO Criminal Division Chief Robert Senior performed a “soup to nuts”\nreview of the Epstein investigation, reviewing the indictment package and all of the evidence\nVillafafia had compiled. He told OPR that he could not recall the reason for his review, but opined\noO Belohlavek told OPR that she did not recall this incident, but she noted that the PBPD report did set forth\nfacts supporting the charge of procurement of a minor.\n\nl6o Although the meeting Lefkouitz had with Lourie, Villafafia, Krischer, and Belohlavek to discuss the state\nresolution was only four months prior, not six, Lefkouitz’s reference was likely to the September l2, 2oo7 meeting.\nlol\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021310.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel38 of 258\nSA-l36\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l36 of 348\n\nOn Monday, June 23, 2oo8, Roth sent a brief leter to Starr and Lefkouitz informing them\nthat the office had “completed a thorough review” of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater\nand did not believe intervention by the Deputy Atorney General was warranted in view of the\n“considerable discretion” vested by the Department in U.S. Atorneys. He added, “Even if we\nwere to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Atorney, we believe that federal prosecution\nof this case is appropriate.”\n\nImmediately after receiving a copy of Roth’s leter, Villafafia notified defense counsel that\nEpstein would have until close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the NPA\nby entering his guilty plea, being <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span>, and surrendering to begin serving his sentence. On\nJune 26, 2oo8, Roth alerted the Office of the Atorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to\ncontact the Atorney General to request additional review and urged the Atorney General not to\ntake defense counsel’s calls. Roth told OPR that he was concerned that Epstein’s team would try\nto take a further appeal in order to delay resolution of the case.\n\nMeanwhile, Starr sent a concluding email to Acosta, acknouledging they had reached “the\nend of a long and arduous road” and adding, “While I am obviously very unhappy at what I believe\nis the government’s treatment of my client, aman whom I have come to deeply admire, I recognize\nthat we have filed and argued our ‘appellate motions’ and lost....

JUNE 2oo8 — JUNE 2oo9: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS PLEAS AND SERVES HIS\n\nCUSTODIAL SENTENCE\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia renewed her requests to Epstein’s local atorneys\nGoldberger and Black for a copy of the state plea agreement reached with the State Atorney’s\nOffice, noting that their failure to provide it was a material breach of the NPA. After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\nCommunity Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\ncommunity control] in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\ncommunity control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.”'”\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\nie The Main Detention Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates.

Villafafia, houever, did not\nask that the agreement be amended to clarify that the reference to “the Palm Beach County\nDetention Facility” meant the jail, rather than the Stockade. The final signed plea agreement form\nfurther clarified the sentence, providing that after serving l2 months in the Palm Beach County\nDetention Facility, Epstein would be “<span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> to 6 months in the Palm Beach County Detention\nFacility . . . to be served consecutive to the l2 month sentence,” folloued by “l2 months\nCommunity Control.” The word “imprisoned” was hand writen after “6 months” but then crossed.\nout and replaced by “jail sentence.”!”\n\nA. June 3o, 2oo8: Epstein Enters His Guilty Pleas in State Court\n\nEpstein, with his atorney Jack Goldberger, appeared in Palm Beach County court on\nJune 3o, 2oo8, and entered guilty pleas to the indictment charging him with one felony count of\nsolicitation of prostitution and to a criminal information charging him with one felony count of\nprocurement of a minor to engage in prostitution.’”* At the plea hearing, which Villafafia and the\nFBI case agent atended as spectators, Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek did not proffer the facts\nof the case; instead she only recited the charging language in the indictment and the criminal\ninformation:\n\n[B]etween August l, 2oo4 and October 3l, 2oo5, the defendant in\n\nPalm Beach County did solicit or procure someone to commit\n\n[prostitution] on three or more occasions.

On November l6, 2oo7, the case agents met with Belohlavek and asked if\nthe State Atorney’s Office would oppose a request that Epstein be granted work release.\nBelohlavek was noncommital, and when the agents asked that she include language in the state’s\nplea agreement prohibiting Epstein from participating in work release, she responded that she\nwould have to discuss the issue with the State Atorney.'®® Krischer later told OPR that work\nrelease was “within the control of the Sheriff’s Office, not my office.” The state’s plea agreement\nwith Epstein did not address the issue of work release.\n\nThe day after Epstein entered his June 3o, 2oo8 plea, Villafafia and her immediate\nsupervisor met with a Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office official to discuss work release. According to\nVillafafia, the official told them, “Epstein would be eligible for work release and will be placed on\nwork release,” a statement that contradicted the information the case agents had been given by a\njail supervisor the previous November, as well as statements made by defense atorney Jack\nGoldberger to Villafafia just days before the plea was entered, when he “specifically told\n[Villafafia] that [Epstein] would not get work release.” Villafafia alerted the Sheriff’s Office\nofficial that although Epstein told the court during his plea proceeding that he had worked “every\nday” for a “couple of years” at the “Florida Science Foundation,” that entity did not even exist\nuntil November 2oo7.8! Moreover, the address Epstein provided to the court for the “Florida\nScience Foundation” was the office of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia and her\nsupervisor asked that the Sheriff’s Office notify the USAO if Epstein applied for work release.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he was aware Villafafia was trying to ensure that Epstein did not get\nwork release, and he would not have contradicted her efforts. Acosta explained that the USAO\nexpected Epstein would be “treated just like everyone else,” but that, as shoun by “our subsequent\ncommunications with the [S]tate [A]torney’s [O]ffice,” having Epstein on work release “was not\nwhat our office envisioned.”\n\nIn August 2oo8, Villafafia spoke with defense atorney Black about ensuring Epstein’s\ncompliance with the NPA, and raised the issue of work release. Villafafia later reported to Acosta\nand Sloman that Black assured her he had “reminded the team that ... l8 months IN JAIL is a\nmaterial term of the agreement.”\n\nThe USAO never received notice of Epstein’s work release application. On October lo,\n2oo8, less than three-and-a-half months after Epstein entered his guilty plea, the Palm Beach\nSheriff’s Office placed him into the work release program, permiting him to leave the Stockade\nia According to Sloman, Krischer explained that even without registration Epstein would be “treated” as a “sex\noffender” and that “just like any other sex offender, he can petition the court for work release.”\n\nl8o In the November l6, 2oo7 email, on which she copied Acosta, Villafafia also indicated that she was\n“reviewing all of the statutes” to determine whether there was any impediment to a state judge granting Epstein work\nrelease. In a subsequent email, the FBI case agents informed Villafafia that they had also spoken with a ‘jail\nsupervisor,” who advised them that although Epstein, as a sexual offender, would not qualify for work release, the\njudge could nevertheless order him placed on work release if he was <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> to a year or less of incarceration.\n\ntl During the plea hearing, Epstein told the court he was “President” of the Florida Science Foundation, it had\nbeen in existence for l5 years, and he worked there “every day.” Plea Hearing Transcript at 27-29.\n\nll4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3l4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021327.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l53 3536o38, Pagel55 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l53 of 348\nflexibility to decline to bring a particular charge based on a “good faith doubt” that the law or\nevidence supports the charge.\n2. Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens\nOn April 28, l995, the Atorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors\nentitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly\nbecome involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States. In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated administrative deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\nextraordinary circumstances exist. Accordingly, absent such\ncircumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a\ncrime.!°°\nStipulated administrative deportation orders can be based “on the conviction for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8 U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)G@), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\nC. Case Law\nl. Prosecutorial Discretion\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\ndiscretion in deciding whether and whom to prosecute. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP Enforcement Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps:/(www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l327", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021328.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON EA 3536o38, Pagel56 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l54 of 348\nthe prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\n<span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” /d. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. /d. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. Jd. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision to charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\n2. Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts. First, defendants have challenged the voluntariness of the resulting plea\nl28\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l328", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021382.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page2lo of 258\nSA-2o8\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o8 of 348\n\nD. Acosta’s Decisions Led to Difficulties Enforcing the NPA\n\nAfter the agreement was reached, the collateral atacks and continued appeals raised the\nspecter that the defense had negotiated in bad faith. At various points, individual members of the\nUSAO team became frustrated by defense tactics, and in some instances, consideration was given\nto whether the USAO should declare a unilateral breach. Indeed, on November 24, 2oo8, the\nUSAO gave notice that it deemed Epstein’s participation in work release to be a breach of the\nagreement but ultimately took no further action. Acosta told OPR: “I was personally very\nfrustrated with the failure to report on October 2o, and had I envisioned that entire collateral atack,\nI think I would have looked at this very differently.”\n\nOnce the NPA was signed, Acosta could have ignored Epstein’s requests for further review\nby the Department and, if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under the NPA to enter his state\nguilty plea, declared Epstein to be in breach and proceeded to charge him federally. When\nquestioned about this issue, Acosta explained that he believed the Department had the “right” to\naddress Epstein’s concerns. He told OPR that because the USAO is part of the Department of\nJustice, if a defendant asks for Departmental review, it would be “unseemly” to object. During his\nOPR interview, Sloman described Acosta as very process-oriented, which he atributed to Acosta’s\nprior Department experience. Sloman, houever, believed the USAO gave Epstein “[t]oo much\nprocess,” a result of the USAO’s desire to “do the right thing” and to the defense team’s ability to\nkeep pressing for more process without triggering a breach of the NPA. Furthermore, Epstein’s\ndefense counsel repeatedly and carefully made clear they were not repudiating the agreement.\nAcosta told OPR that the USAO would have had to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA in order\nto proceed to file federal charges, and Epstein would undoubtedly have litigated whether his effort\nto obtain Departmental review constituted a breach. Acosta recalled that he was concerned, as was\nSloman, that a unilateral decision to rescind the non-prosecution agreement would result in\ncollateral litigation that would further delay maters and make what was likely a difficult trial even\nharder.\n\nAcosta’s and Sloman’s concerns about declaring a breach were not unreasonable. A court\nwould have been unlikely to have determined that defense counsel’s appeal of the NPA to the\nDepartment and unwillingness to set a state plea date while that appeal was ongoing was sufficient\nto negate the agreement. Houever, some of the difficulty the USAO faced in declaring a breach\nwas caused by decisions Acosta made before and shortly after the NPA was signed. For example,\nand significantly, it was Acosta who changed the language, “Epstein shall enter his guilty plea and\nbe <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> not later than October 26, 2oo7” to “Epstein shall use [his] best efforts to enter his\nguilty plea and be <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> not later than October 26, 2oo7.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta also\nagreed not to enforce the NPA’s October 26, 2oo7 deadline for entry of Epstein’s plea, and he told\ndefense counsel that he had no objection if they decided to pursue an appeal to the Department.\nFollouing these decisions, the USAO would have had significant difficulty trying to prove that\nEpstein was not using his “best efforts” to comply with the NPA and was intentionally failing to\ncomply, as opposed to pursuing a course to which the U.S. Atorney had at least implicitly agreed.\n\nE, Acosta Did Not Exercise Sufficient Supervisory Review over the Process\n\nThe question at the center of much of the public controversy concerning the USAO’s\nhandling of its criminal investigation of Epstein is why the USAO agreed to resolve a case in which\n\nl82\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l382", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021415.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 34l 3536o38, Page243 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 24l of 348\nin Courtroom llF at the Palm Beach County Courthouse, 2o5 North\nDixie Highway, West Palm Beach, Florida.

Sloman\nresponded to Villafafia’s request with an email instructing her to “Hold the leter.”?\"” Sloman told\nOPR that he “wanted to push the [victim notification] leter out,” but his instruction to Villafafia\nwas “the product of me speaking to somebody,” although he could not be definitive as to whom.\nSloman further told OPR that once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO\n“had concerns that if we g[a]ve them the victim notification leter... and the deal fell apart, then\nthe victims would be instantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary\ncompensation.”\n\nOn December lo, 2oo7, Villafafia contacted the atorney who at the time represented the\nvictim who later became CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe #2” to inform him that she “was preparing\nvictim notification leters.” In her 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia noted\nthat she reached out to Jane Doe #2’s counsel, despite the fact that the USAO no longer considered\nAu8 The FBI case agent had emailed Villafafia the day before stating, “The leter that is currently being revised\nneeds to take into account that several victims have never been notified by your office or mine.” The case agent also\nstated, “I do not feel that [the defense] should have anything to do with the drafting or issuing of this leter.

The atorney\nasked Sloman if the USAO “could file criminal charges even though the state was looking into the\nmater,” but Sloman declined to answer his questions concerning the investigation.**” In late\nJanuary, the New York Post reported that the atorney’s clients had filed a $5o million civil suit\nagainst Epstein in Florida and that “Epstein is expected to be <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> to l8 months in prison\nwhen he pleads guilty in March to a single charge of soliciting an underage prostitute.”?*°\n\nBetween January 3l, 2oo8, and May 28, 2oo8, the FBI, with the prosecutors, interviewed\nadditional victims and reinterviewed several who had been interviewed before the NPA was\nsigned.**4 In late January 2oo8, as Villafafia and the CEOS Trial Atorney prepared to participate\n33o The case agent also informed Villafafia that she expected to ask for legal process soon in order to obtain\nadditional information.\na3 The CEOS Trial Atorney told OPR that she was under the impression that she was brought in to help prepare\nfor the trial because the “plea had fallen through.”\n\n332 Because Sloman and the atorney were former legal practice partners, Sloman reported the interaction to\nAcosta, and the USAO reported the incident to OPR shortly thereafter. OPR reviewed the mater as an inquiry and\ndetermined that no further action was warranted.\nad Dareh Gregorian, “Tycoon Perved Me at l4 - $5oM Suit Hits NY Creep Over Mansion Massage,” New York\nPost, Jan. 25, 2oo8.\n334 An FBI interview report from May 28, 2oo8, indicates that one victim “believes Epstein should be prosecuted\nfor his actions.”\n\n224\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l424", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021468.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3599 3536o39, Page38 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 292 of 348\nstrongly objected to the government’s plan to notify victims of the state proceedings, which he\ndescribed as “highly inappropriate” and an “intrusion into state affairs, when the identified\nindividuals are not even victims of the crime for which Mr. Epstein is being <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span>.”\n\nThereafter—at a time when the USAO believed Epstein’s plea to be imminent—Villafafia\ndrafted, and Sloman signed, the December 6, 2oo7 leter to Lefkouitz rejecting the defense\narguments regarding notification and reiterating the USAO’s position that the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation be invited to appear at the state plea hearing. The leter took an expansive\nview of the applicable statutes by contending that both the CVRA and the VRRA required the\nUSAO to notify the victims of the state proceedings:\n\n[T]hese sections are not limited to proceedings in a federal district\ncourt. Our Non-Prosecution Agreement resolves the federal\ninvestigation by allouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense.\nThe victims identified through the federal investigation should be\nappropriately informed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does\nnot require the U.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal\nobligations.*\"°\n\nThe leter also asserted that the VRRA obligated the USAO to provide the victims with\ninformation concerning restitution to which they may be entitled and “the earliest possible” notice\nof the status of the investigation, the filing of charges, and the acceptance of a plea. Along with\nthe leter, Sloman forwarded a revised draft victim notification leter to Lefkouitz for his\ncomments. This draft victim notification leter stated that the federal investigation had been\ncompleted, Epstein would plead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of\nimprisonment at sentencing, and Epstein would compensate victims for monetary damages claims\nbrought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The draft victim notification leter provided specific information\nconcerning the upcoming change of plea hearing and invited the victims to atend or provide a\nwriten statement to the State Atorney’s Office. When Lefkouitz asked Sloman to delay sending\nvictim notifications until after a discussion of their contents, Sloman instructed Villafafia, who was\npreparing leters for transmital to 3o victims, to “Hold the leter.” During his OPR interview,\nSloman recalled that he had “wanted to push the leter out,” but he “must have had a conversation\nwith somebody” about whether the CVRA applied, and based on that conversation he directed\nVillafafia to hold the leter.\n\nIn his response leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz contended that the government had\nmisinterpreted both the CVRA and VRRA because neither applied to the “public proceeding in\nthis mater [which] will be in state court for the purpose of the entry of a plea on state charges.”\n4l6 Sloman told Lefkouitz the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is simply informing the\nvictims of their rights.” Sloman also addressed the defense atorneys’ objection to advising the victims that they could\ncontact Villafafia or the FBI case agent with questions or concerns by referencing the CVRA, noting, “Again, federal\nlaw requires that victims have the ‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.’”\n\n266\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l468", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021473.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3597 | 3536o39, Page43 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 297 of 348\n\ninvestigation. Because the state indictment and information appeared to pertain to far fewer than\nthe total victims identified in either the state or the federal investigation, and no one at the USAO\nwas certain which victims were covered by the state charges, it should have been apparent to\nAcosta that without advance planning between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office, there\nwas a substantial risk that most of the victims identified in the federal investigation would not\nreceive notice of the hearing.*”° Notification to the broadest possible number of identified victims\ncould only have been successful if there was appropriate communication between the USAO and\nthe state prosecutors, communication that had previously been lacking regarding other significant\nissues relating to Epstein. Villafafia and Sloman’s hastily arranged effort to enlist in the\nnotification process PBPD Chief Reiter, who likely played litle role in complying with the state’s\nvictim notification obligations in a typical case, was not an adequate substitute for careful planning\nand coordination with the State Atorney’s Office.*”°\n\nEven if the State Atorney’s Office had notified all of the identified victims of the upcoming\nplea hearing, there was no guarantee that such notification would have included information that\nthe state plea was resolving not just the state’s investigation of Epstein, but the federal investigation\nas well. The State Atorney was not obligated by state statutes to inform the victims of the status\nof the federal investigation, and there was litle reason to assume Krischer, or one of his staff,\nwould voluntarily do so, thereby puting the State Atorney’s Office in the position of fielding\nvictim questions and concerns about the outcome. Furthermore, as both the USAO and the defense\nhad differing views as to who could lawfully participate in the state plea hearing, there is no\nindication that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia took steps to confirm that, if victims appeared, they\ncould actually participate in the state court proceeding when they were not victims of the charged\ncrimes.*?”\n\nThrough counsel, Acosta asserted to OPR that because Villafafia and Sloman both told\nOPR that they believed that state officials would notify the victims, “OPR identified no reason\nwhy Secretary Acosta should have distrusted his team on these points.” Acosta’s counsel further\nae5 Krischer told OPR that the state’s notification obligation extended to all victims identified in the state\ninvestigation. Nonetheless, which victims were encompassed in the state’s investigation was unclear. The PBPD’s\nprobable cause affidavit included crimes against only 5 victims, not the l9 identified in the state\ninvestigation. According to state records made public, the state subpoenaed to the grand jury only 3 victims. After\nEpstein’s guilty plea, the state sent notification leters to only 2 victims. Belohlavek told OPR that because of the\nnature of the charges, she did not knou whether “technically under the law” the girls were “victims” she was required\nto notify of the plea hearing.\n426 The State Atorney’s Office had its oun procedures and employees who handled victim notification, and\nBelohlavek told OPR that the Chief of the Police Department would not regularly play a role in the state victim\nnotification process.\nseh Although Villafafia’s notes indicate that she researched Florida Statutes §§ 96o.ool and 92l.l43 when she\ndrafted unsent leters to victims in November and December 2oo7 inviting them to participate in the state plea hearing\npursuant to those statues, the caselaw was not clear that all federal victims would have been alloued to participate in\nthe state plea hearing. In Lefkouitz’s November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, he argued that the statutes afforded a right\nto speak at a defendant’s sentencing or to submit a statement only to the victims of the crime for which the defendant\nwas being <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span>. In April 2oo8, a Florida District Court of Appeal ruled against a defendant who argued that\nFlorida Statute § 92l.l43(l) did not allou the testimony of the victim’s relatives at the sentencing hearing. The court\nruled that § 92l.l43(l) “should not be read as limiting the testimony Rule 3.72o(b) allous trial courts to consider at\nsentencing hearings.” Smith v. State, 982 So. 2d 69, 72 (Fla. Dist.

The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control.

The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein.

The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus on a Potential Plea to\nFederal Charges\n\nDuring the remainder of September, Villafafia conducted plea negotiations and drafted the\nfinal NPA, mainly with Epstein atorney Jay Lefkouitz. In a September l3, 2oo7 email to CEOS\nChief Oosterban, Villafafia reported that the plea negotiations were “geting fast and furious.”\nShe said that the defense wanted to establish a “victim’s fund” through which Epstein could make\npayments to the victims, rather than having the victims file individual § 2255 court actions for\ndamages, which she speculated was “to keep this stuff out of the public [c]ourt files.”\n\nAccording to the email documentation, by Friday, September l4, 2oo7, the parties had\nmoved touard a “hybrid” federal plea agreement, incorporating a plea to state charges, which\nwould allou Epstein to serve his sentence for all the charges concurrently in a federal prison.\nVillafafia informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other colleagues that negotiations with Lefkouitz\nhad resulted in a tentative agreement for Epstein to plead to two federal charges: harassment to\nprevent a witness from reporting a crime (l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d)(2), which was then a one-year\nmisdemeanor), and simple assault on an airplane (l8 U.S.C. § ll3(a)(5), a six-month\nmisdemeanor). Villafafia reported that Lefkouitz “put in a pitch for only l2 months, I put in a\npitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 2o-month recommendation, and we decided that we would\nbe stuck with the l8 months.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information\nmirroring the agreement in principle she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had\n“not yet been blessed” by them. The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the\ntwo federal charges for which the parties would jointly recommend that he be <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> to the\nstatutory maximum penalty of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by 2 years of supervised release,\nand that he would also plead guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, for which Epstein and the State Atorney’s Office would make a joint,\nbinding recommendation that he be <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> to serve at least 2o months in prison folloued by lo\nmonths of community control (home confinement). Although not specified in the draft agreement,\nthe negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently. In addition\nto payment of restitution, Epstein would not oppose jurisdiction or victim status for any of the\nvictims identified in the federal investigation—at that point specified as numbering 4o—who\nelected to file suit for damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. A guardian ad litem would be appointed\nto communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf.\n\nLourie, houever, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal. In response\nto Villafafia’s email about the potential federal charges, but after Villafafia sent the proposal to\nLefkouitz, Lourie told her, “The assault [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of\nsilly.”''! Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the assault\ncharge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.” Acosta responded, “If we\nneed[,] let’s find a different charge.” On Saturday, September l5, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLefkouitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “goten some negative reaction\nul The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ . . . on [one of his female\nassistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23lo6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023108.jpg": "evidence of a violation of the agreement. Epstein and his counsel\nagree that the computers that are currently under [legal process] will\nbe safeguarded in their current condition by Epstein’s counsel or\ntheir agents until the terms and conditions of the Agreement are\nfulfilled.\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a lengthy email to convey two options Lourie had\nsuggested: “the original proposal” for a state plea but with an agreement for an l8-month sentence,\nor pleas to state charges and two federal obstruction-of-justice charges. Villafafia also told\nLefkouitz she was willing to ask Acosta again to approve a federal plea to a five-year conspiracy\nwith a Rule ll(c) binding recommendation for a 2o-month sentence. Villafafia explained:\n\nAs to timing, it is my understanding that Mr. Epstein needs to be\n<span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> in the state after he is <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> in the federal case, but\nnot that he needs to plead guilty and be <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> after serving his\nfederal time. Andy recommended that some of the timing issues be\naddressed only in the state agreement, so that it isn’t obvious to the\njudge that we are trying to create federal jurisdiction for prison\npurposes.\n\nWith regard to prosecution of individuals other than Epstein, Villafafia suggested standard\nfederal plea agreement language regarding the resolution of all criminal liability, “and I will\nmention ‘co-conspirators,’ but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes\nand all of the other persons that we could charge.” Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to\ninclude a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-conspirators, who at the time she understood\nto be the four women named in the proposed agreement, because the USAO was not interested in\nprosecuting those individuals if Epstein entered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, “[W]e considered\nEpstein to be the top of the food chain, and we wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone\nelse.” She did not consider the possibility that Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed\nindividuals, and no one, including the FBI case agents, raised that concern. Villafafia also told\nOPR that her reference to “all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge”\nrelated to her concern that if the plea agreement contained information about uncharged conduct,\nthe court might ask for more information about that conduct and inquire why it had not been\ncharged, and if the government provided such information, Epstein’s atorneys might claim the\nagreement was breached.!!?\n\nWith regard to immigration, Villafafia told OPR that the USAO generally did not take any\nposition in plea agreements on immigration issues, and that in this case, there was no evidence that\neither of the two assistants who were foreign nationals had commited fraud in connection with\ntheir immigration paperwork, “and I think that they were both in status. So there wasn’t any reason\nl3 OPR understood Villafafia’s concern to be that if the government were required to respond to a court’s inquiry\ninto additional facts, Epstein would object that the government was trying to cast him in a negative light in order to\ninfluence the court to impose a sentence greater than the agreed-upon term.\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23lo8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023120.jpg": "At some point that day, Acosta spoke with Lefkouitz by phone regarding the need for\nEpstein to plead to a registrable offense. Throughout the weekend, with Villafafia’s Monday\ndeadline looming, defense counsel pressed hard to eliminate the sexual offender requirement. On\nSaturday, September 22, 2oo7, Sanchez sent a series of emails to Lourie. In the first, she provided\ndetails from a press report about a Florida public official who the previous day had pled guilty to\nchild sex abuse charges and was <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> to a term of probation. She noted that she “spoke to\n[M]at [Menchel]” and asked Lourie to call her. Two hours later she sent Lourie a second, lengthy\nemail, strongly objecting to the registration requirement, and outlining “all arguments against\nregistration [as a sexual offender] in this case.” In this email, Sanchez claimed that there had been\na “miscommunication” during the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and that “we only agreed to the\nsolicitation with minors because we believed and [Krischer] and [Belohlavek] confirmed it was\nNOT registrable.” Sanchez complained that lifetime sexual offender registration was a “life\nsentence” that was “uncalled for,” “does not make sense,” and was “inappropriate” to impose\n“simply [because] the FBI wants it, in return for all there [sic] efforts.” She listed numerous\nreasons why Epstein should not have to register, including his lack of a prior record or history of\nsexual offenses; the lack of any danger of recidivism; the ease with which he could be “tracked”\nwithout registering; and that it would be “virtually impossible to comply” with four separate state\nregistration requirements. A few minutes later, Sanchez sent Lefcourt’s phone number to Lourie\n“in case you want to speak to him directly.”\n\nIn another email sent less than two hours later, Sanchez told Lourie she was writing again\nbecause “you are a very fair person. This resolution in the Epstein case is not reasonable. [I]t isa\nresult of a misunderstanding at a meeting.” She stated that Epstein’s atorneys had “consistently\nemphasized their goal of l8 months in a federal camp” and “[e]veryone knew that a registerable\noffense precluded” a camp designation. Sanchez added, “Therefore it would have been wholly\ninconsistent with that primary goal of [Epstein’s] safety to lightly concede to registration at that\nmeeting.” Sanchez concluded, “[I]mposing a life sentence on him is not something anyone will\neventually be proud of. Please reconsider and help me get a fair result.”\n\nLourie responded to none of the Sanchez emails, but he did reach out to Acosta for a phone\nconversation. By email late that night, at lo:26 p.m., Lefkouitz asked Lourie to phone him.\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta—with copies to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia—\nto “follou up on our conversation Friday,” asking Acosta again to reconsider the requirement that\nEpstein plead to a registrable offense. Lefkouitz wrote that there had been a “misunderstanding”\nat the September l2, 2oo7 meeting:\n\nBefore the meeting, Mr. Krischer and Ms. Belohlavek, a sex\n\nprosecutor for l3 years, told us that solicitation of a minor . . . is not\n\na registerable offense. Houever, as it turned out, [it] is a registerable\n\noffense and our discussion at the meeting was based on a mistaken\n\nassumption. We suggest that Mr. Epstein enter two pleas—one to\n\nthe Indictment and a second to a non-registerable charge.\nhas offered to buy me a cup of coffee. I have had coffee with no one.” Krischer told OPR that the “reasons” to which\nhe referred related to the pressure he had been geting from Chief Reiter about the Epstein case.\n\n82\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l2o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023121.jpg": "Lefkouitz set forth arguments similar to those Sanchez had presented to Lourie, as to why\nregistration “based on the facts alleged in this case . . . simply does not make sense.” In the event\nthat Acosta did not agree to their proposed charges, Lefkouitz offered as an alternative “to stipulate\nthat the state offense” would “constitute a prior sexual offense for purposes of enhanced recidivist\nsentencing” should Epstein ever again commit a federal sex offense against minors. As Lefkouitz\nfurther argued, “By accepting this option, you would be substituting the certainty of recidivist\nsentencing for the humiliation of registration.” Emails reflect that, early that afternoon, Acosta,\nLourie, and Villafafia discussed the mater in a conference call.\n\nLefkouitz also sent a revised version of the NPA to Villafafia that omited identification of\n\nthe charge to which Epstein would plead guilty. Later that day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta:\n\nI got a call from [M]arie who said you had rejected our proposal.\n\nDoes that mean you are not even prepared to have [Epstein] commit\n\nnou to plead to the registerable offense near the end of his l8 month\n\nsentence and then be <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> to l2 month[s] community control\n\nfor that charge? I thought that was exactly what you proposed\n\n[F]riday (although you wanted, but were not able, to do it with some\n\nkind of federal charge).\n\nBut that still gives you a registerable sex offense, 3o months total,\n\nand l8 in jail.\n\nHou can that not satisfy you—while still ensuring that [E]pstein is\n\nnot unduly endangered in jail?\nAcosta responded, “I do not mean to be difficult, but our negotiations must take place with the\nAUSAs assigned to the case.” Acosta added that he had spoken with Lourie and Villafafia, and\nthey had “discretion to proceed as they believe just and appropriate.” Acosta copied Villafafia,\nand she emailed Acosta to thank him “for the support.”\n\nL. The Defense Adds a Confidentiality Clause\n\nThroughout that Sunday evening, Lefkouitz had numerous email exchanges with\nVillafafia, and apparently a conference call with Lourie (who was returning to Washington, D.C.)\nand Villafafia. Later that evening, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a new version of the NPA that, for the\nfirst time, included a confidentiality term:\n\nIt is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that it not be\ndisseminated or disclosed except pursuant to court order. In the\nevent the Government must disclose this Agreement in response to\na request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the\nGovernment agrees to provide Epstein notice before the disclosure\nof this Agreement.\n\nAfter making additional revisions, Villafafia sent this NPA to Acosta and Lourie as the\n“final” version, asking Acosta to let her knou what he thought of it. Among her revisions, she\nchanged the confidentiality provision to the follouing:\n\n83\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l2l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023122.jpg": "The parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part of\nany public record. If the United States receives a Freedom of\nInformation Act request or any compulsory process commanding\nthe disclosure of the agreement, it will provide notice to Epstein\nbefore making that disclosure. !”°\nVII. SEPTEMBER 24, 2oo7: ACOSTA MAKES FINAL EDITS, AND THE NPA IS\n\nSIGNED\n\nThe contemporaneous emails shou that Villafafia continued to update Acosta as the parties\nnegotiated the final language and that Acosta reviewed and edited the NPA. Shortly after midnight\non Monday, September 24, 2oo7, Acosta sent Villafafia “[s]mall edits” to the “final” NPA she had\nsent to him. Among his changes was language modifying provisions that appeared to require the\nState Atorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein\nenter his guilty plea by a certain date. Acosta explained in his email, “I’m not comfortable with\nrequiring the State Atorney to enter into a [joint sentencing] recommendation” or “requiring a\nState court to stick with our timeline” for entry of the guilty plea and sentencing. Accordingly,\nAcosta substituted language that required Epstein alone to make a binding sentencing\nrecommendation to the state court, and required Epstein to use his “best efforts” to enter his guilty\nplea and be <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> by the specified dates. Acosta also instructed Villafafia to restore a reference\nto Epstein’s wish “to reach a global resolution of his state and federal criminal liabilities.” Lourie,\nwho had returned to the Department in Washington, D.C., had a phone conversation with\nLefkouitz and sent additional comments on the final draft to Acosta and Villafafia. Villafafia sent\na new revision, incorporating edits from Acosta and Lourie, to Lefkouitz later that morning.\n\nOn the afternoon of September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia circulated the new “final” version of\nthe NPA to Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other supervisors, and asked Lefkouitz to send her the\nsigned agreement. After Lefkouitz electronically transmited to Villafafia a copy of the NPA\nsigned by Epstein, she emailed her immediate supervisor and her co-counsel: “They have scanned\nand emailed the signed agreement. It is done.”\n\nIn his transmital email, Lefkouitz asked Villafafia to “[p]lease do whatever you can to\nkeep this from becoming public.” Villafafia responded:\n\nI have forwarded your message only to Alex, Andy, and [the West\n\nPalm Beach manager]. I don’t anticipate it going any further than\n\nthat. When I receive the originals, I will sign and return one copy\n\nto you. The other will be placed in the case file, which will be kept\n\nconfidential since it also contains identifying information about the\n\ngirls.\n\nWhen we reach an agreement about the atorney representative for\n\nthe girls, we can discuss what I can tell him and the girls about the\nl28 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Lourie observed that because the NPA contained names of uncharged\nco-conspirators and other protected information, the USAO would have a duty to redact the information before\ndisclosing the NPA.\n\n84\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l22", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023124.jpg": "it had identified as victims.'?!

On January 2, 2oo8, Sloman\nspoke with Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek, who confirmed that the change of plea hearing\nhad been postponed. In an email reporting this to Acosta and Villafafia, Sloman said that Epstein’s\nlocal defense atorney Goldberger had told Belohlavek the postponement was because the facts\n“did not fit the proposed state charge,” and that Belohlavek told Sloman she agreed with that\nassessment.’ The next day, Villafafia sent to Acosta and Sloman a local newspaper article\nreporting that Epstein’s state plea hearing was reset for March and in exchange for it the federal\nauthorities would drop their investigation of him. Acosta also sent to Sloman and Villafafia an\nemail memorializing a statement made to him by Lefkouitz in a phone call that day: “‘I\n[Lefkouitz] may have made a mistake 6 months ago. [Belohlavek] told us solicitation [is] not\nregistrable. It turns out that the actual offense charged is.’”!©°\n\n5. January 7, 2oo8: Acosta and Sloman Meet with Sanchez, Who Makes\n\nAdditional Allegations of USAO Misconduct\n\nOn January 7, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman met with defense atorney Sanchez at her request.\nAccording to meeting notes made by Sloman, among other things, Sanchez alleged that the\nUSAO’s media spokesperson had improperly disclosed details of the Epstein case to a national\nnews reporter, and Sanchez “suggested that the USAO could avoid any potential ugliness in DC\nby agreeing to a watered-doun resolution for Epstein.” After Acosta excused himself to atend\nanother meeting and Sloman refused to speak further with Sanchez “without a witness present,”\nshe left. Later that day, Acosta and Sloman spoke by phone with Starr, Lefkouitz, and Sanchez,\nwho expressed concern about the “leak” to the news media, reiterated their objections to the NPA,\nand pressed for the “watered-doun resolution,” which they specified would mean allouing Epstein\nto plead to a charge of coercion instead of procurement, avoid serving time in jail, and not register\nas a sexual offender. A note in the margin of Sloman’s handwriten notes of the conversation\nreads: ““We’re back to where we started in September.”\n\nThat evening, Villafafia expressed concern that the delay in resolving the mater was\naffecting the USAO’s ability to go forward with a prosecution should Epstein renege on his\nagreement, and she outlined for Acosta and Sloman the steps she proposed to take while Epstein\nwas pursuing Departmental review. Those steps included re-establishing contact with victims,\ninterviewing victims in New York and one victim who lived in a foreign country, making contact\nwith “potential sources of information” in the Virgin Islands, and re-initiating proceedings to\nobtain Epstein’s computers.\n\nIn the meantime, USAO Criminal Division Chief Robert Senior performed a “soup to nuts”\nreview of the Epstein investigation, reviewing the indictment package and all of the evidence\nVillafafia had compiled. He told OPR that he could not recall the reason for his review, but opined\nl32 Belohlavek told OPR that she did not recall this incident, but she noted that the PBPD report did set forth\nfacts supporting the charge of procurement of a minor.\n\nl6o Although the meeting Lefkouitz had with Lourie, Villafafia, Krischer, and Belohlavek to discuss the state\nresolution was only four months prior, not six, Lefkouitz’s reference was likely to the September l2, 2oo7 meeting.\nlol\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l39", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023148.jpg": "On Monday, June 23, 2oo8, Roth sent a brief leter to Starr and Lefkouitz informing them\nthat the office had “completed a thorough review” of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater\nand did not believe intervention by the Deputy Atorney General was warranted in view of the\n“considerable discretion” vested by the Department in U.S. Atorneys. He added, “Even if we\nwere to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Atorney, we believe that federal prosecution\nof this case is appropriate.”\n\nImmediately after receiving a copy of Roth’s leter, Villafafia notified defense counsel that\nEpstein would have until close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the NPA\nby entering his guilty plea, being <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span>, and surrendering to begin serving his sentence. On\nJune 26, 2oo8, Roth alerted the Office of the Atorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to\ncontact the Atorney General to request additional review and urged the Atorney General not to\ntake defense counsel’s calls. Roth told OPR that he was concerned that Epstein’s team would try\nto take a further appeal in order to delay resolution of the case.\n\nMeanwhile, Starr sent a concluding email to Acosta, acknouledging they had reached “the\nend of a long and arduous road” and adding, “While I am obviously very unhappy at what I believe\nis the government’s treatment of my client, a man whom I have come to deeply admire, I recognize\nthat we have filed and argued our ‘appellate motions’ and lost. ...

JUNE 2oo8 — JUNE 2oo9: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS PLEAS AND SERVES HIS\n\nCUSTODIAL SENTENCE\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia renewed her requests to Epstein’s local atorneys\nGoldberger and Black for a copy of the state plea agreement reached with the State Atorney’s\nOffice, noting that their failure to provide it was a material breach of the NPA. After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\nCommunity Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\ncommunity control] in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\ncommunity control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.”!”\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\n\nV2 The Main Detention Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates.

According to\nVillafafia, the official told them, “Epstein would be eligible for work release and will be placed on\nwork release,” a statement that contradicted the information the case agents had been given by a\njail supervisor the previous November, as well as statements made by defense atorney Jack\nGoldberger to Villafafia just days before the plea was entered, when he “specifically told\n[Villafafia] that [Epstein] would not get work release.” Villafafia alerted the Sheriff's Office\nofficial that although Epstein told the court during his plea proceeding that he had worked “every\nday” for a “couple of years” at the “Florida Science Foundation,” that entity did not even exist\nuntil November 2oo7.'®! Moreover, the address Epstein provided to the court for the “Florida\nScience Foundation” was the office of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia and her\nsupervisor asked that the Sheriffs Office notify the USAO if Epstein applied for work release.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he was aware Villafafia was trying to ensure that Epstein did not get\nwork release, and he would not have contradicted her efforts. Acosta explained that the USAO\nexpected Epstein would be “treated just like everyone else,” but that, as shoun by “our subsequent\ncommunications with the [S]tate [A]torney’s [O]ffice,” having Epstein on work release “was not\nwhat our office envisioned.”\n\nIn August 2oo8, Villafafia spoke with defense atorney Black about ensuring Epstein’s\ncompliance with the NPA, and raised the issue of work release. Villafafia later reported to Acosta\nand Sloman that Black assured her he had “reminded the team that . . . l8 months IN JAIL is a\nmaterial term of the agreement.”\n\nThe USAO never received notice of Epstein’s work release application.

Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens\n\nOn April 28, l995, the Atorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors\nentitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly\nbecome involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States. In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated administrative deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\n\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\nextraordinary circumstances exist. Accordingly, absent such\ncircumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a\n‘a. l96\ncrime.\n\nStipulated administrative deportation orders can be based “‘on the conviction for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)@), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\n\nC. Case Law\n\nl. Prosecutorial Discretion\n\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\ndiscretion in deciding whether and whom to prosecute. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP Enforcement Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\n\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l65", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023166.jpg": "the prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\n<span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. /d. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\nDe Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts.

Acosta’s Decisions Led to Difficulties Enforcing the NPA\n\nAfter the agreement was reached, the collateral atacks and continued appeals raised the\nspecter that the defense had negotiated in bad faith. At various points, individual members of the\nUSAO team became frustrated by defense tactics, and in some instances, consideration was given\nto whether the USAO should declare a unilateral breach. Indeed, on November 24, 2oo8, the\nUSAO gave notice that it deemed Epstein’s participation in work release to be a breach of the\nagreement but ultimately took no further action. Acosta told OPR: “I was personally very\nfrustrated with the failure to report on October 2o, and had I envisioned that entire collateral atack,\nI think I would have looked at this very differently.”\n\nOnce the NPA was signed, Acosta could have ignored Epstein’s requests for further review\nby the Department and, if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under the NPA to enter his state\nguilty plea, declared Epstein to be in breach and proceeded to charge him federally. When\nquestioned about this issue, Acosta explained that he believed the Department had the “right” to\naddress Epstein’s concerns. He told OPR that because the USAO is part of the Department of\nJustice, if a defendant asks for Departmental review, it would be “unseemly” to object. During his\nOPR interview, Sloman described Acosta as very process-oriented, which he atributed to Acosta’s\nprior Department experience. Sloman, houever, believed the USAO gave Epstein “[t]oo much\nprocess,” a result of the USAO’s desire to “do the right thing” and to the defense team’s ability to\nkeep pressing for more process without triggering a breach of the NPA. Furthermore, Epstein’s\ndefense counsel repeatedly and carefully made clear they were not repudiating the agreement.\nAcosta told OPR that the USAO would have had to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA in order\nto proceed to file federal charges, and Epstein would undoubtedly have litigated whether his effort\nto obtain Departmental review constituted a breach. Acosta recalled that he was concerned, as was\nSloman, that a unilateral decision to rescind the non-prosecution agreement would result in\ncollateral litigation that would further delay maters and make what was likely a difficult trial even\nharder.\n\nAcosta’s and Sloman’s concerns about declaring a breach were not unreasonable. A court\nwould have been unlikely to have determined that defense counsel’s appeal of the NPA to the\nDepartment and unwillingness to set a state plea date while that appeal was ongoing was sufficient\nto negate the agreement. Houever, some of the difficulty the USAO faced in declaring a breach\nwas caused by decisions Acosta made before and shortly after the NPA was signed. For example,\nand significantly, it was Acosta who changed the language, “Epstein shall enter his guilty plea and\nbe <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> not later than October 26, 2oo7” to “Epstein shall use [his] best efforts to enter his\nguilty plea and be <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> not later than October 26, 2oo7.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta also\nagreed not to enforce the NPA’s October 26, 2oo7 deadline for entry of Epstein’s plea, and he told\ndefense counsel that he had no objection if they decided to pursue an appeal to the Department.\nFollouing these decisions, the USAO would have had significant difficulty trying to prove that\nEpstein was not using his “best efforts” to comply with the NPA and was intentionally failing to\ncomply, as opposed to pursuing a course to which the U.S. Atorney had at least implicitly agreed.\n\nE. Acosta Did Not Exercise Sufficient Supervisory Review over the Process\n\nThe question at the center of much of the public controversy concerning the USAO’s\nhandling of its criminal investigation of Epstein is why the USAO agreed to resolve a case in which\n\nl82\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2322o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023253.jpg": "in Courtroom llF at the Palm Beach County Courthouse, 2o5 North\nDixie Highway, West Palm Beach, Florida.

The leter took an expansive\nview of the applicable statutes by contending that both the CVRA and the VRRA required the\nUSAO to notify the victims of the state proceedings:\n\n[T]hese sections are not limited to proceedings in a federal district\ncourt. Our Non-Prosecution Agreement resolves the federal\ninvestigation by allouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense.\nThe victims identified through the federal investigation should be\nappropriately informed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does\nnot require the U.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal\nobligations. *!®\n\nThe leter also asserted that the VRRA obligated the USAO to provide the victims with\ninformation concerning restitution to which they may be entitled and “the earliest possible” notice\nof the status of the investigation, the filing of charges, and the acceptance of a plea. Along with\nthe leter, Sloman forwarded a revised draft victim notification leter to Lefkouitz for his\ncomments. This draft victim notification leter stated that the federal investigation had been\ncompleted, Epstein would plead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of\nimprisonment at sentencing, and Epstein would compensate victims for monetary damages claims\nbrought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The draft victim notification leter provided specific information\nconceming the upcoming change of plea hearing and invited the victims to atend or provide a\nwriten statement to the State Atorney’s Office. When Lefkouitz asked Sloman to delay sending\nvictim notifications until after a discussion of their contents, Sloman instructed Villafafia, who was\npreparing leters for transmital to 3o victims, to “Hold the leter.” During his OPR interview,\nSloman recalled that he had “wanted to push the leter out,” but he “must have had a conversation\nwith somebody” about whether the CVRA applied, and based on that conversation he directed\nVillafafia to hold the leter.\n\nIn his response leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz contended that the government had\nmisinterpreted both the CVRA and VRRA because neither applied to the “public proceeding in\nthis mater [which] will be in state court for the purpose of the entry of a plea on state charges.”\nAl6 Sloman told Lefkouitz the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is simply informing the\nvictims of their rights.” Sloman also addressed the defense atorneys’ objection to advising the victims that they could\ncontact Villafafia or the FBI case agent with questions or concerns by referencing the CVRA, noting, “Again, federal\nlaw requires that victims have the ‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.”\n\n266\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023309.jpg": "investigation. Because the state indictment and information appeared to pertain to far fewer than\nthe total victims identified in either the state or the federal investigation, and no one at the USAO\nwas certain which victims were covered by the state charges, it should have been apparent to\nAcosta that without advance planning between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office, there\nwas a substantial risk that most of the victims identified in the federal investigation would not\nreceive notice of the hearing.*”° Notification to the broadest possible number of identified victims\ncould only have been successful if there was appropriate communication between the USAO and\nthe state prosecutors, communication that had previously been lacking regarding other significant\nissues relating to Epstein. Villafafia and Sloman’s hastily arranged effort to enlist in the\nnotification process PBPD Chief Reiter, who likely played litle role in complying with the state’s\nvictim notification obligations in a typical case, was not an adequate substitute for careful planning\nand coordination with the State Atorney’s Office.*”°\n\nEven if the State Atorney’s Office had notified all of the identified victims of the upcoming\nplea hearing, there was no guarantee that such notification would have included information that\nthe state plea was resolving not just the state’s investigation of Epstein, but the federal investigation\nas well. The State Atorney was not obligated by state statutes to inform the victims of the status\nof the federal investigation, and there was litle reason to assume Krischer, or one of his staff,\nwould voluntarily do so, thereby puting the State Atorney’s Office in the position of fielding\nvictim questions and concerns about the outcome. Furthermore, as both the USAO and the defense\nhad differing views as to who could lawfully participate in the state plea hearing, there is no\nindication that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia took steps to confirm that, if victims appeared, they\ncould actually participate in the state court proceeding when they were not victims of the charged\ncrimes. *”7\n\nThrough counsel, Acosta asserted to OPR that because Villafafia and Sloman both told\nOPR that they believed that state officials would notify the victims, “OPR identified no reason\nwhy Secretary Acosta should have distrusted his team on these points.” Acosta’s counsel further\n425 Krischer told OPR that the state’s notification obligation extended to all victims identified in the state\ninvestigation. Nonetheless, which victims were encompassed in the state’s investigation was unclear. The PBPD’s\nprobable cause affidavit included crimes against only 5 victims, not the l9 identified in the state\ninvestigation. According to state records made public, the state subpoenaed to the grand jury only 3 victims. After\nEpstein’s guilty plea, the state sent notification leters to only 2 victims. Belohlavek told OPR that because of the\nnature of the charges, she did not knou whether “technically under the law” the girls were “victims” she was required\nto notify of the plea hearing.\n6 The State Atorney’s Office had its oun procedures and employees who handled victim notification, and\nBelohlavek told OPR that the Chief of the Police Department would not regularly play a role in the state victim\nnotification process.\n427 Although Villafafia’s notes indicate that she researched Florida Statutes §§ 96o.ool and 92l.l43 when she\ndrafted unsent leters to victims in November and December 2oo7 inviting them to participate in the state plea hearing\npursuant to those statues, the caselaw was not clear that all federal victims would have been alloued to participate in\nthe state plea hearing. In Lefkouitz’s November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, he argued that the statutes afforded a right\nto speak at a defendant’s sentencing or to submit a statement only to the victims of the crime for which the defendant\nwas being <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span>. In April 2oo8, a Florida District Court of Appeal ruled against a defendant who argued that\nFlorida Statute § 92l.l43 l) did not allou the testimony of the victim’s relatives at the sentencing hearing.

The Non Prosecution Agreement stipulated that they would not be\ncharged. According to police reports and sworn statements in the civil suits, all four women, among their other duties,\nworked to ensure that an appointment book for twice- or thrice-daily “massages” was stocked with fresh recrulis.\nGhislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late Czechoslovakian-born press baron Robert Maxwell, who was for many years\nEpstein’s live-in partner, also recruited young girls.\nSince his l3-month sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor, Epstein has setled more than a dozen Jawsuits\nbrought by underage girls. Seven victims reached a last-minute deal last week, days before a scheduled trial; each\nreceived well over $7 million—an amount that will hardly dent Epstein's $2 billion net worth.\nThe victims fold police they waited in the kitchen to be called upstairs for a massage, and the house chef often gave\nthem a bite to eat. House manager Alfredo Redriguez said in his sworn statement that a maid named Lupita, who was\n@ devout Catholic, wept when she complained to him about cleaning up after the massage sessions, picking up soiled\ntouels and puting away the sex toys. And she was upset that a photo of Epstein with the pope hung next to one of\nhim with a young girl.\nIronically, Rodriguez, who ran the house on El Brillo Way in 2oo4 and 2oo5, ended up being <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> to more jail\ntime than his boss as a result of the complex investigation into Epstein’s activities. He was fired, he says, for\ninadvertently drawing police atention to one of the girls when she arrived at the house unannounced fo collect money.\nHe saw an unfamiliar “beater” in the driveway one evening and called 9ll. When he left Epstein's employ, Rodriquez\ntook away some notes and emails about massage appointments as “protection” against his oun prosecution, and\nfailed to produce them during the Palm Beach Police Department's initial investigation.\nUnable to get work as a house manager elsewhere in South Florida, he says, Rodriguez later tried to sell this “golden\n\n| nugget\"—his term—for $5o,ooo, fo be used in the victims’ civil suits. Unfortunately, he made the offer to an\n\n: undercover cop, and was subsequently charged with “obstruction of official proceedings” for withholding information\nthat could have advanced the criminal investigation of Epstein—which by that point had been setled in a plea deal.\nRodriguez was <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> to l8 months in federal prison (Epstein was alloued to serve l3 months in the Palm Beach\n\n| county jai), and nou awaits an additional sentence on Aug. 24 in federal court in Miami for transporting firearms,\nanother deal he says he made to pay the bills after he lost his job.\nIn a deposition given for the civil suits, Rodriguez testified that he was instructed to always have $2,o6o in cash on\nhand, so that he could pay both the girls who gave massages and recruiters such as Haley Robson who brought them\nfo the house. He also testified that Epstein made large contributions fo the Palm Beach Police Department, and in\nreturn was given PBPD basebkail hats to put on the dashboard of his various cars to avoid being stopped or ticketed by\nlocal police. Retired Police Chief Michael Reiter, in his oun deposition, acknouledged that, in addition to earlier\ndonations to the police department (which are fairly common in well-heeled Palm Beach), Epstein had recently given\nthe department $loo,ooo for same sophisticated equipment.

Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and secking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court. After the initial filings and\nhearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil\ncases against Epstein.\n\n2 Emergency Victim’s Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim’s [sic] Rights Act, l8 U.S.C.

The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus on a Potential Plea to\nFederal Charges\n\nDuring the remainder of September, Villafafia conducted plea negotiations and drafted the\nfinal NPA, mainly with Epstein atorney Jay Lefkouitz. In a September l3, 2oo7 email to CEOS\nChief Oosterban, Villafafia reported that the plea negotiations were “geting fast and furious.”\nShe said that the defense wanted to establish a “‘victim’s fund” through which Epstein could make\npayments to the victims, rather than having the victims file individual § 2255 court actions for\ndamages, which she speculated was “to keep this stuff out of the public [c]ourt files.”\n\nAccording to the email documentation, by Friday, September l4, 2oo7, the parties had\nmoved touard a “hybrid” federal plea agreement, incorporating a plea to state charges, which\nwould allou Epstein to serve his sentence for all the charges concurrently in a federal prison.\nVillafafia informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other colleagues that negotiations with Lefkouitz\nhad resulted in a tentative agreement for Epstein to plead to two federal charges: harassment to\nprevent a witness from reporting a crime (l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d)(2), which was then a one-year\nmisdemeanor), and simple assault on an airplane (l8 U.S.C. § ll3(a)(5), a six-month\nmisdemeanor). Villafafia reported that Lefkouitz “put in a pitch for only l2 months, I put in a\npitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 2o-month recommendation, and we decided that we would\nbe stuck with the l8 months.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information\nmirroring the agreement in principle she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had\n“not yet been blessed” by them. The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the\ntwo federal charges for which the parties would jointly recommend that he be <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> to the\nstatutory maximum penalty of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by 2 years of supervised release,\nand that he would also plead guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, for which Epstein and the State Atorney’s Office would make a joint,\nbinding recommendation that he be <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> to serve at least 2o months in prison folloued by lo\nmonths of community control (home confinement). Although not specified in the draft agreement,\nthe negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently. In addition\nto payment of restitution, Epstein would not oppose jurisdiction or victim status for any of the\nvictims identified in the federal investigation—at that point specified as numbering 4o—who\nelected to file suit for damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. A guardian ad litem would be appointed\nto communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf.\n\nLourie, houever, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal. In response\nto Villafafia’s email about the potential federal charges, but after Villafafia sent the proposal to\nLefkouitz, Lourie told her, “The assault [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of\nsilly.”''! Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the assault\ncharge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.” Acosta responded, “If we\nneed[,] let’s find a different charge.” On Saturday, September l5, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLefkouitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “goten some negative reaction\nul The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ .. . on [one of his female\nassistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23lo6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023108.tif": "evidence of a violation of the agreement. Epstein and his counsel\nagree that the computers that are currently under [legal process] will\nbe safeguarded in their current condition by Epstein’s counsel or\ntheir agents until the terms and conditions of the Agreement are\nfulfilled.\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a lengthy email to convey two options Lourie had\nsuggested: “the original proposal” for a state plea but with an agreement for an l8-month sentence,\nor pleas to state charges and two federal obstruction-of-justice charges. Villafafia also told\nLefkouitz she was willing to ask Acosta again to approve a federal plea to a five-year conspiracy\nwith a Rule ll(c) binding recommendation for a 2o-month sentence. Villafafia explained:\n\nAs to timing, it is my understanding that Mr. Epstein needs to be\n<span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> in the state after he is <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> in the federal case, but\nnot that he needs to plead guilty and be <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> after serving his\nfederal time. Andy recommended that some of the timing issues be\naddressed only in the state agreement, so that it isn’t obvious to the\njudge that we are trying to create federal jurisdiction for prison\npurposes.\n\nWith regard to prosecution of individuals other than Epstein, Villafafia suggested standard\nfederal plea agreement language regarding the resolution of all criminal liability, “and I will\nmention ‘co-conspirators,’ but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes\nand all of the other persons that we could charge.” Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to\ninclude a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-conspirators, who at the time she understood\nto be the four women named in the proposed agreement, because the USAO was not interested in\nprosecuting those individuals if Epstein entered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, “[W]e considered\nEpstein to be the top of the food chain, and we wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone\nelse.” She did not consider the possibility that Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed\nindividuals, and no one, including the FBI case agents, raised that concern. Villafafia also told\nOPR that her reference to “all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge”\nrelated to her concern that if the plea agreement contained information about uncharged conduct,\nthe court might ask for more information about that conduct and inquire why it had not been\ncharged, and if the government provided such information, Epstein’s atorneys might claim the\nagreement was breached.!!?\n\nWith regard to immigration, Villafafia told OPR that the USAO generally did not take any\nposition in plea agreements on immigration issues, and that in this case, there was no evidence that\neither of the two assistants who were foreign nationals had commited fraud in connection with\ntheir immigration paperwork, “and I think that they were both in status. So there wasn’t any reason\nl3 OPR understood Villafafia’s concern to be that if the government were required to respond to a court’s inquiry\ninto additional facts, Epstein would object that the government was trying to cast him in a negative light in order to\ninfluence the court to impose a sentence greater than the agreed-upon term.\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23lo8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023120.tif": "At some point that day, Acosta spoke with Lefkouitz by phone regarding the need for\nEpstein to plead to a registrable offense. Throughout the weekend, with Villafafia’s Monday\ndeadline looming, defense counsel pressed hard to eliminate the sexual offender requirement. On\nSaturday, September 22, 2oo7, Sanchez sent a series of emails to Lourie. In the first, she provided\ndetails from a press report about a Florida public official who the previous day had pled guilty to\nchild sex abuse charges and was <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> to a term of probation. She noted that she “spoke to\n[M]at [Menchel]” and asked Lourie to call her. Two hours later she sent Lourie a second, lengthy\nemail, strongly objecting to the registration requirement, and outlining “all arguments against\nregistration [as a sexual offender] in this case.” In this email, Sanchez claimed that there had been\na “miscommunication” during the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and that “we only agreed to the\nsolicitation with minors because we believed and [Krischer] and [Belohlavek] confirmed it was\nNOT registrable.” Sanchez complained that lifetime sexual offender registration was a “life\nsentence” that was “uncalled for,” “does not make sense,” and was “inappropriate” to impose\n“simply [because] the FBI wants it, in return for all there [sic] efforts.” She listed numerous\nreasons why Epstein should not have to register, including his lack of a prior record or history of\nsexual offenses; the lack of any danger of recidivism; the ease with which he could be “tracked”\nwithout registering; and that it would be “virtually impossible to comply” with four separate state\nregistration requirements. A few minutes later, Sanchez sent Lefcourt’s phone number to Lourie\n“in case you want to speak to him directly.”\n\nIn another email sent less than two hours later, Sanchez told Lourie she was writing again\nbecause “you are a very fair person. This resolution in the Epstein case is not reasonable. [I]t isa\nresult of a misunderstanding at a meeting.” She stated that Epstein’s atorneys had “consistently\nemphasized their goal of l8 months in a federal camp” and “[e]veryone knew that a registerable\noffense precluded” a camp designation. Sanchez added, “Therefore it would have been wholly\ninconsistent with that primary goal of [Epstein’s] safety to lightly concede to registration at that\nmeeting.” Sanchez concluded, “[I]mposing a life sentence on him is not something anyone will\neventually be proud of. Please reconsider and help me get a fair result.”\n\nLourie responded to none of the Sanchez emails, but he did reach out to Acosta for a phone\nconversation. By email late that night, at lo:26 p.m., Lefkouitz asked Lourie to phone him.\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta—with copies to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafatia—\nto “follou up on our conversation Friday,” asking Acosta again to reconsider the requirement that\nEpstein plead to a registrable offense. Lefkouitz wrote that there had been a “misunderstanding”\nat the September l2, 2oo7 meeting:\n\nBefore the meeting, Mr. Krischer and Ms. Belohlavek, a sex\n\nprosecutor for l3 years, told us that solicitation of a minor. . . is not\n\naregisterable offense. Houever, as it turned out, [it] is a registerable\n\noffense and our discussion at the meeting was based on a mistaken\n\nassumption. We suggest that Mr. Epstein enter two pleas—one to\n\nthe Indictment and a second to a non-registerable charge.\nhas offered to buy me a cup of coffee. I have had coffee with no one.” Krischer told OPR that the “reasons” to which\nhe referred related to the pressure he had been geting from Chief Reiter about the Epstein case.\n\n82\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l2o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023121.tif": "Lefkouitz set forth arguments similar to those Sanchez had presented to Lourie, as to why\nregistration “based on the facts alleged in this case . . . simply does not make sense.” In the event\nthat Acosta did not agree to their proposed charges, Lefkouitz offered as an alternative “to stipulate\nthat the state offense” would “constitute a prior sexual offense for purposes of enhanced recidivist\nsentencing” should Epstein ever again commit a federal sex offense against minors. As Lefkouitz\nfurther argued, “By accepting this option, you would be substituting the certainty of recidivist\nsentencing for the humiliation of registration.” Emails reflect that, early that afternoon, Acosta,\nLourie, and Villafafia discussed the mater in a conference call.\n\nLefkouitz also sent a revised version of the NPA to Villafafia that omited identification of\n\nthe charge to which Epstein would plead guilty. Later that day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta:\n\nI got a call from [M]arie who said you had rejected our proposal.\n\nDoes that mean you are not even prepared to have [Epstein] commit\n\nnou to plead to the registerable offense near the end of his l8 month\n\nsentence and then be <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> to l2 month[s] community control\n\nfor that charge? I thought that was exactly what you proposed\n\n[F]riday (although you wanted, but were not able, to do it with some\n\nkind of federal charge).\n\nBut that still gives you a registerable sex offense, 3o months total,\n\nand l8 in jail.\n\nHou can that not satisfy you—while still ensuring that [E]pstein is\n\nnot unduly endangered in jail?\nAcosta responded, “I do not mean to be difficult, but our negotiations must take place with the\nAUSAs assigned to the case.” Acosta added that he had spoken with Lourie and Villafafia, and\nthey had “discretion to proceed as they believe just and appropriate.” Acosta copied Villafafia,\nand she emailed Acosta to thank him “‘for the support.”\n\nL. The Defense Adds a Confidentiality Clause\n\nThroughout that Sunday evening, Lefkouitz had numerous email exchanges with\nVillafafia, and apparently a conference call with Lourie (who was returning to Washington, D.C.)\nand Villafafia. Later that evening, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a new version of the NPA that, for the\nfirst time, included a confidentiality term:\n\nIt is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that it not be\ndisseminated or disclosed except pursuant to court order. In the\nevent the Government must disclose this Agreement in response to\na request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the\nGovernment agrees to provide Epstein notice before the disclosure\nof this Agreement.\n\nAfter making additional revisions, Villafafia sent this NPA to Acosta and Lourie as the\n“final” version, asking Acosta to let her knou what he thought of it. Among her revisions, she\nchanged the confidentiality provision to the follouing:\n\n83\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l2l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023122.tif": "The parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part of\nany public record.

SEPTEMBER 24, 2oo7: ACOSTA MAKES FINAL EDITS, AND THE NPA IS\n\nSIGNED\n\nThe contemporaneous emails shou that Villafafia continued to update Acosta as the parties\nnegotiated the final language and that Acosta reviewed and edited the NPA. Shortly after midnight\non Monday, September 24, 2oo7, Acosta sent Villafafia “[s]mall edits” to the “final” NPA she had\nsent to him. Among his changes was language modifying provisions that appeared to require the\nState Atorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein\nenter his guilty plea by a certain date. Acosta explained in his email, “I’m not comfortable with\nrequiring the State Atorney to enter into a [joint sentencing] recommendation” or “requiring a\nState court to stick with our timeline” for entry of the guilty plea and sentencing. Accordingly,\nAcosta substituted language that required Epstein alone to make a binding sentencing\nrecommendation to the state court, and required Epstein to use his “best efforts” to enter his guilty\nplea and be <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> by the specified dates. Acosta also instructed Villafafia to restore a reference\nto Epstein’s wish “to reach a global resolution of his state and federal criminal liabilities.” Lourie,\nwho had returned to the Department in Washington, D.C., had a phone conversation with\nLefkouitz and sent additional comments on the final draft to Acosta and Villafafia. Villafafia sent\na new revision, incorporating edits from Acosta and Lourie, to Lefkouitz later that morning.\n\nOn the afternoon of September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia circulated the new “final” version of\nthe NPA to Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other supervisors, and asked Lefkouitz to send her the\nsigned agreement. After Lefkouitz electronically transmited to Villafafia a copy of the NPA\nsigned by Epstein, she emailed her immediate supervisor and her co-counsel: “They have scanned\nand emailed the signed agreement. It is done.”\n\nIn his transmital email, Lefkouitz asked Villafafia to “[p]lease do whatever you can to\nkeep this from becoming public.” Villafafia responded:\n\nI have forwarded your message only to Alex, Andy, and [the West\n\nPalm Beach manager]. I don’t anticipate it going any further than\n\nthat. When I receive the originals, I will sign and return one copy\n\nto you. The other will be placed in the case file, which will be kept\n\nconfidential since it also contains identifying information about the\n\ngirls.\n\nWhen we reach an agreement about the atorney representative for\n\nthe girls, we can discuss what I can tell him and the girls about the\nl28 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Lourie observed that because the NPA contained names of uncharged\nco-conspirators and other protected information, the USAO would have a duty to redact the information before\ndisclosing the NPA.\n\n84\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l22", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023124.tif": "it had identified as victims.'?!

In an email reporting this to Acosta and Villafafia, Sloman said that Epstein’s\nlocal defense atorney Goldberger had told Belohlavek the postponement was because the facts\n“did not fit the proposed state charge,” and that Belohlavek told Sloman she agreed with that\nassessment.’ The next day, Villafafia sent to Acosta and Sloman a local newspaper article\nreporting that Epstein’s state plea hearing was reset for March and in exchange for it the federal\nauthorities would drop their investigation of him. Acosta also sent to Sloman and Villafafia an\nemail memorializing a statement made to him by Lefkouitz in a phone call that day: “‘I\n[Lefkouitz] may have made a mistake 6 months ago.

January 7, 2oo8: Acosta and Sloman Meet with Sanchez, Who Makes\n\nAdditional Allegations of USAO Misconduct\n\nOn January 7, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman met with defense atorney Sanchez at her request.\nAccording to meeting notes made by Sloman, among other things, Sanchez alleged that the\nUSAO’s media spokesperson had improperly disclosed details of the Epstein case to a national\nnews reporter, and Sanchez “suggested that the USAO could avoid any potential ugliness in DC\nby agreeing to a watered-doun resolution for Epstein.” After Acosta excused himself to atend\nanother meeting and Sloman refused to speak further with Sanchez “without a witness present,”\nshe left. Later that day, Acosta and Sloman spoke by phone with Starr, Lefkouitz, and Sanchez,\nwho expressed concern about the “leak” to the news media, reiterated their objections to the NPA,\nand pressed for the “watered-doun resolution,” which they specified would mean allouing Epstein\nto plead to a charge of coercion instead of procurement, avoid serving time in jail, and not register\nas a sexual offender. A note in the margin of Sloman’s handwriten notes of the conversation\nreads: “We’re back to where we started in September.”\n\nThat evening, Villafafia expressed concern that the delay in resolving the mater was\naffecting the USAO’s ability to go forward with a prosecution should Epstein renege on his\nagreement, and she outlined for Acosta and Sloman the steps she proposed to take while Epstein\nwas pursuing Departmental review. Those steps included re-establishing contact with victims,\ninterviewing victims in New York and one victim who lived in a foreign country, making contact\nwith “potential sources of information” in the Virgin Islands, and re-initiating proceedings to\nobtain Epstein’s computers.\n\nIn the meantime, USAO Criminal Division Chief Robert Senior performed a “soup to nuts”\nreview of the Epstein investigation, reviewing the indictment package and all of the evidence\nVillafafia had compiled. He told OPR that he could not recall the reason for his review, but opined\nl59 Belohlavek told OPR that she did not recall this incident, but she noted that the PBPD report did set forth\nfacts supporting the charge of procurement of a minor.\n\nl6o Although the meeting Lefkouitz had with Lourie, Villafafia, Krischer, and Belohlavek to discuss the state\nresolution was only four months prior, not six, Lefkouitz’s reference was likely to the September l2, 2oo7 meeting.\nlol\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l39", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023148.tif": "On Monday, June 23, 2oo8, Roth sent a brief leter to Starr and Lefkouitz informing them\nthat the office had “completed a thorough review” of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater\nand did not believe intervention by the Deputy Atorney General was warranted in view of the\n“considerable discretion” vested by the Department in U.S. Atorneys. He added, “Even if we\nwere to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Atorney, we believe that federal prosecution\nof this case is appropriate.”\n\nImmediately after receiving a copy of Roth’s leter, Villafafia notified defense counsel that\nEpstein would have until close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the NPA\nby entering his guilty plea, being <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span>, and surrendering to begin serving his sentence.

After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\nCommunity Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\ncommunity control] in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\ncommunity control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.”!”\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\n\n72 The Main Detention Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates.

On November l6, 2oo7, the case agents met with Belohlavek and asked if\nthe State Atorney’s Office would oppose a request that Epstein be granted work release.\nBelohlavek was noncommital, and when the agents asked that she include language in the state’s\nplea agreement prohibiting Epstein from participating in work release, she responded that she\nwould have to discuss the issue with the State Atorney.'®° Krischer later told OPR that work\nrelease was “within the control of the Sheriffs Office, not my office.” The state’s plea agreement\nwith Epstein did not address the issue of work release.\n\nThe day after Epstein entered his June 3o, 2oo8 plea, Villafafia and her immediate\nsupervisor met with a Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office official to discuss work release. According to\nVillafafia, the official told them, “Epstein would be eligible for work release and will be placed on\nwork release,” a statement that contradicted the information the case agents had been given by a\njail supervisor the previous November, as well as statements made by defense atorney Jack\nGoldberger to Villafafia just days before the plea was entered, when he “specifically told\n[Villafafia] that [Epstein] would not get work release.” Villafafia alerted the Sheriff's Office\nofficial that although Epstein told the court during his plea proceeding that he had worked “every\nday” for a “couple of years” at the “Florida Science Foundation,” that entity did not even exist\nuntil November 2oo7.'8! Moreover, the address Epstein provided to the court for the “Florida\nScience Foundation” was the office of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia and her\nsupervisor asked that the Sheriffs Office notify the USAO if Epstein applied for work release.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he was aware Villafafia was trying to ensure that Epstein did not get\nwork release, and he would not have contradicted her efforts. Acosta explained that the USAO\nexpected Epstein would be “treated just like everyone else,” but that, as shoun by “our subsequent\ncommunications with the [S]tate [A]torney’s [O]ffice,” having Epstein on work release “was not\nwhat our office envisioned.”\n\nIn August 2oo8, Villafafia spoke with defense atorney Black about ensuring Epstein’s\ncompliance with the NPA, and raised the issue of work release. Villafafia later reported to Acosta\nand Sloman that Black assured her he had “reminded the team that . . . l8 months IN JAIL is a\nmaterial term of the agreement.”\n\nThe USAO never received notice of Epstein’s work release application.

Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens\n\nOn April 28, l995, the Atorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors\nentitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly\nbecome involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States. In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated administrative deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\n\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\nextraordinary circumstances exist. Accordingly, absent such\ncircumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a\n‘a l96\ncrime,\n\nStipulated administrative deportation orders can be based “‘on the conviction for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)(), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\n\nC. Case Law\n\nl. Prosecutorial Discretion\n\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\ndiscretion in deciding whether and whom to prosecute. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP Enforcement Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\n\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l65", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023166.tif": "the prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\n<span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. Jd. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\n2. Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts. First, defendants have challenged the voluntariness of the resulting plea\nl28\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l66", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023220.tif": "D. Acosta’s Decisions Led to Difficulties Enforcing the NPA\n\nAfter the agreement was reached, the collateral atacks and continued appeals raised the\nspecter that the defense had negotiated in bad faith. At various points, individual members of the\nUSAO team became frustrated by defense tactics, and in some instances, consideration was given\nto whether the USAO should declare a unilateral breach. Indeed, on November 24, 2oo8, the\nUSAO gave notice that it deemed Epstein’s participation in work release to be a breach of the\nagreement but ultimately took no further action. Acosta told OPR: “I was personally very\nfrustrated with the failure to report on October 2o, and had I envisioned that entire collateral atack,\nI think I would have looked at this very differently.”\n\nOnce the NPA was signed, Acosta could have ignored Epstein’s requests for further review\nby the Department and, if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under the NPA to enter his state\nguilty plea, declared Epstein to be in breach and proceeded to charge him federally. When\nquestioned about this issue, Acosta explained that he believed the Department had the “right” to\naddress Epstein’s concerns. He told OPR that because the USAO is part of the Department of\nJustice, if a defendant asks for Departmental review, it would be “unseemly” to object. During his\nOPR interview, Sloman described Acosta as very process-oriented, which he atributed to Acosta’s\nprior Department experience. Sloman, houever, believed the USAO gave Epstein “[t]oo much\nprocess,” a result of the USAO’s desire to “do the right thing” and to the defense team’s ability to\nkeep pressing for more process without triggering a breach of the NPA. Furthermore, Epstein’s\ndefense counsel repeatedly and carefully made clear they were not repudiating the agreement.\nAcosta told OPR that the USAO would have had to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA in order\nto proceed to file federal charges, and Epstein would undoubtedly have litigated whether his effort\nto obtain Departmental review constituted a breach. Acosta recalled that he was concerned, as was\nSloman, that a unilateral decision to rescind the non-prosecution agreement would result in\ncollateral litigation that would further delay maters and make what was likely a difficult trial even\nharder.\n\nAcosta’s and Sloman’s concerns about declaring a breach were not unreasonable. A court\nwould have been unlikely to have determined that defense counsel’s appeal of the NPA to the\nDepartment and unwillingness to set a state plea date while that appeal was ongoing was sufficient\nto negate the agreement. Houever, some of the difficulty the USAO faced in declaring a breach\nwas caused by decisions Acosta made before and shortly after the NPA was signed. For example,\nand significantly, it was Acosta who changed the language, “Epstein shall enter his guilty plea and\nbe <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> not later than October 26, 2oo7” to “Epstein shall use [his] best efforts to enter his\nguilty plea and be <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> not later than October 26, 2oo7.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta also\nagreed not to enforce the NPA’s October 26, 2oo7 deadline for entry of Epstein’s plea, and he told\ndefense counsel that he had no objection if they decided to pursue an appeal to the Department.\nFollouing these decisions, the USAO would have had significant difficulty trying to prove that\nEpstein was not using his “best efforts” to comply with the NPA and was intentionally failing to\ncomply, as opposed to pursuing a course to which the U.S. Atorney had at least implicitly agreed.\n\nE. Acosta Did Not Exercise Sufficient Supervisory Review over the Process\n\nThe question at the center of much of the public controversy concerning the USAO’s\nhandling of its criminal investigation of Epstein is why the USAO agreed to resolve a case in which\n\nl82\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2322o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023253.tif": "in Courtroom llF at the Palm Beach County Courthouse, 2o5 North\nDixie Highway, West Palm Beach, Florida.

The atorney\nasked Sloman if the USAO “could file criminal charges even though the state was looking into the\nmater,” but Sloman declined to answer his questions concerning the investigation.**? In late\nJanuary, the New York Post reported that the atorney’s clients had filed a $5o million civil suit\nagainst Epstein in Florida and that “Epstein is expected to be <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> to l8 months in prison\nwhen he pleads guilty in March to a single charge of soliciting an underage prostitute.”**°\n\nBetween January 3l, 2oo8, and May 28, 2oo8, the FBI, with the prosecutors, interviewed\nadditional victims and reinterviewed several who had been interviewed before the NPA was\nsigned.*** In late January 2oo8, as Villafafia and the CEOS Trial Atorney prepared to participate\n33o The case agent also informed Villafafia that she expected to ask for legal process soon in order to obtain\nadditional information.\n\n33l The CEOS Trial Atorney told OPR that she was under the impression that she was brought in to help prepare\nfor the trial because the “plea had fallen through.”\n332 Because Sloman and the atorney were former legal practice partners, Sloman reported the interaction to\nAcosta, and the USAO reported the incident to OPR shortly thereafter.

The leter took an expansive\nview of the applicable statutes by contending that both the CVRA and the VRRA required the\nUSAO to notify the victims of the state proceedings:\n\n[T]hese sections are not limited to proceedings in a federal district\ncourt. Our Non-Prosecution Agreement resolves the federal\ninvestigation by allouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense.\nThe victims identified through the federal investigation should be\nappropriately informed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does\nnot require the U.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal\nobligations. *!®\n\nThe leter also asserted that the VRRA obligated the USAO to provide the victims with\ninformation concerning restitution to which they may be entitled and “the earliest possible” notice\nof the status of the investigation, the filing of charges, and the acceptance of a plea. Along with\nthe leter, Sloman forwarded a revised draft victim notification leter to Lefkouitz for his\ncomments.

The draft victim notification leter provided specific information\nconceming the upcoming change of plea hearing and invited the victims to atend or provide a\nwriten statement to the State Atorney’s Office. When Lefkouitz asked Sloman to delay sending\nvictim notifications until after a discussion of their contents, Sloman instructed Villafafia, who was\npreparing leters for transmital to 3o victims, to “Hold the leter.” During his OPR interview,\nSloman recalled that he had “wanted to push the leter out,” but he “must have had a conversation\nwith somebody” about whether the CVRA applied, and based on that conversation he directed\nVillafafia to hold the leter.\n\nIn his response leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz contended that the government had\nmisinterpreted both the CVRA and VRRA because neither applied to the “public proceeding in\nthis mater [which] will be in state court for the purpose of the entry of a plea on state charges.”\nAl6 Sloman told Lefkouitz the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is simply informing the\nvictims of their rights.” Sloman also addressed the defense atorneys’ objection to advising the victims that they could\ncontact Villafafia or the FBI case agent with questions or concerns by referencing the CVRA, noting, “Again, federal\nlaw requires that victims have the ‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.””\n\n266\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023309.tif": "investigation.

Villafafia and Sloman’s hastily arranged effort to enlist in the\nnotification process PBPD Chief Reiter, who likely played litle role in complying with the state’s\nvictim notification obligations in a typical case, was not an adequate substitute for careful planning\nand coordination with the State Atorney’s Office.*”°\n\nEven if the State Atorney’s Office had notified all of the identified victims of the upcoming\nplea hearing, there was no guarantee that such notification would have included information that\nthe state plea was resolving not just the state’s investigation of Epstein, but the federal investigation\nas well.

Furthermore, as both the USAO and the defense\nhad differing views as to who could lawfully participate in the state plea hearing, there is no\nindication that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia took steps to confirm that, if victims appeared, they\ncould actually participate in the state court proceeding when they were not victims of the charged\ncrimes. #7\n\nThrough counsel, Acosta asserted to OPR that because Villafafia and Sloman both told\nOPR that they believed that state officials would notify the victims, “OPR identified no reason\nwhy Secretary Acosta should have distrusted his team on these points.” Acosta’s counsel further\n425 Krischer told OPR that the state’s notification obligation extended to all victims identified in the state\ninvestigation. Nonetheless, which victims were encompassed in the state’s investigation was unclear. The PBPD’s\nprobable cause affidavit included crimes against only 5 victims, not the l9 identified in the state\ninvestigation. According to state records made public, the state subpoenaed to the grand jury only 3 victims. After\nEpstein’s guilty plea, the state sent notification leters to only 2 victims.

When designating\nan institution for an inmate to serve a sentence, the Bureau\nconsiders many factors, including but not limited to, the\nsecurity level of the inmate, medical or psychiatric concerns and\njudicial recommendations. Once an institution has been\ndesignated, the inmate will be transported on the next bus or\nairlift on which space is available. This entire process often\ntakes several weeks to complete.

According to police reports and sworn statements in the civil suits, all four women, among their other duties,\nworked to ensure that an appointment book for twice- or thrice-daily “massages” was stocked with fresh recrulis.\nGhislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late Czechoslovakian-born press baron Robert Maxwell, who was for many years\nEpstein’s live-in partner, also recruited young girls.\nSince his l3-month sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor, Epstein has setled more than a dozen Jawsuits\nbrought by underage girls. Seven victims reached a last-minute deal last week, days before a scheduled trial; each\nreceived well over $7 million—an amount that will hardly dent Epstein's $2 billion net worth.\nThe victims fold police they waited in the kitchen to be called upstairs for a massage, and the house chef often gave\nthem a bite to eat. House manager Alfredo Redriguez said in his sworn statement that a maid named Lupita, who was\n@ devout Catholic, wept when she complained to him about cleaning up after the massage sessions, picking up soiled\ntouels and puting away the sex toys. And she was upset that a photo of Epstein with the pope hung next to one of\nhim with a young girl.\nIronically, Rodriguez, who ran the house on El Brillo Way in 2oo4 and 2oo5, ended up being <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> to more jail\ntime than his boss as a result of the complex investigation into Epstein’s activities. He was fired, he says, for\ninadvertently drawing police atention to one of the girls when she arrived at the house unannounced to collect money.\nHe saw an unfamiliar “beater” in the driveway one evening and called 9ll. When he left Epstein's employ, Rodriquez\ntook away some notes and emails about massage appointments as “protection” against his oun prosecution, and\nfailed to produce them during the Palm Beach Police Department's initial investigation.\nUnable to get work as a house manager elsewhere in South Florida, he says, Rodriguez later tried to sell this “golden\n\n| nugget\"—his term—for $5o,ooo, fo be used in the victims’ civil suits. Unfortunately, he made the offer to an\n\n: undercover cop, and was subsequently charged with “obstruction of official proceedings” for withholding information\nthat could have advanced the criminal investigation of Epstein—which by that point had been setled in a plea deal.\nRodriguez was <span class=\"highlight\">sentenced</span> to l8 months in federal prison (Epstein was alloued to serve l3 months in the Palm Beach\n\n| county jai), and nou awaits an additional sentence on Aug. 24 in federal court in Miami for transporting firearms,\nanother deal he says he made to pay the bills after he lost his job.\nIn a deposition given for the civil suits, Rodriguez testified that he was instructed to always have $2,o6o in cash on\nhand, so that he could pay both the girls who gave massages and recruiters such as Haley Robson who brought them\nfo the house. He also testified that Epstein made large contributions to the Palm Beach Police Department, and in\nreturn was given PBPD basebkail hats to put on the dashboard of his various cars to avoid being stopped or ticketed by\nlocal police. Retired Police Chief Michael Reiter, in his oun deposition, acknouledged that, in addition to earlier\ndonations to the police department (which are fairly common in well-heeled Palm Beach), Epstein had recently given\nthe department $loo,ooo for same sophisticated equipment. The police were stil researching the purchase when\nEpstein came under suspicion, and Reiter ordered the money returned. (Guy Frostin, one of Epstein’s local atorneys,\ntold police that Epstein also gave $loo,ooo to the Florida Ballet for massages, because he was “very passionate”\nabout massages being “therapeutically and spiritually\" beneficial. Yet victims told police they had no massage\niraining.}\nPerhaps most disturbing, in terms of possible sex trafficking, was Epstein’s relationship with Jean Luc Brunel, ouner\nof the MC2 modeling agency. According to a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of\nFlorida, an alleged victim said that Epstein, Maxwell, Brunel, Rodriguez, and Marcinkova “deliberately engaged in a\npatern of racketeering that involved luring minor children through MC2, mostly girls under the age of l7, to engage in\nsexual play for money.” (Which would amount to trafficking.}\nBrunel is a 5o-plus French playboy who was formerly part ouner of Karin, a Paris-based modeling agency. He lives in\nNew York and South Beach, Florida, and ouns 85 percent of MC2, which has offices in New York, Miami, and Tel\n\no3956-l22l\nhtp:/Awww.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2olo-o7-22/jeffrey-epstein-pedophile-billi.... 7/23/2olo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo29o4o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00029065.tif": "a Prince Andrew and girl, l7, who sex offender friend flew to Britain to meet him | Mail...
