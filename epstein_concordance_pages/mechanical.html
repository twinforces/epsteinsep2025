Scopo, 86l F.2d 339, 344 (2d Cir. l988) (internal quotations omited).\nWhile there “is no <span class=\"highlight\">mechanical</span> test with respect to requests for a continuance or adjournment,”\nUnited States v. Al Fawaz, ll6 F. Supp. 3d l94, 2lo (S.D.N.Y. 2ol5), the Second Circuit has\nidentified certain circumstances in which an adjournment may be appropriate: (l) the requested\ndelay is of a short (or at least fixed duration); (2) the sought-after evidence is specified with\nparticularity; (3) the proposed evidence is critical to the defense; and (4) the defendant has not\nbeen dilatory. /d. at 2ll (summarizing considerations found in United States v. White, 324 F.3d\n8l4, 8l4-l6 (2d Cir. l963)).\n\nNone of the circumstances identified in A/ Fawaz necessitate the lengthy adjournment\nrequested by the defendants. The Government’s case-in-chief turns on a brief, fourteen-hour\nwindou for which the evidence is limited and nou available to the defendants. Moreover, even as\nexpanded to include all of the additional material produced as described above, the discovery in\nthe instant case is neither unusually voluminous nor complex, and the defendants provide no\nspecific reasons why the review of the materials requires a six-month adjournment.\n\nNor does the need to file pre-trial motions and interview witnesses support such an\nadjournment. Thomas’s counsel has indicated that he intends to file a motion to dismiss the\nindictment, while Noel’s counsel states that he has not been able to determine what motions to file\npending his review of the discovery. Noel’s counsel, houever, identifies no reason to believe such\na review is likely to result in the identification of any potential pre-trial motions: as counsel is\naware, the Government did not obtain any search warrants as part of its investigation, nor did the\ndefendants make post-arrest statements that the Government would seek to introduce into\nevidence. As such, there is no evidence for the defendants to seek to suppress. As for the motion\nto dismiss, which does not depend on a review of the discovery, counsel for Thomas identifies no\nreason why such a motion could not be made in short order.\n\nFinally, with respect to the need to interview witnesses, as noted above, the Government\nhas already produced all of the witness statements in its possession, almost all of them on\nDecember 3l, 2ol9, nearly four months before trial. As the Court is well-aware, such productions\nof witness statements are typically made only weeks before trial is scheduled to begin. As such,\nthe Government’s early production of those materials—giving the defendants months of additional\ntime to review those statements and take any potential investigation steps based upon them—\ncannot possibly merit a lengthy postponement of the trial date.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l999", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023381.jpg": "Chapter 3: Timeline of Key Events\n\nExcept as otherwise noted, the follouing information is derived from the Federal Bureau of\n\nPrisons (BOP) records and the Office of the Inspector General's interviews.\n\nSeptember 2l-24, The BOP awards contracts to two companies (Company l and 2) to\n\n2ol8 upgrade the security camera system at Metropolitan Correctional Center\nin New York, New York (MCC New York). At the time, images from the\nMCC New York's analog video cameras are recorded to a Digital Video\nRecorder (DVR) system, which is divided into two DVR systems. Cameras\nassigned to the DVR l system record only to the DVR l hard drives, and\ncameras assigned to DVR 2 system record only to the DVR 2 hard drives.\n\nMarch l7, 2ol9 In connection with MCC New York's upgrade of its security camera\nsystem, the BOP’s Northeast Regional Office begins arranging for\ntechnicians from other BOP institutions to perform temporary duty (TDY)\nassignments to MCC New York to perform necessary <span class=\"highlight\">mechanical</span>,\nelectrical, plumbing, and wiring work. Houever, during the course of the\nTDY rotations, work is not consistently conducted on the camera upgrade\nbecause TDY personnel are sometimes used to cover shortages at MCC\nNew York's custody posts.\n\nJuly 2, 2ol9 According to court records, a federal grand jury of the U.S. District Court\nfor the Southern District of New York returns an indictment charging\nEpstein with sex trafficking and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking.\n\nJuly 6, 2ol9 Epstein is arrested at an airport in New Jersey and is transported for\ndetention pending his initial court appearance to the MCC New York as a\npretrial detainee. Epstein is placed in the general inmate population and\nmedically screened.\n\nJuly 7, 2ol9 An MCC New York Facilities Assistant asks the Psychology Department to\nevaluate Epstein because he appears “distraught, sad, and a litle\nconfused.” Epstein is assigned to the MCC New York's Special Housing\nUnit (SHU) because of significant media atention and his notoriety\namong other MCC New York inmates.”\n\nThe SHU is a housing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate\npopulation and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day, to ensure their oun safety as well as the\nsafety of staff and other inmates.\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2338l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023449.jpg": "The Electronics Technician told the OIG that, throughout his tenure at MCC New York, the camera system\nwas subject to frequently recurring failures, particularly with respect to the DVR hard drives.”\nThe Warden, who assumed his responsibilities at MCC New York in May 2ol8, told the OIG he was generally\naware that there were problems with the security camera system throughout the institution. He further\nstated that efforts were undertaken to determine which cameras were working and which needed to be\nfixed, and that MCC New York officials intended to ultimately seek funding to replace the entire system.\nFederal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) records reflect that on September 6, 2ol8, the Warden submited a\nmemorandum to the BOP’s Northeast Regional Director to request $8oo,ooo in funding to replace the entire\ncamera system. The memorandum identified an estimated project start date of December l, 2ol8, and an\nestimated completion date of February 9, 2ol9. The BOP approved the funding request, and on\nSeptember 2l, 2ol8, a contract in the amount of $698,lo8.99 was awarded to Company l to provide various\nequipment for the project and associated labor. On September 24, 2ol8, a separate contract in the amount\nof $34,o89.28 was awarded to Company 2 to provide assorted networking equipment and wiring needed to\ninstall the camera system.\nAs the camera upgrade project was beginning, BOP officials recognized that MCC New York’s <span class=\"highlight\">mechanical</span>,\nelectrical, and plumbing systems were also in need of major repairs. MCC New York did not have enough\nqualified technicians on staff to complete both the camera installation and other repairs needed at the\nfacility, so beginning the week of March l7, 2ol9, the BOP’s Northeast Regional Office arranged for\ntechnicians from other BOP institutions to conduct temporary duty (TDY) assignments at MCC New York to\nperform the work. During the course of the TDY rotations, work was not consistently conducted on the\ncamera upgrade because sometimes TDY staff assigned to the project were used to cover shortages at MCC\nNew York's custody posts, and sometimes there were not enough TDY volunteers who possessed the skills\nrequired to do the camera work.\nAt the time of Epstein’s death on August lo, 2ol9, the camera system upgrade had not been completed.\nImmediately follouing Epstein’s death, Company l officials arrived at MCC New York and installed the new\nrecording system within a couple of days, and recording functionality was restored using the existing\ncameras. The majority of the new cameras did not arrive at the facility until October 2ol9, and they were\ninstalled in stages as the wiring work was conducted. According to the Electronics Technician, as of\nAugust 2o2l, when the MCC closed, the wiring work had still not been fully completed.\nll. Discovery of Security Camera System Recording Issues in August 2ol9\nA. Discovery on August 8 of the DVR 2 Failure that Occurred on July 29\nAccording to forensic analysis conducted by the FBI after Epstein’s death, disk failures occurred in MCC\nNew York's DVR 2 system on July 29, 2ol9, which resulted in the system being unable to record. According\nto BOP records and OIG interviews, the BOP did not learn about the failure until August 8, 2ol9, when the\nSpecial Investigative Services (SIS) Lieutenant and Associate Warden l atempted to review recorded\nsurveillance video for a mater unrelated to Epstein. The SIS Lieutenant told the OIG she discovered that no\n* The Electronics Technician provided the OIG with copies of email messages and work orders that documented nine\ninstances between June 2ol7 and July 2ol9, in which actions were taken to address a problem with either the MCC\nNew York's cameras or the hard drives used to record video from the cameras.\n82\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23449", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023480.jpg": "6. The BOP should continue to develop and implement plans to address staffing\n\nshortages at its prisons.\nSince at least 2ol5, the OIG has repeatedly found the need for BOP to address staffing shortages, including\nmedical staffing shortages.® This investigation and review revealed the direct impact of staffing deficiencies\non inmate safety. For example, the Material Handler worked three consecutive shifts—24 hours straight—\non August 9, 2ol9, which was certainly a contributory cause to the lack of adequate means of accounting for\ninmate location and wellbeing in the SHU. The Material Handler told the OIG that no one did the lo p.m.\nSHU inmate count because they were tired. Additionally, the OIG’s investigation and review found that in\nconnection with MCC New York's upgrade of its security camera system, the BOP’s Northeast Regional Office\narranged for technicians from other BOP institutions to perform temporary duty (TDY) assignments to MCC\nNew York to perform necessary <span class=\"highlight\">mechanical</span>, electrical, plumbing, and wiring work. Yet, during the course of\nthe TDY rotations, work was not consistently conducted on the camera upgrade because sometimes TDY\nstaff were used to cover shortages at MCC New York's custody posts. Without adequate staffing, the BOP\ncannot fulfill its mandate to ensure safe and secure correctional facilities. The OIG therefore recommends\nthat the BOP continue to develop and implement plans to address staffing shortages at its institutions.\n\n7. The BOP should evaluate its cell search procedures and make changes as may be\n\nappropriate to improve those procedures through policy, training, or other measures.\nThe OIG’s investigation and review found that there was an excessive amount of linens in Epstein’s cell at\nthe time of his death. BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders require that SHU cells be searched,\nbut they do not specifically address the issue of excessive bed linens, which the Captain told the OIG\npresent a safety hazard because an inmate can use them to harm themselves or escape from the\ninstitution. Therefore, the OIG recommends that the BOP evaluate its cell search procedures and make\nchanges as may be appropriate to improve those procedures through policy, training, or other measures.\n® U.S. DOJ OIG, Analysis of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Fiscal Year 2ol9 Overtime Hours and Costs, Management Advisory\nMemorandum 2l-oll (December 2o2o); U.S. DOJ OIG, Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Use of Restrictive Housing\nfor Inmates with Mental Illness, Evaluation and Inspections Division Report l7-o5 (July 2ol7); U.S. DOJ OIG, Audit of the\nFederal Bureau of Prisons' Contract No. DJBPOo6l6BPAl2oo4 Awarded to Spectrum Services, Inc., Victorville, California, Audit\nDivision Report l7-2o (March 2ol7); U.S. DOJ OIG, Audit of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Contract with CoreCivic, Inc. to\nOperate the Adams County Correctional Center in Natchez, Mississippi, Audit Division Report l7-o8 (December 2ol6); U.S.\nDOJ OIG, Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons' Medical Staffing Challenges, Evaluation and Inspections Division Report\nl6-o2 (March 2ol6); U.S. DOJ OIG, Review of the Impact of an Aging Inmate Population on the Federal Bureau of Prisons,\nEvaluation and Inspections Division Report l5-o5 (May 2ol5).
