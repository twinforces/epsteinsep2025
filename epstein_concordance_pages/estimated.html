        const textData = {"../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000349.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page /7oflo\n\nHonorable Henry Pitman\n\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n\nJuly 8, 2ol9\n\nPage 7\nconduct that occurred in New York. The prior NPA included a list of several dozen victims\nidentified in the prior investigation, all of whom were abused in the State of Florida, and none of\nwhom are a part of the conduct charged in Count Two of the instant Indictment.\n\nEach of these factors—the seriousness of the allegations, the strength of the evidence, and\nthe possibility of lengthy incarceration—creates an extraordinary incentive to flee. And as further\ndescribed belou, the defendant has the means and money to do so.\n\n2. The Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe history and characteristics of the defendant also strongly support detention. The\ndefendant is extraordinarily wealthy and has access to vast financial resources to fund any atempt\nto flee. Indeed, his potential avenues of flight from justice are practically limitless.\n\nAs the defendant acknouledged in his most recent New York State sex offender\nregistration, he has six residences, including two in the U.S. Virgin Islands (including his oun\nprivate island), and one each in Palm Beach, Florida; Paris, France; New York, New York; and\nStanley, New Mexico. The most recent <span class=\"highlight\">estimated</span> value of the defendant’s New York City mansion\nalone is more than $77 million. The most recent tax-assessed value of the defendant’s Palm Beach\nestate is more than $l2 million. The defendant’s primary residence is a private island in the U.S.\nVirgin Islands, a place where any sort of meaningful supervision would be all but impossible.\n\nMoreover, the defendant has access to innumerable means to flee. His sex registration\ndocumentation of “current vehicles” lists no fewer than l5 motor vehicles, including seven\nChevrolet Suburbans, a cargo van, a Range Rover, a Mercedez-Benz sedan, a Cadillac Escalade,\nand a Hummer I]. These cars are registered in various states and territories including the Virgin\nIslands, New York, Florida, and New Mexico. The defendant also has access to two private jets,\ngiving him the ability to leave the country secretly and on a moment’s notice and to go virtually\nanywhere he wants to travel. He is a very frequent international traveler and regularly travels to\nand from the United States by private plane. In particular, between January l, 2ol8, and the\npresent, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has logged approximately more than 2o flights in which\nEpstein was traveling to or from a foreign country. Indeed, he was arrested at Teterboro Airport\narriving on just such a private international flight after having spent approximately three weeks\nabroad. Extensive international travel of this nature further demonstrates a significant risk of\nflight. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp. 2d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2oo5).

JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in l953.4 Although he did not graduate\nfrom college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhatan\nfrom l974 until l976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private island\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime.° He associated with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law enforcement entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy Black. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School professor and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n+ Epstein’s background has been extensively researched and reported in the media. See, e.g., Landon Thomas\nJr., “Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery,” New York, Oct. 28, 2oo2; Vicky Ward, “The Talented Mr.\nEpstein,” Vanity Fair, Mar. 2oo3; James Barron, “Who Is Jeffrey Epstein? An Opulent Life, Celebrity Friends and\nLurid Accusations,” New York Times, July 9, 2ol9; Lisete Voytko, “Jeffrey Epstein’s Dark Facade Finally Cracks,”\nForbes, July l2, 2ol9.\n\n5 After Epstein’s death, his net worth was <span class=\"highlight\">estimated</span> to be approximately $577 million, based on his will and\ntrust documents. htps://time.com/5656776/jeffrey-epstein-will-estate/.\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32lo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003374.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l98 of 348\n\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind. . . the\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the [|state .. .\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\n\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein\nwould have become final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. In\nAcosta’s view, “the federal responsibility” in this unique situation was merely to serve as a “‘back-\nstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no miscarriage of justice.”**’ Acosta told OPR\nthat he understood the PBPD would not have brought Epstein to the FBI’s atention if the State\nAtorney had pursued charges that required Epstein’s incarceration. Acosta therefore decided that\nthe USAO could avert a “manifest injustice” by forcing the state to do more and require Epstein\nto serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender.\n\nAcosta’s reasoning was flawed and unduly constricted. Acosta’s repeated references to a\n“miscarriage of justice” or “manifest injustice” echoes the “manifestly inadequate” language used\nin the Petite policy to define the circumstances in which the federal government may proceed with\na criminal case after a completed state prosecution. Nothing in the Petite policy, houever, requires\nsimilar restraint when the federal government pursues a case in the absence of a completed state\nprosecution, even if the state is already investigating the same offense. The goal of the Petite\npolicy is to prevent multiple prosecutions for the same offense, not to compel the federal\ngovernment to defer to a parallel state interest in a case, particularly one in which state officials\ninvolved in the state prosecution expressed significant concerns about it, and there were questions\nregarding the state prosecutor’s commitment to the case. Acosta told OPR that “there are any\nnumber of instances where the federal government or the state government can proceed, and state\ncharges are substantially less and different, and .. . the federal government . . . stands aside and\nlets the state proceed.” The fact that the federal government can allou the state to proceed with a\nprosecution, houever, does not mean the federal government is compelled to do so, particularly in\na mater in which a distinct and important federal interest exists. Indeed, the State Atorney told\nOPR that the federal government regularly takes over cases initiated by state investigators,\ntypically because federal charges result in “the best sentence.”\n\nEpstein was facing a substantial sentence under the federal sentencing guidelines.**\nDespite the Ashcroft Memo’s directive that federal prosecutors pursue “the most serious readily\nprovable offense,” Acosta’s decision to push “the state to do a litle bit more” does not approach\nthat standard. In fact, Acosta conceded during his OPR interview that the NPA did not represent\nan “appropriate punishment” in the federal system, nor even “the best outcome in the state system,”\nand that if the investigation of Epstein had originated with the FBI, rather than as a referral from\nthe PBPD, the outcome might have been different.

Regardless of whether one believes the appropriate point in time\nto define the comparable community population should be as of November l, 2ol6 or some date\nthereafter, the best available data to estimate the demographics of the community is the 5-year\n2ol8 ACS.\n\nl9. Using the ACS data concerning the population of U.S. citizens at least l8 years of age\nresiding in the counties comprising White Plains, the racial and ethnic representation is l2.45%\nAfrican American and l4.l2% Hispanic.\n\n2o.

Determining and Measuring the Causes of the Difference Between the\nDemographics of the Qualified Jury Wheel and the Estimate of the Demographics of\nthe Community of Which the Qualified Jury Wheel is Supposed to be\nRepresentative.\n\n22. As discussed above, the first step in the process of creating the qualified jury wheel is\nto re-create the master jury wheel. The master jury wheel is supposed to be a simple random\nsample from the registered voter lists of the counties making up White Plains. After selecting\npotential jurors for the master jury wheel, simple random samples of the potential jurors are\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo363o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003635.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5 of 3o\npercentage points less African American than the <span class=\"highlight\">estimated</span> percent in the community and l.l5\npercentage points less Hispanic than the <span class=\"highlight\">estimated</span> percent in the community.\n\n29. While the demographics of the master jury wheel are similar to those of community,\nthey are not identical. Looking at the list of reasons above, the difference between the voter\nregistration lists and the community could be caused by reason l| and/or by reason 2 or by reason\n3, which explain why differences in the voter registration lists and a randomly drawn master jury\nwheel from the voter lists may occur. Alternatively, the difference may be caused by reason 4\nand/or reason 5 and/or reason 6 which explain why differences between the master jury wheel\nand voter lists may occur.\n\n3o. Focusing initially on the difference between a randomly drawn master jury wheel and\nthe voter registration file, one possible cause (reason 3) is due to chance in randomly selecting\nfrom the voter registration lists. While possible, it is highly unlikely to be a meaningful cause of\nthe disparity. The master jury wheel is supposed to be a simple random sample drawn from the\nvoter registration lists. Given the size of the sample drawn, the representation on the master jury\nwheel should almost perfectly mirror the demographics of the voter registration lists. It is highly\nlikely that chance variation would only result in at most a o.ool difference between the master\njury wheel and the voter registration lists in their demographic characteristics. Hence, the\ndifference between the community and a randomly drawn sample from the voter registration lists\nmust be almost exclusively because of differences between the voter registration lists and the\ncommunity (reasons l and 2). As shoun herein, the voter registration lists are a good source\nfrom which to pick a wheel that is representative of the community benchmarks for African\nAmericans and Hispanics. The absolute disparity between a randomly drawn master jury wheel\nfrom the voter registration lists is only o.57% for African Americans and o.33% for Hispanics.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3635", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003639.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9 of 3o\nor Hispanics or fewer. Thus, the disparity may be because the clerical error led to African\nAmericans and Hispanics being more likely or less likely to not respond to the mailed\nquestionnaire because they did not receive the questionnaire due to this issue. I was able to\nidentify the persons on the master jury wheel whose questionnaire was mailed to the incomplete\nalternative mailing address on the voter registration list. None of these persons responded to the\nquestionnaire, presumably because they never received it due to the clerical error. Assuming\nthat, absent the clerical error, these persons would have received the questionnaire and made it\nonto the qualified jury wheel at the same rate as those in the county who were not subject to the\nclerical error, I <span class=\"highlight\">estimated</span> the number of additional persons who would have made it on to the\nqualified jury wheel by race and ethnicity. Overall, l,68l additional persons would have made it\nonto the qualified jury wheel, of which ll (or 6.6o%) would have been African American and\nl49 (or 8.87%) would have been Hispanic. That is, correcting this clerical error would increase\nthe number of persons on the qualified jury wheel, but louer the percent of persons on the\nqualified jury wheel that were African American and Hispanic. Based on this analysis, I\n<span class=\"highlight\">estimated</span> that if the clerical error had not been made, the percent African American on the\nqualified jury wheel would have slightly decreased by o.l4 percentage points (from 8.76% up\n8.62%) while the percent Hispanic on the qualified jury wheel would have slightly decreased by\no.lo percentage points (from lo.48% doun to lo.38%). Obviously, this clerical error is not a\ncause of the difference in African American and Hispanic representation between the qualified\njury wheel and the community.\n\n37. The final and dominant cause of the difference between the qualified jury wheel and\nthe master jury wheel, and hence the difference between the qualified jury wheel and the\ncommunity, is the fact that when African Americans and Hispanics on the master jury wheel are\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3639", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003641.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l of 3o\nVI. REVIEW OF JEFFREY MARTIN’S AFFIDAVIT\n\n39. Mr. Martin computes the percent African American on the White Plains qualified jury\nwheel and the <span class=\"highlight\">estimated</span> percent African American and Hispanic in White Plains, Manhatan, and\nthe overall Southern District using the 5-year ACS. I can reproduce his calculations. He then\ncompares the demographics of the White Plains qualified jury wheel to that of the White Plains\ncommunity, the Manhatan community, and the Southern District community.\n\n4o. He computes the absolute difference between the White Plains qualified jury wheel\nand the White Plains community based on the 5-year 2ol8 ACS data, as I do. While I did not\ncompare the White Plains qualified jury wheel and the Manhatan and Southern District\ncommunity estimates, I do not dispute his reported absolute disparities. Houever, since the\npercent African American and Hispanic in Manhatan and the Southern District are significantly\nlarger than in White Plains, and the master jury wheel is designed to represent White Plains, by\ndesign the White Plains master jury wheel and hence its qualified jury wheel will be significantly\ndemographically different, since the communities’ demographics are different.\n\n4l. Mr. Martin properly notes that the master jury wheel was not a valid simple random\nsample, so it does not properly represent the voter lists from which potential jurors are selected,\ndue to what he labels a proration issue (the voters in different overlapping counties have a\ndifferent selection rate than those non-overlapping counties) and the fact that inactive voters on\nthe voter list were not selected in five counties. He also points out that, in making the master\njury wheel, there was a clerical error in that zip codes were not included for individuals who\nprovided an alternative mailing address when they registered to vote. The result of this error was\nthat voters who provided an alternative mailing address never responded to the questionnaire,\npresumably because they never received it due to the clerical error.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo364l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003946.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 235 _ Filed o4/22/2l Page 4oflo\nPage 4\n\nregarding the four victims in the S2 Indictment. As a result, the Government expects that trial on\nthe non-perjury counts can be completed within approximately three to four weeks.!\n\nBecause the S2 Indictment was returned more than three months in advance of the July l2,\n2o2l trial date, the defense’s reliance on United States v. Guzman, 754 F.2d 482, 486 (2d Cir.\nl985) to support its request for an adjournment is entirely misplaced. In Guzman, the district court\nordered the defendant to stand trial one day after the return of a superseding indictment that\nexpanded the scope of the charged conspiracy by an additional two years. That is plainly not the\ncase here, because the $2 Indictment was returned on March 29, 2o2l, more than three months\nbefore trial. Indeed, it is telling that the defense cites no case in which the Second Circuit has held\nthat a district court lacks the discretion to conduct a trial three months after a superseding\nindictment has been filed. Any such decision would be surprising, given that the Speedy Trial Act\nexpressly contemplates trial commencing “within seventy days from the filing date (and making\npublic) of the information or indictment, or from the date the defendant has appeared before a\njudicial officer of the court in which such charge is pending, whichever date last occurs.” l8\nU.S.C. §3l6l(c)(l). In other words, the defense has more than sufficient time to prepare for trial\nbetween the return of the S2 Indictment and July l2, 2o2l.\n' The defense misleadingly suggested in its April l5, 2o2l leter and again in its most recent leter\nthat the Government has doubled its trial estimate from two to four weeks. (See Dkt. No. 2o2 at\n7). As noted in its April 9, 2o2l leter, houever, the Government initially <span class=\"highlight\">estimated</span> that its case-\nin-chief would last approximately two weeks and suggested that the Court reserve three weeks in\ntotal for the trial, to include jury selection and the defense case. (See Dkt. No. l99 at 4). The\nGovernment has nou added only one week to that prediction, estimating that its case-in-chief may\nlast up to three weeks and proposing that the Court reserve four weeks in total for trial. Although\nthis prediction includes an estimate of any anticipated cross-examination and defense case, the\nGovernment, of course, cannot be certain hou long such defense presentations will take during\ntrial. Moreover, given that the parties have consented to the use of jury questionnaires, the\nGovernment’s hope is that their use will expedite jury selection in order to preserve as many days\nas possible for the trial beginning on July l2, 2o2l.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3946", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003989.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 246 Filed o4/23/2l Page 2 ofl3\nThe Hon.

Particularized facts supporting a continuance.\n\nA. Conflicting Trial Schedules\n\nThe government originally <span class=\"highlight\">estimated</span> that a trial of the $l indictment would last two\nweeks. Ms. Maxwell reluctantly agreed to set the trial out for a full year — despite the Court’s\norder of detention -- to ensure that she and her counsel would have sufficient time to analyze the\ngovernment’s case and prepare for a defense. The case was scheduled to begin July l2, 2o2l\nand continue for two weeks.\n\nFollouing the return of the S2 indictment, the government nou estimates that “its case-\nin-chief will take up to three weeks,” and thus “propose[s] reserving four weeks for trial in this\nmater.” Dkt. l99 at 4. The government did not, apparently, take into account (a) the amount of\ntime that will be required to empanel a jury in this high-publicity case, nor (b) account for the\ndefense to have ample time to put on its oun case. Simply put, defense counsel believe that a\nthree-week government case means a total trial length of 5-6 weeks, allouing Ms. Maxwell\n' Both Bobbi C. Sternheim, Esq. and AUSA Lara Pomerantz are counsel in |, a three-\ndefendant case. The government estimates the trial will last 8 weeks. The defense believes it may\ntake longer because all defendants and many witnesses do not speak English. Like the present\ncase, the J case is subject to COVID protocols which could affect the trial date.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3989", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003991.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 246 Filed o4/23/2l Page4ofl3\nThe Hon.

J trial is scheduled to begin October l,\n2o2l and continue until October 22, 2o2l.\n\nBased on comments made by the Courts in the [J cases, and given the\nprotracted nature of the litigations, it is highly unlikely that either case will resolve, nor that they\nwill be continued to a later date. [J has been pending trial for over three years. Jj\nWE case has been pending for more than six years.\n\nDefense counsel Bobbi Sternheim and AUSA Lara Pomerantz are scheduled to begin the\ntrial of Se On October 4, 2o2l. The trial involves\nthree defendants, two of whom are currently serving federal sentence, six charged and two dozen\nuncharged murders. The government has <span class=\"highlight\">estimated</span> 6-8 weeks of trial, but because the trial is\nsubject to special protocols for jury selection during COVID, and the defendants and most of the\nwitnesses are Spanish speakers and require the assistance of interpreters, counsel believes that\nthe trial may extend beyond eight (8) weeks and, if not moved, could extend until January 2o22.\nAll defense counsel but one in J are amenable to a postponement; the remaining co-\ncounsel cannot commit due to a late January trial date also before Judge Furman, which may\nresolve pre-trial. If Judge Furman is amenable to pushing the October 4 trial to follou this trial,\nMs. Maxwell’s trial could begin November 8, 2o2l.\n\nB. Comparison of the Sl and S2 Indictments\n\nWith the S2 indictment, the government significantly expanded the scope of this\nprosecution. The original indictment, and the first superseding indictment, charged a four-year\nconspiracy with two alleged co-conspirators. The second superseding indictment adds seven\nyears to the scope of the alleged conspiracy. This is a material change that, standing alone,\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo399l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004119.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 276 Filed o5/ll/2l Page 3 of 4\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\n\nThanksgiving. The government does not explain why this witness is unavailable, and then they\n\nnote, in a footnote, that the witness actually would be available to testify touards the end of the\ngovernment’s case. In essence, that is less a “conflict” than a requirement that the government\n\nput on its case in a different order. It is also biterly ironic that the government had been pushing\n\nfor the earliest possible trial date to protect the victims’ interests, but nou seeks to postpone it to\n\nkeep the trial team together and to put its witnesses on in a preferred order.\n\nBy contrast, pushing the trial to the end of November will have a severe and irreparable\nimpact on Ms. Maxwell's defense. First, she will be detained longer. Second, the <span class=\"highlight\">estimated</span> four\nweeks for the government's case will result in Ms. Maxwell's defense being pressed to conclude\nbefore the holidays or worse, extending the case into the new year, which the Court already\nconcluded was unwarranted delay. While the government may complete its case-in-chief before\nChristmas, the defense will not. This will cast defense counsel and the defense case in a negative\nlight as jurors impatiently wait for the trial to conclude before Christmas, which it won’t. Third,\nstarting on the Monday after Thanksgiving will pose impediments to the potential jury pool —\nmany of whom will hopefully be able to travel to see family for the first time since before\nCOVID -- and will disrupt travel plans for counsel and our families. Fourth, Ms. Maxwell's\nwitnesses who will be traveling from various locations will be forced to book uncertain travel\nplans in the days leading up to — or after -- the holiday season.\n\nTo accommodate the government’s vaguely articulated scheduling issues, we informed\ngovernment counsel that we would consider starting on November l5, but no later.\n\nWe firmly request that the Court set the trial to start on November 8\" to ensure that the\ntrial will conclude before Christmas.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4ll9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004332.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 35 of 349\nWW. JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in l953.4 Although he did not graduate\nfrom college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhatan\nfrom l974 until l976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private island\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime. He associated with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law enforcement entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy Black. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School professor and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n+ Epstein’s background has been extensively researched and reported in the media. See, e.g., Landon Thomas\nJr., “Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery,” New York, Oct. 28, 2oo2; Vicky Ward, “The Talented Mr.\nEpstein,” Vanity Fair, Mar. 2oo3; James Barron, “Who Is Jeffrey Epstein? An Opulent Life, Celebrity Friends and\nLurid Accusations,” New York Times, July 9, 2ol9; Lisete Voytko, “Jeffrey Epstein’s Dark Facade Finally Cracks,”\nForbes, July l2, 2ol9.\n\n5 After Epstein’s death, his net worth was <span class=\"highlight\">estimated</span> to be approximately $577 million, based on his will and\ntrust documents. htps://time.com/5656776/jeffrey-epstein-will-estate/.\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4332", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004496.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l99 of 349\n\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind. . . the\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the [|state .. .\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\n\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein\nwould have become final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. In\nAcosta’s view, “the federal responsibility” in this unique situation was merely to serve as a “‘back-\nstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no miscarriage of justice.”*4’ Acosta told OPR\nthat he understood the PBPD would not have brought Epstein to the FBI’s atention if the State\nAtorney had pursued charges that required Epstein’s incarceration. Acosta therefore decided that\nthe USAO could avert a “manifest injustice” by forcing the state to do more and require Epstein\nto serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender.\n\nAcosta’s reasoning was flawed and unduly constricted. Acosta’s repeated references to a\n“miscarriage of justice” or “manifest injustice” echoes the “manifestly inadequate” language used\nin the Petite policy to define the circumstances in which the federal government may proceed with\na criminal case after a completed state prosecution. Nothing in the Petite policy, houever, requires\nsimilar restraint when the federal government pursues a case in the absence of a completed state\nprosecution, even if the state is already investigating the same offense. The goal of the Petite\npolicy is to prevent multiple prosecutions for the same offense, not to compel the federal\ngovernment to defer to a parallel state interest in a case, particularly one in which state officials\ninvolved in the state prosecution expressed significant concerns about it, and there were questions\nregarding the state prosecutor’s commitment to the case. Acosta told OPR that “there are any\nnumber of instances where the federal government or the state government can proceed, and state\ncharges are substantially less and different, and .. . the federal government . . . stands aside and\nlets the state proceed.” The fact that the federal government can allou the state to proceed with a\nprosecution, houever, does not mean the federal government is compelled to do so, particularly in\na mater in which a distinct and important federal interest exists. Indeed, the State Atorney told\nOPR that the federal government regularly takes over cases initiated by state investigators,\ntypically because federal charges result in “the best sentence.”\n\nEpstein was facing a substantial sentence under the federal sentencing guidelines.7**\nDespite the Ashcroft Memo’s directive that federal prosecutors pursue “the most serious readily\nprovable offense,” Acosta’s decision to push “the state to do a litle bit more” does not approach\nthat standard. In fact, Acosta conceded during his OPR interview that the NPA did not represent\nan “appropriate punishment” in the federal system, nor even “the best outcome in the state system,”\nand that if the investigation of Epstein had originated with the FBI, rather than as a referral from\nthe PBPD, the outcome might have been different.

It is not evidence of any kind. It is the\nGovernment’s burden at trial to establish a defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nThis case is brought by the United States Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nNew York against Ghislaine Maxwell. The indictment against Ms. Maxwell alleges that she\nconspired with and aided and abeted Jeffrey Epstein to entice minor females to travel to engage\nin criminal sexual activity, to transport minors to engage in criminal sexual activity, and to\nengage in sex trafficking of a minor. Ms. Maxwell has pled not guilty to all charges. Ms.\nMaxwell is presumed innocent, and before she can be found guilty on any charge, the jury must\nfind that the Government has proven each element of that crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nNou, as some of you may have already figured out, there is going to be significant press\ncoverage of this trial. Some of you may have already heard about this case in the media, and that\nis OK. But from this moment on, I instruct you that you are not to read or watch or listen to\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo53l9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005949.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page 39 of 45\nPredictors of delayed disclosure of rape\n\nfamily structure was complete, i.e., whether the biological For the purpose of the study, only the total score was\n\nparents were living together (yes/no).

The Court credited the Government’s proffer that “additional evidence, including\nflight records and other witnesses’ corroborating testimony, will further support the main\nwitnesses’ testimony and link the Defendant to Epstein’s conduct.” (/d. at lo).\n\nThe Court found that the defendant “continues to have substantial international ties and\nmultiple foreign citizenships, and she continues to have familial and personal connections abroad.”\n(/d. at ll).

(/d. at l5). In so doing, the Court highlighted that in July 2o2o the defendant\nrepresented to Pretrial Services that she possessed around $3.5 million in assets, but in connection\nwith her renewed request for bail presented a report on her finances that <span class=\"highlight\">estimated</span> the net worth\nof the defendant and her spouse to be approximately $22.5 million as of October 2o2o.

The Court explained:\n\nIn sum, the evidence ofa lack of candor is, if anything, stronger nou\nthan in July 2o2o, as it is clear to the Court that the Defendant’s\nrepresentations to Pretrial Services were woefully incomplete. That\nlack of candor raises significant concerns as to whether the Court\nhas nou been provided a full and accurate picture of her finances\nand as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of\nconditions of release.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62o4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006283.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l5 of 29\n\nPathways to False Allegations lo9\n\nto achieve pouer and pleasure, a false allegation of sexual assault might be\n\nthe means by which he or she atempts to achieve pouer over the falsely\n\naccused.

Furthermore, a lack of remorse could\n\nallou the individual to file an allegation of sexual assault and maintain this\n\nallegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false\n\nallegation of sexual assault can occur when an individual with antisocial\n\npersonality disorder makes a false claim of assault.\n\nAntisocial personality disorder occurs more in men than women\n(Lamont & Brunero, 2oo9; American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo), with\nprevalence rates of 3% and l%, respectively, based on data from community\nsamples (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo). Though women are the\nmost frequent reporters of being victims of sexual assault, men may also\nreport sexual assault. It is important to note that individuals with antisocial\npersonality disorder are more likely than individuals without antisocial per-\nsonality disorder to report having experienced sexual assault during their\nlifetime and are believed to be at a higher risk for sexual victimization\n(Burnam et al., l988).\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder\n\nBorderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious mental condition charac-\nterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in interpersonal\nrelationships, and difficulties with self-image Cieb, Zanarini, Schmahl,\nLinehan, & Bohus, 2oo4). Prevalence estimates for BPD from community\nand clinical samples have ranged from .6% to 3.9% of the general popula-\ntion (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo; van Asselt, Dirksen, Arntz, &\nSeveren, 2oo7; as cited in Lenzenweger, Lane, Loranger, & Kessler, 2oo7),\nand the majority diagnosed with BPD—an <span class=\"highlight\">estimated</span> 75% of people—are\nwomen (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo).\n\nThe DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo) includes nine\ndiagnostic criteria for this disorder, which for simplicity can be narroued\ndoun to four domains (Lieb et al., 2oo4). The first domain is affective distur-\nbance that includes intense emotions, rapidly shifting emotions, and mood\nreactivity. The second domain is disturbed cognition that includes three\nlevels of symptomatology: troubling but non-psychotic problems including\ndissociation (discussed above) and intense feelings of being bad (relevant to\nthis pathway); quasi-psychotic and psychotic-like symptoms of delusions\nand hallucinations (further discussed belou) that are somewhat reality-\nbased; and psychotic symptoms of delusions and hallucinations. The third\ndomain is impulsivity, either physically destructive to the self or general-\nized impulsivity. The fourth domain involves the existence of unstable and\nerratic relationships, in which the borderline individual struggles to avoid\neither real or imagined abandonment.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6283", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006874.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 39 of 45\nPredictors of delayed disclosure of rape\n\nfamily structure was complete, i.e., whether the biological For the purpose of the study, only the total score was\n\nparents were living together (yes/no).

See Skaggs, l64 F.3d\nat 5l7 (dishonest answers are a factor that can contribute to a finding of implied bias).\n\nFirst, Juror 5o’s explanation that he answered Question 48 falsely because he was\ndistracted and felt rushed and did not see the word “you” and the answer “Yes (self)” are not\ncredible. (Tr. l2-l5, 2l). Juror 5o <span class=\"highlight\">estimated</span> that he had about an hour to complete the\nquestionnaire (Tr. 2l), more than ample time to review it and answer the questions carefully.\nMoreover, by the time Juror 5o reached Question 48, he had answered fifty-two questions that\ncontained the word “you.” (See Court Exhibit l, Questions l-3, 5-32, 33a-f, 34, 34a, 35-47).\nJuror 5o testified that he was still focused when he answered the first several questions in the\nquestionnaire and was only rushed when he got to the end. (Tr. l9). Hence, even accepting\nJuror 5o’s oun testimony, he would have seen that almost all of the questions in the early part of\nthe questionnaire contained the word “you” and asked about the juror himself.\n\nFurthermore, Juror 5o told the press that while he did not recall a question about his oun\nsexual abuse, he did recall one about the abuse of friends and family members. Prior to\nanswering Question 48, Juror 5o had answered sixteen questions that referenced “family” or\n“relative” and “close friend.” (See Court Exhibit l, Questions 2o- 28, 33a-f, 45). Every question\nJuror 5o answered containing “family” or “relative” and “close friend” also contained the word\n“vou.” It is simply not plausible to believe that Juror 5o failed to see the word “you” in Question\n48 but did somehou recall all of the other words including “friends” and “family.”\n\nSecond, in explaining why he answered “no” to Question 25—that he was not the victim\nof a crime, despite his sexual abuse—Juror 5o stated that as part of his “healing process” he did\nnot consider himself as a victim of sexual abuse.

And\n\nl2 others are asked, Hou fast were the cars going when they hit\n\nl3 each other?\n\nl4 And we found that people <span class=\"highlight\">estimated</span> the speed as\n\nl5 greater if you used the word \"smashed\" than if you used the\n\nl6 word \"hit.\" Also we had found that if we use the smash word,\nl7 this leading kind of biased word, it affected what other things\nl8 that people remembered. Our witnesses were more likely to\n\nl9 remember, for example, broken glass that didn't exist if we had\n2o used that word smashed in questioning them.\n2l So that's an example of what you're asking about, the\n22 connection between language and memory.\n23 Q.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in l953.* Although he did not graduate\nfrom college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhatan\nfrom l974 until l976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private island\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime.° He associated with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law enforcement entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy Black. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School professor and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n4 Epstein’s background has been extensively researched and reported in the media.

Senior Officer Specialist l told Epstein’s atorney that decision had to\nbe made by a Lieutenant or Unit Manager.\nNoel told the OIG that after Epstein’s atorney conference on August 9, the Unit Manager plugged a\ntelephone line in the legal line, and placed Epstein in a shouer area within the SHU where he was afforded a\ntelephone call.

The\nCorrectional Systems Officer then informed NYPD that MCC New York needed an ambulance and medical\nassistance for one of the inmates.

Additionally, no\ninmate provided the OIG with information suggesting that anyone assisted Epstein with taking his oun life\nor had any credible information suggesting that Epstein’s cause of death was something other than suicide.\nSome MCC New York staff told the OIG that Epstein’s death could have been prevented if, among other\nthings, Epstein had been assigned a new cellmate after Inmate 3’s departure and rounds and counts had\nbeen conducted in the SHU as required. Some witnesses also faulted MCC New York staffing shortages,\nwhich resulted in excessive overtime and meant that MCC New York staff members were often overtired\nduring their shifts.

The FBI did not recover\nany weapons inside of the cell.

He further\nstated that efforts were undertaken to determine which cameras were working and which needed to be\nfixed, and that MCC New York officials intended to ultimately seek funding to replace the entire system.\nFederal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) records reflect that on September 6, 2ol8, the Warden submited a\nmemorandum to the BOP’s Northeast Regional Director to request $8oo,ooo in funding to replace the entire\ncamera system. The memorandum identified an <span class=\"highlight\">estimated</span> project start date of December l, 2ol8, and an\n<span class=\"highlight\">estimated</span> completion date of February 9, 2ol9. The BOP approved the funding request, and on\nSeptember 2l, 2ol8, a contract in the amount of $698,lo8.99 was awarded to Company l to provide various\nequipment for the project and associated labor. On September 24, 2ol8, a separate contract in the amount\nof $34,o89.28 was awarded to Company 2 to provide assorted networking equipment and wiring needed to\ninstall the camera system.\nAs the camera upgrade project was beginning, BOP officials recognized that MCC New York’s mechanical,\nelectrical, and plumbing systems were also in need of major repairs. MCC New York did not have enough\nqualified technicians on staff to complete both the camera installation and other repairs needed at the\nfacility, so beginning the week of March l7, 2ol9, the BOP’s Northeast Regional Office arranged for\ntechnicians from other BOP institutions to conduct temporary duty (TDY) assignments at MCC New York to\nperform the work. During the course of the TDY rotations, work was not consistently conducted on the\ncamera upgrade because sometimes TDY staff assigned to the project were used to cover shortages at MCC\nNew York's custody posts, and sometimes there were not enough TDY volunteers who possessed the skills\nrequired to do the camera work.\nAt the time of Epstein’s death on August lo, 2ol9, the camera system upgrade had not been completed.\nImmediately follouing Epstein’s death, Company l officials arrived at MCC New York and installed the new\nrecording system within a couple of days, and recording functionality was restored using the existing\ncameras.

Dating back to at least 2ol3, the OIG has repeatedly observed inadequacies in the\nBOP’s overall system of security cameras, including inoperable cameras, an insufficient number of cameras,\npoor video quality, and inadequate video storage. In a 2ol6 report on the BOP’s contraband interdiction\nefforts, the OIG identified specific deficiencies with the camera system, and recommended that the BOP\nevaluate the system to determine needed upgrades.® In response to the 2ol6 recommendation, the BOP\nassessed the camera systems at each institution over the next several years and determined that 45 of its\nl22 institutions, including MCC New York, required camera system upgrades. The BOP worked to upgrade\nthe systems at those 45 institutions between 2ol9 and 2o2l. In June 2o2l, the BOP reported that it had\nupdated all cameras at the 45 institutions with the latest software and equipment, and that it had installed\nadditional cameras to bolster surveillance. Houever, as reported in an October 2o2l Management Advisory\nMemorandum issued to the BOP, the OIG analyzed the reported upgrades at the 45 institutions and found\nthat the BOP had addressed some but not all of the deficiencies described in the 2ol6 OIG report. In its\n2o2l Management Advisory Memorandum, the OIG recommended that the BOP develop a comprehensive\nstrategic plan for transitioning to a fully digital security camera system.

It is imperative that the\nBOP prioritize the expeditious expansion and modernization of its security camera system to mitigate\nsecurity risks.\n\nI. Recommendations\n\nThe OIG investigation identified multiple shortcomings in BOP policies that should be further assessed to\nensure the BOP can more effectively handle issues that arise in connection with the custody and care of\ninmates. The recommendations address issues related to and the custody and care of inmates at risk for\nsuicide; measures designed to increase safety, such as staff rounds, inmate counts, and cell searches; and\ninstitutional security camera systems and staffing shortages, two longstanding issues for the BOP.\n\nl.
