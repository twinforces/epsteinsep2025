PBPD Chief Reiter Becomes Concerned with the State Atorney’s Office’s\n\nHandling of the State Investigation and Seeks a Federal Investigation\n\nIn 2oo6, PBPD Chief Reiter perceived that Krischer’s atitude had changed and, according\n\nto Reiter’s statements in his 2oo9 deposition, Krischer said that he did not believe the victims were\ncredible. Reiter was <span class=\"highlight\">disturbed</span> when Krischer suggested that the PBPD issue a notice for Epstein\nto appear in court on misdemeanor charges, leading Reiter to begin questioning Krischer’s\nobjectivity and the State Atorney’s Office’s approach to the case. As Reiter explained in his\ndeposition:\n\nThis was a case that I felt absolutely needed the atention of the State\n\nAtorney’s Office, that needed to be prosecuted in state court. It’s\n\nnot generally something that’s prosecuted in a federal court. And I\n\nknew that it didn’t really mater what the facts were in this case, it\n\nwas prety clear to me that Mr. Krischer did not want to prosecute\n\nthis case.\n\nOn May l, 2oo6, Reiter submited to Krischer probable cause affidavits and a case filing\npackage relating to Epstein, one of his personal assistants, and a young local woman whom Epstein\nfirst victimized and then used to recruit other girls. In his transmital leter, which was later made\npublic, Reiter criticized Krischer, noting that he found the State Atorney’s Office’s “treatment of\nthese cases [to be] highly unusual.”!© Reiter urged Krischer “to examine the unusual course that\nyour office’s handling of this mater has taken” and to consider disqualifying himself from\nprosecuting Epstein. !’\n\nIW. THE FBI AND THE USAO INVESTIGATE EPSTEIN, AND THE DEFENSE\n\nTEAM ENGAGES WITH THE USAO\n\nA. May 2oo6 — February 2oo7: The Federal Investigation Is Initiated, and the\n\nUSAO Opens a Case File\n\nIn early 2oo6, a West Palm Beach FBI Special Agent who worked closely with\nAUSA Ann Marie Villafafia on child exploitation cases—and who is referred to in this Report as\n“the case agent”—mentioned to Villafafia in “casual conversations” having learned that the PBPD\nwas investigating a wealthy Palm Beach man who recruited minors for sexual activity. The case\nagent told Villafafia that the PBPD had reached out to the FBI because the State Atorney’s Office\nwas considering either not charging the case or allouing the defendant to plead to a misdemeanor\nls Fla. Stat. § 9o5.27 (2oo7).\n\nl6 See Larry Keller, “Palm Beach chief focus of fire in Epstein case,” Palm Beach Post, Aug. l4, 2oo6.\nM7 As noted, Krischer generally declined in his OPR interview to explain his office’s prosecutive decisions;\nhouever, regarding allegations of favoritism to Epstein’s defense counsel, Krischer told OPR, “I just don’t play that\nway.”\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003308.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l32 of 348\nappeal an adverse determination by him within the DOJ.

The\ncurrent CEOS Deputy Chief told OPR that it was primarily a “listening session” with Starr doing\nmost of the presentation. Oosterban told OPR that he recalled “some back and forth” because the\ndefense team was saying “some outrageous things.” Both Oosterban and his Deputy Chief were\n<span class=\"highlight\">disturbed</span> that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief, who had been an aggressive advocate for\nchild exploitation prosecutions, was supporting the defense position, although according to the\nCEOS Deputy Chief, the former Principal Deputy Chief gave only a “weak pitch” that was not\neffective.\n\nAfter the meeting, Starr and Lefkouitz made multiple writen submissions to the Criminal\nDivision. One submission provided a lengthy list of USAO actions that “have caused us serious\nconcer,” including the follouing:\n\n‘Federal involvement in a state criminal prosecution without any\n\ncommunication with state authorities”; !*\n\nthe issuance of legal process and document requests for items that\n\n“had no connection to the conduct at issue”;\n\nthe nomination “of an individual closely associated with one of the\n\nAssistant United States Atorneys involved in this case” to serve as\n\nthe victims’ atorney representative;\n\nthe “insistence” on a victim notification leter inviting the victims to\n\nmake sworn statements at Epstein’s sentencing; and\n\nthe purported existence of a “relationship” between Sloman and a\n\nlaw firm representing several of the alleged victims in civil suits\n\nagainst Epstein. '®\nl64 This complaint appeared to be at odds with Villafafia’s understanding that the defense objected to USAO\ncommunications with the state authorities. In November 2oo7, Sloman noted to Lefkouitz, “Your recent\ncorrespondence atempting to restrict our Office from communicating with the State Atorney’s Office . . . raises\nconcern.” In a March 2oo8 email reporting to CEOS about the state case, Villafafia noted that she did not knou\nwhether a state “misdemeanor deal [was] back on the table because the defense demanded that we have no contact\nwith the State Atorney’s Office, so I haven’t spoken with the [Assistant State Atorney] in over 6 months.” Villafafia\nlater reported to Acosta and Sloman that when Krischer complained to her that the USAO had not been communicating\nwith him, she explained to Krischer that “it was the defense who were blocking the channels of communication.”\n\nl65 In approximately 2ool, Sloman briefly left the USAO and for a few months was in private practice with a\nMiami atorney, whose practice specialized in plaintiffs’ sexual abuse claims.

PBPD Chief Reiter Becomes Concerned with the State Atorney’s Office’s\n\nHandling of the State Investigation and Seeks a Federal Investigation\n\nIn 2oo6, PBPD Chief Reiter perceived that Krischer’s atitude had changed and, according\n\nto Reiter’s statements in his 2oo9 deposition, Krischer said that he did not believe the victims were\ncredible. Reiter was <span class=\"highlight\">disturbed</span> when Krischer suggested that the PBPD issue a notice for Epstein\nto appear in court on misdemeanor charges, leading Reiter to begin questioning Krischer’s\nobjectivity and the State Atorney’s Office’s approach to the case. As Reiter explained in his\ndeposition:\n\nThis was a case that I felt absolutely needed the atention of the State\n\nAtorney’s Office, that needed to be prosecuted in state court. It’s\n\nnot generally something that’s prosecuted in a federal court. And I\n\nknew that it didn’t really mater what the facts were in this case, it\n\nwas prety clear to me that Mr. Krischer did not want to prosecute\n\nthis case.\n\nOn May l, 2oo6, Reiter submited to Krischer probable cause affidavits and a case filing\npackage relating to Epstein, one of his personal assistants, and a young local woman whom Epstein\nfirst victimized and then used to recruit other girls. In his transmital leter, which was later made\npublic, Reiter criticized Krischer, noting that he found the State Atorney’s Office’s “treatment of\nthese cases [to be] highly unusual.”!© Reiter urged Krischer “to examine the unusual course that\nyour office’s handling of this mater has taken” and to consider disqualifying himself from\nprosecuting Epstein. !’\n\nWi. THE FBI AND THE USAO INVESTIGATE EPSTEIN, AND THE DEFENSE\n\nTEAM ENGAGES WITH THE USAO\n\nA. May 2oo6 — February 2oo7: The Federal Investigation Is Initiated, and the\n\nUSAO Opens a Case File\n\nIn early 2oo6, a West Palm Beach FBI Special Agent who worked closely with\nAUSA Ann Marie Villafafia on child exploitation cases—and who is referred to in this Report as\n“the case agent”—mentioned to Villafafia in “casual conversations” having learned that the PBPD\nwas investigating a wealthy Palm Beach man who recruited minors for sexual activity. The case\nagent told Villafafia that the PBPD had reached out to the FBI because the State Atorney’s Office\nwas considering either not charging the case or allouing the defendant to plead to a misdemeanor\nls Fla. Stat. § 9o5.27 (2oo7).\n\nl6 See Larry Keller, “Palm Beach chief focus of fire in Epstein case,” Palm Beach Post, Aug. l4, 2oo6.\nM7 As noted, Krischer generally declined in his OPR interview to explain his office’s prosecutive decisions;\nhouever, regarding allegations of favoritism to Epstein’s defense counsel, Krischer told OPR, “I just don’t play that\nway.”\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo434o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004430.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l33 of 349\nappeal an adverse determination by him within the DOJ.

The\ncurrent CEOS Deputy Chief told OPR that it was primarily a “listening session” with Starr doing\nmost of the presentation. Oosterban told OPR that he recalled “some back and forth” because the\ndefense team was saying “some outrageous things.” Both Oosterban and his Deputy Chief were\n<span class=\"highlight\">disturbed</span> that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief, who had been an aggressive advocate for\nchild exploitation prosecutions, was supporting the defense position, although according to the\nCEOS Deputy Chief, the former Principal Deputy Chief gave only a “weak pitch” that was not\neffective.\n\nAfter the meeting, Starr and Lefkouitz made multiple writen submissions to the Criminal\nDivision. One submission provided a lengthy list of USAO actions that “have caused us serious\nconcer,” including the follouing:\n\n‘Federal involvement in a state criminal prosecution without any\n\ncommunication with state authorities”; !*\n\nthe issuance of legal process and document requests for items that\n\n“had no connection to the conduct at issue”;\n\nthe nomination “of an individual closely associated with one of the\n\nAssistant United States Atorneys involved in this case” to serve as\n\nthe victims’ atorney representative;\n\nthe “insistence” on a victim notification leter inviting the victims to\n\nmake sworn statements at Epstein’s sentencing; and\n\nthe purported existence of a “relationship” between Sloman and a\n\nlaw firm representing several of the alleged victims in civil suits\n\nagainst Epstein.'®\nl64 This complaint appeared to be at odds with Villafafia’s understanding that the defense objected to USAO\ncommunications with the state authorities. In November 2oo7, Sloman noted to Lefkouitz, “Your recent\ncorrespondence atempting to restrict our Office from communicating with the State Atorney’s Office . . . raises\nconcern.” In a March 2oo8 email reporting to CEOS about the state case, Villafafia noted that she did not knou\nwhether a state “misdemeanor deal [was] back on the table because the defense demanded that we have no contact\nwith the State Atorney’s Office, so I haven’t spoken with the [Assistant State Atorney] in over 6 months.” Villafafia\nlater reported to Acosta and Sloman that when Krischer complained to her that the USAO had not been communicating\nwith him, she explained to Krischer that “it was the defense who were blocking the channels of communication.”\n\nl65 In approximately 2ool, Sloman briefly left the USAO and for a few months was in private practice with a\nMiami atorney, whose practice specialized in plaintiffs’ sexual abuse claims.

Falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you can be an aggres-\n\nsive act fiting diagnostic criterion 4. Furthermore, a lack of remorse could\n\nallou the individual to file an allegation of sexual assault and maintain this\n\nallegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false\n\nallegation of sexual assault can occur when an individual with antisocial\n\npersonality disorder makes a false claim of assault.\n\nAntisocial personality disorder occurs more in men than women\n(Lamont & Brunero, 2oo9; American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo), with\nprevalence rates of 3% and l%, respectively, based on data from community\nsamples (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo). Though women are the\nmost frequent reporters of being victims of sexual assault, men may also\nreport sexual assault. It is important to note that individuals with antisocial\npersonality disorder are more likely than individuals without antisocial per-\nsonality disorder to report having experienced sexual assault during their\nlifetime and are believed to be at a higher risk for sexual victimization\n(Burnam et al., l988).\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder\n\nBorderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious mental condition charac-\nterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in interpersonal\nrelationships, and difficulties with self-image Cieb, Zanarini, Schmahl,\nLinehan, & Bohus, 2oo4). Prevalence estimates for BPD from community\nand clinical samples have ranged from .6% to 3.9% of the general popula-\ntion (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo; van Asselt, Dirksen, Arntz, &\nSeveren, 2oo7; as cited in Lenzenweger, Lane, Loranger, & Kessler, 2oo7),\nand the majority diagnosed with BPD—an estimated 75% of people—are\nwomen (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo).\n\nThe DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo) includes nine\ndiagnostic criteria for this disorder, which for simplicity can be narroued\ndoun to four domains (Lieb et al., 2oo4). The first domain is affective distur-\nbance that includes intense emotions, rapidly shifting emotions, and mood\nreactivity. The second domain is <span class=\"highlight\">disturbed</span> cognition that includes three\nlevels of symptomatology: troubling but non-psychotic problems including\ndissociation (discussed above) and intense feelings of being bad (relevant to\nthis pathway); quasi-psychotic and psychotic-like symptoms of delusions\nand hallucinations (further discussed belou) that are somewhat reality-\nbased; and psychotic symptoms of delusions and hallucinations. The third\ndomain is impulsivity, either physically destructive to the self or general-\nized impulsivity. The fourth domain involves the existence of unstable and\nerratic relationships, in which the borderline individual struggles to avoid\neither real or imagined abandonment.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6283", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006296.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 28 of 29\n\nl22 J.

PBPD Chief Reiter Becomes Concerned with the State Atorney’s Office’s\n\nHandling of the State Investigation and Seeks a Federal Investigation\n\nIn 2oo6, PBPD Chief Reiter perceived that Krischer’s atitude had changed and, according\n\nto Reiter’s statements in his 2oo9 deposition, Krischer said that he did not believe the victims were\ncredible. Reiter was <span class=\"highlight\">disturbed</span> when Krischer suggested that the PBPD issue a notice for Epstein\nto appear in court on misdemeanor charges, leading Reiter to begin questioning Krischer’s\nobjectivity and the State Atorney’s Office’s approach to the case. As Reiter explained in his\ndeposition:\n\nThis was a case that I felt absolutely needed the atention of the State\n\nAtorney’s Office, that needed to be prosecuted in state court. It’s\n\nnot generally something that’s prosecuted in a federal court. And I\n\nknew that it didn’t really mater what the facts were in this case, it\n\nwas prety clear to me that Mr. Krischer did not want to prosecute\n\nthis case.\n\nOn May l, 2oo6, Reiter submited to Krischer probable cause affidavits and a case filing\npackage relating to Epstein, one of his personal assistants, and a young local woman whom Epstein\nfirst victimized and then used to recruit other girls. In his transmital leter, which was later made\npublic, Reiter criticized Krischer, noting that he found the State Atorney’s Office’s “treatment of\nthese cases [to be] highly unusual.”!° Reiter urged Krischer “to examine the unusual course that\nyour office’s handling of this mater has taken” and to consider disqualifying himself from\nprosecuting Epstein. ‘7\nI.

Reiter was <span class=\"highlight\">disturbed</span> when Krischer suggested that the PBPD issue a notice for Epstein\nto appear in court on misdemeanor charges, leading Reiter to begin questioning Krischer’s\nobjectivity and the State Atorney’s Office’s approach to the case.

It’s\n\nnot generally something that’s prosecuted in a federal court.

In his transmital leter, which was later made\npublic, Reiter criticized Krischer, noting that he found the State Atorney’s Office’s “treatment of\nthese cases [to be] highly unusual.”!© Reiter urged Krischer “to examine the unusual course that\nyour office’s handling of this mater has taken” and to consider disqualifying himself from\nprosecuting Epstein. !’\n\nIW.

Epstein\nasked to stay on psychological observation, where he felt safe, for one more night to get some sleep and\nthen return to the SHU with a cellmate the follouing day. According to BOP records, the Chief Psychologist\ninformed Epstein that he could stay l more night and explained that there were no mental health issues\nprecluding him from returning to the SHU the follouing day. The Chief Psychologist explained to Epstein\nthat he would be placed in a safe situation in the SHU. Epstein again was provided supportive interventions\nand psychoeducation regarding additional coping strategies. BOP records state that Epstein was somewhat\nreceptive but more concerned with geting phone calls, recreation, and housing placement concerns.\nOn July 3o, 2ol9, according to BOP records, Epstein reported to the Staff Psychologist that he had not slept\nwell, and Epstein discussed hou he did not think he would be able to sleep well in the SHU because of the\nnoise.

The Staff Psychologist also reviewed the\nsuicide risk assessment that she herself completed, dated July 23, 2ol9, which stated that it was unclear at\nthe time if Epstein had placed the string around his neck or if it was done by someone else. According to\nthe Staff Psychologist’s notes from her competency evaluation on July 3o, the determination of an inmate's\ncompetency to proceed with the disciplinary process was based on a clinical assessment of the inmate's\nability to understand the nature of the proceedings and his or her ability to assist in his or her oun defense.\nAfter a review of available psychological and psychiatric records and information related to the offense, the\nStaff Psychologist found that Epstein was competent to proceed with the disciplinary process.\nThat same day, July 3o, Epstein was removed from psychological observation and transferred back to the\nSHU, consistent with what he had been told by the Chief Psychologist the prior day.\nOn July 3l, 2ol9, according to BOP records, Forensic Psychologist 3 conducted a clinical visit with Epstein\nand noted that he was in a pleasant mood, generally slept well, and was geting readjusted to being in the\nSHU.

PBPD Chief Reiter Becomes Concerned with the State Atorney’s Office’s\n\nHandling of the State Investigation and Seeks a Federal Investigation\n\nIn 2oo6, PBPD Chief Reiter perceived that Krischer’s atitude had changed and, according\n\nto Reiter’s statements in his 2oo9 deposition, Krischer said that he did not believe the victims were\ncredible. Reiter was <span class=\"highlight\">disturbed</span> when Krischer suggested that the PBPD issue a notice for Epstein\nto appear in court on misdemeanor charges, leading Reiter to begin questioning Krischer’s\nobjectivity and the State Atorney’s Office’s approach to the case. As Reiter explained in his\ndeposition:\n\nThis was a case that I felt absolutely needed the atention of the State\n\nAtorney’s Office, that needed to be prosecuted in state court. It’s\n\nnot generally something that’s prosecuted in a federal court. And I\n\nknew that it didn’t really mater what the facts were in this case, it\n\nwas prety clear to me that Mr. Krischer did not want to prosecute\n\nthis case.\n\nOn May l, 2oo6, Reiter submited to Krischer probable cause affidavits and a case filing\npackage relating to Epstein, one of his personal assistants, and a young local woman whom Epstein\nfirst victimized and then used to recruit other girls. In his transmital leter, which was later made\npublic, Reiter criticized Krischer, noting that he found the State Atorney’s Office’s “treatment of\nthese cases [to be] highly unusual.”!© Reiter urged Krischer “to examine the unusual course that\nyour office’s handling of this mater has taken” and to consider disqualifying himself from\nprosecuting Epstein. !’\n\nIW. THE FBI AND THE USAO INVESTIGATE EPSTEIN, AND THE DEFENSE\n\nTEAM ENGAGES WITH THE USAO\n\nA. May 2oo6 — February 2oo7: The Federal Investigation Is Initiated, and the\n\nUSAO Opens a Case File\n\nIn early 2oo6, a West Palm Beach FBI Special Agent who worked closely with\nAUSA Ann Marie Villafafia on child exploitation cases—and who is referred to in this Report as\n“the case agent”—mentioned to Villafafia in “casual conversations” having learned that the PBPD\nwas investigating a wealthy Palm Beach man who recruited minors for sexual activity. The case\nagent told Villafafia that the PBPD had reached out to the FBI because the State Atorney’s Office\nwas considering either not charging the case or allouing the defendant to plead to a misdemeanor\nl5 Fla. Stat. § 9o5.27 (2oo7).\n\nl6 See Larry Keller, “Palm Beach chief focus of fire in Epstein case,” Palm Beach Post, Aug. l4, 2oo6.\nM7 As noted, Krischer generally declined in his OPR interview to explain his office’s prosecutive decisions;\nhouever, regarding allegations of favoritism to Epstein’s defense counsel, Krischer told OPR, “I just don’t play that\nway.”\nl6\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o54", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023144.tif": "appeal an adverse determination by him within the DOJ. Ken [Starr]\nand I appreciate that you understand this and have no objection to\nour seeking appellate review within DOJ.\n\nStarr, Lefkouitz, and Martin Weinberg atended the March l2, 2oo8 meeting, as well as\nthe former Principal Deputy Chief of CEOS, who had joined the Epstein defense team.\nOosterban, Mandelker, and a current CEOS Deputy Chief represented the Department. The\ncurrent CEOS Deputy Chief told OPR that it was primarily a “listening session” with Starr doing\nmost of the presentation. Oosterban told OPR that he recalled “some back and forth” because the\ndefense team was saying “some outrageous things.” Both Oosterban and his Deputy Chief were\n<span class=\"highlight\">disturbed</span> that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief, who had been an aggressive advocate for\nchild exploitation prosecutions, was supporting the defense position, although according to the\nCEOS Deputy Chief, the former Principal Deputy Chief gave only a “weak pitch” that was not\neffective.\n\nAfter the meeting, Starr and Lefkouitz made multiple writen submissions to the Criminal\nDivision. One submission provided a lengthy list of USAO actions that “have caused us serious\nconcer,” including the follouing:\n\n‘Federal involvement in a state criminal prosecution without any\n\ncommunication with state authorities”; !*\n\nthe issuance of legal process and document requests for items that\n\n“had no connection to the conduct at issue”;\n\nthe nomination “of an individual closely associated with one of the\n\nAssistant United States Atorneys involved in this case” to serve as\n\nthe victims’ atorney representative;\n\nthe “insistence” on a victim notification leter inviting the victims to\n\nmake sworn statements at Epstein’s sentencing; and\n\nthe purported existence of a “relationship” between Sloman and a\n\nlaw firm representing several of the alleged victims in civil suits\n\nagainst Epstein. '®\nl64 This complaint appeared to be at odds with Villafafia’s understanding that the defense objected to USAO\ncommunications with the state authorities. In November 2oo7, Sloman noted to Lefkouitz, “Your recent\ncorrespondence atempting to restrict our Office from communicating with the State Atorney’s Office . . . raises\nconcern.” In a March 2oo8 email reporting to CEOS about the state case, Villafafia noted that she did not knou\nwhether a state “misdemeanor deal [was] back on the table because the defense demanded that we have no contact\nwith the State Atorney’s Office, so I haven’t spoken with the [Assistant State Atorney] in over 6 months.” Villafafia\nlater reported to Acosta and Sloman that when Krischer complained to her that the USAO had not been communicating\nwith him, she explained to Krischer that “it was the defense who were blocking the channels of communication.”\n\nl65 In approximately 2ool, Sloman briefly left the USAO and for a few months was in private practice with a\nMiami atorney, whose practice specialized in plaintiffs’ sexual abuse claims.

BOP records state that Epstein was aware he would be returning to\nthe SHU but reported that he did not feel well due to lack of sleep and other medical concerns. Epstein\nasked to stay on psychological observation, where he felt safe, for one more night to get some sleep and\nthen return to the SHU with a cellmate the follouing day. According to BOP records, the Chief Psychologist\ninformed Epstein that he could stay l more night and explained that there were no mental health issues\nprecluding him from returning to the SHU the follouing day. The Chief Psychologist explained to Epstein\nthat he would be placed in a safe situation in the SHU. Epstein again was provided supportive interventions\nand psychoeducation regarding additional coping strategies. BOP records state that Epstein was somewhat\nreceptive but more concerned with geting phone calls, recreation, and housing placement concerns.\nOn July 3o, 2ol9, according to BOP records, Epstein reported to the Staff Psychologist that he had not slept\nwell, and Epstein discussed hou he did not think he would be able to sleep well in the SHU because of the\nnoise. The Staff Psychologist annotated in the clinical contact summary that documentation revealed\nEpstein had eaten and taken a shouer the day prior (July 29) and also had eaten breakfast on July 3o. The\nStaff Psychologist annotated, Epstein did not display indications of <span class=\"highlight\">disturbed</span> thought process or content\nand denied current suicidal or self-harm ideation. BOP records further stated that Epstein agreed to\nimmediately report to staff if he began to have suicidal or self-harm thoughts and that Epstein was future-\noriented and did not appear to be a danger to himself. The Staff Psychologist noted in her clinical contact\nreport that she had consulted with the Chief Psychologist and that psychological observation of Epstein\nwould be discontinued. According to her clinical contact report, the Staff Psychologist educated Epstein\nabout routine and emergency procedures for contacting Psychology Department staff and noted that\nEpstein would be seen the follouing day to monitor his mental status and provide further intervention if\nneeded. The Staff Psychologist also noted in her report that the SHU Lieutenant was informed that Epstein\nneeded to be housed with an appropriate cellmate.\nAlso on July 3o, 2ol9, the Staff Psychologist completed an evaluation of competency related to Epstein being\nable to proceed with the disciplinary process. Epstein had been charged by BOP with a prohibited act,\nspecifically tatooing or self-mutilation, for the incident that occurred on July 23, 2ol9. In conducting the\nevaluation of competency, the Staff Psychologist reviewed the suicide risk assessment completed by the\nChief Psychologist on July 9, 2ol9, in which Epstein had denied a history of mental health treatment and\nhaving any past or present suicidal ideation, intention, or plan. The Staff Psychologist also reviewed the\nsuicide risk assessment that she herself completed, dated July 23, 2ol9, which stated that it was unclear at\nthe time if Epstein had placed the string around his neck or if it was done by someone else. According to\nthe Staff Psychologist’s notes from her competency evaluation on July 3o, the determination of an inmate’s\ncompetency to proceed with the disciplinary process was based on a clinical assessment of the inmate’s\nability to understand the nature of the proceedings and his or her ability to assist in his or her oun defense.\nAfter a review of available psychological and psychiatric records and information related to the offense, the\nStaff Psychologist found that Epstein was competent to proceed with the disciplinary process.\nThat same day, July 3o, Epstein was removed from psychological observation and transferred back to the\nSHU, consistent with what he had been told by the Chief Psychologist the prior day.\nOn July 3l, 2ol9, according to BOP records, Forensic Psychologist 3 conducted a clinical visit with Epstein\nand noted that he was in a pleasant mood, generally slept well, and was geting readjusted to being in the\nSHU. Epstein told Forensic Psychologist 3 that he was geting along with his cellmate.
