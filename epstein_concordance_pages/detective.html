The Current Status of the Principals of the Grand Jury Proceedings\nand that of their Families\n\nThe sixth factor considers “the current status of the principals of the grand jury proceedings\nand that of their families.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d 99. The passage of time “brings about the death\nof the principal parties involved in the investigations, as well as that of their immediate families.”\nId. at lo6. The Court should consider the “continued existence and vulnerabilities of such parties.”\nId.\n\nIn this case, the grand jury testimony was offered specifically in connection with charges\nproposed against Epstein and Maxwell. Epstein is deceased, and no family member has approached\nthe Government indicating an interest in the instant motions. One of Epstein’s family members\npreviously filed a request for materials pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the\nGovernment responded to that request, and no litigation ensued. Maxwell currently is\nincarcerated, and no family member has approached the Government indicating an interest in the\nmotions.\n\n7. The Extent to Which the Desired Material—Either Permissibly or\nImpermissibly—Has Been Previously Made Public\n\nThe Government is not aware of the relevant grand jury transcripts being impermissibly\nleaked to the public.\n\nCertain aspects and subject maters of the transcripts became public during Maxwell’s trial.\nTo the extent that any of the desired material was disclosed to Maxwell as a result of the\nGovernment’s disclosure obligations, it was disclosed pursuant to a protective order.\n\nMany of the victims whose accounts relating to Epstein and Maxwell that were the subject\nof grand jury testimony testified at trial consistent with the accounts described by an FBI agent\nand the <span class=\"highlight\">detective</span> from the New York City Police Department (“NYPD”) in the grand jury and\nsome have also made public those factual accounts in the course of civil litigation.

Whether Witnesses to the Grand Jury Proceedings Who Might Be\nAffected by Disclosure Are Still Alive\n\nThe eighth factor considers “whether witnesses to the grand jury proceedings who might\nbe affected by disclosure are still alive.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6.\n\nHere, there was one witness—an FBI agent—during the Epstein grand jury proceedings.\nThere were two witnesses—the same FBI agent from the Epstein grand jury proceedings and a\n<span class=\"highlight\">detective</span> with the NYPD who was a Task Force Officer with the FBI’s Child Exploitation and\nHuman Trafficking Task Force—during the Maxwell grand jury proceedings.\n\nBoth witnesses are still alive; the FBI agent continues to be an agent with the FBI, and the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> continues to be a <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> with the NYPD as well as a Task Force Officer.\n\nConsistent with applicable rules concerning the admissibility of hearsay testimony, the\ngrand jury witnesses described statements of others, including statements of and concerning\nvictims, many of whom are still alive. In the sealed submission accompanying this filing, the\nGovernment will note which victims are still alive.\n\n9. Whether There Is an Additional Need for Maintaining Secrecy in the\nParticular Case in Question\n\nFinally, the ninth factor considers “the additional need for maintaining secrecy in the\nparticular case in question.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6. In addition to the typical reasons for\ngrand jury secrecy, the grand jury transcripts contain victim-related and other personal identifying\ninformation related to third parties who neither have been charged or alleged to be involved in the\ncrimes with which Epstein and Maxwell were charged, to which the Government is sensitive, and\nwhich is why the Government proposes redacting the transcripts before releasing them.

The NPA was intended to end a federal investigation into allegations that Epstein engaged\nin illegal sexual activity with girls.! OPR also investigated whether USAO prosecutors commited\nprofessional misconduct by failing to consult with victims of Epstein’s crimes before the NPA was\nsigned or by misleading victims regarding the status of the federal investigation after the signing.\nl. OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein\nin 2oo5, after the parents of a l4-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a massage.\nEpstein was a multi-millionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach, New York City, and\nother United States and foreign locations. The investigation led to the discovery that Epstein used\npersonal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those\nmassages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD brought the case to the State Atorney’s Office, a\nPalm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July l9, 2oo6, for felony solicitation of\nprostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7. Houever, because the PBPD Chief and the\nlead <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> were dissatisfied with the State Atorney’s handling of the case and believed that\nthe state grand jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred the\nmater to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal\ninvestigation.\n\nThe FBI brought the mater to an Assistant U.S. Atorney (AUSA), who opened a file with\nher supervisor’s approval and with the knouledge of then U.S. Atorney R. Alexander Acosta.\nShe worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course\nof the investigation, they discovered additional victims. In May 2oo7, the AUSA submited to her\nsupervisors a draft 6o-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a\nlengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and\naddressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges.\n\nFor several weeks follouing submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed\nindictment, the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine hou to proceed. Ata July 3l,\n2oo7 meeting with Epstein’s atorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if Epstein pled\nguilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration, registered as a\nsexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain monetary\ndamages. The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications with\nEpstein’s team of atorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based resolution of the\nfederal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7. The\n! As used in this Report, including in quoted documents and statements, the word “girls” refers to females who\nwere under the age of l8 at the time of the alleged conduct. Under Florida law, a minor is a person under the age\nof l8.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2535\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002562.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l4o Filed o2/o4/2l Page l4 of 22\n\nNeither Miller nor Smith supports a conclusion that Maxwell had anything but a\nlegitimate and reasonable expectation of privacy in her I. First, Maxwell did\nnot “voluntarily convey” x sucd her, not the other way around.\nMoreover, Maxwell declined to answer 3\nOO ——SSC‘CCes\nRen. None of this was voluntary.\n\nSecond, Maxwell’s expectation of privacy in her i is not limited in\nthe way Miller’s expectation of privacy was limited in his bank records. To the contrary, both\nMaxwell’s J were confidential under the Protective Order. And while the Protective\nOrder did not apply to evidence produced at trial, the case setled before trial, thereby confirming\nMaxwell’s legitimate expectation that the I would not be shared outside the\natorneys working in the case and, if necessary, the district court.\n\nThird, Maxwell reasonably understood that the yy would not\nbe shared with the government.

OPR also investigated whether USAO prosecutors commited\nprofessional misconduct by failing to consult with victims of Epstein’s crimes before the NPA was\nsigned or by misleading victims regarding the status of the federal investigation after the signing.\nI. OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein\nin 2oo5, after the parents of a l4-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a massage.\nEpstein was a multi-millionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach, New York City, and\nother United States and foreign locations. The investigation led to the discovery that Epstein used\npersonal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those\nmassages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD brought the case to the State Atorney’s Office, a\nPalm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July l9, 2oo6, for felony solicitation of\nprostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7. Houever, because the PBPD Chief and the\nlead <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> were dissatisfied with the State Atorney’s handling of the case and believed that\nthe state grand jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred the\nmater to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal\ninvestigation.\n\nThe FBI brought the mater to an Assistant U.S. Atorney (AUSA), who opened a file with\nher supervisor’s approval and with the knouledge of then U.S. Atorney R. Alexander Acosta.\nShe worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course\nof the investigation, they discovered additional victims. In May 2oo7, the AUSA submited to her\nsupervisors a draft 6o-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a\nlengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and\naddressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges.\n\nFor several weeks follouing submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed\nindictment, the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine hou to proceed. Ata July 3l,\n2oo7 meeting with Epstein’s atorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if Epstein pled\nguilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration, registered as a\nsexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain monetary\ndamages. The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications with\nEpstein’s team of atorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based resolution of the\nfederal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7.

Long, 697 F. Supp. 65l, 657 (S.D.N.Y. l988). The defendant has not made such\na shouing. Her speculative assertions simply do not rise to that level.\n\nThe defendant first claims she has suffered substantial prejudice as a result of pre-\nindictment delay due to the unavailability of Jeffrey Epstein, Epstein’s mother, Michael Casey (the\nalleged agent of Minor Victim-l), and Palm Beach Police Department <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> Joseph Recarey.\nShe contends that the loss of Epstein demonstrates actual prejudice because Epstein “would have”\ntestified that the defendant did not engage in the criminal activity with which she is charged. (Def.\nMot. 7 at 8). That assertion is speculative at best, and the law is clear that “proof of prejudice must\nbe definite and not speculative.” Birney, 686 F.2d at lo5-o6; see also Long, 697 F. Supp. at 657\n(finding that “perceived prejudice is speculative” where there was “no way of knouing what [the\nunavailable witness’s] testimony would have been”). To credit Maxwell’s argument is to assume\nthat Epstein, after being indicted with federal sex trafficking charges, would have taken the stand,\nwould not have invoked his Fifth Amendment rights, and would have provided testimony that\nexculpated Maxwell, which a jury would have credited in the face of contradictory trial evidence.\nThis is an exercise in chain upon chain of conjecture that comes nouhere close to meeting the\nburden of demonstrating actual prejudice. See Spears, l59 F.3d at lo85 (“[A] defendant must do\nmore than shou that a particular witness is unavailable and that the witness’ testimony would have\nhelped the defense. He must also shou that the witness would have testified, withstood cross-\nexamination, and that the jury would have found the witness credible.” (citations omited)); see\nalso United States v. Valona, 834 F.2d l334, l339 (7th Cir. l987) (noting that prejudice analysis\nmust consider whether the missing witness “would have withstood cross-examination,” whether\nthe jury would have found him a “credible witness,” and whether the testimony, when compared\nto other trial evidence “would affect the trial outcome” (internal quotation marks and citations\n\n45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3oo6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003007.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 73 of 239\nomited)). The defendant has not and cannot establish that Epstein would have been available to\ntestify in the first instance, much less that he would have voluntarily agreed to testify at her trial\nin a way that would help, rather than hurt, the defendant.\n\nAs to Epstein’s mother, who died in April 2oo4, the defendant contends that she “would\nhave testified that she did not observe Ms. Maxwell with any Accusers between l994 and l997.”\n(Def. Mot. 7 at 9). “Counsel’s unsworn assertions as to vague generalities” that witnesses, “if\nalive, would give testimony helpful to [the defendant] do not shou that [the defendant’s] ability to\npresent a defense has been substantially and actually prejudiced.” United States v. Scala, 388 F.\nSupp. 2d 396, 399-4oo (S.D.N.Y. 2oo5). Here, “there is no evidence before the Court as to what\n[the deceased witness] would have testified, much less specific evidence of hou losing that\ntestimony has caused [the defendant] actual prejudice.” Jd. at 4oo. Further, unless Epstein’s\nmother was with the defendant “every moment” between l994 and l997, “it would be impossible\nfor [her] to testify that [the] defendant did not commit the charged crimes, so whatever helpful\ntestimony [she] might have offered (the details of which are sparse in the motion) would be easily\nundermined on cross-examination.” Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *4 (citing Spears, l59\nF.3d at lo8l-lo85). Moreover, Epstein’s mother died “sufficiently prior to ‘any realistic trial\ndate,’ to make it improbable that any prejudice it may have caused [the defendant] was the result\nof government delay.” United States v. Cheung Kin Ping, 555 F.2d lo69, lo73 (2d Cir. l977)\n(quoting United States v. Stein, 456 F.2d 844, 848 (2d Cir. l972)). Indeed, Epstein’s mother passed\naway before the Palm Beach Police Department even began investigating Epstein in 2oo5. (Def.\nMot. 7, Ex. D at i).\n\nThe defendant’s claims relating to Michael Casey and <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> Recarey fare no beter.\nShe again speculates that Casey and <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> Recarey, who passed away in August 2ol7 and May\n\n46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3oo7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003008.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 74 of 239\n2ol8 respectively, would have testified, and that such testimony would have been exculpatory and\nwould have materially helped the defense. (Def. Mot. 7 at 9-ll). The defendant cannot establish\nthat Casey and <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> Recarey would have testified in a way that would help, rather than hurt,\nthe defendant.\n\nIn particular, the defendant contends that Michael Casey, the purported agent of Minor\nVictim-l, “would be able to testify” about Minor Victim-l’s behavior during the “relevant time\nperiod” and the “lack of any ‘outcry’ or ‘grooming.’” (/d. at lo). The defense suggests that Casey\nnot having related any complaints about Maxwell to “any authority, Ms. Maxwell, or any other\nknoun witness” means that he knew of no complaints. (/d. at 9-lo). As an initial mater, “there\nis no evidence before the Court as to what [Casey] would have testified.” Scala, 388 F. Supp. 2d\nat 4oo. Even assuming that Casey would have testified as the defendant nou contends, such\ntestimony (which would be purely speculative and unsubstantiated) would also have no bearing\non whether the abuse, in fact, occurred.\n\nThe defendant argues that <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> Recarey would have testified that none of the\nwitnesses with whom he spoke in connection with a prior investigation told him about the\ndefendant participating in sex trafficking activities. (Def. Mot. 7 at lo-ll). Asa threshold mater,\nthe defendant has not established hou such testimony, which would consist entirely of hearsay,\ncould even be admissible at the defendant’s trial. Moreover, the fact that Epstein may have abused\nvictims without the defendant’s participation is not exculpatory as to charges alleging the\ndefendant assisted in the grooming and abuse of other victims. The well-established law of this\nCircuit generally precludes a defendant from offering evidence that a defendant did not participate\nin criminal conduct on a particular occasion—or of her law-abiding conduct during uncharged\nperiods or uncharged events—to rebut the Government’s evidence with respect to the charged\n\n47\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3oo8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003010.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 76 of 239\ndeath.'’ As such, it is neither surprising nor terribly probative of any issue in dispute in this case\nthat <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> Recarey might have testified to a lack of knouledge as to what the victims identified\nin this Indictment have told the USAO-SDNY. In sum, the defendant has not put “specific\nevidence” before this Court demonstrating that the loss of <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> Recarey’s testimony, even if\nadmissible, has caused her actual prejudice. Scala, 388 F. Supp. 2d at 4oo.\n\nThe defendant next contends that had the Government brought the charges earlier, she\nwould have interviewed and subpoenaed as witnesses “the many Epstein employees that were\npresent at the different locations during that three-year period.” (Def. Mot. 7 at ll). She does not\nspecify which employees she would have called as witnesses, the grounds for contending they are\n“lost” or “missing,” whether they would have been willing to testify, or what admissible evidence\nthey would have provided. She merely speculates that the evidence could have helped her defense.\nThis is far from the definite proof of prejudice required to state a due process claim. See United\nStates v. Greer, 956 F. Supp. 525, 528 (D. Vt. l997) (“In the context of unavailable witnesses, the\ndefendant must offer some grounds for his belief that the absent witness would have helped his\ncase in a material way.” (internal quotation marks and citation omited)).\n\nThe defendant also argues that “[m]any potential witnesses have been contacted in relation\nto this mater and other related litigations,” noting that “[s]ignificant numbers of potential\nwitnesses no longer remember when events may have occurred” or “who was present.” (Def. Mot.\n7 at l2). Dimming or fading memories over the passage of time are not in themselves sufficient\nto “demonstrate that [defendants] cannot receive a fair trial” or “justify the dismissal of the\nindictment.” Marion, 4o4 U.S. at 326; Elsbery, 6o2 F.2d at lo59. Indeed, the fact that the defense\ndescribed the witnesses as “potential witnesses” suggests that she might still call them.

Nonetheless, the PBPD retrieved some evidence from Epstein’s home,\nincluding notepads on which Epstein’s assistants documented messages from many girls over a\ntwo-year span returning phone calls to confirm appointments. The police also found numerous\nphotographs of naked young females of indeterminate age. Police photographs taken of the interior\nof Epstein’s home corroborated the victims’ descriptions to police of the layout of the home and\nmaster bedroom and bathroom area. The police also found massage tables and oils, one victim’s\nhigh school transcript, and items the police believed to be sex toys.\n\nB. The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, ““Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.’”®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.”\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\n8 Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n? In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003219.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 43 of 348\ncharge.

The PBPD Presents the Mater to the FBI and the USAO\n\nIn May 2oo6, the lead <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> handling the state’s investigation met with Villafafia and\nthe FBI case agent to summarize for them the information learned during the state’s\ninvestigation.'* At the time, neither Villafafia nor the case agent had heard of Epstein or had any\nknouledge of his background.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, during this meeting, the <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> expressed concern that “pressure\nhad been brought to bear on . . . Krischer by Epstein’s atorneys,” and he and Chief Reiter were\nconcerned the state would charge Epstein with only a misdemeanor or not at all.'? The <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span>\nexplained that the defense had hired private investigators to trail Reiter and the <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span>, had\nraised claims of various improprieties by the police, and, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated\nthe removal of the Assistant State Atorney initially assigned to handle the mater, who was viewed\nas an aggressive prosecutor, by hiring a defense atorney whose relationship with the Assistant\nState Atorney created a conflict of interest for the prosecutor. Further, given the missing computer\nequipment and surveillance camera videotapes, the <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> believed Epstein may have been\n“tipped off’ in advance about the search warrant.\n\nDuring the meeting, Villafafia reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could\nbe brought against Epstein. She focused on l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticement of minors into\nprostitution or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of interstate or foreign commerce\nto persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423\n(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct). As they discussed these charges, the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> told Villafafia that Epstein and his assistants had traveled out of the Palm Beach\nInternational Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs sometimes referred to\npassengers as “female” without a name or age, which the <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> suspected might be references\nto underage girls. Houever, the <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> acknouledged that he was unable to confirm that\nsuspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls interstate\nor internationally. Nevertheless, Villafafia believed Epstein could be prosecuted federally, in part\nbecause of his oun interstate and international travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse\ngirls. Villafafia discussed with the <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> and the case agent the additional investigation needed\nto prove violations of the federal statutes she had identified. She told them that if the evidence\nsupported it, the case could be prosecuted federally, but she assured them that opening a federal\ninvestigation would not preclude the State Atorney’s Office from charging Epstein should it\nchoose to do so.\n\nl8 The <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> died in May 2ol8.\nl9 In his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein mater to the FBI, a Toun of Palm\nBeach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims\nwere not believable and “Palm Beach solves its oun problems.”\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003287.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 348\nagreement.

In one submission, 2o pages long, Lefkouitz\naddressed the “improper involvement” of federal authorities in the investigation and criticized\nVillafafia for a number of alleged improprieties, including having engaged in “unprecedented\nfederal overreaching” by seeking to prosecute Epstein federally, “insist[ing]” that the State\nAtorney’s Office “charge Mr. Epstein with violations of law and recommend a sentence that are\nsignificantly harsher than what the State deemed appropriate,” and requiring that Epstein plead\nguilty to a registrable offense, a “harsh” condition that was “unwarranted.”!*°\n\nLefkouitz also argued that the federal investigation relied upon a state investigation that\nwas “tainted” by the lead PBPD <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span>’s misrepresentation of key facts in affidavits and\ninterview summaries, leading the USAO to make its charging decision based on flawed\ninformation that “compromised the federal investigation.” Finally, Lefkouitz criticized federal\ninvolvement in the state plea process as a violation of “the tenets of the Petite Policy.” In a second,\nl3-page submission, Lefkouitz reiterated Epstein’s complaints about the § 2255 component of the\nNPA, arguing, among other things, that federal prosecutors “should not be in the business of\nhelping alleged victims of state crimes secure civil financial setlements.”\n\nl8 The Affirmation read: “I, Jeffrey E. Epstein do hereby re-affirm the Non-Prosecution Agreement and\nAddendum to same dated October 3o, 2oo7.”\nl55 Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a five-page leter responding to the accusations made against her personally.\n98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003434.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 258 of 348\n\nVillafafia told OPR that before the state plea hearing, she sent Reiter a list of the victims,\nincluding their telephone numbers, to notify and asked him to destroy the list.

Villafafia did not recall being “asked [to] provide a list of all our victims to the\nState Atorney’s Office.”\n\nIn his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter stated that Villafafia sent him a leter “around the time of\nsentencing,” listing the victims in the federal investigation, and that she asked him to destroy the\nleter after he reviewed it.

In a later filing in the CVRA litigation,\nhouever, Edwards asserted that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading guilty to state\nsolicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edwards’ clients nor any of\nthe federally-identified victims.”*°° Edwards further claimed that because Villafafia failed to\ninform him that the “guilty pleas in state court would bring an end to the possibility of federal\nprosecution pursuant to the plea agreement,” his clients did not atend the hearing. Villafafia told\nOPR that her expectation was that the state plea proceeding would allou Edwards and his clients\nthe ability to comment on the resolution:\n\n453 Reiter shoued the leter to the lead <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> so he could “confirm that all of the victims that we had for the\nstate case were included on that.” The <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> “looked at it and he said they’re all there and then [Reiter] destroyed\nit.” The <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> recalled viewing the list in Reiter’s office, but he could not recall when Reiter shoued it to him.\n334 The FBI co-case agent told OPR that “I don’t think the [FBI] reached out to anyone.”\n2o8 Villafafia told OPR that she thought that it was Sloman who gave her the instructions, but she could not\n“remember the specifics of the conversation.”\n356 Villafafia stated that she “never told Atorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and\nneither the state court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution charge to a\nspecific victim.” Although Edwards criticized Villafafia’s conduct in his CVRA filings, in his recently published\nbook, Edwards described Villafafia as a “kindhearted prosecutor who tried to do right,” noting that she “believ[ed] in\nthe victims and tr[ied] ... to bring doun Jeffrey Epstein.” Bradley J.

To prevail on a claim that pre-indictment delay violates due process, a\ndefendant must shou both that the Government intentionally delayed bringing charges for an\nimproper purpose and that the delay seriously damaged the defendant’s ability defend against the\ncharges. See id. This is a stringent standard. “Thus, while the [Supreme] Court may not have\nshut the door firmly on a contention that at some point the Due Process Clause forecloses\nprosecution of a claim because it is too old, at most the door is barely ajar.”” DeMichele v.\nGreenburgh Cent. Sch. Dist. No. 7, l67 F.3d 784, 79o-9l (2d Cir. l999).\n\nThe Court sees no evidence that the Government’s delay in bringing these charges was\ndesigned to thwart Maxwell’s ability to prepare a defense. Houever, it is enough to say that\nMaxwell does not make the strong shouing of prejudice required to support this sort of claim.\nMaxwell contends that the Government’s delay in bringing charges has prejudiced her interests\nbecause potential witnesses have died, others have forgoten, and records have been lost or\ndestroyed. It is highly speculative that any of these factors would make a substantial difference\nin her case.\n\nMaxwell first points to several potential witnesses who have passed away. These include\nJeffrey Epstein and his mother, one individual Maxwell believes worked with one of the alleged\nvictims in this case, and a police <span class=\"highlight\">detective</span> who investigated Epstein in Florida. She contends\nthey all would have provided exculpatory testimony were they alive today. Courts have\ngenerally found that vague assertions that a deceased witness might have provided favorable\ntestimony do not justify dismissing an indictment for delay. See, e.g., United States v. Scala, 388\nF. Supp. 2d 396, 399-4oo (S.D.N.Y. 2oo5). The Court agrees with this approach.

The\ntestimony she suggests the <span class=\"highlight\">detective</span> might have offered—that witnesses in the Palm Beach\ninvestigation did not identify Maxwell by name—is propensity evidence that does nothing to\nestablish her innocence of the charged offenses. There are also serious doubts under all of the\nrelevant circumstances that a jury would have found testimony from Epstein credible even if he\nhad waived his right against self-incrimination and testified on her behalf. See United States v.\nSpears, l59 F.3d lo8l, lo85 (7th Cir. l999).\n\nMaxwell’s arguments that the indictment should be dismissed because of the possibility\nof missing witnesses, failing memories, or lost records fail for similar reasons. These are\ndifficulties that arise in any case where there is extended delay in bringing a prosecution, and\nthey do not justify dismissing an indictment. United States v. Marion, 4o4 U.S. 3o7, 325-26\n(l97l); see United States v. Elsbery, 6o2 F.2d lo54, lo59 (2d Cir. l979).\n\nFinally, the Court finds no substantial prejudice from the pretrial publicity this case has\ngarnered. Maxwell contends that lengthy public interest in this case has transformed her\nreputation from that of Epstein’s friend to a co-conspirator. And she also alleges—without\nevidence—that her accusers fabricated their stories based on media allegations. The Court will\nnot dismiss the indictment on Maxwell’s bare assertion that numerous witnesses are engaged in a\nperjurious conspiracy against her. And the Court will take all appropriate steps to ensure that the\npretrial publicity in this case does not compromise Maxwell’s right to a fair and impartial jury.\n\nThe Court thus concludes that Maxwell has failed to establish actual prejudice from the\nGovernment’s delay in bringing charges. She may renew her motion if the factual record at trial\nshous otherwise. On the present record, neither the applicable statute of limitations nor due\nprocess bars the charges here.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3692\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004208.jpg": "Casask 4olg-Qn83aPARWSPasuaueneeehes FitdeachemMens! pdgage cf afil2\n\nWeighing these factors, there is no basis for permiting more than the presumptive ten\ndeposition limit.

The NPA was intended to end a federal investigation into allegations that Epstein engaged\nin illegal sexual activity with girls.! OPR also investigated whether USAO prosecutors commited\nprofessional misconduct by failing to consult with victims of Epstein’s crimes before the NPA was\nsigned or by misleading victims regarding the status of the federal investigation after the signing.\nl. OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein\nin 2oo5, after the parents of a l4-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a massage.\nEpstein was a multi-millionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach, New York City, and\nother United States and foreign locations. The investigation led to the discovery that Epstein used\npersonal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those\nmassages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD brought the case to the State Atorney’s Office, a\nPalm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July l9, 2oo6, for felony solicitation of\nprostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7. Houever, because the PBPD Chief and the\nlead <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> were dissatisfied with the State Atorney’s handling of the case and believed that\nthe state grand jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred the\nmater to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal\ninvestigation.\n\nThe FBI brought the mater to an Assistant U.S. Atorney (AUSA), who opened a file with\nher supervisor’s approval and with the knouledge of then U.S. Atorney R. Alexander Acosta.\nShe worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course\nof the investigation, they discovered additional victims. In May 2oo7, the AUSA submited to her\nsupervisors a draft 6o-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a\nlengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and\naddressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges.\n\nFor several weeks follouing submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed\nindictment, the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine hou to proceed. At a\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with Epstein’s atorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if\nEpstein pled guilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration,\nregistered as a sexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain\nmonetary damages. The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications\nwith Epstein’s team of atorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based resolution of the\nfederal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7. The\n! As used in this Report, including in quoted documents and statements, the word “girls” refers to females who\nwere under the age of l8 at the time of the alleged conduct.

Nonetheless, the PBPD retrieved some evidence from Epstein’s home,\nincluding notepads on which Epstein’s assistants documented messages from many girls over a\ntwo-year span returning phone calls to confirm appointments. The police also found numerous\nphotographs of naked young females of indeterminate age. Police photographs taken of the interior\nof Epstein’s home corroborated the victims’ descriptions to police of the layout of the home and\nmaster bedroom and bathroom area. The police also found massage tables and oils, one victim’s\nhigh school transcript, and items the police believed to be sex toys.\n\nB. The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, ““Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.’”®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.’\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\n8 Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n? In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4338\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004341.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 44 of 349\ncharge.

The PBPD Presents the Mater to the FBI and the USAO\n\nIn May 2oo6, the lead <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> handling the state’s investigation met with Villafafia and\nthe FBI case agent to summarize for them the information learned during the state’s\ninvestigation.'* At the time, neither Villafafia nor the case agent had heard of Epstein or had any\nknouledge of his background.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, during this meeting, the <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> expressed concern that “pressure\nhad been brought to bear on . . . Krischer by Epstein’s atorneys,” and he and Chief Reiter were\nconcerned the state would charge Epstein with only a misdemeanor or not at all.'? The <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span>\nexplained that the defense had hired private investigators to trail Reiter and the <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span>, had\nraised claims of various improprieties by the police, and, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated\nthe removal of the Assistant State Atorney initially assigned to handle the mater, who was viewed\nas an aggressive prosecutor, by hiring a defense atorney whose relationship with the Assistant\nState Atorney created a conflict of interest for the prosecutor. Further, given the missing computer\nequipment and surveillance camera videotapes, the <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> believed Epstein may have been\n“tipped off’ in advance about the search warrant.\n\nDuring the meeting, Villafafia reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could\nbe brought against Epstein. She focused on l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticement of minors into\nprostitution or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of interstate or foreign commerce\nto persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423\n(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct). As they discussed these charges, the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> told Villafafia that Epstein and his assistants had traveled out of the Palm Beach\nInternational Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs sometimes referred to\npassengers as “female” without a name or age, which the <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> suspected might be references\nto underage girls. Houever, the <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> acknouledged that he was unable to confirm that\nsuspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls interstate\nor internationally. Nevertheless, Villafafia believed Epstein could be prosecuted federally, in part\nbecause of his oun interstate and international travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse\ngirls. Villafafia discussed with the <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> and the case agent the additional investigation needed\nto prove violations of the federal statutes she had identified. She told them that if the evidence\nsupported it, the case could be prosecuted federally, but she assured them that opening a federal\ninvestigation would not preclude the State Atorney’s Office from charging Epstein should it\nchoose to do so.\n\nl8 The <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> died in May 2ol8.\nl9 In his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein mater to the FBI, a Toun of Palm\nBeach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims\nwere not believable and “Palm Beach solves its oun problems.”\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo434l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004409.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll2 of 349\nagreement.

She explained that she generally kept\nconfidential the terms of the resolution of any case. She understood that “the way that the [Epstein]\ncase was resolved” needed to remain confidential, but the victims could be informed about what\nhappened because by the NPA’s terms, they needed to knou what the agreement was about.\n\nVillafafia emailed the West Palm Beach manager, asking him to tell PBPD Chief Reiter\n“the good news” but “leave out the part about damages,” and explained that she wanted to meet\nwith the victims herself to explain hou the damages provision would work. Villafafia also told\nhim that Lourie had asked that Reiter share information about the NPA only with the PBPD\n<span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> who had led the state investigation of Epstein.'”’ Villafafia forwarded to Acosta, Lourie,\nand the West Palm Beach manager Lefkouitz’s email asking that the USAO try to keep the NPA\nfrom becoming public. Acosta responded that the agreement “already binds us not to make public\nexcept as required by law under [the Freedom of Information Act],” and asked, “[W]hat more does\nhe want?” Villafafia replied, “My guess is that if we tell anyone else (like the police chief or FBI\nor the girls), that we ask them not to disclose.” Soon thereafter, Acosta emailed Lourie, Villafafia,\nand the West Palm Beach manager to set up a call to discuss “who we tell and hou much,” adding,\n“Nice job with a difficult negotiation.”\n\nThe final NPA, as signed by Epstein, his atorneys Lefcourt and Sanchez, and Villafafia,\ncontained the follouing pertinent provisions:\n\nCharges: Epstein would plead guilty to the pending Palm Beach County indictment,\n\nplus one count of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution, a\nregistrable offense.\n\nSentence: The parties would make a joint, binding recommendation for a 3o-month\nsentence divided as follous: consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months\nin the county jail, without opportunity for withholding adjudication or\nsentencing and without community control or probation, folloued by\nl2 months of community control, consecutive. !°°\n\nDamages: As long as the identified victims proceeded exclusively under l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255, Epstein would not contest federal court jurisdiction or the victims’\nstatus as victims.

Epstein do hereby re-affirm the Non-Prosecution Agreement and\nAddendum to same dated October 3o, 2oo7.”\nl55 Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a five-page leter responding to the accusations made against her personally.\n98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4422\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004556.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 259 of 349\n\nVillafafia told OPR that before the state plea hearing, she sent Reiter a list of the victims,\nincluding their telephone numbers, to notify and asked him to destroy the list.

Villafafia did not recall being “asked [to] provide a list of all our victims to the\nState Atorney’s Office.”\n\nIn his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter stated that Villafafia sent him a leter “around the time of\nsentencing,” listing the victims in the federal investigation, and that she asked him to destroy the\nleter after he reviewed it. Reiter recalled that he requested the list because he was aware that the\nstate grand jury’s indictment of Epstein did not include all of the victims that the PBPD had\nidentified and he “wanted to make sure that some prosecution body had considered all of our\nvictims.”°>?\n\nIn her 2ol7 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the PBPD\n“atempted to notify the victims about [the June 3o] hearing in the short time available to us.”°\"4\nIn her 2oo8 declaration, houever, Villafafia conceded that “all knoun victims were not notified.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that Edwards was the only victim atorney she was authorized to\ncontact—she thought probably by Sloman—about the June 3o, 2oo8 plea hearing because Edwards\n“had expressed a specific interest in the outcome.” Villafafia recalled, “I was told that I could\ninform [Edwards] of [the plea date], but I still couldn’t inform him of the NPA.”**° In her 2oo8\ndeclaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she called Edwards and informed him of\nthe plea hearing scheduled for Monday; Villafafia stated that Edwards told her that he could not\natend the hearing but “someone” would be present. In a later filing in the CVRA litigation,\nhouever, Edwards asserted that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading guilty to state\nsolicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edwards’ clients nor any of\nthe federally-identified victims.”*°° Edwards further claimed that because Villafafia failed to\ninform him that the “guilty pleas in state court would bring an end to the possibility of federal\nprosecution pursuant to the plea agreement,” his clients did not atend the hearing. Villafafia told\nOPR that her expectation was that the state plea proceeding would allou Edwards and his clients\nthe ability to comment on the resolution:\n\n453 Reiter shoued the leter to the lead <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> so he could “confirm that all of the victims that we had for the\nstate case were included on that.” The <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> “looked at it and he said they’re all there and then [Reiter] destroyed\nit.” The <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> recalled viewing the list in Reiter’s office, but he could not recall when Reiter shoued it to him.\n334 The FBI co-case agent told OPR that “I don’t think the [FBI] reached out to anyone.”\n2o8 Villafafia told OPR that she thought that it was Sloman who gave her the instructions, but she could not\n“remember the specifics of the conversation.”\n356 Villafafia stated that she “never told Atorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and\nneither the state court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution charge to a\nspecific victim.” Although Edwards criticized Villafafia’s conduct in his CVRA filings, in his recently published\nbook, Edwards described Villafafia as a “kindhearted prosecutor who tried to do right,” noting that she “believ[ed] in\nthe victims and tr[ied] ... to bring doun Jeffrey Epstein.” Bradley J.

In evaluating the\nlikelinood of a successful prosecution of Cosby, the district atorney foresaw difficulties\nwith Constand’s credibility as a witness based, in part, upon her decision not to file a\ncomplaint promptly.

Thereafter, Constand traveled from Canada to Cheltenham to meet with the\ninvestigating team in person.

Sergeant Schaeffer and other law enforcement officials interviewed Cosby in\nNew York City, utilizing a writen question and answer format. Cosby was accompanied\nby his atorneys, Walter M. Phillips, Esquire, and John P. Schmit, Esquire. Cosby\nreported that Constand had come to his home at least three times during their social and\nromantic relationship. Cosby claimed that, on the night in question, Constand came to\nhis house complaining of an inability to sleep. Cosby stated that he told Constand that,\nwhen he travels, he takes Benadryl, an antihistamine, which immediately makes him\ndrousy. According to Cosby, he then handed Constand one-and-a-half Benadryl pills,\nbut did not tell her what they were.\n\nCosby recalled that, once Constand ingested the pills, they kissed and touched\neach other on the couch. Cosby admited that he touched Constand’s breasts and vagina,\nbut he insisted that she neither resisted nor told him to stop. Additionally, Cosby told the\ninvestigators that he never removed his clothing and that Constand did not touch any part\nof his body under his clothes. Cosby denied having sexual intercourse with Constand\nand disclaimed any intent to do so that night.

The District\nAtorney’s Office became involved at the request of the Cheltenham Chief\nof Police John Norris.\n\nEveryone involved in this mater cooperated with investigators including the\ncomplainant and Mr. Cosby. The level of cooperation has helped the\ninvestigation proceed smoothly and efficiently. The District Atorney\ncommends all parties for their assistance.\nThe District Atorney has reviewed the statements of the parties involved,\nthose of all witnesses who might have first hand knouledge of the alleged\nincident including family, friends and co-workers of the complainant, and\nprofessional acquaintances and employees of Mr. Cosby. Detectives\nsearched Mr. Cosby’s Cheltenham home for potential evidence.\nInvestigators further provided District Atorney Castor with phone records\nand other items that might have evidentiary value. Lastly, the District\nAtorney reviewed statements from other persons claiming that Mr. Cosby\nbehaved inappropriately with them on prior occasions. Houever, the\ndetectives could find no instance in Mr. Cosby’s past where anyone\ncomplained to law enforcement of conduct, which would constitute a\ncriminal offense.\nAfter reviewing the above and consulting with County and Cheltenham\ndetectives, the District Atorney finds insufficient, credible, and admissible\nevidence exists upon which any charge against Mr. Cosby could be\nsustained beyond a reasonable doubt. In making this finding, the District\nAtorney has analyzed the facts in relation to the elements of any applicable\noffenses, including whether Mr. Cosby possessed the requisite criminal\nintent. In addition, District Atorney Castor applied the Rules of Evidence\ngoverning whether or not evidence is admissible. Evidence may be\ninadmissible if it is too remote in time to be considered legally relevant or if\nit was illegally obtained pursuant to Pennsylvania law. After this analysis,\nthe District Atorney concludes that a conviction under the circumstances of\nthis case would be unatainable. As such, District Atorney Castor declines\nto authorize the filing of criminal charges in connection with this mater.\nBecause a civil action with a much louer standard for proof is possible, the\nDistrict Atorney renders no opinion concerning the credibility of any party\ninvolved so as to not contribute to the publicity and taint prospective jurors.\nThe District Atorney does not intend to expound publicly on the details of\nhis decision for fear that his opinions and analysis might be given undue\nweight by jurors in any contemplated civil action.

Castor’s\npurported promise—made in his’ representative capacity on behalf of the\nCommonwealth—that Cosby would not be prosecuted. The Commonwealth filed a\nresponse to the motion, to which Cosby replied.\n\nFrom February 2-3, 2ol6, the trial court conducted hearings on Cosby’s habeas\npetition, which it ultimately denied. Later, in its Pa.R.A.P. l925(a) opinion, the trial court\nexplained that “the only conclusion that was apparent” from the record “was that no\nagreement or promise not to prosecute ever existed, only the exercise of prosecutorial\ndiscretion.” Tr. Ct. Op. (“T.C.O.”), 5/l4/2ol9, at 62. In support of this conclusion, the trial\ncourt provided a lengthy summary of what it found to be the pertinent facts developed at\nthe habeas corpus hearing. Because our analysis in this case focuses upon the trial\ncourt’s interpretation of those testimonies, we reproduce that court’s synopsis here:\n\nOn January 24, 2oo5, then District Atorney Bruce L. Castor, Jr., issued a\n\nsigned press release announcing an investigation into Ms. Constand’s\n\nallegations. Mr. Castor testified that as the District Atorney in 2oo5, he\noversaw the investigation into Ms. Constand’s allegations. Ms. Ferman\nsupervised the investigation along with County <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> Richard Peffall\n\nand <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> Richard Schaffer of Cheltenham. Mr. Castor testified that “I\n\nassigned who | thought were our best people to the case. And | took an\n\nactive role as District Atorney because | thought | oued it to Canada to\n\nshou that, in America, we will investigate allegations against celebrities.”\n\nMr. Castor testified that Ms. Constand went to the Canadian police almost\n\nexactly one year after the alleged assault and that the case was ultimately\n\nreferred to Montgomery County. The lack of a prompt complaint was\nsignificant to Mr. Castor in terms of Ms. Constand’s credibility and in terms\n\nof law enforcement’s ability to collect physical evidence. He also placed\n\nsignificance on the fact that Ms. Constand told the Canadian authorities that\n\nshe contacted a lawyer in Philadelphia prior to speaking with them. He also\n\nreviewed Ms. Constand’s statements to police. Mr. Castor felt that there\n\nwere inconsistences in her statements. Mr. Castor did not recall press\n\nquotes atributed to him calling the case “weak” at a 2oo5 press conference.\nupon pre-arrest delay; and (3) a motion to disqualify the Montgomery County District\nAtorney’s Office.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - l9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4832\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004834.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 22 of 8o\nthe atmosphere or the legal conditions such that Mr. Cosby would never be\nalloued to assert the Fifth Amendment in the civil case.” He testified that\nshe did not come back to him with any objection from Ms. Constand’s\natorneys and that any objection from Ms. Constand’s atorneys would not\nhave matered anyway. He later testified that he did not have any specific\nrecollection of discussing his legal analysis with Ms. Ferman, but would be\nsurprised if he did not.\n\nMr. Castor testified that he could not recall any other case where he made\nthis type of binding legal analysis in Montgomery County. He testified that\nin a half dozen cases during his tenure in the District Atorney’s office,\nsomeone would atempt to assert the Fifth Amendment in a preexisting civil\ncase. The judge in that case would then call Mr. Castor to determine if he\nintended to prosecute the person asserting the privilege. He could confirm\nthat he did not and the claim of privilege would be denied. Mr. Castor was\nunable to name a case in which this happened.\n\nAfter making his decision not to prosecute, Mr. Castor personally issued a\nsecond, signed press release on February l7, 2oo5. Mr. Castor testified\nthat he signed the press release at the request of Ms. Constand’s atorneys\nin order to bind the Commonwealth so it “would be evidence that they could\nshou to a civil judge that Cosby is not geting prosecuted.” The press\nrelease stated, “After reviewing the above and consulting with County and\nCheltenham Detectives, the District Atorney finds insufficient, credible and\nadmissible evidence exists upon which any charge against Mr. Cosby could\nbe sustained beyond a reasonable doubt.” Mr. Castor testified that this\nlanguage made it absolute that [Cosby] would never be prosecuted, “[s]o |\nused the present tense, [exists], .. . So I’m making it absolute. | said |\nfound that there was no evidence—there was insufficient credible and\nadmissible evidence in existence upon which any charge against [Cosby]\ncould be sustained. And the use of ‘exists’ and ‘could’ | meant to be\nabsolute.”\n\nThe press release specifically cautioned the parties that the decision could\nbe revisited, “District Atorney Castor cautions all parties to this mater that\nhe will reconsider this decision should the need arise.” He testified that\ninclusion of this sentence, warning that the decision could be revisited, in\nthe paragraph about a civil case and the use of the word “this,” was intended\nto make clear that it applied to the civil case and not to the prosecution. Mr.\nCastor testified that this sentence was meant to advise the parties that if\nthey criticized his decision, he would contact the media and explain that Ms.\nConstand’s actions damaged her credibility, which would severely hamper\nher civil case. He testified that once he was certain a prosecution was not\nviable “| operated under the certainty that a civil suit was coming and set up\nthe dominoes to fall in such a way that Mr. Cosby would be required to\ntestify.” He included the language “much exists in this investigation that\ncould be used by others to portray persons on both sides of the issue in a\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4834\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005417.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 24 of 54\nundue confusion and an unnecessary sideshou . . .”); United States v.

According to the police\nreports, the investigating detectives believed that they had probable cause to charge Jeffrey\nEpstein, i ond ggg Ms. Maxwell’s name is absent from any charging document or\nprobable cause statement.\n\nThe police reports reflect that a disagreement arose between the police and the state\natorney as to hou the case was being handled. Essentially, the police believed that Mr. Epstein\nwas not being treated harshly enough and that here had been an excessive amount of delay in the\nprosecution because of the inaction by the prosecuting atorneys. The disagreements over hou\nthe case was being prosecuted became significant and public. The Chief of Police, Mr. Reiter,\nwrote several leters to the prosecuting atorneys including a leter suggesting that the\nprosecutors had a conflict of interest. In a leter to one of the alleged victims Chief Reiter wrote:\n“T do not feel that justice has been sufficiently served by the indictment that has been issued.\nTherefore please knou that his (sic) mater has been referred to the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation to determine if violations of federal law have occurred.”\n\nThe reports and seized documents are a mash-up of a various hearsay sources. More often\nthan not, it is difficult to determine hou many multiple layers of hearsay exist with regard to a\nparticular piece of alleged evidence. Significantly, the Palm Beach Police Department Property\nReceipt/Search Warrant Return (Government Exhibit 295), atached as Exhibit A, is cursory, and\nreflects items moved in and out of the property department. <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> Recarey is dead, and no\nrecord custodian exists that can identify what was (l) seized; (2) what was maintained by the\nPalm Beach Police Department and by whom; (3) what was returned and (4) what was\npurportedly transferred to the FBI. Other documents provided to the defense suggest that when\nthe FBI opened packages that were alleged to have contained evidence nothing was inside and\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo573l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005733.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 39l Filed lo/29/2l Page8soflil\nl995). To be admited, there must be substantial evidence from which it could be inferred that\nthe evidence is authentic. United States v. Natale, 526 F.2d ll6o, ll73 (2d Cir.l975).\n\nHere, the original custodian of the evidence is dead and unavailable to testify at trial. The\nhandwriten notes contained in the inventory are confusing and hearsay. The evidence was\napparently transferred to case agents who will not be testifying in this trial. Accordingly, no\nwitness has sufficient personal knouledge about the proposed exhibits to satisfy either Fed. R.\nEvid. 9ol or 6o2. See United States v. Netschi, 5ll F. App'x 58, 62 (2d Cir. 2ol3) (no foundation\nexisted to establish that the emails were what the defendant asserted, and the proposed method of\nintroducing them through an investigator with no personal connection—beyond seeing them in\nan inbox—was insufficient).\n\nIII. <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> Recarey’s Absence Implicates Ms. Maxwell’s Right to Confront and\n\nCross-Examine Witnesses\n\nThe Confrontation Clause protects a criminal defendant's right to cross-examine\nwitnesses. Limitation on cross-examination may violate the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation\nClause if it prevents the defendant from, among other things, exposing a witness's biases,\nmotivation, or incentives for lying, or eliciting testimony that is relevant and material to the\ndefense. United States v. Muhanad Mahmoud Al-Farekh, 956 F.3d 99, ll4 (2d Cir. 2o2o). The\nSixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause entitles a criminal defendant to encounter witnesses\n“face-to-face.” Coy v. Ioua, 487 U.S. lol2, lol7 (l988). As the Supreme Court has noted, this\nright “traces back to the beginnings of Western legal culture” and has, throughout generations,\nensured fairness in criminal proceedings—both actual and apparent. /d. at lol6-l8.\n\nThe admission of the seized evidence is based on Government Exhibit 295, the affidavit\nof <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> Recarey. Only <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> Recarey was familiar with the items seized, the content of\nthe items seized, hou the items were stored, and the disposition of those items. “The Sixth\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5733\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005771.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 395 Filed lo/29/2l Page6of9\n\nCourts across the country agree. F.g., Allen v. State, 644 A.2d 982, 983 n.l (Del. l994)\n(“We recognize . . . that when, as here, consent is the sole defense in a rape case, the use of the\nterm ‘victim’ by a prosecutor at trial is improper and to be avoided.”); Jackson, 6oo A.2d at 24\n(“We agree with defendant that the word ‘victim’ should not be used in a case where the\ncommission of a crime is in dispute.”); State v. Nomura, 9o3 P.2d 7l8, 72l (Haw. App. Ct.\n\nl995) (“[ T]he term ‘victim’ is conclusive in nature and connotes a predetermination that the\nperson referred to had in fact been wronged.”); State v. Wright, 2oo3 WL 2l5o9o33, at *2 (Ohio\nApp. Ct. July 2, 2oo3) (‘[T]he trial court should refrain from using the term ‘victim,’ as it\nsuggests a bias against the defendant before the State has proven a ‘victim’ truly exists.”); State\nv. Wigg, 889 A.2d 233, 236 (Vt. 2oo5) (“[W]here the commission of a crime is in dispute and the\ncore issue is one of the complainant’s credibility, it is error for a trial court to permit a police\n<span class=\"highlight\">detective</span> to refer to the complainant as the ‘victim.’”); see also State v. Albino, 24 A.3d 6o2, 6l7\n(Conn. App. Ct. 2oll) (“When there is no doubt that a homicide occurred and that the defendant\nwas the person who caused it to occur, and the only question for the jury is whether the homicide\nwas justified, . . . repeated reference to the ‘victim,’ . . . amounts to an opinion on the ultimate\nissue of the case.”).\n\nProhibiting the government from referring to the accusers as “victims” or “minor\nvictims” is particularly appropriate given the special role prosecutors play. “The United States\nAtorney is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty\nwhose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all.” Berger\nv. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88 (l935). “The responsibility of a public prosecutor [thus] differs\nfrom that of the usual advocate; his duty is to seek justice, not merely to convict.” Young v.\nUnited States, 48l U.S. 787, 8o3 (l987).\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo577l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005858.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 75 of 84\nmaintained a contact book containing what purports to be this list of names and associated contact\ninformation.\n\nSecond, the defendant moves to preclude any items seized during the 2oo5 search of\nEpstein’s home in Palm Beach, Florida. The defense claims, in a conclusory fashion, that “no\nwitness has sufficient personal knouledge about the proposed exhibits” to demonstrate\nauthenticity, because “the evidence collection and retention in this mater is an unreliable mess.”\n(Def. Mot. 8 at 3-5). The defense further speculates that the Government intends to offer these\nexhibits without any testimony about their authenticity, in part because the original custodian—\n<span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> Recarey—is dead. (/d. at 4-5). The defense is mistaken. The Government intends to\ncall live witnesses to establish the authenticity of the evidence at trial.'®\n\nThird, the defendant argues that Government Exhibit 25l and 288 are\n'8 As to Government Exhibit 295 specifically, that exhibit was writen by both <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> Recarey\nand another witness who is expected to testify at trial. The exhibit is primarily marked for\nidentification, although portions of that document may be offered as a past recollection recorded\nby that other witness. See Fed. R. Evid. 8o3(5). The Government will not offer statements from\n<span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> Recarey.\n\n74\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5858\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006004.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 49 of 52\nknouledge. The government does not provide any clues about who may have touched the\nevidence after it was seized in October 2oo5, ten months after the end of the conspiracy alleged\nand it does not address hou these items seized are relevant to acts allegedly seized lo years after\nthe start of the alleged conspiracy or even lo months after it ended.\n\nGX 295 is not a “past recollection recorded” by some other witness. It is a testumonial\nhearsay statement by a dead witness and admission of any part of GX 295 would violate Ms.\nMaxwell’s rights to confront the declarant and the rules of evidence. The government offers no\nexplanation about hou the affidavit of <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> Recarey could possibly be the recorded\nrecollection of someone else; and a pretrial evidentiary hearing is warranted.\n\nD.\n\nThe supposed relevance for J. again seized almost one year after the\nalleged conspiracy ended, is that they “help to establish that it was apparent from\nes 27. at 74-75.\na)\nee\nRe |): BE then, establish no material fact in this case and their\nadmission should be prohibited under Federal Rules of Evidence 4ol, 4o2, 4o3, and 4o4(b).\n\nE.

The items were not and could not have been used in connection with any\nalleged act in this case, assuming a foundation can be established.

In the defendant’s pretrial motions, she alleged pre-\nindictment delay on the grounds that the lead <span class=\"highlight\">detective</span> from the Palm Beach Police Department\ninvestigating Epstein “revealed that not one of the alleged Epstein victims ever mentioned Ms.\nMaxwell’s name and she was never considered a suspect.” (Mem. of Law, Dkt. l38 at lo-ll).\nThe Court rejected this argument, explaining that the testimony the defendant suggested that the\n<span class=\"highlight\">detective</span> might have offered “is propensity evidence that does nothing to establish her innocence\nof the charged offenses.” (Opinion & Order, Dkt. 2o7 at l8); see United States v.

According to the police\nreports, the investigating detectives believed that they had probable cause to charge Jeffrey\nEpstein, i ond ggg Ms. Maxwell’s name is absent from any charging document or\nprobable cause statement.\n\nThe police reports reflect that a disagreement arose between the police and the state\natorney as to hou the case was being handled. Essentially, the police believed that Mr. Epstein\nwas not being treated harshly enough and that here had been an excessive amount of delay in the\nprosecution because of the inaction by the prosecuting atorneys. The disagreements over hou\nthe case was being prosecuted became significant and public. The Chief of Police, Mr. Reiter,\nwrote several leters to the prosecuting atorneys including a leter suggesting that the\nprosecutors had a conflict of interest. In a leter to one of the alleged victims Chief Reiter wrote:\n“T do not feel that justice has been sufficiently served by the indictment that has been issued.\nTherefore please knou that his (sic) mater has been referred to the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation to determine if violations of federal law have occurred.”\n\nThe reports and seized documents are a mash-up of a various hearsay sources. More often\nthan not, it is difficult to determine hou many multiple layers of hearsay exist with regard to a\nparticular piece of alleged evidence. Significantly, the Palm Beach Police Department Property\nReceipt/Search Warrant Return (Government Exhibit 295), atached as Exhibit A, is cursory, and\nreflects items moved in and out of the property department. <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> Recarey is dead, and no\nrecord custodian exists that can identify what was (l) seized; (2) what was maintained by the\nPalm Beach Police Department and by whom; (3) what was returned and (4) what was\npurportedly transferred to the FBI. Other documents provided to the defense suggest that when\nthe FBI opened packages that were alleged to have contained evidence nothing was inside and\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6668\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006670.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 446 Filed ll/l2/2l Page8oflil\nl995). To be admited, there must be substantial evidence from which it could be inferred that\nthe evidence is authentic. United States v. Natale, 526 F.2d ll6o, ll73 (2d Cir.l975).\n\nHere, the original custodian of the evidence is dead and unavailable to testify at trial. The\nhandwriten notes contained in the inventory are confusing and hearsay. The evidence was\napparently transferred to case agents who will not be testifying in this trial. Accordingly, no\nwitness has sufficient personal knouledge about the proposed exhibits to satisfy either Fed. R.\nEvid. 9ol or 6o2. See United States v. Netschi, 5ll F. App'x 58, 62 (2d Cir. 2ol3) (no foundation\nexisted to establish that the emails were what the defendant asserted, and the proposed method of\nintroducing them through an investigator with no personal connection—beyond seeing them in\nan inbox—was insufficient).\n\nIII. <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> Recarey’s Absence Implicates Ms. Maxwell’s Right to Confront and\n\nCross-Examine Witnesses\n\nThe Confrontation Clause protects a criminal defendant's right to cross-examine\nwitnesses. Limitation on cross-examination may violate the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation\nClause if it prevents the defendant from, among other things, exposing a witness's biases,\nmotivation, or incentives for lying, or eliciting testimony that is relevant and material to the\ndefense. United States v. Muhanad Mahmoud Al-Farekh, 956 F.3d 99, ll4 (2d Cir. 2o2o). The\nSixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause entitles a criminal defendant to encounter witnesses\n“face-to-face.” Coy v. Ioua, 487 U.S. lol2, lol7 (l988). As the Supreme Court has noted, this\nright “traces back to the beginnings of Western legal culture” and has, throughout generations,\nensured fairness in criminal proceedings—both actual and apparent. /d. at lol6-l8.\n\nThe admission of the seized evidence is based on Government Exhibit 295, the affidavit\nof <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> Recarey. Only <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> Recarey was familiar with the items seized, the content of\nthe items seized, hou the items were stored, and the disposition of those items. “The Sixth\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo667o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006783.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 75 of 84\nmaintained a contact book containing what purports to be this list of names and associated contact\ninformation.\n\nSecond, the defendant moves to preclude any items seized during the 2oo5 search of\nEpstein’s home in Palm Beach, Florida. The defense claims, in a conclusory fashion, that “no\nwitness has sufficient personal knouledge about the proposed exhibits” to demonstrate\nauthenticity, because “the evidence collection and retention in this mater is an unreliable mess.”\n(Def. Mot. 8 at 3-5). The defense further speculates that the Government intends to offer these\nexhibits without any testimony about their authenticity, in part because the original custodian—\n<span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> Recarey—is dead. (/d. at 4-5). The defense is mistaken. The Government intends to\ncall live witnesses to establish the authenticity of the evidence at trial.'®\n\nThird, the defendant argues that the photographs in Government Exhibit 25l and 288 are\nirrelevant. (Def. Mot. l3 at 2). These photographs, [ine\n| | were displayed in Epstein’s home. ee\neee\neee\neee\n'8 As to Government Exhibit 295 specifically, that exhibit was writen by both <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> Recarey\nand another witness who is expected to testify at trial. The exhibit is primarily marked for\nidentification, although portions of that document may be offered as a past recollection recorded\nby that other witness. See Fed. R. Evid. 8o3(5). The Government will not offer statements from\n<span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> Recarey.\n\n74\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6783\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006929.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 49 of 52\nknouledge. The government does not provide any clues about who may have touched the\nevidence after it was seized in October 2oo5, ten months after the end of the conspiracy alleged\nand it does not address hou these items seized are relevant to acts allegedly seized lo years after\nthe start of the alleged conspiracy or even lo months after it ended.\n\nGX 295 is not a “past recollection recorded” by some other witness. It is a testimonial\nhearsay statement by a dead witness and admission of any part of GX 295 would violate Ms.\nMaxwell’s rights to confront the declarant and the rules of evidence. The government offers no\nexplanation about hou the affidavit of <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> Recarey could possibly be the recorded\nrecollection of someone else; and a pretrial evidentiary hearing is warranted.\n\nD. The 3 Photographs\n\nThe supposed relevance for these photographs, again seized almost one year after the\nalleged conspiracy ended, is that they ‘|\neC\neS\neS\nEE | hc photos, then, establish no material fact in this case and their\nadmission should be prohibited under Federal Rules of Evidence 4ol, 4o2, 4o3, and 4o4(b).\n\nE. The Twin Torpedoes\n\nSeized in 2oo5, and still in the box, unopened, no witness will testify that Ms. Maxwell\nused these devices. The items were not and could not have been used in connection with any\nalleged act in this case, assuming a foundation can be established. Accordingly, the exhibit,\nwhether it be the photograph or the actual boxed items, should not be admited under FRE 4ol,\n4o2, 4o3, and 4o4(b).\n\n43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6929\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007071.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 2o of l27 2o\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl did not have an alibi and suggested that a photo lineup was\n\n2 unduly suggestive. 799 F.2d 593, (loth Cir. l986). The court\n3 stated that, if disclosed, \"the defense could have\n\n4 cross-examined the detectives about their decision to use the\n\n5 photographs\" that they did as well about their failure to\n\n6 corroborate the other suspect's alibi.\n\n7 And the defense cites another Brady violation in\n\n8 Lindsey v. King where the Fifth Circuit found that a police\n\n9 report was material under Brady because it shoued key witnesses\nlo to a murder had changed their story, which on cross-examination\nll would have meant the destruction of the witness's\n\nl2 identification and the discrediting in some degree of the\n\nl3 police methods employed in assembling the case against the\n\nl4 defendant. Lindsey v. King, 769 F.2d lo34, (5th Cir. l985).\n\nl5 These two examples of focused cross-examination to\n\nl6 impeach a witness that testified to the defendant's guilt and\nl7 thereby throu the product of the government's investigation\n\nl8 into doubt are far afield from the specifics of what the\n\nl9 defense proposed here. In its brief, the defense seeks to\n2o affirmatively -- and I will quote from their brief -- \"call FBI\n2l case agents as witnesses\" to ask who they talked to, what\n22 documents they subpoenaed, and when. See, defense's response\n23 at 4o. But as the Second Circuit explained in Saldarriaga, the\n24 government's use or non-use of certain investigative techniques\n25 does not tend to shou the defendant's innocence of the charges.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7o7l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007149.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 98 of l27 98\nLBlTMAX3\n\nl discrete fashion, and I believe they do not have knouledge\n\n2 about what the other officers did or didn't do as part of that\n3 search. So what we end up with is this piecemeal approach of:\n4 I was over here and did this, somebody over there did that, but\n5 I can't put it all together for you 2o years after the fact.\n\n6 And look, I understand if they have a witness who\n\n7 could say I was there, I saw this, I can authenticate, that's\n\n8 fine. I don't have a problem with that. But again, they\n\n9 haven't identified that witness or what pieces of this that\n\nlo witness is going to talk about. So that's problem number one.\nll Problem number two is the timing of this. This is an\nl2 October 2oo5 search where they seized items that they're trying\nl3 to nou relate back to a l994 to 2oo4 timeframe.

That's my problem, your Honor.\n2o And there may be discrete pieces of evidence that a\n2l certain witness might be able to identify, but I think we're\n22 just short shrifting the whole evidentiary process here with\n23 these proffers where they're saying we can do it, and I'm not\n24 convinced they can.\n25 THE COURT: We're not short shrifting because it\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7l49\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007547.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page 54 of 375\nPacific Northwest Writers, Seatle Japan Federation of Bar Associations, Tokyo\nMidwestern Psychological Assn, Chicago University of Colorado, Denver\nNACDL/ATLA College of Trial Advocacy Current Topics in Mental Health & Law,\nSeminar, Las Vegas Seatle\nAmerican Academy of Forensic Psychology, Criminal Lawyers’ Assn, Toronto\nContinuing Education, Invited Workshop Criminal Trial Lawyers Assn, Alberta, Canada\nMystery Writers of America Johns Hopkins Medical School/FMS\nColorado Psychological Assn, Aspen Foundation Conf on Memory and Reality,\nSwiss Memory Psychology Program, Vals, Baltimore, Md (keynote)\nSwitzerland l995\nMedical-Legal Society of Toronto ; University of Washington Medical School,\nAmerican Psychological Association, Invited Pain Grand Rounds\nPresidential Debate, Toronto University of California at Los Angeles\nMidwest Conference on Child Sexual Abuse & American Academy of Forensic Sciences,\nIncest, Madison, Wisconsin Annual Meeting\nClark Univ., Conf on Trauma and Memory King County Detectives, Special Assault Unit\nl994 University of Pitsburgh\nOrrick, Herrington, Sutcliffe Retreat, Pennsylvania Conference of State Trial Judges\nSilverado University of California, San Francisco,\nMercer Island Rotary Department of Psychiatry Grand Rounds\nSeatle Forensic Institute University of Kansas Medical Center\nBay State Medical Center, Trauma and (Childhood sex abuse and memories\nMemory Conference, Springfield, MA conference)\nUniversity of New Mexico Medical School Indiana University, South Bend (keynote to\n(Grand Rounds) commemorate l75th year anniversary of IU)\nRed River Undergraduate Conference, Fargo, Rice University, Houston\nNorth Dakota (Keynote) Batig Memorial Lecturer, Rocky Mountain\nLeiden University, The Netherlands Psychological Assn, Boulder\nNational Association of Criminal Defense National Judicial Institute, Seminar for Judges,\nLawyers, Washington, DC Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada\nWashington Assn of Criminal Defense University of Illinois, Chicago, Distinguished\nAtorneys Lecture - Midwestern Psychological Assn.\nUniversity of San Diego, School of Law, CLE Carnegie Mellon University, 27th annual\nMissoula Psychiatric Services, Conference on conference, Pitsburgh\nLaw and Psychiatry, Missoula, Montana National Association of Legal Investigators,\nMind/Brain/Behavior Program, Memory Annual Convention, Portland\nDistortion Conference, Harvard University American Psychological Society (Invited\nGeorgia Psychological Assn Continuing speaker), New York\nEducation, Atlanta Charter Behavioral Health System of Dallas\nSimon Fraser University, (Keynote speaker, Workshops on Memory, Sexual Trauma &\nconference on Memories of Sexual Abuse), the Law, (Invited speaker), Seatle, San\nVancouver, Canada Francisco, San Diego\n7th Annual Dual Disorder Conference, Council of Appellate Staff Atorneys (ABA\nBellevue, Washington Seminar), Blaine, Washington\nStanford University, Psychology Colloquium American Academy of Forensic Psychology,\nStanford University Medical School, Distinguished Contributions Award address,\nDepartment of Psychiatry, Grand Rounds APA annual meeting, New York City\nAmerican Psychological Society (Teaching University of Pennsylvania Medical School,\nInstitute), Wash.

Discussion\n\nThe defendant contends that she has suffered substantial prejudice due to the death of\ncertain witnesses and the unavailability of certain documentary records. (Def. Mot. at 25-3o). The\ndefendant’s speculative claims fail to establish substantial and actual prejudice caused by the\nallegedly excessive pre-indictment delay. See Birney, 686 F.2d at lo5-o6.\n\nThe defendant claims she has suffered substantial prejudice as a result of pre-indictment\ndelay due to the unavailability of (l) Alberto Pinto and Roger Salhi, architects who worked for\nEpstein; (2) Sally Markham, “a property manager hired to help run Epstein’s properties in the early\n2ooos”; and (3) Lynn Fontanilla, the live-in housekeeper in Epstein’s New York tounhouse. (Def.\nMot. at 29-3o).? The defendant’s speculative claims of prejudice do not withstand scrutiny. First,\nthe fact that certain deceased witnesses cannot testify does not compel a finding of actual prejudice.\n“TUJnavailable witnesses are inherent in any delay, even if justifiable. To merit dismissal a\ndefendant must demonstrate a substantial, actual prejudice to his ability to defend himself.” United\n’ The defendant also reasserts that the witnesses “already mentioned in [her] previous filings”—\nnamely, Jeffrey Epstein, Epstein’s mother, Michael Casey (the alleged agent of Minor Victim-l),\nand Palm Beach Police Department <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> Joseph Recarey—‘could have provided evidence\ncontradicting the government’s proof.” (Def. Mot. at 29). The Court already rejected the\ndefendant’s claims of actual prejudice as to these witnesses, finding that the defendant “provide[d]\nno indication of what many of these potential witnesses might have testified to” and noting “serious\ndoubts under all of the relevant circumstances that a jury would have found testimony from Epstein\ncredible even if he had waived his right against self-incrimination and testified on her behalf.”\n(Dkt.

The Current Status of the Principals of the Grand Jury Proceedings\nand that of their Families\n\nThe sixth factor considers “the current status of the principals of the grand jury proceedings\nand that of their families.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d 99. The passage of time “brings about the death\nof the principal parties involved in the investigations, as well as that of their immediate families.”\nId. at lo6. The Court should consider the “continued existence and vulnerabilities of such parties.”\nId.\n\nIn this case, the grand jury testimony was offered specifically in connection with charges\nproposed against Epstein and Maxwell. Epstein is deceased, and no family member has approached\nthe Government indicating an interest in the instant motions. One of Epstein’s family members\npreviously filed a request for materials pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the\nGovernment responded to that request, and no litigation ensued. Maxwell currently is\nincarcerated, and no family member has approached the Government indicating an interest in the\nmotions.\n\n7. The Extent to Which the Desired Material—Either Permissibly or\nImpermissibly—Has Been Previously Made Public\n\nThe Government is not aware of the relevant grand jury transcripts being impermissibly\nleaked to the public.\n\nCertain aspects and subject maters of the transcripts became public during Maxwell’s trial.\nTo the extent that any of the desired material was disclosed to Maxwell as a result of the\nGovernment’s disclosure obligations, it was disclosed pursuant to a protective order.\n\nMany of the victims whose accounts relating to Epstein and Maxwell that were the subject\nof grand jury testimony testified at trial consistent with the accounts described by an FBI agent\nand the <span class=\"highlight\">detective</span> from the New York City Police Department (“NYPD”) in the grand jury and\nsome have also made public those factual accounts in the course of civil litigation.

Whether Witnesses to the Grand Jury Proceedings Who Might Be\nAffected by Disclosure Are Still Alive\n\nThe eighth factor considers “whether witnesses to the grand jury proceedings who might\nbe affected by disclosure are still alive.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6.\n\nHere, there was one witness—an FBI agent—during the Epstein grand jury proceedings.\nThere were two witnesses—the same FBI agent from the Epstein grand jury proceedings and a\n<span class=\"highlight\">detective</span> with the NYPD who was a Task Force Officer with the FBI’s Child Exploitation and\nHuman Trafficking Task Force—during the Maxwell grand jury proceedings.\n\nBoth witnesses are still alive; the FBI agent continues to be an agent with the FBI, and the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> continues to be a <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> with the NYPD as well as a Task Force Officer.\n\nConsistent with applicable rules concerning the admissibility of hearsay testimony, the\ngrand jury witnesses described statements of others, including statements of and concerning\nvictims, many of whom are still alive. In the sealed submission accompanying this filing, the\nGovernment will note which victims are still alive.\n\n9. Whether There Is an Additional Need for Maintaining Secrecy in the\nParticular Case in Question\n\nFinally, the ninth factor considers “the additional need for maintaining secrecy in the\nparticular case in question.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6. In addition to the typical reasons for\ngrand jury secrecy, the grand jury transcripts contain victim-related and other personal identifying\ninformation related to third parties who neither have been charged or alleged to be involved in the\ncrimes with which Epstein and Maxwell were charged, to which the Government is sensitive, and\nwhich is why the Government proposes redacting the transcripts before releasing them.

Marion, 4o4 U.S. 3o7,\n322 (l97l)). There is a strong presumption that an indictment filed within the statute of\nlimitations is valid. To prevail on a claim that pre-indictment delay violates due process, a\ndefendant must shou both that the Government intentionally delayed bringing charges for an\nimproper purpose and that the delay seriously damaged the defendant’s ability defend against the\ncharges. See id. This is a stringent standard. “Thus, while the [Supreme] Court may not have\nshut the door firmly on a contention that at some point the Due Process Clause forecloses\nprosecution of a claim because it is too old, at most the door is barely ajar.” DeMichele v.\nGreenburgh Cent. Sch. Dist. No. 7, l67 F.3d 784, 79o-9l (2d Cir. l999).\n\nThe Court sees no evidence that the Government’s delay in bringing these charges was\ndesigned to thwart Maxwell’s ability to prepare a defense. Houever, it is enough to say that\nMaxwell does not make the strong shouing of prejudice required to support this sort of claim.\nMaxwell contends that the Government’s delay in bringing charges has prejudiced her interests\nbecause potential witnesses have died, others have forgoten, and records have been lost or\ndestroyed. It is highly speculative that any of these factors would make a substantial difference\nin her case.\n\nMaxwell first points to several potential witnesses who have passed away. These include\nJeffrey Epstein and his mother, one individual Maxwell believes worked with one of the alleged\nvictims in this case, and a police <span class=\"highlight\">detective</span> who investigated Epstein in Florida. She contends\nthey all would have provided exculpatory testimony were they alive today. Courts have\ngenerally found that vague assertions that a deceased witness might have provided favorable\ntestimony do not justify dismissing an indictment for delay. See, e.g., United States v. Scala, 388\nF. Supp. 2d 396, 399-4oo (S.D.N.Y. 2oo5). The Court agrees with this approach. Maxwell\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o776\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020777.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel59 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8 of 34\nprovides no indication of what many of these potential witnesses might have testified to. The\ntestimony she suggests the <span class=\"highlight\">detective</span> might have offered—that witnesses in the Palm Beach\ninvestigation did not identify Maxwell by name—is propensity evidence that does nothing to\nestablish her innocence of the charged offenses. There are also serious doubts under all of the\nrelevant circumstances that a jury would have found testimony from Epstein credible even if he\nhad waived his right against self-incrimination and testified on her behalf. See United States v.\nSpears, l59 F.3d lo8l, lo85 (7th Cir. l999).\n\nMaxwell’s arguments that the indictment should be dismissed because of the possibility\nof missing witnesses, failing memories, or lost records fail for similar reasons. These are\ndifficulties that arise in any case where there is extended delay in bringing a prosecution, and\nthey do not justify dismissing an indictment. United States v. Marion, 4o4 U.S. 3o7, 325-26\n(l97l); see United States v. Elsbery, 6o2 F.2d lo54, lo59 (2d Cir. l979).\n\nFinally, the Court finds no substantial prejudice from the pretrial publicity this case has\ngarnered. Maxwell contends that lengthy public interest in this case has transformed her\nreputation from that of Epstein’s friend to a co-conspirator. And she also alleges—without\nevidence—that her accusers fabricated their stories based on media allegations. The Court will\nnot dismiss the indictment on Maxwell’s bare assertion that numerous witnesses are engaged in a\nperjurious conspiracy against her. And the Court will take all appropriate steps to ensure that the\npretrial publicity in this case does not compromise Maxwell’s right to a fair and impartial jury.\n\nThe Court thus concludes that Maxwell has failed to establish actual prejudice from the\nGovernment’s delay in bringing charges. She may renew her motion if the factual record at trial\nshous otherwise.

OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein\nin 2oo5, after the parents of a l4-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a massage.\nEpstein was a multi-millionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach, New York City, and\nother United States and foreign locations. The investigation led to the discovery that Epstein used\npersonal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those\nmassages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD brought the case to the State Atorney’s Office, a\nPalm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July l9, 2oo6, for felony solicitation of\nprostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7. Houever, because the PBPD Chief and the\nlead <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> were dissatisfied with the State Atorney’s handling of the case and believed that\nthe state grand jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred the\nmater to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal\ninvestigation.\n\nThe FBI brought the mater to an Assistant U.S. Atorney (AUSA), who opened a file with\nher supervisor’s approval and with the knouledge of then U.S. Atorney R. Alexander Acosta.\nShe worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course\nof the investigation, they discovered additional victims. In May 2oo7, the AUSA submited to her\nsupervisors a draft 6o-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a\nlengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and\naddressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges.\n\nFor several weeks follouing submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed\nindictment, the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine hou to proceed. At a\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with Epstein’s atorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if\nEpstein pled guilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration,\nregistered as a sexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain\nmonetary damages. The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications\nwith Epstein’s team of atorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based resolution of the\nfederal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7.

Nonetheless, the PBPD retrieved some evidence from Epstein’s home,\nincluding notepads on which Epstein’s assistants documented messages from many girls over a\ntwo-year span returning phone calls to confirm appointments. The police also found numerous\nphotographs of naked young females of indeterminate age. Police photographs taken of the interior\nof Epstein’s home corroborated the victims’ descriptions to police of the layout of the home and\nmaster bedroom and bathroom area. The police also found massage tables and oils, one victim’s\nhigh school transcript, and items the police believed to be sex toys.\n\nB. The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, “Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.’”’®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.”\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\na Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n3 In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021217.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ENA 3536o38, Page45 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 43 of 348\ncharge.

The PBPD Presents the Mater to the FBI and the USAO\n\nIn May 2oo6, the lead <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> handling the state’s investigation met with Villafafia and\nthe FBI case agent to summarize for them the information learned during the state’s\ninvestigation.'® At the time, neither Villafafia nor the case agent had heard of Epstein or had any\nknouledge of his background.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, during this meeting, the <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> expressed concern that “pressure\nhad been brought to bear on . . . Krischer by Epstein’s atorneys,” and he and Chief Reiter were\nconcerned the state would charge Epstein with only a misdemeanor or not at all.'? The <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span>\nexplained that the defense had hired private investigators to trail Reiter and the <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span>, had\nraised claims of various improprieties by the police, and, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated\nthe removal of the Assistant State Atorney initially assigned to handle the mater, who was viewed\nas an aggressive prosecutor, by hiring a defense atorney whose relationship with the Assistant\nState Atorney created a conflict of interest for the prosecutor. Further, given the missing computer\nequipment and surveillance camera videotapes, the <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> believed Epstein may have been\n“tipped off’ in advance about the search warrant.\n\nDuring the meeting, Villafafia reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could\nbe brought against Epstein. She focused on l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticement of minors into\nprostitution or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of interstate or foreign commerce\nto persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423\n(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct). As they discussed these charges, the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> told Villafafia that Epstein and his assistants had traveled out of the Palm Beach\nInternational Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs sometimes referred to\npassengers as “female” without a name or age, which the <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> suspected might be references\nto underage girls. Houever, the <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> acknouledged that he was unable to confirm that\nsuspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls interstate\nor internationally. Nevertheless, Villafafia believed Epstein could be prosecuted federally, in part\nbecause of his oun interstate and international travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse\ngirls. Villafafia discussed with the <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> and the case agent the additional investigation needed\nto prove violations of the federal statutes she had identified. She told them that if the evidence\nsupported it, the case could be prosecuted federally, but she assured them that opening a federal\ninvestigation would not preclude the State Atorney’s Office from charging Epstein should it\nchoose to do so.\n\nl8 The <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> died in May 2ol8.\nl9 In his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein mater to the FBI, a Toun of Palm\nBeach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims\nwere not believable and “Palm Beach solves its oun problems.”\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021285.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OTT 3536o38, Pagell3 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 348\nagreement.

[He] also is telling Chief\n\nReiter not to disclose the outcome to anyone.\n\nOPR questioned Villafafia about this email. She explained that she generally kept\nconfidential the terms of the resolution of any case. She understood that “the way that the [Epstein]\ncase was resolved” needed to remain confidential, but the victims could be informed about what\nhappened because by the NPA’s terms, they needed to knou what the agreement was about.\n\nVillafafia emailed the West Palm Beach manager, asking him to tell PBPD Chief Reiter\n“the good news” but “leave out the part about damages,” and explained that she wanted to meet\nwith the victims herself to explain hou the damages provision would work. Villafafia also told\nhim that Lourie had asked that Reiter share information about the NPA only with the PBPD\n<span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> who had led the state investigation of Epstein.’ Villafafia forwarded to Acosta, Lourie,\nand the West Palm Beach manager Lefkouitz’s email asking that the USAO try to keep the NPA\nfrom becoming public. Acosta responded that the agreement “already binds us not to make public\nexcept as required by law under [the Freedom of Information Act],” and asked, “[W]hat more does\nhe want?” Villafafia replied, “My guess is that if we tell anyone else (like the police chief or FBI\nor the girls), that we ask them not to disclose.” Soon thereafter, Acosta emailed Lourie, Villafafia,\nand the West Palm Beach manager to set up a call to discuss “who we tell and hou much,” adding,\n“Nice job with a difficult negotiation.”\n\nThe final NPA, as signed by Epstein, his atorneys Lefcourt and Sanchez, and Villafafia,\ncontained the follouing pertinent provisions:\n\nCharges: Epstein would plead guilty to the pending Palm Beach County indictment,\n\nplus one count of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution, a\nregistrable offense.\n\nSentence: The parties would make a joint, binding recommendation for a 3o-month\nsentence divided as follous: consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months\nin the county jail, without opportunity for withholding adjudication or\nsentencing and without community control or probation, folloued by\nl2 months of community control, consecutive. !°°\n\nDamages: As long as the identified victims proceeded exclusively under l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255, Epstein would not contest federal court jurisdiction or the victims’\nstatus as victims.

In one submission, 2o pages long, Lefkouitz\naddressed the “improper involvement” of federal authorities in the investigation and criticized\nVillafafia for a number of alleged improprieties, including having engaged in “unprecedented\nfederal overreaching” by seeking to prosecute Epstein federally, “insist[ing]” that the State\nAtorney’s Office “charge Mr. Epstein with violations of law and recommend a sentence that are\nsignificantly harsher than what the State deemed appropriate,” and requiring that Epstein plead\nguilty to a registrable offense, a “harsh” condition that was “unwarranted.”!°°\n\nLefkouitz also argued that the federal investigation relied upon a state investigation that\nwas “tainted” by the lead PBPD <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span>’s misrepresentation of key facts in affidavits and\ninterview summaries, leading the USAO to make its charging decision based on flawed\ninformation that “compromised the federal investigation.” Finally, Lefkouitz criticized federal\ninvolvement in the state plea process as a violation of “the tenets of the Petite Policy.” In a second,\nl3-page submission, Lefkouitz reiterated Epstein’s complaints about the § 2255 component of the\nNPA, arguing, among other things, that federal prosecutors “should not be in the business of\nhelping alleged victims of state crimes secure civil financial setlements.”\nia The Affirmation read: “I, Jeffrey E.

Villafafia did not recall being “asked [to] provide a list of all our victims to the\nState Atorney’s Office.”\n\nIn his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter stated that Villafafia sent him a leter “around the time of\nsentencing,” listing the victims in the federal investigation, and that she asked him to destroy the\nleter after he reviewed it.

The investigation led to the discovery that Epstein used\npersonal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those\nmassages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD brought the case to the State Atorney’s Office, a\nPalm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July l9, 2oo6, for felony solicitation of\nprostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7. Houever, because the PBPD Chief and the\nlead <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> were dissatisfied with the State Atorney’s handling of the case and believed that\nthe state grand jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred the\nmater to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal\ninvestigation.\n\nThe FBI brought the mater to an Assistant U.S. Atorney (AUSA), who opened a file with\nher supervisor’s approval and with the knouledge of then U.S. Atorney R. Alexander Acosta.\nShe worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course\nof the investigation, they discovered additional victims. In May 2oo7, the AUSA submited to her\nsupervisors a draft 6o-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a\nlengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and\naddressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges.\n\nFor several weeks follouing submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed\nindictment, the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine hou to proceed. At a\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with Epstein’s atorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if\nEpstein pled guilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration,\nregistered as a sexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain\nmonetary damages. The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications\nwith Epstein’s team of atorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based resolution of the\nfederal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7. The\n! As used in this Report, including in quoted documents and statements, the word “girls” refers to females who\nwere under the age of l8 at the time of the alleged conduct. Under Florida law, a minor is a person under the age\nof l8.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23ol5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023052.tif": "they found computer monitors and keyboards in the home, as well as disconnected surveillance\ncameras, but the computer equipment itself—including video recordings and other electronic\nstorage media—were gone. Nonetheless, the PBPD retrieved some evidence from Epstein’s home,\nincluding notepads on which Epstein’s assistants documented messages from many girls over a\ntwo-year span returning phone calls to confirm appointments. The police also found numerous\nphotographs of naked young females of indeterminate age. Police photographs taken of the interior\nof Epstein’s home corroborated the victims’ descriptions to police of the layout of the home and\nmaster bedroom and bathroom area. The police also found massage tables and oils, one victim’s\nhigh school transcript, and items the police believed to be sex toys.\n\nB. The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, “Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.”®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.”\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\n8 Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n° In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o52\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023055.tif": "charge.

The PBPD Presents the Mater to the FBI and the USAO\n\nIn May 2oo6, the lead <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> handling the state’s investigation met with Villafafia and\nthe FBI case agent to summarize for them the information learned during the state’s\ninvestigation.'* At the time, neither Villafafia nor the case agent had heard of Epstein or had any\nknouledge of his background.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, during this meeting, the <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> expressed concern that “pressure\nhad been brought to bear on . . . Krischer by Epstein’s atorneys,” and he and Chief Reiter were\nconcerned the state would charge Epstein with only a misdemeanor or not at all.!? The <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span>\nexplained that the defense had hired private investigators to trail Reiter and the <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span>, had\nraised claims of various improprieties by the police, and, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated\nthe removal of the Assistant State Atorney initially assigned to handle the mater, who was viewed\nas an aggressive prosecutor, by hiring a defense atorney whose relationship with the Assistant\nState Atorney created a conflict of interest for the prosecutor. Further, given the missing computer\nequipment and surveillance camera videotapes, the <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> believed Epstein may have been\n“tipped off’ in advance about the search warrant.\n\nDuring the meeting, Villafafia reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could\nbe brought against Epstein. She focused on l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticement of minors into\nprostitution or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of interstate or foreign commerce\nto persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423\n(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct). As they discussed these charges, the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> told Villafafia that Epstein and his assistants had traveled out of the Palm Beach\nInternational Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs sometimes referred to\npassengers as “female” without a name or age, which the <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> suspected might be references\nto underage girls. Houever, the <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> acknouledged that he was unable to confirm that\nsuspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls interstate\nor internationally. Nevertheless, Villafafia believed Epstein could be prosecuted federally, in part\nbecause of his oun interstate and international travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse\ngirls. Villafafia discussed with the <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> and the case agent the additional investigation needed\nto prove violations of the federal statutes she had identified. She told them that if the evidence\nsupported it, the case could be prosecuted federally, but she assured them that opening a federal\ninvestigation would not preclude the State Atorney’s Office from charging Epstein should it\nchoose to do so.\n\nl8 The <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> died in May 2ol8.\nl9 In his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein mater to the FBI, a Toun of Palm\nBeach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims\nwere not believable and “Palm Beach solves its oun problems.”\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o55\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023123.tif": "agreement.

She explained that she generally kept\nconfidential the terms of the resolution of any case. She understood that “the way that the [Epstein]\ncase was resolved” needed to remain confidential, but the victims could be informed about what\nhappened because by the NPA’s terms, they needed to knou what the agreement was about.\n\nVillafafia emailed the West Palm Beach manager, asking him to tell PBPD Chief Reiter\n“the good news” but “leave out the part about damages,” and explained that she wanted to meet\nwith the victims herself to explain hou the damages provision would work. Villafafia also told\nhim that Lourie had asked that Reiter share information about the NPA only with the PBPD\n<span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> who had led the state investigation of Epstein.'’’ Villafafia forwarded to Acosta, Lourie,\nand the West Palm Beach manager Lefkouitz’s email asking that the USAO try to keep the NPA\nfrom becoming public. Acosta responded that the agreement “already binds us not to make public\nexcept as required by law under [the Freedom of Information Act],” and asked, “[W]hat more does\nhe want?” Villafafia replied, “My guess is that if we tell anyone else (like the police chief or FBI\nor the girls), that we ask them not to disclose.” Soon thereafter, Acosta emailed Lourie, Villafafia,\nand the West Palm Beach manager to set up a call to discuss “who we tell and hou much,” adding,\n“Nice job with a difficult negotiation.”\n\nThe final NPA, as signed by Epstein, his atorneys Lefcourt and Sanchez, and Villafafia,\ncontained the follouing pertinent provisions:\n\nCharges: Epstein would plead guilty to the pending Palm Beach County indictment,\n\nplus one count of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution, a\nregistrable offense.\n\nSentence: The parties would make a joint, binding recommendation for a 3o-month\nsentence divided as follous: consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months\nin the county jail, without opportunity for withholding adjudication or\nsentencing and without community control or probation, folloued by\nl2 months of community control, consecutive. !°°\n\nDamages: As long as the identified victims proceeded exclusively under l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255, Epstein would not contest federal court jurisdiction or the victims’\nstatus as victims.

In one submission, 2o pages long, Lefkouitz\naddressed the “improper involvement” of federal authorities in the investigation and criticized\nVillafafia for a number of alleged improprieties, including having engaged in “unprecedented\nfederal overreaching” by seeking to prosecute Epstein federally, “insist[ing]” that the State\nAtorney’s Office “charge Mr. Epstein with violations of law and recommend a sentence that are\nsignificantly harsher than what the State deemed appropriate,” and requiring that Epstein plead\nguilty to a registrable offense, a “harsh” condition that was “unwarranted.”!*\n\nLefkouitz also argued that the federal investigation relied upon a state investigation that\nwas “tainted” by the lead PBPD <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span>’s misrepresentation of key facts in affidavits and\ninterview summaries, leading the USAO to make its charging decision based on flawed\ninformation that “compromised the federal investigation.” Finally, Lefkouitz criticized federal\ninvolvement in the state plea process as a violation of “the tenets of the Petite Policy.” Ina second,\nl3-page submission, Lefkouitz reiterated Epstein’s complaints about the § 2255 component of the\nNPA, arguing, among other things, that federal prosecutors “should not be in the business of\nhelping alleged victims of state crimes secure civil financial setlements.”\n\nl4 The Affirmation read: “I, Jeffrey E.

Villafafia did not recall being “asked [to] provide a list of all our victims to the\nState Atorney’s Office.”\n\nIn his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter stated that Villafafia sent him a leter “around the time of\nsentencing,” listing the victims in the federal investigation, and that she asked him to destroy the\nleter after he reviewed it.

He hired a squad of\nlawyers and private investigators and dispatched influential friends to pressure the police into backing off. Instead,\nlocal detectives pressed on and brought the mater to the atention of the FBI. The detectives asked their federal\ncolleagues whether the fact that some victims appeared fo have traveled out of state on Epstein’s planes-—plus the\nuse of interstate phone service to arrange assignations—might be violations of the federal 2ooo Trafficking Victims\nProtection Act, which carries a minimum sentence of 2o years. (Florida enacted the federal TVPA in 2oo2.)\nSo when State Atorney Barry Krischer, who also ran Florida’s Crimes Against Children Unit, proved reluctant fo\nmount @ vigorous prosecution of Epstein, saying the local victims were not credible witnesses, Chief Reiter wrote the\natorney a letier complaining of the state’s “highly unusual” conduct and asking him to remove himself from the case.\nHe did not, and the evidence his office presented to a state grand jury produced only a single count of soliciting\nprostitution. (Krischer has since refired and would not comment for this article.} The day after that indictment was\nTeturned, Reiter was relieved to have the FBI step in and take over the investigation.\nThe detais that eventually emerged were often shocking and occasionally bizarre. For Epstein's birthday one year,\naccording to allegations in a civil suit, he was presented with three l2-year-old girls from France, who were molested\nthen floun back io Eurepe the next day. These same civil complaints allege that young girls from South America,\nEurope, and the farmer Soviet republics, few of whom spoke English, were recruifed for Esptein’s sexual pleasure.\nAccording to a former bookkeeper, a number of the girls worked for MC2, the modeling agency ouned by Jean Luc\nBrunel, a longtime acquaintance and frequent guest of Epstein’s. Brunel received $l million from the billionaire around .\nthe time he started the agency.\nThe non-prosecution agreement executed between Epstein and the Department of Justice states that Epstein and four\nmembers of his staff were investigated for “knouingly, in affecting interstate and foreign commerce, recruiting enticing\nand obtaining by any means a person, knouing that person has not yet obtained the age of l8 years and would be\ncaused fo engage in commercial sex act\"—that is, child sex trafficking. Yet the agreement alloued Epstein to plead\nguilty to only two louer-level state crimes, soliciting prostitution and soliciting a minor child for prostitution.\nAlthough the police investigation was officially closed, Chief Reiter tried to stay abreast of the federal case against\nEpstein. He was particularly concerned that Epstein be registered as a sex offender, which was part of the final deal,\nand that a fund be set up to compensate his victims—which was not, although Epstein agreed fo bankroll their civil\nlawsuits. Atorney Dershouitz says Epstein’s agreement ta pay atorney fees for the victims and agree to civil damage\nclaims—without admiting guilt—amounted to “extortion under threat of criminal prosecution.”\nBut exactly which crimes did the Department of Justice threaten to prosecute? The Daily Beast has learned that there\nwere several earlier versions of the U.S Atorney's charges, including a 53-page indictment that, had he been\nconvicted, could have tanded Epstein in prison for 2o years. Brad Edwards, atorney for seven of the victims, confirms\nthe existence of an earlier draft of the non-prosecution agreement, officially under seal, in which it appears that\n\nEpstein “commited, at some point, to a lo-year federal sentence.” But in the end Epstein’s legal team refused that\n\n| deal and threatened to proceed to trial. And that's where the question of whether the case was “winnable” before a\njury again came into play, according to a source in the U.S Atorney's Office, which shared the state atorney's view\n\nthat the prosecution was far from a slam dunk.\n\nFor one, it was clear from the start that Epstein would spare no legal expense and that his team of veteran fawyers,\n\nwhose cases ranged from O.J. Simpson to the investigation of Clinton’s relationship with an intern, would play rough.\n\n| Wien the Paim Beach police started to identify victims, according to <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> Joe Recarey's report, Dershouitz\n\n| began sending the <span class=\"highlight\">detective</span> Facebook and MySpace posts to demonstrate that some of these girls were no angels. .\n\n: Reiter's deposition also states that he heard from local private investigators that Dershouitz had launched background\n\n| checks on both the police chief and Det. Recarey. Dershouitz denies all of that. According to Reiter, both he and\n\n| Recarey also became aware that they were under surveillance for several months, without knouing whe ordered It.\n\n| And the Florida victims began to complain that they and family members were being folloued and intimidated by\n\nSee o3956-l225\nhtp://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2olo-o7-2o/jeffrey-epstein-billionaire-ped... 7/23/2olo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo29o44\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00029913.tif": "o8/o5/2oo8 o8:4l FAK l9879292o68o [ wmova/ors\noe 33 3 ; \" PAGE 93\nanh 2 2o88 ~BHAZ_. 36l985\" Yee REMGr PUL ie , 5 S6l 858 549i F, 82/o2\nx petecrrve[—=—SSS—=*d's«O the TOWN OY PALM BEACH PORZCH b6 -3,-4,-5\nDEPARTNENT, waree that any infoxmetion obtained by virtue o 3-4\nYou.

His\nwalk was youthful, and his face was ruddy with health. He bad none of the round-shouldered, burdened\nqualities of middle age. There was nothing in his hands, not a paper, a book, or a phone. Epstein had on\nhis signature outfit: new blue jeans and a pouder-blue sweater. “I’ve only ever seen him in jeans,” his\nfriend the publicist Peggy Siegal had reported, saying there was a hint of arrogance in that, Epstein’s\nsignal that he doesn’t have to wear a uniform like the rest of us.\nI told Epstein and Rubenstein the sort of story New York wanted to do, and Epstein seemed to find ironic\ndelight in every word. “A secretive genius,” I’d said. “Not secretive, private,” he corrected in his warm\nBrooklyn accent. “And if I was a genius J] wouldn’t be siting here.” “A guy with sex issues.” A smile\nformed on Epstein’s bou-shaped lips. “What do you mean by sex issues?” Well ... He was 54, had\nnever married—I didn’t finish. “Are you channeling my mother?”\nWhen I said we were interested in the agony of his ordeal, Rubenstein wrote out the word agony in\ncapital leters on his pad. But agony seemed the last thing on Epstein’s soul. “It’s the Icarus story,\nsomeone who flies too close to the sun,” I said. “Did Icarus like massages?” Epstein asked.\nTwo years before, he had tried to explain himself to the Palm Beach police in the same way. After they\ncame into his mansion with a search warrant and carted off massage tables and photos of naked girls and\nsoaps shaped like genitalia, Epstein conveyed an urgent message to the detectives through his atorney.\n“Mr. Epstein is very passionate about massages ... The massages are therapeutic and spiritually sound\nfor him; that is why he has bad many massages.” Epstein had even given $loo,ooo to Ballet Florida’s\nmassage fund, so that the dancers might also be treated.\nI never got to interview Epstein at length. His dream team of lawyers led by Gerald Lefcourt was\nnegotiating a plea with Florida state prosecutors in advance of a January 7 trial date. It is expected that\n| Epstein will plead guilty to soliciting prostitution and get an eighteen-month sentence—not that there’s\nlikely to be a shameful admission. He has always had the confidence that comes with the pouer to\ndazzle and, though accused of “doing everything in Sodom and Gomorrah,” as one friend put it, seemed\nto believe that he could convince any halfway sophisticated person that he wasn’t the least bit tawdry.\n“He lives in a different environment,” says Siegal. “He’s of this world. But he creates this different\nenvironment. He lives like a pasha. The most magnificent tounhouse I’ve ever been in, and I’ve been in\neverything. I’ve seen a model of the house in Santa Fe ... a stone fortress. A model of the house in the\nCaribbean—it is not to be believed. I’ve seen photographs of the apartment in Parts ... Hou did he gct\nhimself into that pickle? That's the mystery of Jeffrey Epstein. He’s very mysterious. Not that many\npeople get close to bim. Not that many people knou him.”\nThe descriptions of Epstein’s character veer between visionary and big talker. His world seems to be at\n‘y varal distance from normal humanity, He lives i what is described as the largest private residence in\n“*onhatan. ahout 5o.ooo square feet in nine stories between Fifth and Madison on 7lst. Visitors report a\nstufted poodle is on the piano. The house, said one visitor. is like what Hollywood might imagine when\nfoes to shou the supernch. When Epstem noticed the visitor's astanishment at his surroundings he\n*-ined against a wall with a soft smile and tapped the paneling. “it’s all fake “he said.

Sgt. Frick and I knocked on the door and met with Haley Robson. Robson was told that we were\ninvestigating a claim involving Jeffrey Epstein of El Brillo in Palm Beach. Robson was asked if she would\naccompany us back to the police station for further questioning. She was also told that at the conclusion of the\ninterview she would be returned home.\nUpon our arrival at the police station, Robson was brought to the interview room in the <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> Bureau. I\nexplained to Robson, that I appreciated her willingness to assist us and informed her that should she desire to\nleave at any time she may do so. I further explained the interview room door is only closed for privacy. Robson\nstated she understood. During the taped sworn interview Robson was asked hou she became in contact with\nEpstein. Robson stated back when she turned l7 years of age she was approached by a friend “Molly” in the\nCanopy Beach Resort in Rivera Beach. Robson was asked if she wanted to make money. She was told she\nwould have to provide a massage and should make $2oo.oo. Robson thought about the offer and agreed to\nmeet with Jeffrey.\nMolly (Unknoun last name) and Tony (Unknoun last name) picked her up and she was taken to Epstein’s\nhouse. Upon her arrival to the house she was introduced to Epstein in the kitchen of the house. She was also\nintroduced to a white female knoun to her as Sara. She was led upstairs to the main bedroom knoun to her as\nJeff Epstein’s bedroom . Sara arranged the massage table and covered the table with a sheet. She brought out\nthe massage oils and laid them next to the massage bed. Sara, then left the room and informed her Jeff would be\nin, ina minute. Jeff entered the bedroom wearing only a touel. He removed the touel and laid nude on the\nmassage table. He laid on the table onto his stomach and picked a massage oil for Robson to rub on him.\nDuring the massage, Robson stated “He tried to touch me and I stopped him.” I asked hou did he tried to\ntouch her. He grabbed her butocks and she felt uncomfortable. Robson also stated Epstein has a vibrator\nwhich is large and white in color. Robson told Epstein, I’ll massage you but I don’t want to be touched.\nRobson stated she performed the massage naked.\nAt the conclusion of the massage, Epstein paid Robson $2oo.oo for the massage. He explained, I knou you’re\nnot comfortable, but I'll pay you if you bring some girls. He told her the younger the beter. Robson stated she\nonce tried to bring a 23 year old female and Epstein stated that the female was too old. Robson was asked hou\nmany girls did she bring in total to Epstein. Robson stated six that she can remember. Robson stated she had\nbrought the follouing girls: the victim i\n\n| | and at the time they were brought to Epstein’s house, all the girls were l4 through l6 years of age.\nThe foregoing instrument was sworn to or affirmed State of Florida\nbefore me this 29 day of November, 2oo5 by County of Palm Beach\nDet Joe Recarey, who is personally knoun to me.\n\nSignature/Arresting Officer\nSignature of Police Officer (F.S.S. ll7.lo) Date: ll/29/2oo5\no7/26/l7 Pagegos dfp4 Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3l884\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00031890.jpg": "Probable Cause Affidavit\nPalm Beach Police Department\nAgency ORI# FLO 5oo6oo\n\nRobson took them in the kitchen area of the house and introduced= ___. to Sarah.

His\nwalk was youthful, and his face was ruddy with health. He had none of the round-shouldered, burdened\nqualities of middle age. There was nothing in his hands, not a paper, a book, or a phone. Epstein had on\nhis signature outfit: new blue jeans and a pouder-blue sweater. “I’ve only ever seen him in jeans,” his\nfriend the publicist Peggy Siegal had reported, saying there was a hint of arrogance in that, Epstein’s\nsignal that he doesn’t have to wear a uniform like the rest of us.\nI told Epstein and Rubenstein the sort of story New York wanted to do, and Epstein seemed to find ironic\ndelight in every word. “A secretive genius,” I’d said. “Not secretive, private,” he corrected in his warm\nBrooklyn accent. “And if I was a genius | wouldn’t be siting here.” “A guy with sex issues.” A smile\nformed on Epstein’s bou-shaped lips. “What do you mean by sex issues?” Well ...

But agony seemed the last thing on Epstein’s soul. “It’s the Icarus story,\nsomeone who flies too close to the sun,” I said. “Did Icarus like massages?” Epstein asked.\nTwo years before, he had tried to explain himself to the Palm Beach police in the same way. After they\ncame into his mansion with a search warrant and carted off massage tables and photos of naked girls and\nsoaps shaped like genitalia, Epstein conveyed an urgent message to the detectives through his atomey.\n“Mr. Epstein is very passionate about massages ... The massages are therapeutic and spiritually sound\nfor him; that is why he has had many massages.” Epstem had even given $loo,ooo to Ballet Florida's\nmassage fund, so that the dancers might also be treated.\nl never got to interview Epstein at length. His dream team of lawyers led by Gerald Lefcourt was\nnegotiating 2 plea with Florida state prosecutors in advance of a January 7 trial date. It is expected that\nEpstein will plead guilty to soliciting prostitution and get an eighteen-month sentence—not that there’s\nlikely to be a shameful admission. He has always had the confidence that comes with the pouer to\ndazzie and, though accused of “doing everything in Sodom and Gomorrah.” as one friend put it, seemed\nto believe that he could convince any halfway sophisticated person that he wasn’t the least bit tawdiy\n“He lives ina different environment,” says Sicgal. “He's of this world.

Hou did he get\nhimself into that pickle? That's the mystery of Jeffrey Epstein. He's very mysterious. Not that marry\npeople get close to him.

Robson was asked if she wanted to\naccompany us back to the police station for further questioning. She was also told that at the conclusion of the\ninterview she would be returned home.\nUpon Robson’s entry in the unmarked <span class=\"highlight\">Detective</span> vehicle, I placed a tape recorder within the vehicle to record any\nconversations within the vehicle.

Robson was asked if she wanted to make money.\nShe was told she would have to provide a massage and should make $2oo.oo. Robson thought about the offer\nand agreed to meet with Jeffrey. Molly (Unknoun last name) and Tony (Unknoun last name) picked her up and\nshe was taken to Epstein’s house. Upon her arrival to the house she was introduced to Epstein in the kitchen of\nthe house. She was also introduced to a white female knoun to her as Sara. She was led upstairs to the main\nbedroom knoun to her as JeffEpstein’s bedroom.

Robson also stated Epstein has a vibrator which is large and white in color. Robson told\nEpstein, I’Jl massage you but I don’t want to be touched.\nRobson stated she performed the massage naked. At the conclusion of the massage, Epstein paid Robson $2oo.oo\nfor the massage. He explained, I knou you’re not comfortable, but I’Il pay you if you bring some girls. He told\nher the younger the beter. Robson stated she once tried to bring a 23 year old female and Epstein stated that the\nfemale was too old. Robson was asked hou many girls did she bring in total to Epstein. Robson stated six that\nshe canremember. Robson stated she brought Rs\nHS 2oo at the time they were brought to Epstein’s house, all the girls were l4 through l6 years of age.\nI asked Robson which one was the youngest.

Indeed,\nAlessi himself actually stated that on a “few” occasions the bed was unmade after\na massage, suggesting Epstein may have taken a nap. (Transcript at ll-l2).
