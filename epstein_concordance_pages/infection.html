This is likely to continue in light of the spike in COVID <span class=\"highlight\">infection</span> within and outside the\nMDC. Within a two-day period from December l to December 3, 55 inmates tested positive,\ncompared with 25 from March to December l. As of the date of this filing, the BOP reports 8o\nMDC inmates and staff with COVID.”™ If legal visits are suspended, it will further limit our\nability to review the voluminous discovery (well in excess of one million documents) with Ms.\nMaxwell and will further compromise her ability to prepare her defense. Moreover, as this Court\nobserved in United States v. Stephens, if an outbreak occurs “substantial medical and security\nchallenges would almost certainly arise.” Stephens, 447 F. Supp. 3d at 65. We urge the Court to\nweigh the threat of COVID as a factor favoring release in this case, as it did in Stephens.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nGhislaine Maxwell is commited to defending herself and wants nothing more than to\nremain in this country, with her family and friends by her side, so that she can fight the\nallegations against her and clear her name. She is determined to ensure that her sureties and her\nfamily do not suffer because of any breach of the terms of her bond. We have presented a\nsubstantial bail package that satisfies the concerns of the Court and the government, which\ncontains more than ample security and safeguards to reasonably assure that Ms. Maxwell\nremains in New York and appears in court. The Court has the obligation to ensure that a\ndefendant’s constitutional right to prepare a defense is safeguarded. The correct—and only\nlegitimate—decision is to grant Ms. Maxwell bail on the proposed strict conditions.\nM4 See htps://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/.\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo58", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024163.jpg": "Bureau of Prisons\nHealth Services\nMedical Duty Status\nReg #: 763l8-o54 innate Name: EPSTEIN, JEFFREY EDWARD\nHousing Status\n___ confined to the living quarters except _ meals __pilline __ treatments Exp.
