Gentile, 235 F. Supp. 3d 649, 655 (D.N.J.\n2ol7), and that case, which did not concern Section 3283, relied extensively on a pre-Landgraf\nopinion requiring a clear statement of congressional intent in favor of retroactivity. See id. at 655\n(citing United States v. <span class=\"highlight\">Richardson</span>, 5l2 F.2d lo5 (3d Cir. l975)). That clear-statement rule is\ninconsistent with the analysis required by Landgraf step two. See Nader, 425 F. Supp. 3d at 63l\n(rejecting an identical argument relying on Toussie and Gentile).\n\n3s 2K 3\n\nThe defendant asks this Court to break new ground and become the first court to hold that\nSection 3283 applies only prospectively. The Court should reject this invitation. For the reasons\nset forth above, the weight of authority holds that Section 3283 applies retroactively, in keeping\nwith Congress’s express intent to expand prosecutions of individuals who sexually exploit\nchildren. The Indictment is timely, and the motion should be denied.\n\nC. The Defendant’s Crimes Involved the Sexual Abuse of Minors\n\nThe defendant next argues that Section 3283 does not apply at all, and she asks the Court\nto conclude that the crimes of sexual abuse alleged in the Indictment did not involve sexual abuse.\nHer argument runs contrary to both the case law and common sense. Her motion is meritless and\nshould be denied.\n\nBy its terms, Section 3283 applies to any “offense involving the sexual or physical abuse,\nor kidnaping, of a child under the age of l8 years.” l8 U.S.C. § 3283. As discussed above, when\nthe statute was first enacted, it was located at l8 U.S.C. § 35o9(k). The definition of the term\n“sexual abuse” is located in a neighboring provision within that same section:\n\nFor purposes of this section . . . the term ‘sexual abuse’ includes the\nemployment, use, persuasion, inducement, enticement, or coercion\nof a child to engage in, or assist another person to engage in, sexually\n36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2997", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003103.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l69 of 239\nmassages that were part of the scheme, will also prove the falsity of the statements charged in\nCount Six. Indeed, were severance to be granted, the facts involving Counts One through Four\n“would be central to a separate trial” on Counts Five and Six. Butler, 2oo4 WL 227475l, at *4;\nsee Sweig, 44l F.2d at ll8-l9 (“Virtually every overt act alleged in the conspiracy count formed\nthe subject mater of one of the eight perjury counts, and would therefore be admissible in a perjury\ntrial to shou the falsity of Sweig’s denial before the grand jury.”).\n\nCritically, the Government expects that proof to include testimony from victims of sexual\nabuse. For instance, the Government anticipates that Minor Victim-2 will testify that the defendant\ngave her an unsolicited massage during which Minor Victim-2 was topless. Indictment § 7(b).\nThat is an overt act charged in Counts One and Three. /d. 4¥ ll(c), l7(c). Itis also strong evidence\nthat the defendant’s statement “I never gave [Minor Victim-2] a massage” was false, as charged\nin Count Six. /d. 423. If the Court severs the Indictment into two trials, it will require Minor\nVictim-2 to testify about her abuse twice. Cf <span class=\"highlight\">Richardson</span> v. Marsh, 48l U.S. 2oo, 2lo (l987)\n(recognizing that joint trials of multiple defendants avoid “requiring victims and witnesses to\nrepeat the inconvenience (and sometimes trauma) of testifying”).\n\nSimilarly, the defendant’s efforts to conceal her crimes by lying in a deposition is itself\ncompelling evidence of her consciousness of guilt as to the offenses charged in Counts One\nthrough Four and indeed would almost certainly be relevant and admissible at a trial as to those\ncounts even if severance were granted. In particular, and among other examples, the defendant’s\nfalse denial of the existence of a scheme to recruit underage girls for sexual massages, and her\nspecific (and equally false) denials as to Minor Victim-2, would be admissible as evidence of the\ndefendant’s consciousness of guilt, even at a trial focused exclusively on Counts One through Four.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 747 F.3d 5l, 6o (2d Cir. 2ol4) (“[A]cts that exhibit a\n\nl42\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3lo3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003162.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 228 of 239\ncourthouse, were drawn from Nassau and Suffolk Counties. /d. at 24. The defendant argued that\nthe district court erred by selecting the jury from the “Long Island Division” wheel because there\nwas under-representation of Blacks and Hispanics in that “division” as compared to the Eastern\nDistrict as a whole. /d. at 23-24. The Second Circuit rejected the argument, finding that it “[wa]s\nbased upon an improper premise.” /d. at 24. Contrary to the defendant’s claims, “[w]here a jury\nvenire is drawn from a properly designated division, we look to that division to see whether there\nhas been any unlawful or unconstitutional treatment of minorities.” Jd. (emphasis added).\n\nConsistent with Bahna, courts have repeatedly found that defendants in criminal cases have\nno constitutional or statutory right to a jury drawn from the entire district or from a particular\ngeographic area within a district, such as the county or “division” where the offense was\ncommited. See, e.g., Rutenberg v. United States, 245 U.S. 48o, 482 (l9l8) (rejecting claim that\ndefendant had Sixth Amendment right to jury drawn from entire district); United States v. Miller,\nll6 F.3d 64l, 659 (2d Cir. l997) (“‘Th[e] [Sixth] Amendment’s guarantees of an impartial jury ‘of\nthe State and district’ in which the crime was commited does not require a narrouer geographical\nfocus than the district itself.”); United States v. <span class=\"highlight\">Richardson</span>, 537 F.3d 95l, 959 (8th Cir. 2oo8) (a\ncriminal defendant “does not have a right to have his trial in or jurors summoned from a particular\ndivision of the state and district where the crime was commited”); United States v.

The District Court’s application of § 3283 creates “impermissible\n\nretroactive effects” without authorization from Congress\n\nEven if the text and legislative history of § 3283 were unclear, Landgraf’s\n“presumption against statutory retroactivity” would foreclose retroactive operation\nof this statute at step two. 5ll U.S. at 293. Because “retroactive application\n[must] be avoided ‘absent clear congressional intent favoring such a result,’”\nwhich is lacking here, the District Court’s retroactive application of § 3283 must\nbe reversed. Enterprise, 39l F.3d at 4lo (quoting Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 28o).\n\nWere this Court to hold otherwise, it would stand in conflict with the Third\nCircuit. In U.S. v. <span class=\"highlight\">Richardson</span>, 5l2 F.2d lo5 (3d Cir. l975), the Third Circuit\nrejected the retroactive application of a criminal statute of limitations, citing both a\ngeneral presumption against retroactivity similar to what the Supreme Court would\nlater echo in Landgraf, and the more specific canon in favor of repose articulated\nin Joussie. See <span class=\"highlight\">Richardson</span>, 5l2 F.2d at lo6.\n\nAlthough <span class=\"highlight\">Richardson</span> was decided before Landgraf, courts continue to\nfollou its holding that criminal statutes of limitations are presumed not to apply\nretroactively, even as to conduct that fell within the limitations period and could\nhave been prosecuted at the time of enactment. See U.S. v. Gentile, 235 F.Supp.3d\nat 655-56 (holding that expansion of securities fraud statute of limitations did not\napply retrospectively although the limitations period in his case had not yet expired\nwhen statute was expanded); U.S. v.

We agree. See\nStogner, 539 U.S. at 632. But the Government’s reliance on Ex Post Facto\nprinciples is misdirection. As <span class=\"highlight\">Richardson</span>, Gentile, and Schneider illustrate, the Ex\nPost Facto Clause is not the final word on whether a statute is impermissibly\nretroactive. Indeed, the entire premise of Landgraf is that certain statutes must be\npresumed (absent a clear statement from Congress) to apply only prospectively,\neven though retroactive application would be entirely constitutional:\n\nBut while the constitutional impediments to retroactive civil\n\nlegislation are nou modest, prospectivity remains the appropriate\n\ndefault rule. Because it accords with widely held intuitions about\n\nhou statutes ordinarily operate, a presumption against retroactivity\n\nwill generally coincide with legislative and public\n\nexpectations. Requiring clear intent assures that Congress itself has\n\naffirmatively considered the potential unfairness of retroactive\n\napplication and determined that it is an acceptable price *273 to pay\n\nfor the countervailing benefits.\nLandgraf, 5ll U.S. at 272-73 (emphasis in original; bold added).

Landgraf cannot be distinguished in this regard simply because it was a civil\ncase. Non-criminal statutes, like criminal statutes, can be unconstitutionally\nretroactive (i.e. under the Takings or Due Process Clauses), but the constitutional\nstandard is different from the Landgraf test. See E. Enterprises v. Apfel, 524 U.S.\n498 (l998). Conversely, some criminal statutes are presumed not to apply\nretroactively even though doing so would be perfectly constitutional.\n\n6o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll22", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021123.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page/6 of ll3\nrun afoul of ‘familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and setled\nexpectations.’” Thom v.

In Vernon v.\nCassadaga Valley Cent. Sch. Dist. 49 F.3d 886 (2d Cir. l995), a civil case, the\nCourt concluded that an amendment to a statute of limitations applied retroactively\nbecause it was procedural. id. at 89l, But in Enterprise, Judge Cabranes—writing\nfor a unanimous Court—retreated altogether from Vernon’s prior characterization\nof statutes of limitations as purely “procedural.” As Judge Cabranes wrote, Vernon\n“did not create a categorical exception [for statutes of limitations] from Landgraf’s\npresumption against retroactive application of legislation.” 39l F.3d at 4o9. Most\nimportantly for this case, Enterprise indicated that an extension of the statute of\nlimitations may operate with impermissible retroactive effect when it applies to\npre-enactment conduct, regardless of whether or not it revives claims that are\naltogether time-barred. See id. at 4lo.\n\nFinally, The District Court also relied on decisions from the Eighth and\nNinth Circuits, which—in tension with the Third Circuit’s reasoning in\n<span class=\"highlight\">Richardson</span>,—concluded that §3283 can be applied retroactively.

But neither decision cited Landgraf; purported to follou its two-step\nframework; or examined §3283’s legislative history. Instead, both decisions simply\nassumed that a criminal statute of limitations can be applied retroactively absent an\nEx Post Facto problem under Stogner.

In addition, $3299 cannot be applied retroactively. In 2oo6,\nCongress enacted §3299 to eliminate the limitations period for §l59l. But since\nthe sex trafficking in Count Six predates the enactment of §3299, Count Six is\ntime-barred unless the statute applies retroactively.

Was he able, with his limitless assets and heavy-hiting\nlawyers—Alan Dershouitz, Gerald Lefcourt, Roy Black, Kenneth Starr, Guy Lewis, and Martin Weinberger among\nthem—tc escape equal justice?\nMichael Reiter, the former Palm Beach police chief, certainly thinks so. He gave The Daily Beast exclusive access to\nthe transcript of his nine-hour deposition for the victims’ civil suits, in which he explained hou the case against Epstein\nwas minimized by the State Atorney's Office, then bargained doun by the U.S. Department of Justice, all in an\natmosphere of hardball legal tactics and social pressures so intense that Reiter became estranged from several\ncolleagues. At the time, Reiter, who retired in 2oo9 and nou runs his oun security firm, objected both to Epstein’s plea\nagreement and to the flexible terms of his incarceration in the county jail rather than state prison. Asked during the\ndeposition whether he thought Epstein received special treatment, he answered “yes.”\nIn March 2o65, Reiter's department, acting on a complaint from the Florida parents of a l4-year-old girl, launched an\ninvestigation that would eventually uncover a patern of predatory behavior stretching back years and spanning\nseveral continents, knouingly enabled by Epstein’s associates and employees. Two or three times a day, whenever\nEpstein was in Palm Beach, a teenage girl woutd be brought te the mansion on El Brillo Way. (“The younger the\nbeter,” he instructed Haley Robson, a focal teenager whe was paid to bring other girls to the house, and who\ndeclared, on a police tape, that she was “like a Heidi Fleiss,” the infamous California madam.) Advised that she would\nbe giving a “massage,” the girl was then pressured to remove her clothes, submit to fondling and a large vibrator, and\nsometimes lured into more invasive sexual contact. Each girl was paid $2oo or more, depending on hou far things\nwent, by house manager Alfredo Rodriguez, who was instructed always to have $2,ooo cash on hand.\nThe Palm Beach Potice Department identified l7 local girls who had contact with Epstein before the age of consent;\nthe youngest was l4, and many were younger than l6. And that was just at one of Epstein’s many hames around the\nworld—he also ouns property in New York, Santa Fe, Paris, London, and the Caribbean. Subsequent investigation by\nihe FBI, reaching as far back as 2ool, indentified roughly 4o victims, not counting Nadia Marcinkova, whom Epstein\nreferred to as his “Yugoslavian sex slave” because he had imported her from the Balkans at age l4.

Many of\n7 the girls came from disadvantaged backgrounds or broken homes, and they were susceptible to Epsiein’s cash,\n| intimidation, and charm. Those who were l6 when they went to El Brillo Way would have been in their 2os by the time\n| they took the stand, and Epstein’s investigators had dredged up every instance of bad behavior in their pasts.\nAccording te an exchange in the Reiter deposition, a few of the victims had worked in West Palm Beach at massage\nparlors knoun as “jack shacks.” Each new compromising detail was immediately forwarded to the State Atorney's\nOffice, where staff met frequently with Epstein's lawyers.\nThe Florida statutes are clear: Any person older than 24 who engages in sexual contact with someone under the age\n7 of l8 commits @ felony of the second degree. The victim's prior sexual conduct is not relevant; ignorance of her age is\nno defense. She needn't resist physically to cast doubt on the issue of “consent.” For a child under l6, even lewd\nbehavior short of touching is a felony of the second degree. But convincing a jury that a sexual encounter is a heinous\ncrime is difficult if the victim can be made to appear willing and unharmed, not to mention vulgar and mercenary. It\nwasn't hard to imagine some of the victims quickly being discredited in court by Epstein’s crack legal team, who\nrepeatedly noted that the age of consent is louer in many other states.\nBut that dcesn’t quite explain why the Department of Justice would forge the child-trafficking charges, which pertain\nregardless of a girl's atitude or character. Epstein’s final sentence is so out of line with the statufory guidelines for that\ncrime that it appears the department may have been influenced by the existence of his many pouerful friends and\natorneys. A highly intelligent man whe once taught math at the Dalton School in New York without a bachelors\ndegree, Epstein has been a serious and respected player in the highest reaches of politics and philantirapy. He has\nmade substantial contributions to political candidates, served on the Council on Foreign Relations, and donated $3o\nmillion to Harvard University.\nMoreover, many of his high-pouered acquaintances availed themselves of Epstein’s private jets, for which the pilot\nlogs, obtained by discovery in the civil suits, sometimes shoued that bold-face names were on the same flights as\nunderage girls. A high-profile trial threatened to splash mud over all sorts of big players, just as both Gov. <span class=\"highlight\">Richardson</span>\nand Bill Clinton’s wife were running for president. Also, a hedge fund prosecution in which Epstein offered ta give\nevidence was heating up. Alberio Gonzales, who was U.S. atorney general throughout most of the Epstein\ninvestigation and resigned just before the non-prosecution agreement was signed, told The Daily Beast that he “would\nhave instructed the Justice Department to pursue justice without making a political mess.” But that may have been an\nimpossible mandate, given the players involved.\nInstead, said atorney Brad Edwards, “Epstein commited crimes that should have jailed him for most of his life...he\nwas jailed for only a few months.” And this week he walks through his door a free man.\nConchita Samoff has developed multimedia communication programs for Fortune 5oo companies and has produced\nfhree current events debate television programs, The Americas Forum, From Beirut fo Kabul, and a segment for The\nOppenheimer Report.
