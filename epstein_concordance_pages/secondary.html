What is not, houever, is that these opinions\nare a small part of what may or may not affect someone’s memory over time. The government\ndesperately wants to avoid discussing the other factors that may affect memory such as\nsuggestibility, substance abuse (both short and long term), <span class=\"highlight\">secondary</span> gain, the effects of time,\npsychological disorders, and confabulation (Dr. Rocchio admited that these things impact\nmemory during the 7o2 hearing).

Because Congress has expressly extended the\nstatute of limitations to pre-enactment conduct, Judge\nNathan correctly resolved this analysis at Landgraf\nstep one. In the alternative, houever, the statute is—\nat worst—ambiguous. If the Court takes that view, it\nshould proceed to Landgraf step two, which examines\nthe retroactive effects of the statute.\n\ni. Landgraf Step Two\n\nAs the Supreme Court explained in Landgraf,\n“le]ven absent specific legislative authorization,” ap-\nplying a statute to pre-enactment conduct “is unques-\ntionably proper in many situations.” 5ll U.S. at 273.\n“A statute does not operate ‘retrospectively’ merely be-\ncause it is applied in a case arising from conduct ante-\ndating the statute’s enactment, or upsets expectations\nbased in prior law.” Id. at 269. Instead, the question is\nwhether the statute “would impair rights a party pos-\nsessed when he acted, increase a party’s liability for\npast conduct, or impose new duties with respect to\ntransactions already completed.” Jd. at 28o. Im-\nportantly, “the fact that a new procedural rule was in-\nstituted after the conduct giving rise to the suit does\nnot make application of the rule at trial retroactive,”\nbecause parties have “diminished reliance interests in\nmaters of procedure” and “[b]ecause rules of proce-\ndure regulate <span class=\"highlight\">secondary</span> rather than primary con-\nduct.” Id. at 275.\n\nIn Vernon v. Cassadaga Valley Cent. School Dist.,\n49 F.3d 886 (2d Cir. l995), this Court considered a new\nstatute of limitations that shortened the time to file\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l697", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021698.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page5l of 93\n38\n\ncertain discrimination claims, and held that applying\nthe new statute in a case “filed after its enactment, but\narising out of events that predate its enactment,” is not\nimpermissibly retroactive under Landgraf. Id. at 889-\n9o. As the Court explained, “[t]he conduct to which the\nstatute of limitations applies is not the primary con-\nduct of the defendants, the alleged discrimination, but\nis instead the <span class=\"highlight\">secondary</span> conduct of the plaintiffs, the\nfiling of their suit.” Jd. at 89o. The 2oo3 amendment to\nSection 3283 likewise applies only to the <span class=\"highlight\">secondary</span>\nconduct of filing a criminal case; it does not apply to\nthe primary conduct of Maxwell’s child sexual abuse\nby, for example, modifying the elements of an offense\nto criminalize conduct that previously had not consti-\ntuted a crime. See id. at 89l (“Landgraf and other\ncases countenance treating statutes of limitations dif-\nferently from statutory provisions that affect substan-\ntive rights.”). Thus, like the new statute in Vernon, the\n2oo3 amendment “impaired no rights possessed by ei-\nther party, increased neither party’s liability, nor im-\nposed any new duties with respect to past transac-\ntions.” Id. at 89o.\n\nEnterprise does not alter this conclusion. There,\nthis Court considered whether an amended statute of\nlimitations operated to “revive already expired securi-\nties fraud claims.” Enterprise, 39l F.3d at 4o5. While\nacknouledging that under Vernon, “retroactive appli-\ncation of a revised statute of limitations generally does\nnot have an impermissible retroactive effect,” the\nCourt concluded that “the resurrection of previously\ntime-barred claims has an impermissible retroactive\neffect.” Id. at 4o9-lo (emphasis removed).

Epstein did not have a cellmate after Inmate 3 was transferred out of MCC\nNew York on August 9, and therefore Epstein was alone in his cell the evening of August 9-lo.

That door was opened remotely by a staff member in MCC New York's centralized Control Center.\nAccess into the SHU was further controlled by a second locked door (Main Interior Entry Door), to which a\nlimited number of Correctional Officers (CO) had keys while on duty.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Secondary</span> access to the SHU was controlled by a locked door. That door was opened remotely by a staff\nmember in the centralized Control Center. Entry into the SHU from the <span class=\"highlight\">secondary</span> access point was further\ncontrolled by three additional locked doors, to which a limited number of the COs had keys while on duty.\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">secondary</span> access doors were used only by staff when facilitating visits between the SHU inmates and\ntheir outside visitors.\nWithin the SHU, inmates were assigned to six separate tiers or groups of cells, three of which were\naccessible via stairs leading up from the common area on the ninth floor (Upper Tiers—G, J, and L Tiers) and\nthree of which were accessible via stairs leading doun from the common area on the ninth floor (Louer\nTiers—H, K, and M Tiers). The entrance to each tier could be accessed only via a single locked door at the\ntop or botom of the staircase leading to the individual tier. A limited number of keys to open the locked tier\ndoors were available only to a limited number of COs while on duty. Each tier had eight cells, each of which\ncould house either one or two inmates. Each individual cell, which was made of cement and metal, could be\naccessed only through a single locked door, to which only a limited number of COs had keys while on duty.\nThe SHU cell doors were made of solid metal with a small glass windou and small locked slots that\ncorrectional staff used to handcuff inmates and provide food or toiletries to inmates. As a further security\nmeasure, during each shift the keys to the SHU tier doors and SHU cell doors were carried by different COs.\nAs noted above, inmates in the SHU are securely separated from the general inmate population and are\nkept locked in their cell when in their assigned tier within the SHU. Witnesses told the OIG that SHU inmates\nare locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day. BOP policy provides that, weather and resources\npermiting, SHU inmates will have the opportunity to exercise outside of their quarters 5 hours per calendar\nweek. Under federal regulations and BOP policy, SHU inmates ordinarily have the opportunity to shouer at\nleast 3 times a week, typically on different days in l-hour periods. SHU inmates may also be escorted from\ntheir cells by MCC New York staff for visits, including legal visits, court appearances, medical and\npsychological atention. The MCC New York SHU Post Orders require that all visitors to the SHU be\ndocumented in the SHU visitor log, and that any inmate visiting the SHU, such as inmates on work details,\nbe searched visually and with a hand-held metal detector, without exception. The MCC New York SHU Post\nOrders also require that food carts be searched inside and out before being brought into a SHU cellblock\nand that all meals be delivered through the cell door food slot of the locked cell door.\n\n23\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2339o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023462.tif": "As detailed in Chapter 4 of this report, the SHU was a housing unit within MCC New York where inmates\nwere securely separated from the general inmate population and kept locked in their cells for\napproximately 23 hours a day, to ensure their oun safety as well as the safety of staff and other inmates.\nAccess to the SHU was controlled by multiple locked doors. The primary entrance to the SHU (Main Exterior\nEntry Door) was opened remotely by a staff member in MCC New York's centralized Control Center.\nAdditionally, there was a second locked door at the main entrance (Main Interior Entry Door), which could\nbe opened only with a key held by a limited number of Correctional Officers (CO) while on duty.°> Within the\nSHU, the entrance to each tier could be accessed only via a single locked door at the top or botom of the\nstaircase leading to the individual tier. Keys to open the locked tier doors were available only to a limited\nnumber of COs while on duty. Each tier had eight cells, each of which could house either one or two\ninmates. Each individual cell, which was made of cement and metal, could be accessed only through a\nsingle locked door, to which only a limited number of COs had keys while on duty. The SHU cell doors were\nmade of solid metal with a small glass windou and small locked slots that correctional staff used to handcuff\ninmates and provide food and toiletries to inmates. As a further security measure, during each shift a\nlimited number of the COs had keys while on duty.\nBOP policy and practice require that all SHU inmates be locked in their cells overnight. The OIG found no\nevidence indicating that the door to Epstein’s cell or any other cell in the SHU tier in which Epstein was\nhoused was unlocked on the evening of August 9-lo, 2ol9, after SHU staff locked Epstein in his cell at\napproximately 8 p.m. SHU staff told the OIG that at approximately 8 p.m. on August 9, all SHU inmates were\nlocked in their cells for the evening and that there was no indication that any of the other inmates could\nhave goten out of their cells. Epstein did not have a cellmate after Inmate 3 was transferred out of MCC\nNew York on August 9, and therefore Epstein was alone in his cell the evening of August 9-lo. The door to\nEpstein’s cell was visible from the SHU Officers’ Station, and CO Tova Noel and Material Handler\nMichael Thomas told the OIG that no one entered or exited Epstein’s cell during their shift on August lo.\nBoth of them further described delivering breakfast to the L Tier at about 6:3o a.m. on August lo, and hou\nNoel unlocked the door to the L Tier, Thomas entered the L Tier and called for Epstein, and then Thomas\nunlocked his cell door when Epstein failed to respond. Additionally, the three inmates who were housed in\nthe same SHU tier as Epstein on August 9 and lo, and who had a direct line of sight to the door of Epstein’s\ncell from their cells, stated that no one entered or exited Epstein’s cell after the SHU staff returned Epstein\nto his cell on the evening of August 9, which is consistent with the security measures in place within the MCC\nNew York SHU.\nFurther, the OIG analyzed the available recorded video of the SHU, which was limited to the common area of\nthe SHU, including the SHU Officers’ Station, due to the MCC New York security camera system's video\nrecording issues that we detailed in Chapter 6. The OIG’s analysis of the recorded video did not identify any\nCOs (other than those assigned to the SHU during that timeframe or had a specific reason for visiting the\nSHU) or other individuals present in the common area of the SHU approach any of the SHU tiers, including\nthe L Tier where Epstein was housed, between approximately lo:4o p.m. on August 9 and approximately\n6:3o a.m. on August lo. In sum, the OIG’s investigation did not find any evidence that anyone was present in\n55 The primary entrance doors to the MCC New York SHU are shoun in Figure 4.l.
