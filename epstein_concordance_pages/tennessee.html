Nonetheless, the Court alloued her to testify with a limiting instruction.\nMaxwell’s offense conduct was not limited to minor victims.\n\nSarah and Elizabeth have the right to deliver an in—court statement at Maxwell’s sentencing.\nThe CVRA guarantees all crime victims the right to be “reasonably heard at any public proceeding in\nthe district court involving...sentencing.” l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(4). This is the right of any victim to\ngive what is commonly referred to as a “victim impact statement.” See generally United States v,\nDegenhardt, 4o5 F.Supp.2d l34l (D. Utah 2oo5). Various courts have held that the CVRA’s right to\nbe reasonably heard guarantees victims the right to make an in—court statement. As one court\nexplained: “At a sentencing hearing, the other participants will speak directly to the judge. Read\nagainst this backdrop, the CVRA commands that a victim should be treated equally with the\ndefendant, defense counsel, and the prosecutor, rather than turned into a ‘faceless stranger.” /d. at\nl348, quoting Payne v. <span class=\"highlight\">Tennessee</span>, 5ol U.S. 8o8, 825 (l99l). The Ninth Circuit has reached an\nidentical conclusion. See Kenna v. U.S. Dist. Court for C.D. Cal. 435 F.3d loll, lol7-l8 (9th Cir.\n2oo6). These holdings are consistent with the intentions of the CVRA’s drafters. As Senator Kyl\nexplained, “the very purpose of this section is to allou the victim to appear personally and directly\naddress the court.” l5o CONG. REC. Slo, 9ll (daily ed. Oct. 9, 2oo4) (statement of Sen. Kyl),\nquoted in Degenhardt, 4o5 FSupp.2d at l346.\n\nFurther, victim impact evidence is probative of the offense conduct because an “assessment of\nthe harm caused by the defendant has long been an important factor in determining the appropriate\npunishment, and victim impact evidence is simply another method of informing the sentencing\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo698", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010699.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document675_ Filed o6/25/22 Page 8of2l\nauthority about such harm.” Payne v. <span class=\"highlight\">Tennessee</span>, 5ol U.S. 8o8, 8o8 (l99l). Speaking directly to\nMaxwell in this case is particularly important for these victims. Crime victims often want to speak\n“to regain a sense of dignity and respect rather than feeling pouerless and ashamed.” Degenhardt, 4o5\nESupp.2d at l348 (internal quotation omited). Here, Sarah and Elizabeth believe it is important\nthat they be given an opportunity to speak as part of the process of overcoming the horrific impact of\nMaxwell's sex trafficking conspiracy on them and others.\n\nIl. Regardless of Whether Sarah and Elizabeth are CVRA “Victims,” the Court Undoubtedly\n\nPossesses Discretion to Hear from them at Sentencing Under l8 U.S.C. § 366l\n\nFor all the reasons just explained, Sarah and Elizabeth have the right to speak at Maxwell's\nsentencing under the CVRA. Additionally, this Court also possesses broad discretionary pouer,\nderived from statute and common law, to hear from them when determining the appropriate\nsentence for Maxwell’s crimes. See l8 U.S.C. § 366l; see also Degenhardt, 4o5 FSupp.2d at l343\n(discussing the court’s discretionary pouers to hear from victims).\n\nThe Court’s discretion in this case is important not only because it provides an alternative\nbasis for considering Sarah’s and Elizabeth's victim impact, but also because the Court may have\nother requests to speak at Maxwell’s sentencing. Some of these other victims may not be able to\nafford legal counsel to present their arguments to this Court.' Federal courts have wide discretion to\ngather information at sentencing subject to only a few constitutional or statutory restrictions. See\nUnited States v. Tucker, 4o4 U.S. 443, 446 (l972) (“[A] judge may appropriately conduct an inquiry\n\n\" Under the CVRA, the Justice Department is obligated to use its “best efforts” to protect the\nrights of “crime victims.” l8 U.S.C § 377l(c)(l). We trust that the Department will present factual\nand legal arguments in support of victims being heard at sentencing.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo699", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010739.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 68l-l Filed o6/26/22 Page3of7\nARGUMENT\nl. Kate has a statutory right to be heard under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act.\n\nThe CVRA guarantees crime victims the right to “reasonably heard at any public\nproceeding in the district court involving ... sentencing.” l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(4). This is the right\nof a victim to give what is commonly referred to as a “victim impact statement.” See generally\nUnited States v. Degenhardt, 4o5 F.Supp.2d l34l (D. Utah 2oo5). Various courts have held that\nthe CVRA right to be reasonably heard guarantees victims the right to make an in-court statement.\nAs one court has explained, “[a]t a sentencing hearing, the other participants will speak directly to\nthe judge. Read against this backdrop, the CVRA commands that a victim should be treated equally\nwith the defendant, defense counsel, and the prosecutor, rather than turned into a ‘faceless\nstranger.’” Degenhardt, 4o5 F.Supp.2d at l348 (quoting Payne v. <span class=\"highlight\">Tennessee</span>, 5ol U.S. 8o8,825\n(l99l)).\n\nThe Crime Victim’s Rights Act (“CVRA”) defines the term “crime victim” as a “person\ndirectly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of a Federal offense ....” l8 U.S.C.\n§ 377l(e). This definition was based on earlier restitution statutes, which “all demonstrate a clarion\ncongressional intent to provide restitution to as many victims and in as many cases as possible.”\nUnited States v. Martin, l28 F.3d ll88, ll9o (7th Cir. l997) (quoted in United States v. Kamuvaka,\n7l9 F.Supp.2d 469, 475 (E.D. Pa. 2olo)). Thus, in relying on these far-reaching statutes to craft\nthe CVRA, Congress used “an intentionally broad definition because all victims of crime deserve\nto have their rights protected.” l5o Cong. Rec. $427o (Apr. 22, 2oo4) (emphasis added) (statement\nof Sen. Kyl, agreed to by Sen. Feinstein). Congress understood that it was extending rights to\n“literally millions of people’—l.e., victims who were being denied rights in the federal criminal\njustice process. l5o Cong. Rec.
