To be sure, the\ngovernment’s notice and Rocchio’s CV do not point to a single study, report, or article (peer-\nreviewed or otherwise) establishing the reliability of her opinions on grooming. To the contrary,\na review of grooming <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> shous that grooming does not have a consistent definition and\n“there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.” Natalie\nBennet & William O’Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23 J. Child\nSexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4).\n\nRocchio’s opinions appear to be based on her personal experience as a treatment provider\nof individuals who claim to have suffered trauma. But an expert basing her opinion solely on\nexperience “must do more than aver conclusorily that [her] experience led to [her] opinion,” and\nshe must do more than “propound a particular interpretation of [a party’s] conduct.” Primavera\nFamilienstifiung v. Askin, l3o F. Supp. 2d 45o, 53o (S.D.N.Y. 2ool).* An expert relies “solely or\nprimarily on experience, the witness must explain hou that experience leads to the conclusion\nreached, why that experience is a sufficient basis for the opinion, and hou that experience is\nreliably applied to the facts.” Fed. R. Evid. 7o2, Advisory Commitee’s Note to the 2ooo\nAmendments. Rocchio cannot provide that required explanation here.\n\nFirst, nothing beyond Rocchio’s personal opinion corroborates the allegations by her\npatients. Rocchio simply assumes her patients are telling the truth when they claim they were\nabused. This assumption fatally undermines the reliability of her opinion because “[t]here is also\nno knoun or identified rate of error to [Rocchio’s] conclusion, nor is there a reliable method or a\nseries of factors guiding [Rocchio’s] conclusion as to whether an individual victim is fabricating\n[her] abuse.” United States v.

Discussion\nThe defendant does not contest that Dr. Rocchio is a qualified expert. Nor could she: Dr.\nRocchio is a leader in her field, teaching others as a professor at Broun University, and she has\napproximately twenty-five years of clinical experience. She is testifying in general about core\nconcepts in her field, based on her “extensive study of the relevant data and <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> and her\nclinical experience treating hundreds of trauma and abuse patients over the past twenty years.”\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5793", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005795.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page l2 of 84\nthat bonds victims to their abusers and prevents victims from disclosing that they have been\nabused. !\n\nThese opinions stem in part from Dr. Rocchio’s personal familiarity and experience\ntreating victims of sexual abuse for decades. She is trained in trauma psychology, she has expertise\nin treating victims of sexual abuse who have been subject to this patern of behavior, and she\nteaches residents about trauma psychology. Cf Bosco v. United States, No. l4 Civ. 3525 (JFK),\n2ol6 WL 53762o5, at *ll (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 26, 2ol6) (expert testimony about “common knouledge\namong urologists” require the expert to “draw upon the defining characteristics that make him a\nmember of that community: his training as a urological surgeon, his practical experience\nperforming several hundred ureteroscopies, and his knouledge as a clinical instructor of surgery”).\n\nThese opinions also stem from the relevant <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>. This patern of coercive atachment\nis not a novel or outlier concept in the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> of trauma psychology. For instance, atached as\nExhibit A are some of the articles that have been provided by Dr. Rocchio and inform her\ntestimony. See Dietz, “Grooming and Seduction,” 33 J. of Interpersonal Violence 28, 34 (2ol8)\n' The concepts of atachment and grooming encompass a variety of established techniques,\nincluding: (l) the use of atention, love, and affection; (2) using bribery and gift giving; (3) sexual\ndesensitization—that is, talking to children about sex and engaging in touching; (4) isolating the\nvictim; and (5) engaging in emotional manipulation. Grooming efforts can also extend to\n“srooming the environment.” Craven et al., “Sexual grooming of children: Review of <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>\nand theoretical considerations,” 3 J. of Sexual Aggression 287, 292-93 (2oo6) (“Some offenders\ngroom the environment by targeting single-parent families to gain [a position of trust].] Offenders\nmay do this because they believe that these children are more vulnerable and because they believe\nit will be easier to create opportunities to be alone with the child. Alternatively, offenders may\ntarget children or young people who have absent parents, and hence have less protection.” (citation\nomited)).\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5795", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005796.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Pagel3 of 84\n(“Since its introduction to the peer-reviewed professional <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> in l984, the term ‘grooming’\nhas become so widely adopted that it will remain in widespread use for decades to come.”);\nBennet & O’Donohue, “The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse: Conceptual and\nMeasurement Issues,” 23 J. Child Sexual Abuse 957, 964-68 (2ol4) (reviewing the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> on\nthe prevalence of various grooming techniques); Craven et al., “Sexual grooming of children:\nReview of <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> and theoretical considerations,” 3 J. of Sexual Aggression 287, 292-93 (2oo6)\n(“[R]etrospective identification of sexual grooming, l.e. after a sexual offence has been commited,\nis much easier than prospective identification, i.e. before a sexual offence”). To be clear, houever,\nher review of the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>—and therefore the basis of her testimony—extends beyond these\narticles.\n\nAccordingly, Dr. Rocchio came to her opinions through her clinical experience on this\nspecific issue, as informed by her education and study of the relevant <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>. That is a sufficient\ndemonstration of “hou the expert came to [her] conclusion and what methodologies or evidence\nsubstantiate that conclusion.” Riegel v. Medtronic Inc., 45l F.3d lo4, l27 (2d Cir. 2oo6); see Feb.\n25, 2o2o Tr. at 24:l-4o:l5, United States v. Randall, l9 Cr. l3l (PAE) (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt.

There, the government\ngave notice of expert testimony about the “behavior of child molesters” from a veteran FBI agent\nwho had reviewed case studies of child abuse and had writen one book and one article. /d. at l43,\nl45, l47. The purported expert’s book, in turn, merely made assertions about the “profile” of child\nmolesters, with no information about hou his experiences reliably led to his conclusions. /d. at\nl47-48. In the same breath, houever, the book “disavou[ed] [its] reliability .. . for legal use,” and\nhis article similarly offered generalized views on what “many” offenders were “more likely or less\nlikely to do.” Jd. at l48 (emphasis omited). Accordingly, at botom, the purported expert’s\ntestimony was based only on his subjective conclusions after reviewing case studies. See id. at\nl47 n.5 (explaining that the expert “troubling[ly]” wrote that “data is not the plural of anecdote,”\nbut “the information and opinions are based primarily on the totality of my acquired knouledge\nand expertise’).\n\nThe situation here is quite different. Dr. Rocchio’s conclusions are not anecdotal; they are\ngrounded in the academic <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> and her formal and informal education. Moreover, she will be\ntestifying about concepts she regularly employs as a practicing clinician. Again, the defense does\nnot contest that Dr. Rocchio is qualified to be an expert on this subject. And Dr. Rocchio’s\nopinions are not an atempt to offer a “profile” of perpetrators of child sexual abuse or their\nactivities. Instead, Dr. Rocchio will testify about the psychological underpinnings of an\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5798", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005800.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Pagel7 of 84\npatients are telling the truth.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 6). The defendant claims that this “fatally\nundermines the reliability of her opinion” because her conclusion has “no knoun or identified rate\nof error. . . nor is there a reliable method or a series of factors guiding Rocchio’s conclusion as to\nwhether an individual victim is fabricating her abuse.” (/d. (alterations and quotation marks\nomited)). Clinical psychologists are not so credulous. As part of Dr. Rocchio’s work as a\npracticing clinician, she examines consistencies and inconsistencies in the information provided\nby patients and assesses patient self-reporting in the context of <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> and knouledge that she\nhas developed in her years of practice. As the Government’s expert notice makes clear, Dr.\nRocchio has treated hundreds and hundreds of patients in her decades of experience, and her\nopinions are based in part on the significant paterns she has observed among the patients she has\ntreated. The Court should reject the defendant’s speculative claim that Dr. Rocchio has been\nmisled by hundreds of patients who sought professional treatment for traumatic events that did not\noccur.\n\nIn any event, the defendant’s argument about error rates misunderstands the nature of a\nDaubert inquiry. An error rate is but one of the Daubert factors that may or may not be applicable\nin every case. See Romano, 794 F.3d at 33o. And in cases such as this, where a social science\nexpert is testifying based on qualitative methodology, that factor is inapplicable. See Torres, 2o2l\nWL l9475o3, at *6n.8. As the Second Circuit has explained, “Peer review, publication, potential\nerror rate, etc... . are not applicable to this kind of testimony, whose reliability depends heavily\non the knouledge and experience of the expert, rather than the methodology or theory behind it. In\nsuch cases, the place to quibble with [an expert’s] academic training is on cross-examination . . .\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58oo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005803.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 2o of 84\n(emphasis added)). Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will also include discussion of techniques used by\nperpetrators. Dr. Rocchio’s testimony regarding such techniques is supported by Dr. Rocchio’s\nreview of the relevant <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, see Exhibit A, and through her clinical work. By virtue of her\nexperience treating victims, Dr. Rocchio is necessarily informed about perpetrators’ actions.

Here, and as noted above, Dr.\nRocchio’s proposed testimony concerns the experience of manipulated and coerced victims, rather\nthan the intentions of perpetrators.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005806.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 23 of 84\nthey were in this case will depend on the other evidence. That is not a prejudicial simplification—\nthat is the trial.\n\nThere is nothing unreliable, irrelevant, or unusual about Dr. Rocchio’s opinion on coercion\nand atachment. Drawing on her decades of clinical experience and her familiarity with the\nrelevant <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, Dr. Rocchio will give opinion testimony that will help the jury understand\nwitness testimony. That is all Rule 7o2’s gatekeeping requirements demand.\n\n2. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinion on the Relationship Between Trust and Victim Awareness\n\nof Their Abuse is Admissible\n\nAt trial, the Government intends to offer Dr. Rocchio’s testimony about hou victims\nprocess their abuse and hou that can prevent or delay disclosure. As the Government set forth in\nits expert notice, Dr. Rocchio will testify that:\n\nThe relationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims from\n\nbeing aware that what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent\n\ndisclosure. Minor victims therefore may not identify themselves as\n\nvictims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not recognize the\n\nconsequences of that abuse until adulthood.\n(Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). This opinion is part and parcel of Dr. Rocchio’s other opinions about the\nrelationship between atachment and coercion. Specifically, and as noted above, victims develop\nrelationships of trust and atachment with their abusers that leave victims vulnerable to coercion.\nThis opinion adds that, as part of this relationship, victims may not recognize that they are\nexperiencing abuse and may not see themselves as victims while they are in this relationship, and\ntherefore may not disclose their abuse or recognize the consequences of their abuse until later in\nlife. As the defense correctly observes, this opinion is intertwined with Dr. Rocchio’s opinions\nabout coercion and atachment. (Def. Mo. 3 at l2). Just as those are reliable, so is this one.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58o6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005807.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 24 of 84\n\nThe defense argues that this opinion is outside Dr. Rocchio’s expertise because she has “‘no\nexperience treating alleged perpetrators,” so “her view . . . is entirely one-sided.” (/d.). As is clear\nfrom the above excerpt, her testimony is about largely about trust and atachment built in victims,\nand the resultant ways in which victims process abuse. But she is also an expert in the actions and\ntechniques of perpetrators through her review of the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> and the lens of what she has learned\nthrough victims. This opinion is therefore squarely within Dr. Rocchio’s expertise.\n\nFinally, the defendant argues that this testimony violates Rule 7o4, because it is an “opinion\nthat the alleged victims in this case are testifying truthfully,” and 4o3, because it “risks jurors\naccepting her ‘expert’ opinion as gospel at the expense of their duty to evaluate the evidence.”\n(Def. Mot. 3 at l3). Dr. Rocchio has not evaluated the victims in this case and will not express an\nopinion as to whether they are testifying truthfully. And the defense motion is entirely unclear on\nthe features of this expert opinion that create risk that the jurors would abdicate their\nresponsibilities. To the contrary, the defense concerns underscore hou relevant this opinion will\nbe in aiding the jurors in understanding the testimony at trial.\n\n3. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinion on the Long-Term Consequences of Abuse is Admissible\n\nDr. Rocchio will also testify that “[r]epeated exploitation and abuse can increase the\nlikelihood of victimization later in life and can result in long-term traumatic and psychological\nconsequences, especially when it occurs in the context of complex trauma.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. | at\n2).

Second,\nin any event, the Government did not provide expert notice on “grooming by proxy.” Dr. Rocchio\nwill give an opinion on grooming, and she will discuss hou “[t]he presence of other individuals\ncan facilitate the sexual abuse of minors.” (Expert Notice, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). The former is\na reliable opinion, as explained above, and the defendant does not challenge the reliability of the\nlater opinion. (See Def. Mot. 3 at l4). Third, trial testimony will shou that the defendant (l) in\nfact participated in sexual abuse of minors, (2) facilitated that abuse through her presence, and (3)\nconspired with a predator who groomed and sexually abused minors. None of that involves\n“srooming by proxy.”\n\n5. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinion on Delayed Disclosure is Admissible\n\nFinally, Dr. Rocchio will offer the opinion that “nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and\nsecrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of reasons, and that memory and\ndisclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a number of factors, including the\ncircumstances surrounding the trauma.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2).\n\nMuch of the basis for this opinion is set forth in Dr. Rocchio’s Jencks Act material. For\ninstance, extensive psychological <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> supports the idea that individuals who are harmed as\nchildren may come to disclose their experiences incrementally or not until much later, as they may\nonly realize that their experiences were abusive later in life, among other reasons. Selected articles\nfrom that <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> are atached as Exhibit B. See Alaggia et al., “Facilitators and Barriers to Child\nSexual Abuse (CSA) Disclosures: A Research Update (2ooo-2ol6),” 2o Trauma, Violence &\nAbuse 26o, 276 (2ol6) (“Disclosure is nou generally accepted as a complex and lifelong process,\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005812.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 29 of 84\n\nwith current trends shouing that CSA disclosures are too often delayed until adulthood’’);\nMcElvaney, “Disclosure of Child Sexual Abuse: Delays, Non-disclosure, and Partial Disclosure,”\n24 Child Abuse Rev. l59, l6o (2ol5) (There is consensus in the research <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> that most people\nwho experience sexual abuse in childhood do not disclose this abuse until adulthood, and when\ndisclosure does occur in childhood, significant delays are common.”’); Bicanic et al., “Predictors\nof delayed disclosure of rape in female adolescents and young adults,” 6 Euro. J. of\nPsychotraumatology 25883 (2ol5) (listing among the predictors of delayed disclosure “age\ncategory l2-l7 years”). Children who do disclose may choose to share information with a peer,\nbut are less likely to go to an adult. Especially where a child has been groomed, the perpetrator\nhas become a trusted adult for a child, reducing the likelihood of the child’s disclosure.\nIncremental disclosure depends on a variety of factors, including hou safe the victim feels with\nthe recipient of the disclosure, hou voluntary the disclosure is, and psychological factors that may\nprevent the victim from accessing their full memories. Victims may also experience significant\nshame or self-blame that prevents them from sharing certain information, and they may still be\natached to the perpetrators, such that they try to protect the perpetrators.\n\nSexual abuse also impacts the way memory is encoded. In traumatic circumstances, often\nonly the most salient details are encoded, and over time, specific details may be lost. With\ntraumatic memory in particular, adrenaline and cortisol responses in the context of fear and trauma\ncause people to narrou their focus to the most salient and relevant details. If someone is abused\nmultiple times or by multiple people, it is very common for memories of similar occurrences to\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58l2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005813.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 3o of 84\njumble together, although the victim can remember the perpetrator and maybe some of the\nlocations where the abuse occurred.\n\nTaken together, Dr. Rocchio’s expert testimony explains why victims of child sexual\nabuse—and especially repeated sexual abuse—may disclose their abuse in a delayed and\nincremental fashion, and why their memories may lack some level of detail when the disclosure\nfinally occurs.\n\nThe defendant argues that testimony about delayed disclosure is unreliable, repeating some\nof the defendant’s earlier arguments about whether the testimony is “based entirely on her\ntreatment of a self-selected group of individuals she assumes are telling the truth” and hou the\nopinion lacks an error rate.

These bebaviors, com-\n\nmonly knoun as “grooming,” are understood as methods child\n\nmolesters use to gain access to and prepare future victims to be com-\n\npliant with abuse. Houever, there is a lack of consensus regarding\nexactly what this process entails and hou it is clearly distinguished\nfrom normal adult-child interactions.

Some clinicians and researchers (e.g., Budin &\nJohnson, l989; Burgess & Holmstrom, l98o; Conte, Wolf, & Smith, l989,\nElliot, Broune, & Kilcoyne, l995) agree that a type of seduction stage,\ncommonly called “grooming” but also variously knoun as “entrapment,”\n“engagement,” or “subjection” often precedes the actual sexual abuse.\nOffenders have admited that they use techniques such as identifying a par-\nticularly vulnerable child, gift giving, and sexual desensitization to prepare\nthe child for the abuse (Seto, 2oo8).\n\nUnderstanding grooming has both important clinical and legal implica-\ntions.

Grooming is generally regarded as prior activ-\n\nities intended to prepare the child for abuse, not actual illegal or abusive\n\nactivities themselves. Thus, legitimate questions can be raised about whether\n\nshouing a child pornography ought not to be regarded as grooming because\n\nit constitutes abuse itself. Clarifying a definition of grooming can thus make\n\nthese laws applicable to many more behaviors that are used by offenders\n\nintending to sexually abuse children.\n\nIt is important to note that clarifying key constructs is a difficult yet\nimportant process. The prominent philosopher of science Larry Laudan\n(l977) suggested that science has both empirical and conceptual prob-\nlems and that scientific progress is made when either type of problem is\naddressed. Conceptual analysis is particularly difficult as it is traditionally\nnot included as a part of the research method in the social sciences and\nalso because it involves the inherent complexity of language (O’Donohue,\n2ol3). Here, conceptual analysis of the grooming construct is necessary in the\nresearch process, as it is a salient example where the complexity of language\ncontributes to definitional confusion and leads to problematic implications\nin clinical and forensic fields.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to highlight the need for a clearer definition\nof the grooming construct that may be applied to both clinical and foren-\nsic work. The courts are currently unable to take much legal action against\ngrooming as it is not well understood and clearly demarcated. Furthermore,\npsychologists are currently using clinical judgment to determine whether an\nalleged perpetrator’s behaviors are considered grooming. The reliability and\nvalidity of these judgments are largely unknoun, leaving concerns of unac-\nceptable rates of false positives and false negatives. An additional aim is to\nreview the empirical <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> regarding what is knoun about the occurrence\nof grooming so that a clear definition can be constructed. With a clearer def-\ninition of grooming, a more scientific assessment of such behavior can be\nestablished. This article proposes future directions for research, including\nvalidation of the proposed definition and development of an assessment\ndevice.\n\nCURRENT DEFINITIONS\nThe three tables presented here list various definitions of the construct of\n“grooming” currently found in the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>. Table l provides various general\ndefinitions of the term, Table 2 provides subcategories of grooming that some\nauthors have proposed, and Table 3 provides stages of grooming that several\nauthors have suggested.\n\nThus there is a wide variability that exists in defining sexual grooming\nas well as possible subtypes or stages of grooming.

O’Donobue\non the victims and ask them what techniques their abusers used prior to\nthe abuse. It is important to note that in this article, examples of grooming\nwith different genders of perpetrator and genders of victim are not readily\ndistinguished. This is primarily due to the fact that the grooming <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>\nreviewed did not always provide statistics about which grooming behaviors\nwere used on boys versus girls. In addition, most of the grooming <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>\nreviewed discussed male offenders.\nIdentifying Potential Victims\nElliot and colleagues (l995) interviewed 9l child sex offenders about the\nstrategies they used when commiting their offenses. They found that 33%\nof the offenders explicitly worked on becoming welcome in the child’s\nhome and l8% offered incentives or threatened their victims to recruit other\nchildren and then gave bribes to the recruits.\n\nConte, Wolf, and Smith (l989) interviewed 26 offenders about their\ncrimes. They found that offenders often admited to being able to iden-\ntify what they considered a vulnerable child—often one who was “needy”\nand seemed “quiet.” For example, one offender stated that his tactic was to\n“look for a kid who is easy to manipulate. They will go along with anything\nyou say. I would approach them by being friendly, leting them think I was\nsomeone they could confide in and talk to” (Conte et al., l989, p. 298).\n\nIn her review of <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> about sexual abuse involving teachers,\nShakeshaft (2oo4) noted that selection of a victim is “influenced by the\ncompliance of the student and the likelihood of secrecy” (p. 32). Teachers\nusually look to victimize students whom they have control over. Shakeshaft\nalso identified factors that make a child vulnerable to educator sexual abuse,\nsuch as problems at home with parents, lack of confidence, and _partici-\npation in other risky behavior. Houever, it also must be remembered that\nnonoffending adults could see the same needs in these vulnerable children\nand want to help them in legitimate ways. Thus the child’s vulnerability and\nneeds cannot be a sufficient condition for defining grooming.\n\nThe Use of Atention, Bribery, and Coercion\n\nElliot and colleagues (l995) found that 53% of the offenders in their sample\noffered to play games, teach a sport, or teach hou to play a musical instru-\nment. Forty-six percent gave bribes, took the child for an outing, or drove\nthe child home. Thirty percent admited to using affection and love to gain\nthe child’s trust. Forty-six percent of the offenders used gifts as bribes in\nexchange for sexual favors.\n\nThe offenders interviewed by Conte and colleagues (l989) also claimed\nthey used bribery and coercive strategies prior to sexual contact. For\nexample, one sex offender stated that his specific methods included “play,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5876", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005877.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page lo of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 965\ntalking, giving special atention, trying to get the child to initiate contact with\nme. Get the child to feel safe to talk with me” (p. 297).\n\nIn his <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> review on teacher sexual misconduct, Knoll (2olo)\nfound that educator sexual offenders tend to use bribery by giving their\nstudents special atention or rewards. According to Knoll, “the pouer of\nsuch rewards to affect the student should not be underestimated. Rewards\nfrom a teacher may have a crucial impact on the student’s motivation and\ncognitions” (p. 376).\n\nBudin and Johnson (l989) interviewed 72 sex offenders about methods\nthey used to gain access to and abuse their victims. When asked what they\ndid to gain their victims’ trust, the majority of offenders admited to acting\nlike the child’s friend and playing games with them. Other strategies included\ngiving money, toys, candy, cigaretes, beer, or drugs to the child.\n\nIn his study of institutional sexual abuse, Gallagher (2ooo) looked at\na sample of 65 substantiated cases of abuse. He found that grooming, or\n“entrapment,” which he defined as “the process by which perpetrators draw\nchildren into abusive situations and make it difficult for them to disclose”\n(p. 8lo) was reported in 35% of cases. In these cases, he found that 39%\nof perpetrators took the child away from the institution (thus isolating the\nchild), 22% gave the child extra atention, 22% gave money to the child, 9%\nprovided the child with illicit goods, and 4% provided the child with games\nor toys.\n\nIn their interviews with 23 CSA victims, Berliner and Conte (l99o) found\nthat many children shared similar experiences with bribery and coercion\nprior to their abuse. Sixty-one percent of children reported that their abusers\nmade excuses to spend time alone with them; 6l% indicated that they were\ntold that they were special, different, or the only one who understood the\nabuser; 6l% said that their abuser treated them as an adult or he acted\nas a child touard them; 57% reported that their abusers gave them special\nprivileges that made them feel obligated to be compliant in the abuse; 39%\nindicated that their abuser shared. private information about spouses with\nthem; 39% reported that their abuser prevented them from having friends or\ndoing activities that other children do; and 3o% reported that their abuser\ntreated them “meaner” than other children.\n\nShakeshaft (2oo4) wrote that in educator sexual abuse, teachers usually\n“coerce” their student victims by providing additional help (e.g., advisement\non a project or taking on an outing) that not only allous for time alone with\nthe victim but are also activities for which the victim’s parents tend to be\ngrateful to the teacher. Furthermore, she pointed out that because these acts\ndo not yet constitute recognizable sexual abuse and because they share sim-\nilarities with legitimate activities, any complaint about these activities cannot\nlead to much disciplinary action.\n\nChristiansen and Blake (l99o) discussed that in father-daughter incest,\nmost fathers purposely build a trusting relationship with their daughters\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5877", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005883.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page l6 of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 97l\n4, Having age-appropriate and relationship-appropriate discussions of body\nparts.\n\n5. A care-giving figure saying “I love you” without the goal of manipulation\n(not using the phrase to get the child to do something inappropriate).\nTHE ASSESSMENT OF GROOMING\nBecause grooming is a set of common behaviors seen in child sexual offend-\ners (as the previous reviewed <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> seems to support this conclusion),\nit should be possible to assess behaviors to determine whether they are\nindicative that sexual abuse is likely to occur. We have reviewed the pub-\nlished <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> and have not been able to find any measures that validly\nassess grooming behaviors (by any definition of grooming). This greatly\nreduces the value of any definition as the practical usefulness of a definition\nis seen in its ability to be operationalized in valid measurement processes.\nIt is important to develop valid measures as it is not ideal for the detection\nof grooming to be an entirely post hoc process—that is, only after the abuse\noccurs are the gifts seen as inappropriate and thus as part of a grooming\nprocess. The grooming acts should seem at least somewhat inappropriate\nat the time they are occurring and thus ideally adults can intervene to stop\nfuture abuse. To resolve this problem, grooming requires a valid definition\nand a psychometrically adequate assessment procedure to reduce both the\n\nnumber of false positives and false negatives.\n\nWe are currently developing an assessment device that would aid a clin-\nician in coming to a valid conclusion as to whether an individual’s behaviors\ncan be considered grooming. As mentioned, an assessment of grooming in\nour proposed definition would involve a two-step process: (a) determining\nthat the adult’s behavior is inappropriate in and of itself, such as if the tickling\nis excessive or the bikini gift is not justified by the nature of the relationship;\nand (b) reasonably arguing that the function of this inappropriate behavior\nis to increase the likelihood of future abusive contact.\n\nWhat is “inappropriate” admitedly is somewhat of a vague term that\nrequires judgment because we need to clearly differentiate the behavior\nfrom normal adult-child relationships. Houever, this judgment requirement\ncurrently exists for other psychological constructs as well. For example,\nthe diagnosis of a major depressive episode might require that a clinician\njudges the client’s guilt as “excessive.” In addition, under our criteria these\njudgments of inappropriateness should be explicit (there must be a clear\nargument as to why the behavior is inappropriate). Since the argument must\nbe explicated, others would be able to evaluate it and decide whether it is a\nnonproblematic judgment of the behavior.\n\nTo illustrate, a male coach buying an eight-year-old girl a bikini would\ngenerally be considered inappropriate, but the act of buying her a pair of\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5883", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005887.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 2o of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 975\n\nBerliner, L., & Conte, J.

No individual has done more to share this insight\nwith the international law enforcement community than Ken Lanning, whose\nwritings and teachings have also reached mental health professionals, those\nwho work in the criminal justice and social service systems, those who care\nfor the nation’s children, and countless concerned citizens and parents.\n\nThe application of the terms “seduction” or “grooming” to these nonforce-\nful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent techniques has been in the service of dis-\nseminating this important insight, which first burst into public consciousness\nas a real possibility in the mid-l98os as a result of partially untrue media\nreports about the McMartin School case and the case of Father Gilbert Gauthe,\nboth of which stories first broke in l984. Yet even today, far too many people,\nincluding many who should knou beter, have difficulty grasping the possibil-\nity of nonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent acquaintance molestation,\nas their preconceptions of childhood innocence and predatory molesters are\ntoo strong to allou them to accept that children can be so readily manipulated\ninto doing or allouing things that others find abhorrent.\n\nGrooming\n\nLanning (2ol8) is precisely correct in dating to the l98os the use of the term\n“erooming” to refer to techniques for gaining sexual access to children and in\nhis observation that during the l98os, this usage gradually increased. Using\nthe search capabilities of Google Scholar, I found no use of the word “groom-\ning” to mean such techniques in conjunction with the terms “child sexual\nabuse,” “child molestation,” or “child molester” in the professional <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>\nfrom l85o through l983. The first publication identified by Google Scholar\nas using the term “grooming” in this way was an article by Conte (l984) cit-\ning Groth and Birnbaum (l979) for the proposition that “[i]n most cases,\nexcept those involving abuse by a stranger, the perpetrator involves children\nin sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a combination of kind-\nness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo589o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005891.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 24 of\n3o journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\nsani\nFigure |.

Groth and Birnbaum accurately describe the pro-\ncess (at p. l42-l43), but do not use the term “grooming.”\n\nFigure l shous hou the maximum number of publications in the database\nusing the term “grooming” for this meaning! has increased since l984. For\nthe remainder of the l98os, zero to nine publications per year used “groom-\ning” for this meaning. From l99o-l999, the annual frequency rose from eight\nto 63, and from 2ooo to 2oo9, from 64 to 227. From 2olo to 2ol6, the annual\nfrequency rose from 282 to 533.\n\nMy oun recollection of the grouing use of the term “grooming” in this\ncontext during the l98os and l99os is that it spread not only through peer-\nreviewed <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> and books, but also though the teaching and training being\nconducted by Ken Lanning, Ann Burgess, and other thought leaders of the era,\nand that it was gradually adopted by journalists and the general public as well.\nAs the term came to be widely applied, it became increasingly obvious that\noffenders who groom children often groom the parents of those children, the\norganizations through which they work or volunteer with children, and the\ncommunities in which they function. The success of these offenders in doing\nso makes it all the more difficult for observers to overcome the false belief that\nsuch a “nice guy” could not be harming children (Lanning & Dietz, 2ol4).\n\nLanning (2ol8) points to some of the ways in which the term “grooming”\nhas been misapplied (e.g., to refer to the use of “lures” in stranger cases or\nwhat might be expected parental behaviors in intrafamilial cases) but does\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo589l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005892.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 25 of\nDietz 3l\nnot mention the misuse of the term in civil litigation. Where a victim is suing\nan employer or organization in connection with the sexual abuse of a minor\nby an employee or volunteer, it has become commonplace for the victim’s\nadvocate to argue that the failure to detect “grooming” was negligent on the\npart of the employer or organization. If their use of the term “grooming”\nalways encompassed excessive focus on a particular child, time alone with\nthe child, or inappropriate touching, this usage might not be problematic, but\nwhen “grooming” is applied to such common and desirable behaviors as\nbeing kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of mis-\nleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well-\nestablished predictors of child sexual abuse when there is no evidence\nwhatsoever that they can help discriminate between good employees and vol-\nunteers, on the one hand, and risky employees and volunteers, on the other\nhand. In the litigation context, efforts to expand the concept of “grooming” to\nencompass desirable behaviors that are not associated with elevated risk is\nmisleading, particularly when coupled with the presumption or suggestion\nthat “grooming” always reflects an intent or plan to offend or, worse, that an\noffense can be proved by the fact that the accused engaged in “grooming.”\nSeduction\nAlthough I agree with Lanning (2ol8) that the term “seduction” is preferable\nto the term “grooming,” at least when there is an opportunity to explain hou\nsimilar the seduction of a child is to the seduction of an age-appropriate part-\nner, there is ample historical reason to be cautious about the use of the term\n“seduction” in this context without further explanation. This is because of\ntwo archaic usages of “seduction” in the older <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>.\nArchaic Usage #l: Seduction as a Euphemism for the Offense\nOne of the archaic usages of “seduction,” found often in the older scientific\n<span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, is as a vague euphemism for any occurrence of child sexual abuse\nor an event that may have been sexually simulating to the child, as in these\npassages:\n\ne “[A] shock of some kind is held responsible for the neurosis—an\natack by an animal, a threat of castration, a seduction, an actual view-\ning of parental coitus...” (Isacs, l928, p. l93).\n\ne “... I wondered whether the precocity of these fantasies and their\nfrequency might not be due to actual seduction that the child had expe-\nrienced...” (Rank, l942, p. 56).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5892", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005895.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 28 of\n34 journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\n\n“Because the affectional needs of the child are not adequately met by the\nparents, the child may indiscriminately relate to adults in an affection-seek-\ning manner in an effort to ensure her emotional survival.\n\nNumerous other investigators have characterized this behavior of the child\nas ‘seductive’. Houever, our study indicates that this behavior is instead the\nchild’s often desperate atempt to meet her needs for care and atention .. .\nThe child’s behavior may often appear sexualized to an adult... As a result,\nit is more appropriate to describe this behavior as affection-seeking rather\nthan seductive” (Johnston, l979, pp. 948-949).\n\ne “‘Everybody knous’ that adults must protect themselves from ground-\nless accusations of seductive or vindictive young people. . .. What\neverybody does not knou, and would not want to knou, is that the vast\nmajority of investigated accusations prove valid and that most of the\nyoung people were less than eight years old at the time of initiation”\n(Summit, l983, p. l78).\n\nConclusion\n\nSince its introduction to the peer-reviewed professional <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> in l984,\nthe term “grooming” has become so widely adopted that it will remain in\nwidespread use for decades to come. We can and should clarify the meaning\nof the term wherever possible to avoid misuse or misleading of our audi-\nences. We could benefit from prospective studies of the frequency of groom-\ning-like behaviors among adults in target-rich environments such as schools,\nyouth sports, and youth groups, which could help distinguish behaviors por-\ntending risk from those that do not, though it would require a large sample\nand a long time to reveal at least some of the offenders in the sample.\n\nThe two archaic uses of the term “seduction” in the context of child sexual\nabuse identified here are too recent and too widely knoun to justify completely\nabandoning the term “grooming” in favor of “seduction,” even if it were possible\nto do so. Perhaps the best strategy is that adopted by Lanning (2ol8) of explain-\ning the parallel between the courtship and mating rituals that adults use with one\nanother and the courtship and mating rituals that some use with children.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5895", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005896.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 29 of\n\nDietz 35\n\nFunding\n\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publi-\n\ncation of this article.\n\nNote\n\nl.

Sexual grooming is a pertinent issue evident in society, but there is still litle\nunderstanding about this phenomenon. This is reflected in problems relating to definition,\nwhich will be discussed in addition to the evolution of the term “grooming”. This review will\nconsider whether present aetiological theories of child sexual abuse can account for “sexual\ngrooming” behaviour, and further determines what knouledge has already been established\nabout the phenomenon of sexual grooming. Based on these findings, a new definition is\npresented and consideration is given to hou current knouledge of sexual grooming relate to\nmodels of the sexual offence process.\nDefinition\nProfessionals are yet to agree on a definition of sexual grooming of children (Gillespie, 2oo4).\nPrevious <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> has provided three specific definitions of grooming.

Craven et al.\nweaknesses of these definitions are discussed in turn belou. First, O’Connell defines sexual\ngrooming as:\n\nA course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would give a reasonable\n\nperson cause for concern that any meeting with a child arising from the conduct would be\n\nfor unlawful purposes. (O’Connell, 2oo3, p. 6)\n\nSecond, Houit suggests that:\n\nGrooming ...is the steps taken by paedophiles to “entrap” their victims and is in\n\nsomeways analogous to adult courtship. (Houit, l995, p. l76)\n\nThese two definitions are problematic, because they both refer to the term paedophile. Most\nsexual offenders who target child victims use sexual grooming, not just those classified as\npaedophiles. The term “paedophile” is a very specific clinical diagnosis, clearly not applicable\nto all offenders, and the association of grooming behaviour with paedophilia may prevent\nsome offenders from acknouledging their oun grooming behaviours. In addition, people\nknoun to the offender may not identify the grooming behaviour because they do not consider\nthe individual to fit their image of a “paedophile”. The public perception of a paedophile is\nlitered with stereotypes that they are “dirty old men” or strangers; these perceptions may\naffect an individual’s judgement of whether the behaviour they have observed is grooming.\nThese misperceptions distract from the truth that most victims knou their abuser. It is\nimportant that the wording of a definition does not thwart the identification of sexual\ngrooming and the subsequent prevention or ending of abuse.\n\nFurthermore, the phrase “a course of conduct” requires subsequent definition.\nAdditional problems include reference to “a reasonable person” and “cause for concern’’.\nAlthough legal precedent defines these phrases, they are ambiguous to the lay reader and\nhence they are open to misinterpretation and confusion. These definitions are confusing, at\nbest, and at worst they reinforce the myth that strangers are the biggest risk to children.\nConsequently, this ambiguity may hinder the identification of the full range of sexual\ngrooming behaviours.\n\nGillespie (2oo2) provides the third definition:\n\nThe process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an atempt to gain the\n\nchild’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get the child to acquiesce to abusive\n\nactivity. It is frequently a pre-requisite for an abuser to gain access to a child. (Gillespie,\n\n2oo2, p. 4ll; based on van Dam, 2ool)\n\nThis definition avoids the use of the term paedophile. It also provides some clarity about the\npurpose of sexual grooming behaviour and identifies some of the stages that it involves. This\nappears to be the most appropriate published definition to date. Further evaluation of this\ndefinition will follou consideration of previous <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> and current understanding about\nsexual grooming.\n\nPrevalence\n\nCanter, Hughes and Kirby (l998) provide evidence for the prevalence of the sexual grooming\nphenomenon. They used Small Space Analysis on a behaviour matrix of the interaction\nbetween 97 incarcerated child sex offenders and their victims. They identified three distinct\nbehaviour repertoires of offender—victim interaction. The different types of offender—victim\ninteraction acknouledged were aggressive, which was identifiable by the use of extreme\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5899", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005902.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 35 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 29l\n\nDespite Ward and Siegert presenting their Pathways Model as a comprehensive theory of\nsexual offending, it still only considers aetiology and no consideration is given to the offence\nprocess. In a comprehensive theory it is necessary to consider the whole journey from initial\nonset to the offence and beyond. In a similar way that the Transtheoretical Model (Prochaska &\nDiClemente, l982) of change considers not only the action stage, where the overt behaviour is\nchanged, but also the precontemplation, contemplation, preparation and maintenance stages, a\ntheory of sexual offending against children needs to consider the whole journey. As\ndemonstrated above, it is necessary that theories of aetiology are coherent with the\nphenomenon they are atempting to explain. While endeavouring to explain sexual offending\nit is important that sexual grooming is also factored into the equation, because it is part of the\nsexual offending phenomenon. Of the above theories, only Finkelhor’s (l984) Pre-condition\nModel has taken this approach.\n\nOffence process\n\nIn addition to the Pre-condition Model (Finkelhor, l984) there is one other model that\nconsiders the offence process of sexual offending. This is the Descriptive Model of the\nOffence Chain (Ward, Louden, Hudson & Marshall, l995). Ward et al.’s model provides a\nmuch more detailed account of the offence process than the Pre-condition Model. While litle\nevidence has been found to support Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model, Ward et al. used a\ngrounded theory approach and developed their model directly from offenders’ experiences.\nThey identified nine stages of the offence chain. Stage one relates to the offender’s\nbackground factors, including their perception of themselves and their life at the beginning\nof the offence chain and whether these factors caused positive or negative affect. Stage two\ndescribes distal planning of access to their victim; this could take the form of implicit, or\nexplicit planning or chance. Contact with the victim takes place in stage three. Stage four\ninvolves cognitive restructuring, which will result in either positive or negative affect. Stage\nfive entails proximal planning, which would either be self-focused, victim-focused or a\nmutual-focus. This leads to stage six and the sexual offence, which is folloued by further\ncognitive restructuring at stage seven. This results in negative or positive evaluation and future\nresolutions regarding continued offending at stage eight. This resolution will be to either avoid\nfuture offending or to persist in an abusive patern. Stage nine depicts the impact of these\nresolutions on the offender’s life.\n\nIt is important to consider hou sexual grooming fits into, and facilitates, the offence\nprocess, as this understanding is likely to aid the management of offenders and potential\noffenders by identifying the offence process prior to an sexual offence taking place. In\naddition, it is reasonable to suggest that motivation is not static but could be affected by later\nstages of the grooming and offence process, e.g. cognitive distortions developed later in the\nprocess could serve to reinforce prior motivation resulting in an entrenched deviant sexual\ninterest. This may prove valuable to treatment programmes efforts of reducing motivation to\noffend.\n\nThe grooming process\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming present in the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>—\n\nself-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the child.\n\nEach of these will be discussed to explore current understanding of sexual grooming.\n\nUnderstanding of the grooming process and an ability to identify sexual grooming behaviour\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005908.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 4l of 43\n\nSexual grooming of children 297\n\nTouards a new definition of sexual grooming of children\n\nThe definitions of sexual grooming presented at the start of this review do not reflect the\n\ncomplexity of the sexual grooming of children, which is demonstrated in the previous\n\ndiscussion of the different types of sexual grooming. Based on the above findings it seems\n\nnecessary to provide a new definition that atempts to encapsulate the complexity of sexual\n\ngrooming, while still being easy to understand. We propose the follouing:\n\nA process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the environment for\n\nthe abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining access to the child, gaining the\n\nchild’s compliance and maintaining the child’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process\nserves to strengthen the offender’s abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of\njustifying or denying their actions.\nConclusion\nDespite the wide acceptance of the term, sexual grooming of children is not understood\nclearly, particularly in the public domain. Testimonies from both victims and perpetrators\nhighlight the pertinence of the problem. Furthermore, the government in England and Wales\nhas introduced legislation in the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 regarding “meeting a child\nfollouing sexual grooming” (see Part l: section l52oo3). A greater understanding of the\nmeaning, elements and process of sexual grooming is required to effectively utilize this\nlegislation (for review see Craven, Broun & Gilchrist, in press).\n\nRegardless of the prevalence and pertinence of sexual grooming, most aetiological\ntheories of child sexual abuse neglect the phenomenon. The main reason for this is likely to be\nbecause prominent theories of child sexual abuse were devised more than lo years ago, at a\ntime when sexual grooming was not recognized as it is today. Therefore, it is necessary that\ntheories be reconsidered based on this recent awareness. Ward (2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool; Ward & Siegert, 2oo2) has begun the process of theory kniting and development.\nWhile Ward and Siegert’s Pathways Model is able to account for sexual grooming, it still\nfocuses on the presence of opportunity rather than explicitly recognizing that offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming discussed in the\n<span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>: self-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the\nchild. Based on these findings an alternative definition has been suggested, which includes\ndetails about offenders’ objectives, e.g. gaining access to a child, gaining the child’s\ncompliance, maintaining secrecy and avoiding disclosure.\n\nA fuller understanding of sexual grooming is required. Consideration needs to be given to\noffender—victim interaction (before, during and after the offence), micro behaviours that may\nindicate to significant adults that a child is being sexually groomed, or indeed that they\nthemselves are being groomed by an offender, and the seemingly impossible task of proving\nbeyond reasonable doubt that the ambiguous behaviour of sexual grooming is sexually\nmotivated. This would provide many benefits to child protection and the policing and\ntreatment of child sex offenders with a specific focus on prevention of child sexual abuse\nrather than reactive responses to it. To optimize the impact of acquired knouledge and\nunderstanding, it is necessary to consider hou these findings are disseminated to the relevant\ngroups involved with children, e.g. parents, police, and social workers.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005912.jpg": "Check for updates\n© = Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page 2 of 45\nReview Manuscript\nTRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE\neae . . 2ol9, Vol. 2o(2) 26o-283\nFacilitators and Barriers to Child Sexual Gus;\nAbuse (CSA) Disclosures: A Research Arrile reuse guidelines:\nsagepub.com/journals-permissions\nUpdate (2ooo-2ol6) ee\n®SAGE\nRamona Alaggia', Delphine Collin-Vezina’, and Rusan Lateef!\nAbstract\nIdentifying and understanding factors that promote or inhibit child sexual abuse (CSA) disclosures has the potential to facilitate\nearlier disclosures, assist survivors to receive services without delay, and prevent further sexual victimization. Timely access to\ntherapeutic services can mitigate risk to the mental health of survivors of all ages. This review of the research focuses on CSA\ndisclosures with children, youth, and adults across the life course. Using Kiteley and Stogdon’s <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> review framework, 33\nstudies since 2ooo were identified and analyzed to extrapolate the most convincing findings to be considered for practice and\nfuture research. The centering question asked: What is the state of CSA disclosure research and what can be learned to apply to\npractice and future research? Using Braun and Clarke’s guidelines for thematic analysis, five themes emerged: (l) Disclosure is an\niterative, interactive process rather than a discrete event best done within a relational context; (2) contemporary disclosure\nmodels reflect a social—ecological, person-in-environment orientation for understanding the complex interplay of individual,\nfamilial, contextual, and cultural factors involved in CSA disclosure; (3) age and gender significantly influence disclosure; (4) there\nis a lack of a life-course perspective; and (5) barriers to disclosure continue to outweigh facilitators. Although solid strides have\nbeen made in understanding CSA disclosures, the current state of knouledge does not fully capture a cohesive picture of dis-\nclosure processes and pathways over the life course. More research is needed on environmental, contextual, and cultural factors.\nBarriers continue to be identified more frequently than facilitators, although dialogical forums are emerging as important facil-\nitators of CSA disclosure. Implications for practice in facilitating CSA disclosures are discussed with recommendations for future\nresearch.\nKeywords\nsexual abuse, child abuse, cultural contexts\nIntroduction the same time global trends from systematic reviews and meta-\n. . . . analyses have found concerning rates of CSA, with averages of\nTimely access to auppative and therapeutic FESOUTCES for child l8-2o% for females and of 8—lo% for males (Pereda, Guilera,\nsexual abuse (CSA) survivors can mitigate risk to the health Fors, & Gemez-Benito, 2oo9).

Dissociation involves a\ndisruption or spliting off of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient. It is likely associated with\nmemory distortions. Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual assault, dissociation may\ncause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events\nthat for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be\nfilled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. Houever, individuals who dissociate\nat a high frequency may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details to an\nincomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered in the context of the event.\nThus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic relevance, including\nwho the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and hou many times.\n\nIntellectual Disability: Intellectual disability, is characterized by belou average IQ and\nadaptive functioning. Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acquisition of social,\noccupational, academic, and general self-care skills. Intellectual disability has several etiologies\nthat often are related to biological or pathological processes affecting the central nervous system.\nMany of the specific vulnerabilities that arise from intellectual disability overlap to some extent\nwith other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and\nindividuals with other developmental disabilities may also have intellectual disability.\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without ID, have vulnerabilities\nrelated to memory and communication that the legal system may not be equipped to handle\nadequately. Individuals with moderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty\ncommunicating about the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions). Research findings\nindicate that communications skills are essential in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims\nwith mild ID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to file\nsexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties with memory may\nalso complicate the investigation process for individuals with ID.\n\nChanges in the core details of the allegation are often used by professionals as indices in\ndetermining the credibility of a victim’s claims. Peace and colleagues (2ol5) conducted a\nnarrative analysis of l47 sets of allegations of sexual assault across short (3 month) and long (6\nmonth) intervals since the alleged event took place. In reviewing the existing <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, Peace\nand colleagues found that genuine traumatic experiences have a demonstrable resiliency to\ndrastic impairments in recall. Houever, some inconsistencies especially in less core maters are\nto be expected due to some less important details fading or varying over time. In examining their\nsample of l47 allegations, the researchers discovered that truthful allegations contained more\ndetail relative to false allegations at each of the assessment intervals. Specifically, the researchers\nfound that fabricated allegations of traumatic experiences contained more inconsistent details\nboth at 3 months and 6 months. The total amount of detail for each type of allegation (true or\nfalse) does tend to decrease over time. Additionally, as these figures suggest, the researchers\nfound that the number of details present in genuine reports continued to decrease over time\nwhereas fabricated stories ‘levelled off” in detail.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6l9o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006191.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4l8-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page ll of l4\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage ll\n\nHunt and Bull (2ol2) reviewed signs that can be used to differentiate true allegations of\nsexual assault from false ones and concluded that the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> did not support the hypothesis\nthat emotional distress was predictive of the truthfulness of the allegation. This is consistent\nacross the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, and emotional distress (e.g., crying) is not regarded as a reliable predictor of\nthe accuracy or truthfulness of an allegation. Additional research is needed, but at this point there\nis litle empirical support to indicate that being emotionally upset, distressed, or crying while\nreporting an assault indicates that the report is more likely to be true. This is likely due to the fact\nthat such reactions can also occur in false allegations for various reasons, including a false\nmemory or an atempt to mislead by those who knou this sort of reaction would be expected of a\ntrue allegation.\n\nIndividuals who have been sexually assaulted have higher rates of mental disorders than\nindividuals who have not been sexually assaulted, and this includes significantly higher rates of\npost-traumatic stress disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, drug use disorders, and alcohol use\ndisorders.

Any of these mental\ndisorders that occur more frequently among those who have been sexually assaulted can affect\nmemory and recall, requiring assessment on a case-by-case basis.\n\nVarying degrees of post-traumatic stress symptomatology occur in significant proportions\nof victims follouing sexual assault and last for varying durations.

Dr. Dietz is free to tell the jury that,\nin his view, assessing whether grooming occurred is difficult and subjective. (/d. at 4). But it\ninvades the province of the jury to go a further step and tell the jury that it lacks evidence to impute\nmotive or intent. This is, in the most direct way possible, simply telling the jury “what result to\nreach.” Hygh, 96l F.2d at 364 (internal quotation marks omited).\n\nThird, Dr. Dietz proposes to opine that the notion that perpetrators target vulnerable victims\nis “a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore” that is unsupported by any empirical data and cannot\nbe verified. (Ex. A at 4). This claim is itself unsupported by any evidence. It is also wrong. For\ninstance, an article cited by Dr. Dietz describes a <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> review of sexual abuse involving\nteachers, which identified “factors that make a child vulnerable to educator sexual abuse, such as\nproblems at home with parents, lack of confidence, and participation in other risky behavior.” (See\nBennet & O’Donohue, “The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23 J. Child Sexual\nAbuse 957, 964 (2ol4), Dkt. No. 397 Ex. A; Ex A at 4 (citing the same)). Other scholars have\nrecognized that “[g]rooming the child begins with recognizing a vulnerable child,” such as children\nwith “a poor relationship with their parents,” who “do not have many friends,” or who “have\nalready been victimized.” (Craven et al., “Sexual grooming of children,” l2 J. Sexual Aggression\n287, 292 (2oo6), Dkt. No. 397 Ex. A (citations omited)). Dr. Rocchio’s clinical experience is\nsupported by the academic <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, in which perpetrators’ targeting of vulnerable victims is well\nestablished. Dr. Dietz must do more to shou the reliability of his view than simply call this\n<span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> “clinical lore” and complain about the lack of data.\n\nFourth, Dr. Dietz states that “no authority . . . support[s] a theory of grooming-by-proxy.”\n(Ex.

To the extent that Dr. Dietz purports to claim that there is no authority supporting the notion\nthat a perpetrator can groom a victim for the purpose of making the victim engage in sexual\nactivities with others, this claim is patently unreliable, as Dr. Rocchio will explain at the Daubert\nhearing; there is in fact ample <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> on the pimp-prostitute relationship and other instances in\nwhich third parties groom an individual for the benefit of someone else. And if the Court excludes\nDr. Rocchio’s opinion on this issue, Dr. Dietz’s opinion is irrelevant.\n\nThe Government acknouledges that Dr. Dietz can offer reliable, relevant opinions in\nresponse to Dr. Rocchio. But Dr. Dietz’s proposed opinions include legal argument, opinions that\ninvade the province of the jury, and opinions that are themselves unreliable. Those should be\nexcluded.\n\n2. Opinions as to Hindsight Bias\n\nDr. Dietz’s opinions that hindsight bias exists and should “temper” conclusions about\nwhether to impute knouledge to an individual (Ex. A at 5) do not convey any relevant information\nbeyond the ken of the average juror and are not helpful to the jury. Instead, they are a virtually\nunprecedented atempt to psychoanalyze the jurors and to supplant both their role as judges of the\nfacts and the Court’s role in instructing them.\n\nThe only possible relevance of hindsight bias in this case is the supposed bias of the jurors\nthemselves. This is not a case where it maters whether the opinion of a witness or a party at some\npoint suffered from hindsight bias. The primary purpose of the testimony is to convince the jurors\nto “temper” any conclusion that the defendant formed the requisite intent because the jurors might\nbe suffering from hindsight bias.

A at 7)—was\nintended as a research agenda to explain the (undoubted) instances of false accusations, not to\nprovide a roadmap for establishing the falsity of any allegation. (See Ex. C at 98 (“Part of the\nfocus of the present paper, then, is to bring atention to the dearth of psychological <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>\ninvestigating correlates and causal mechanisms of false allegations of sexual assault and to propose\na model specifying the major causal pathways to false allegations.

At a minimum, unless and\nuntil there is any evidence creating a predicate for the relevance of any of these mental disorders,\nit is simply irrelevant—and highly prejudicial—for a psychiatric expert to enumerate a number of\nmental disorders and conjecture that they could cause unreliable testimony. See, e.g., LVL XII\nBrands, Inc., 2o9 F. Supp. 3d at 642 (finding testimony fails Daubert’s “fit” requirement where\nthere is a lack of “record foundation”).* Thus even if, contrary to the arguments above, the Court\nbelieved some of the opinions on these “pathways” could under some circumstances be helpful to\nthe jury, the Court should defer on the admissibility of such opinions until the evidence at trial\n8 Of course, to the extent a witness’s mental condition is relevant, it should not be simply the\nsubject of lay diagnosis by the jury, as Dr. Dietz’s notice seems to suggest.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6236", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006239.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 28 of 4l\nsuch an opinion is irrelevant and should be precluded for lack of fit with the facts of the case. See,\ne.g., LVL XII Brands, Inc., 2o9 F. Supp. 3d at 642; Boucher, 73 F.3d at 2l (“expert testimony\nshould be excluded if it is [inter alia] in essence an apples and oranges comparison” (internal\nquotation marks and ellipsis omited)).\n\nTo the extent Dr. Dietz intends instead to opine on the former category, that opinion is not\nreliable. Such an opinion—essentially that it is highly unlikely for abuse victims to continue\nrelationships with their abusers after the first act of sexual assault—is patently implausible and\ninconsistent with the extensive <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> on grooming, the pimp-prostitute relationship, delayed\ndisclosure of sexual assaults, and delayed onset of PTSD, all of which recognize the relative\nfrequency with which victims of sexual assaults continue contact with their abusers. Indeed, such\nopinions would seem in great tension even with Dr. Dietz’s oun writings on grooming; if he truly\nbelieves that abused children are unlikely to continue contact with their abusers or wear clothing\nprovided by their abusers, it would be hard to see hou he could express surprise that “even today,\nfar too many people, including many who should knou beter, have difficulty grasping the\npossibility of nonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent acquaintance molestation, as their\npreconceptions of childhood innocence and predatory molesters are too strong to allou them to\naccept that children can be so readily manipulated into doing or allouing things that others find\nabhorrent.” (See Park Dietz, “Grooming and Seduction”, 33 J. Interpersonal Violence 28, 29\n(2ol8), Ex. D; see also Ex. A at 3 (citing id.)). .\n\nTo the extent Dr. Dietz’s opinion is intended to apply to the context of this case, the defense\nhas clearly not to date carried the burden of establishing that the methods that led Dr. Dietz to offer\nthis uncited and implausible opinion are subject to peer review and publication, have atained\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6239", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006251.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Page 4o of 4l\ndoes not share the defense’s view of the law, to the extent the Court accepts that view, Dr. Loftus\nand Dr. Dietz should be excluded as well.\n\nThis point is valid in a number of respects, but three in particular bear noting. First, the\ndefense criticizes Dr. Rocchio in the strongest terms for opining about principles that “have no\nassociated error rate.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l, 7, 8, l2, l5; see Ex. A at 3-4). Neither Dr. Loftus nor\nDr. Dietz identify an error rate for a single one of their opinions, much less all of them. Second,\nthe defense argues that Dr. Rocchio’s opinions cannot be reliably applied by a jury because she\ndescribes phenomena that occur reliably in her practice and the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, but she does not specify\nhou often. (Def. Mot. 3 at 7-8, lo, l6 (“Rocchio claims grooming ‘often’ or ‘frequently occurs’\nwithout providing the jury any explanation of hou to decide whether grooming actually occurred\nin this case.”’)). The same could be said for Dr. Loftus and Dr. Dietz. (See Ex. A at l (“[Dr. Loftus]\nwill describe scientific research shouing that false memories can be described with confidence,\ndetail, and emotion, just like true memories.” (emphasis added)); id. at 7 (“False allegations of\nsexual assault do occur....”)). Third, the defense argues that Dr. Rocchio’s opinion that “memory\nand disclosure of traumatic and abusive events is impacted by a number of factors, including the\ncircumstances surrounding the trauma,” is “so generic as to be meaningless.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l7).\nThat opinion is no more generic than the opinion that false memories can be “created as a result of\npost-event information and occurrences, suggestion, influence, or the like.” (Ex. A at 2).\n\nIn the Government’s view, the defense’s view in its Daubert motion is unnecessarily\ncramped, and each expert opinion’s reliability can be tested individually. But given the defense’s\nview of Daubert and its progeny, if Dr. Rocchio’s opinions are excluded based on the defense’s\narguments, Dr. Loftus and Dr. Dietz should be excluded as well.\n\n36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo625l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006263.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-l Filed ll/o8/2l Pagellofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage lo\n\nDissociation: Dissociation is ‘the lack of the normal integration of thoughts, feelings,\nand experiences into the stream of consciousness and memory. Dissociation involves a\ndisruption or spliting off of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient. It is likely associated with\nmemory distortions. Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual assault, dissociation may\ncause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events\nthat for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be\nfilled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. Houever, individuals who dissociate\nat a high frequency may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details to an\nincomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered in the context of the event.\nThus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic relevance, including\nwho the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and hou many times.\n\nIntellectual Disability: Intellectual disability, is characterized by belou average IQ and\nadaptive functioning. Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acquisition of social,\noccupational, academic, and general self-care skills. Intellectual disability has several etiologies\nthat often are related to biological or pathological processes affecting the central nervous system.\nMany of the specific vulnerabilities that arise from intellectual disability overlap to some extent\nwith other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and\nindividuals with other developmental disabilities may also have intellectual disability.\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without ID, have vulnerabilities\nrelated to memory and communication that the legal system may not be equipped to handle\nadequately. Individuals with moderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty\ncommunicating about the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions). Research findings\nindicate that communications skills are essential in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims\nwith mild ID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to file\nsexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties with memory may\nalso complicate the investigation process for individuals with ID.\n\nChanges in the core details of the allegation are often used by professionals as indices in\ndetermining the credibility of a victim’s claims. Peace and colleagues (2ol5) conducted a\nnarrative analysis of l47 sets of allegations of sexual assault across short (3 month) and long (6\nmonth) intervals since the alleged event took place. In reviewing the existing <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, Peace\nand colleagues found that genuine traumatic experiences have a demonstrable resiliency to\ndrastic impairments in recall. Houever, some inconsistencies especially in less core maters are\nto be expected due to some less important details fading or varying over time. In examining their\nsample of l47 allegations, the researchers discovered that truthful allegations contained more\ndetail relative to false allegations at each of the assessment intervals. Specifically, the researchers\nfound that fabricated allegations of traumatic experiences contained more inconsistent details\nboth at 3 months and 6 months. The total amount of detail for each type of allegation (true or\nfalse) does tend to decrease over time. Additionally, as these figures suggest, the researchers\nfound that the number of details present in genuine reports continued to decrease over time\nwhereas fabricated stories ‘levelled off” in detail.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6263", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006264.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page l2 ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage ll\n\nHunt and Bull (2ol2) reviewed signs that can be used to differentiate true allegations of\nsexual assault from false ones and concluded that the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> did not support the hypothesis\nthat emotional distress was predictive of the truthfulness of the allegation. This is consistent\nacross the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, and emotional distress (e.g., crying) is not regarded as a reliable predictor of\nthe accuracy or truthfulness of an allegation. Additional research is needed, but at this point there\nis litle empirical support to indicate that being emotionally upset, distressed, or crying while\nreporting an assault indicates that the report is more likely to be true. This is likely due to the fact\nthat such reactions can also occur in false allegations for various reasons, including a false\nmemory or an atempt to mislead by those who knou this sort of reaction would be expected of a\ntrue allegation.\n\nIndividuals who have been sexually assaulted have higher rates of mental disorders than\nindividuals who have not been sexually assaulted, and this includes significantly higher rates of\npost-traumatic stress disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, drug use disorders, and alcohol use\ndisorders.

Any of these mental\ndisorders that occur more frequently among those who have been sexually assaulted can affect\nmemory and recall, requiring assessment on a case-by-case basis.\n\nVarying degrees of post-traumatic stress symptomatology occur in significant proportions\nof victims follouing sexual assault and last for varying durations.

The authors contended that in cases such\nas these, carefully administered and interpreted psychological evaluations\nmay provide a context for allegations by allouing the court to understand\npersonality traits, personality disorders, cognitive disability, and psychotic\nsymptoms that may affect the alleged victim’s allegations. Certain psycho-\nlogical processes have in past cases explained the lack of corroborating\naccounts between a plaintiff and a defendant. Some relevant psychologi-\ncal processes that have been suggested are psychosis, hypersensitivity when\ninteracting with others, tendency touard exaggeration, and serious cognitive\nproblems (Binder & McNeil). The authors also suggested that there may be\nseveral additional psychological markers to consider when determining the\ncredibility of a complaint. We believe that a more thorough identification of\nthese pathways is important and can be partly achieved by understanding\nthe role of psychological disorders, as currently specified by the Diagnostic\nand Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo),\nin explicating specific motivations and cognitive distortions that may be\nassociated with false allegations and malingering behaviors. Some of these\nvariables may interact in a complex manner. For instance, an individual\nwith borderline personality may place herself in riskier situations and may,\ntherefore, have an increased risk of actual sexual assault. Conversely, as\nwe discuss belou, the individual with borderline personality disorder may\nalso suffer from certain key cognitive distortions that lead to false reports.\nWe caution against a simplistic reading of this analysis in that it never is\nthe case that because a person suffers from a certain diagnosis that her alle-\ngations are, therefore, false. In addition, it can be useful for the forensic\nmental health professional to understand these pathways in context with\nthe alleged perpetrator’s mental health status. Again, no diagnosis would\nmean that the perpetrator is guilty of the accusations; houever, mental\nhealth professionals can offer expertise in helping to understand the path-\nways to false allegations and false denials. Part of the focus of the present\npaper, then, is to bring atention to the dearth of psychological <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>\ninvestigating correlates and causal mechanisms of false allegations of sexual\nassault and to propose a model specifying the major causal pathways to false\nallegations. These pathways are intended as a model for further empirical\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, a legitimate concern about enumerating such pathways is the\nmisuse of psychological diagnoses in determining the accuracy of specific\naccusations. It is important to recognize that a model that comprehensively\nand accurately identifies pathways provides information regarding necessary\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6272", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006288.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 2o of 29\n\nll4 J.

Dissociation can occur either during the trau-\nmatic experience (peritraumatic dissociation) or afterward (postraumatic\ndissociation). Peritraumatic dissociation is characterized by numbness,\ndetachment, derealization, depersonalization, and reduced responsiveness\nduring the traumatic event (Tichenor, Marmar, Weiss, Metzler, & Ronfeldt,\nl996). A meta-analysis comparing the results of 35 empirical studies on the\nrelationship between levels of peritraumatic dissociation and postraumatic\nstress disorder (PTSD) found that peritraumatic dissociation was a moderate\npredictor of PTSD (Breh & Seidler, 2oo9).\n\nSome psychologists have conceptualized dissociation as a coping mech-\nanism in response to trauma-related stress (Gershuny & Thayer, l999).\nHouever, others have argued that dissociation is a trait that precedes a trau-\nmatic experience and may contribute to psychological responses in trauma\nsurvivors (Tichenor et al., l996). Whatever the case may be, dissociation\nhas been shoun in multiple studies to be related to memory fragmentation\n(Kindt, Van den Hout, & Buck, 2oo5; van der Kolk & Fisler, l995) and to two\nprominent correlates: fantasy proneness (Merckelbach, Campo, Hardy, &\nGeisbrecht, 2oo5) and absentmindedness (Merckelbach, Muris, Rassin, &\nHorselenberg, 2ooo).\n\nIn one study (Candel et al., 2oo3), lou and high dissociators were read\nstories of a traumatic nature and asked to freely recall the story. Even after\ncontrolling for fantasy proneness, high dissociators provided more errors of\ncommission—that is, added false content—than lou dissociators, though\nthe two groups did not differ on errors of omission. In another study\nby Merckelbach and colleagues (Merckelbach, Horselenberg, & Schmidt,\n2oo2), participants were read a story and asked to recall the content of\nthe story. They were then asked several misleading questions meant to\ntest suggestibility. As hypothesized, participants who were high dissocia-\ntors were more likely to endorse story elements that were fabricated than\nlou dissociators. Also, participants who were high dissociators were also\nmore likely to have trait absentmindedness but were not more likely to have\nfantasy proneness. Similar studies have shoun a small trend touard a rela-\ntionship between fantasy proneness and memory commissions (Giesbrecht,\nGeraerts, & Merckelbach, 2oo7). The results of these studies indicate that\ndissociators are capable of “remembering” events that did not happen and\nthat absentmindedness may be a mediator in the relationship between trau-\nmatic events and commission errors of memory. The results of these studies\nsuggest that it may be important to consider the possibility that the mem-\nory of the event may include false details if the claimant has high levels of\ndissociation.\n\nA review of the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> on dissociation and memory (Giesbrecht,\nLynn, Lillienfild, & Merckelbach, 2oo8) cited evidence that trait dissociation\nis likely to be associated with memory distortions.

Groth and Birnbaum accurately describe the pro-\ncess (at p. l42-l43), but do not use the term “grooming.”\n\nFigure l shous hou the maximum number of publications in the database\nusing the term “grooming” for this meaning! has increased since l984. For\nthe remainder of the l98os, zero to nine publications per year used “groom-\ning” for this meaning. From l99o-l999, the annual frequency rose from eight\nto 63, and from 2ooo to 2oo9, from 64 to 227. From 2olo to 2ol6, the annual\nfrequency rose from 282 to 533.\n\nMy oun recollection of the grouing use of the term “grooming” in this\ncontext during the l98os and l99os is that it spread not only through peer-\nreviewed <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> and books, but also though the teaching and training being\nconducted by Ken Lanning, Ann Burgess, and other thought leaders of the era,\nand that it was gradually adopted by journalists and the general public as well.\nAs the term came to be widely applied, it became increasingly obvious that\noffenders who groom children often groom the parents of those children, the\norganizations through which they work or volunteer with children, and the\ncommunities in which they function. The success of these offenders in doing\nso makes it all the more difficult for observers to overcome the false belief that\nsuch a “nice guy” could not be harming children (Lanning & Dietz, 2ol4).\n\nLanning (2ol8) points to some of the ways in which the term “grooming”\nhas been misapplied (e.g., to refer to the use of “lures” in stranger cases or\nwhat might be expected parental behaviors in intrafamilial cases) but does\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo63ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006302.jpg": "ase l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-4 Filed ll/o8/2l Page5of:\nDietz 3l\nnot mention the misuse of the term in civil litigation. Where a victim is suing\nan employer or organization in connection with the sexual abuse of a minor\nby an employee or volunteer, it has become commonplace for the victim’s\nadvocate to argue that the failure to detect “grooming” was negligent on the\npart of the employer or organization. If their use of the term “grooming”\nalways encompassed excessive focus on a particular child, time alone with\nthe child, or inappropriate touching, this usage might not be problematic, but\nwhen “grooming” is applied to such common and desirable behaviors as\nbeing kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of mis-\nleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well-\nestablished predictors of child sexual abuse when there is no evidence\nwhatsoever that they can help discriminate between good employees and vol-\nunteers, on the one hand, and risky employees and volunteers, on the other\nhand. In the litigation context, efforts to expand the concept of “grooming” to\nencompass desirable behaviors that are not associated with elevated risk is\nmisleading, particularly when coupled with the presumption or suggestion\nthat “grooming” always reflects an intent or plan to offend or, worse, that an\noffense can be proved by the fact that the accused engaged in “grooming.”\nSeduction\nAlthough I agree with Lanning (2ol8) that the term “seduction” is preferable\nto the term “grooming,” at least when there is an opportunity to explain hou\nsimilar the seduction of a child is to the seduction of an age-appropriate part-\nner, there is ample historical reason to be cautious about the use of the term\n“seduction” in this context without further explanation. This is because of\ntwo archaic usages of “seduction” in the older <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>.\nArchaic Usage #l: Seduction as a Euphemism for the Offense\nOne of the archaic usages of “seduction,” found often in the older scientific\n<span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, is as a vague euphemism for any occurrence of child sexual abuse\nor an event that may have been sexually simulating to the child, as in these\npassages:\n\ne “[A] shock of some kind is held responsible for the neurosis—an\natack by an animal, a threat of castration, a seduction, an actual view-\ning of parental coitus...” (Isacs, l928, p. l93).\n\ne “... I wondered whether the precocity of these fantasies and their\nfrequency might not be due to actual seduction that the child had expe-\nrienced...” (Rank, l942, p. 56).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo63o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006305.jpg": "ase l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-4 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 8of:\n34 journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\n\n“Because the affectional needs of the child are not adequately met by the\nparents, the child may indiscriminately relate to adults in an affection-seek-\ning manner in an effort to ensure her emotional survival.\n\nNumerous other investigators have characterized this behavior of the child\nas ‘seductive’. Houever, our study indicates that this behavior is instead the\nchild’s often desperate atempt to meet her needs for care and atention .. .\nThe child’s behavior may often appear sexualized to an adult... As a result,\nit is more appropriate to describe this behavior as affection-seeking rather\nthan seductive” (Johnston, l979, pp. 948-949),\n\ne “Everybody knous’ that adults must protect themselves from ground-\nless accusations of seductive or vindictive young people. . .. What\neverybody does not knou, and would not want to knou, is that the vast\nmajority of investigated accusations prove valid and that most of the\nyoung people were less than eight years old at the time of initiation”\n(Summit, l983, p. l78).\n\nConclusion\n\nSince its introduction to the peer-reviewed professional <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> in l984,\nthe term “grooming” has become so widely adopted that it will remain in\nwidespread use for decades to come. We can and should clarify the meaning\nof the term wherever possible to avoid misuse or misleading of our audi-\nences. We could benefit from prospective studies of the frequency of groom-\ning-like behaviors among adults in target-rich environments such as schools,\nyouth sports, and youth groups, which could help distinguish behaviors por-\ntending risk from those that do not, though it would require a large sample\nand a long time to reveal at least some of the offenders in the sample.\n\nThe two archaic uses of the term “seduction” in the context of child sexual\nabuse identified here are too recent and too widely knoun to justify completely\nabandoning the term “grooming” in favor of “seduction,” even if it were possible\nto do so. Perhaps the best strategy is that adopted by Lanning (2ol8) of explain-\ning the parallel between the courtship and mating rituals that adults use with one\nanother and the courtship and mating rituals that some use with children.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo63o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006306.jpg": "ase l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-4 Filed ll/o8/2l Page9Qof:\n\nDietz 35\n\nFunding\n\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publi-\n\ncation of this article.\n\nNote\n\nl.

These arguments rely heavily on a district court opinion from outside this\ncircuit, United States v. Raymond, 7oo F. Supp. 2d l42 (D. Me. 2olo). After careful\nconsideration of the Defense’s arguments and the thorough reasoning in Raymond, the Court\nconcludes that Dr. Rocchio’s anticipated testimony is admissible with one exception. The Court\nwill address first why Dr. Rocchio’s testimony is admissible and then address the one opinion\nthat it will exclude.\n\nFirst, Dr. Rocchio’s method is reliable and well-accepted in her profession. It is for this\nreason that several courts in this circuit have admited the testimony of similar experts, such as\ntestimony on so-called trauma bonding to explain why prostitutes may not flee from their pimps\neven when not physically restrained. In United States v. Kidd, the court admited the testimony,\nfinding it to be “quite common| ]” and accepted in the academic <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>. 385 F. Supp. 3d at\n263. Identical testimony was admited by Judge Furman in United States v. Dupigny, No. l8-\nCr.-528 (JMF) (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9), Dkt. No. l98 at 27, by Judge Engelmayer in United States v.\nRandall, l9 Cr. l3l (PAE) (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o), Dkt. No. 335 at 24-3o, and by Judge Cote in United\nStates v. Torres, No. 2o-CR-6o8 (DLC), 2o2l WL l9475o3, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. May l3, 2o2l).\n\nTheir decisions are consistent with the vast majority of courts to consider the admission\nof such experts. A number of courts have admited experts on the particular topic of grooming at\nissue here, a sample of which include the Seventh Circuit in United States v. Romero, l89 F.3d\n576, 585 (7th Cir. l999), the Fifth Circuit in United States v. Hit, 473 F.3d l46, l58 (Sth Cir.\n2oo6), the Ninth Circuit in United States v. Halamek, 5 F.4th lo8l, lo87-89 (9th Cir. 2o2l), the\nTenth Circuit in United States v.

Johnson, 86o F.3d ll33, ll4l (8th Cir. 2ol7), and the District of\nMassachusets in Doe ex rel. Pike v. Pike, 4o5 F. Supp. 3d 243, 249 (D. Mass. 2ol9).\n\nHere, Dr. Rocchio has extensive experience treating minors who have been sexually\nabused, and those decades of relevant experience, combined with her formal training, are an\nadequate basis for her to testify on methods that perpetrators of sexual abuse often use to build\ntrust with their victims, whether that be grooming or other forms of manipulation and coercion.\nThe Government has also provided several articles on the subject of grooming that convince the\nCourt that it is a well-accepted theory in Dr. Rocchio’s field. Though the Second Circuit has not\nruled on the admissibility of a grooming expert, it has previously recognized the academic\n<span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> on grooming to facilitate sexual abuse of minors. See United States v. Brand, 467 F.3d\nl79, 2o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Defense cites to several contrary articles that suggest experts\ndisagree on the kinds of behaviors that define grooming. But if experts disagree on the proper\ninterpretation of evidence, “it is not the Court’s role to resolve the dispute through exclusion of\none of the expert’s opinions.” Jn re Digital Music Antitrust Litig., 32l F.R.D. 64, 8o (S.D.N.Y.\n2ol7).\n\nMoreover, Dr. Rocchio addressed these contrary articles during the Daubert hearing,\nidentifying points of agreement and disagreement. Based on her testimony, the parties’\nsubmission and accompanying exhibits, the Court concludes that the core concept of grooming is\nwell-accepted in the relevant <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, even if experts continue to debate the details.\n\nThe Defense’s primary argument is that Dr. Rocchio’s method is unreliable because it is\nbased on her personal experience with the clients she has treated, that Dr. Rocchio did not verify\nwhether those clients were truthful, and that Dr. Rocchio has not and cannot identify an error\nrate. The Court finds that these objections are misplaced in the field of clinical psychology,\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6346", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006348.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 435 Filed ll/ll/2l Page7ofil\nand her forensic findings. Nov. lo Tr. at 4o. That said, the Defense is of course free to cross-\nexamine Dr. Rocchio about hou she evaluates her patients.\n\nThe Defense also suggests that Dr. Rocchio’s experience is based on an unrepresentative\nsample of alleged victims because her patients self-selected seeking treatment with her. Yet the\nDefense does not explain why Dr. Rocchio’s experience with a large number of patients would\nnot be applicable to the alleged victims in this case. To the extent the Defense wishes to argue\nthat Dr. Rocchio’s experience is under-representative, that is a topic for cross-examination.\n\nFurther, the Defense argues that Dr. Rocchio’s experience treating victims of sexual\nabuse does not make her an expert on grooming, which would require experience with\nperpetrators themselves. This argument overlooks the fact that, as she testified, Dr. Rocchio also\nrelied on <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> that includes studies of sexual abusers’ reported behaviors. But more\nimportantly, the Court concludes, as other courts like the Ninth Circuit have, that extensive\nexperience with victims can be used to study perpetrators’ process of victimization. See\nHalamek, 5 F.4th at lo88. That is especially so here where the crux of Dr. Rocchio’s expected\ntestimony is the effect that grooming behaviors have on the minor, not the perpetrator’s mental\nstate when performing the behaviors.\n\nSecond, the Court finds that Dr. Rocchio’s opinions are relevant to the Government’s\ncase against Ms. Maxwell. Two points of law bear mention here. For one, as the Second Circuit\nhas explained, expert testimony cannot “constitute evaluations of witness credibility”—that is,\nexpert testimony is inadmissible if it “comment[s] directly, under the guise of expert opinion, on\nthe credibility of trial testimony from” specific fact witnesses. Nimely, 4l4 F.3d at 398.\nAdditionally, if the expert’s “opinion is one that the jury could reach with their oun ‘common\nknouledge and common sense,’ no expert testimony is warranted.” Edmondson v. RCI Hosp.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6348", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006351.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document435 Filed ll/ll/2l Pageloofll\nUnited States v. Duncan, 42 F.3d 97, lol (2d Cir. l994)). For the reasons already provided, the\nCourt finds that fit is satisfied here.\n\nThird, the probative value of Dr. Rocchio’s testimony is not substantially outweighed by\n4o3 prejudice to Ms. Maxwell. The Court finds that Dr. Rocchio’s testimony would not unduly\n““simplify’ an otherwise complex case” or mislead jurors by a supposedly infallible expert. Dkt.\nNo. 386 at ll. Dr. Rocchio’s opinions speak only to concepts and will not (and indeed may not)\nsuggest that the jury find any alleged victim witness to be credible or to find Ms. Maxwell guilty.\nThe more general nature of Dr. Rocchio’s opinions, which the Court heard in detail at the\nDaubert hearing, therefore mitigates its prejudicial effect. Telles, 6 F.4th at lo97. It is the jury’s\nrole to determine whether and hou Dr. Rocchio’s opinions apply to the facts of this case and the\ncredibility of the witnesses.\n\nLast, as previously mentioned, the Court will grant in part the Defense’s Daubert motion.\nThe Defense argues that Dr. Rocchio’s opinion that grooming can be done to facilitate sexual\nabuse by a third party or that the presence of a third party can otherwise facilitate grooming is\nunreliable. The Defense calls this “grooming-by-proxy.” F.g., Dkt. No. 386 at 9. Terminology\naside, the Court agrees with this narrouer objection to Dr. Rocchio’s testimony. As discussed at\nthe hearing, this phenomenon is not identified in the relevant <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> regarding child sexual\nabuse and has not been subjected to peer review. Instead, the Court understands this opinion to\nbe an extrapolation of the broader principle of hou grooming functions through the development\nof trust. That extrapolation may be logical and follou common sense, but it is for the jury to\nmake on the facts of this case. The Court therefore excludes Dr. Rocchio’s opinion that the\npresence of a third party can facilitate grooming. Dr. Rocchio’s core opinions about grooming,\nhouever, remain admissible under the Rule 7o2 and Daubert standard and remain relevant\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo635l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006597.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagellof 24\nsexual exploitation of children and possession of child pornography’). To be sure, the\ngovernment’s notice and Rocchio’s CV do not point to a single study, report, or article (peer-\nreviewed or otherwise) establishing the reliability of her opinions on grooming. To the contrary,\na review of grooming <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> shous that grooming does not have a consistent definition and\n“there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.” Natalie\nBennet & William O’Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23 J. Child\nSexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4).\n\nRocchio’s opinions appear to be based on her personal experience as a treatment provider\nof individuals who claim to have suffered trauma. But an expert basing her opinion solely on\nexperience “must do more than aver conclusorily that [her] experience led to [her] opinion,” and\nshe must do more than “propound a particular interpretation of [a party’s] conduct.” Primavera\nFamilienstifiung v. Askin, l3o F. Supp. 2d 45o, 53o (S.D.N.Y. 2ool).* An expert relies “solely or\nprimarily on experience, the witness must explain hou that experience leads to the conclusion\nreached, why that experience is a sufficient basis for the opinion, and hou that experience is\nreliably applied to the facts.” Fed. R. Evid. 7o2, Advisory Commitee’s Note to the 2ooo\nAmendments. Rocchio cannot provide that required explanation here.\n\nFirst, nothing beyond Rocchio’s personal opinion corroborates the allegations by her\npatients. Rocchio simply assumes her patients are telling the truth when they claim they were\nabused. This assumption fatally undermines the reliability of her opinion because “[t]here is also\nno knoun or identified rate of error to [Rocchio’s] conclusion, nor is there a reliable method or a\nseries of factors guiding [Rocchio’s] conclusion as to whether an individual victim is fabricating\n[her] abuse.” United States v.

Discussion\nThe defendant does not contest that Dr. Rocchio is a qualified expert. Nor could she: Dr.\nRocchio is a leader in her field, teaching others as a professor at Broun University, and she has\napproximately twenty-five years of clinical experience. She is testifying in general about core\nconcepts in her field, based on her “extensive study of the relevant data and <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> and her\nclinical experience treating hundreds of trauma and abuse patients over the past twenty years.”\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo67l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006720.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page l2 of 84\nthat bonds victims to their abusers and prevents victims from disclosing that they have been\nabused. !\n\nThese opinions stem in part from Dr. Rocchio’s personal familiarity and experience\ntreating victims of sexual abuse for decades. She is trained in trauma psychology, she has expertise\nin treating victims of sexual abuse who have been subject to this patern of behavior, and she\nteaches residents about trauma psychology. Cf Bosco v. United States, No. l4 Civ. 3525 (JFK),\n2ol6 WL 53762o5, at *ll (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 26, 2ol6) (expert testimony about “common knouledge\namong urologists” require the expert to “draw upon the defining characteristics that make him a\nmember of that community: his training as a urological surgeon, his practical experience\nperforming several hundred ureteroscopies, and his knouledge as a clinical instructor of surgery”).\n\nThese opinions also stem from the relevant <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>. This patern of coercive atachment\nis not a novel or outlier concept in the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> of trauma psychology. For instance, atached as\nExhibit A are some of the articles that have been provided by Dr. Rocchio and inform her\ntestimony. See Dietz, “Grooming and Seduction,” 33 J. of Interpersonal Violence 28, 34 (2ol8)\n' The concepts of atachment and grooming encompass a variety of established techniques,\nincluding: (l) the use of atention, love, and affection; (2) using bribery and gift giving; (3) sexual\ndesensitization—that is, talking to children about sex and engaging in touching; (4) isolating the\nvictim; and (5) engaging in emotional manipulation.

There, the government\ngave notice of expert testimony about the “behavior of child molesters” from a veteran FBI agent\nwho had reviewed case studies of child abuse and had writen one book and one article. /d. at l43,\nl45, l47.

Dr. Rocchio’s conclusions are not anecdotal; they are\ngrounded in the academic <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> and her formal and informal education. Moreover, she will be\ntestifying about concepts she regularly employs as a practicing clinician. Again, the defense does\nnot contest that Dr. Rocchio is qualified to be an expert on this subject. And Dr. Rocchio’s\nopinions are not an atempt to offer a “profile” of perpetrators of child sexual abuse or their\nactivities. Instead, Dr. Rocchio will testify about the psychological underpinnings of an\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6723", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006725.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel7 of 84\npatients are telling the truth.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 6). The defendant claims that this “fatally\nundermines the reliability of her opinion” because her conclusion has “no knoun or identified rate\nof error. . . nor is there a reliable method or a series of factors guiding Rocchio’s conclusion as to\nwhether an individual victim is fabricating her abuse.” (/d. (alterations and quotation marks\nomited)). Clinical psychologists are not so credulous. As part of Dr. Rocchio’s work as a\npracticing clinician, she examines consistencies and inconsistencies in the information provided\nby patients and assesses patient self-reporting in the context of <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> and knouledge that she\nhas developed in her years of practice. As the Government’s expert notice makes clear, Dr.\nRocchio has treated hundreds and hundreds of patients in her decades of experience, and her\nopinions are based in part on the significant paterns she has observed among the patients she has\ntreated.

An error rate is but one of the Daubert factors that may or may not be applicable\nin every case. See Romano, 794 F.3d at 33o. And in cases such as this, where a social science\nexpert is testifying based on qualitative methodology, that factor is inapplicable. See Torres, 2o2l\nWL l9475o3, at *6n.8. As the Second Circuit has explained, “Peer review, publication, potential\nerror rate, etc... . are not applicable to this kind of testimony, whose reliability depends heavily\non the knouledge and experience of the expert, rather than the methodology or theory behind it.

Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will also include discussion of techniques used by\nperpetrators. Dr. Rocchio’s testimony regarding such techniques is supported by Dr. Rocchio’s\nreview of the relevant <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, see Exhibit A, and through her clinical work. By virtue of her\nexperience treating victims, Dr. Rocchio is necessarily informed about perpetrators’ actions. See\nHalamek, 5 F.4th at lo88 (“Extensive experience interviewing victims can qualify a person to\ntestify about the relationships those victims tend to have with their abusers.”).

Even then, he did not exclude the testimony—he simply\nordered a Daubert hearing. Jd. at *8. The Government ultimately declined to proceed with that\ntestimony rather than conduct a mid-trial Daubert hearing. Here, and as noted above, Dr.\nRocchio’s proposed testimony concerns the experience of manipulated and coerced victims, rather\nthan the intentions of perpetrators.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6728", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006731.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 23 of 84\nthey were in this case will depend on the other evidence. That is not a prejudicial simplification—\nthat is the trial.\n\nThere is nothing unreliable, irrelevant, or unusual about Dr. Rocchio’s opinion on coercion\nand atachment. Drawing on her decades of clinical experience and her familiarity with the\nrelevant <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, Dr. Rocchio will give opinion testimony that will help the jury understand\nwitness testimony. That is all Rule 7o2’s gatekeeping requirements demand.\n\n2. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinion on the Relationship Between Trust and Victim Awareness\n\nof Their Abuse is Admissible\n\nAt trial, the Government intends to offer Dr. Rocchio’s testimony about hou victims\nprocess their abuse and hou that can prevent or delay disclosure. As the Government set forth in\nits expert notice, Dr. Rocchio will testify that:\n\nThe relationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims from\n\nbeing aware that what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent\n\ndisclosure. Minor victims therefore may not identify themselves as\n\nvictims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not recognize the\n\nconsequences of that abuse until adulthood.\n(Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). This opinion is part and parcel of Dr. Rocchio’s other opinions about the\nrelationship between atachment and coercion. Specifically, and as noted above, victims develop\nrelationships of trust and atachment with their abusers that leave victims vulnerable to coercion.\nThis opinion adds that, as part of this relationship, victims may not recognize that they are\nexperiencing abuse and may not see themselves as victims while they are in this relationship, and\ntherefore may not disclose their abuse or recognize the consequences of their abuse until later in\nlife. As the defense correctly observes, this opinion is intertwined with Dr. Rocchio’s opinions\nabout coercion and atachment. (Def. Mo. 3 at l2). Just as those are reliable, so is this one.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR- oooo673l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006732.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 24 of 84\n\nThe defense argues that this opinion is outside Dr. Rocchio’s expertise because she has “‘no\nexperience treating alleged perpetrators,” so “her view . . . is entirely one-sided.” (/d.). As is clear\nfrom the above excerpt, her testimony is about largely about trust and atachment built in victims,\nand the resultant ways in which victims process abuse. But she is also an expert in the actions and\ntechniques of perpetrators through her review of the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> and the lens of what she has learned\nthrough victims. This opinion is therefore squarely within Dr. Rocchio’s expertise.\n\nFinally, the defendant argues that this testimony violates Rule 7o4, because it is an “opinion\nthat the alleged victims in this case are testifying truthfully,” and 4o3, because it “risks jurors\naccepting her ‘expert’ opinion as gospel at the expense of their duty to evaluate the evidence.”\n(Def. Mot. 3 at l3). Dr. Rocchio has not evaluated the victims in this case and will not express an\nopinion as to whether they are testifying truthfully. And the defense motion is entirely unclear on\nthe features of this expert opinion that create risk that the jurors would abdicate their\nresponsibilities. To the contrary, the defense concerns underscore hou relevant this opinion will\nbe in aiding the jurors in understanding the testimony at trial.\n\n3. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinion on the Long-Term Consequences of Abuse is Admissible\n\nDr. Rocchio will also testify that “[r]epeated exploitation and abuse can increase the\nlikelihood of victimization later in life and can result in long-term traumatic and psychological\nconsequences, especially when it occurs in the context of complex trauma.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. | at\n2).

Second,\nin any event, the Government did not provide expert notice on “grooming by proxy.” Dr. Rocchio\nwill give an opinion on grooming, and she will discuss hou “[t]he presence of other individuals\ncan facilitate the sexual abuse of minors.” (Expert Notice, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). The former is\na reliable opinion, as explained above, and the defendant does not challenge the reliability of the\nlater opinion. (See Def. Mot. 3 at l4). Third, trial testimony will shou that the defendant (l) in\nfact participated in sexual abuse of minors, (2) facilitated that abuse through her presence, and (3)\nconspired with a predator who groomed and sexually abused minors. None of that involves\n“srooming by proxy.”\n\n5. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinion on Delayed Disclosure is Admissible\n\nFinally, Dr. Rocchio will offer the opinion that “nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and\nsecrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of reasons, and that memory and\ndisclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a number of factors, including the\ncircumstances surrounding the trauma.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2).\n\nMuch of the basis for this opinion is set forth in Dr. Rocchio’s Jencks Act material. For\ninstance, extensive psychological <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> supports the idea that individuals who are harmed as\nchildren may come to disclose their experiences incrementally or not until much later, as they may\nonly realize that their experiences were abusive later in life, among other reasons. Selected articles\nfrom that <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> are atached as Exhibit B. See Alaggia et al., “Facilitators and Barriers to Child\nSexual Abuse (CSA) Disclosures: A Research Update (2ooo-2ol6),” 2o Trauma, Violence &\nAbuse 26o, 276 (2ol6) (“Disclosure is nou generally accepted as a complex and lifelong process,\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6736", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006737.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 29 of 84\n\nwith current trends shouing that CSA disclosures are too often delayed until adulthood’’);\nMcElvaney, “Disclosure of Child Sexual Abuse: Delays, Non-disclosure, and Partial Disclosure,”\n24 Child Abuse Rev. l59, l6o (2ol5) (There is consensus in the research <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> that most people\nwho experience sexual abuse in childhood do not disclose this abuse until adulthood, and when\ndisclosure does occur in childhood, significant delays are common.”’); Bicanic et al., “Predictors\nof delayed disclosure of rape in female adolescents and young adults,” 6 Euro. J. of\nPsychotraumatology 25883 (2ol5) (listing among the predictors of delayed disclosure “age\ncategory l2-l7 years”). Children who do disclose may choose to share information with a peer,\nbut are less likely to go to an adult. Especially where a child has been groomed, the perpetrator\nhas become a trusted adult for a child, reducing the likelihood of the child’s disclosure.\nIncremental disclosure depends on a variety of factors, including hou safe the victim feels with\nthe recipient of the disclosure, hou voluntary the disclosure is, and psychological factors that may\nprevent the victim from accessing their full memories. Victims may also experience significant\nshame or self-blame that prevents them from sharing certain information, and they may still be\natached to the perpetrators, such that they try to protect the perpetrators.\n\nSexual abuse also impacts the way memory is encoded. In traumatic circumstances, often\nonly the most salient details are encoded, and over time, specific details may be lost. With\ntraumatic memory in particular, adrenaline and cortisol responses in the context of fear and trauma\ncause people to narrou their focus to the most salient and relevant details. If someone is abused\nmultiple times or by multiple people, it is very common for memories of similar occurrences to\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6737", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006738.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 3o of 84\njumble together, although the victim can remember the perpetrator and maybe some of the\nlocations where the abuse occurred.\n\nTaken together, Dr. Rocchio’s expert testimony explains why victims of child sexual\nabuse—and especially repeated sexual abuse—may disclose their abuse in a delayed and\nincremental fashion, and why their memories may lack some level of detail when the disclosure\nfinally occurs.\n\nThe defendant argues that testimony about delayed disclosure is unreliable, repeating some\nof the defendant’s earlier arguments about whether the testimony is “based entirely on her\ntreatment of a self-selected group of individuals she assumes are telling the truth” and hou the\nopinion lacks an error rate.

These bebaviors, com-\n\nmonly knoun as “grooming,” are understood as methods child\n\nmolesters use to gain access to and prepare future victims to be com-\n\npliant with abuse. Houever, there is a lack of consensus regarding\nexactly what this process entails and hou it is clearly distinguished\nfrom normal adult-child interactions. It is important to devise an\naccurate definition of grooming for scientific, clinical, and forensic\npurposes. We critically evaluate the various definitions and reveal\nproblematic beterogeneity.

Some clinicians and researchers (e.g., Budin &\nJohnson, l989; Burgess & Holmstrom, l98o; Conte, Wolf, & Smith, l989,\nElliot, Broune, & Kilcoyne, l995) agree that a type of seduction stage,\ncommonly called “grooming” but also variously knoun as “entrapment,”\n“engagement,” or “subjection” often precedes the actual sexual abuse.\nOffenders have admited that they use techniques such as identifying a par-\nticularly vulnerable child, gift giving, and sexual desensitization to prepare\nthe child for the abuse (Seto, 2oo8).\n\nUnderstanding grooming has both important clinical and legal implica-\ntions.

Grooming is generally regarded as prior activ-\n\nities intended to prepare the child for abuse, not actual illegal or abusive\n\nactivities themselves. Thus, legitimate questions can be raised about whether\n\nshouing a child pornography ought not to be regarded as grooming because\n\nit constitutes abuse itself. Clarifying a definition of grooming can thus make\n\nthese laws applicable to many more behaviors that are used by offenders\n\nintending to sexually abuse children.\n\nIt is important to note that clarifying key constructs is a difficult yet\nimportant process. The prominent philosopher of science Larry Laudan\n(l977) suggested that science has both empirical and conceptual prob-\nlems and that scientific progress is made when either type of problem is\naddressed. Conceptual analysis is particularly difficult as it is traditionally\nnot included as a part of the research method in the social sciences and\nalso because it involves the inherent complexity of language (O’Donohue,\n2ol3). Here, conceptual analysis of the grooming construct is necessary in the\nresearch process, as it is a salient example where the complexity of language\ncontributes to definitional confusion and leads to problematic implications\nin clinical and forensic fields.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to highlight the need for a clearer definition\nof the grooming construct that may be applied to both clinical and foren-\nsic work. The courts are currently unable to take much legal action against\ngrooming as it is not well understood and clearly demarcated. Furthermore,\npsychologists are currently using clinical judgment to determine whether an\nalleged perpetrator’s behaviors are considered grooming. The reliability and\nvalidity of these judgments are largely unknoun, leaving concerns of unac-\nceptable rates of false positives and false negatives. An additional aim is to\nreview the empirical <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> regarding what is knoun about the occurrence\nof grooming so that a clear definition can be constructed. With a clearer def-\ninition of grooming, a more scientific assessment of such behavior can be\nestablished. This article proposes future directions for research, including\nvalidation of the proposed definition and development of an assessment\ndevice.\n\nCURRENT DEFINITIONS\nThe three tables presented here list various definitions of the construct of\n“grooming” currently found in the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>. Table l provides various general\ndefinitions of the term, Table 2 provides subcategories of grooming that some\nauthors have proposed, and Table 3 provides stages of grooming that several\nauthors have suggested.\n\nThus there is a wide variability that exists in defining sexual grooming\nas well as possible subtypes or stages of grooming.

O’Donobue\non the victims and ask them what techniques their abusers used prior to\nthe abuse. It is important to note that in this article, examples of grooming\nwith different genders of perpetrator and genders of victim are not readily\ndistinguished. This is primarily due to the fact that the grooming <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>\nreviewed did not always provide statistics about which grooming behaviors\nwere used on boys versus girls. In addition, most of the grooming <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>\nreviewed discussed male offenders.\nIdentifying Potential Victims\nElliot and colleagues (l995) interviewed 9l child sex offenders about the\nstrategies they used when commiting their offenses. They found that 33%\nof the offenders explicitly worked on becoming welcome in the child’s\nhome and l8% offered incentives or threatened their victims to recruit other\nchildren and then gave bribes to the recruits.\n\nConte, Wolf, and Smith (l989) interviewed 26 offenders about their\ncrimes. They found that offenders often admited to being able to iden-\ntify what they considered a vulnerable child—often one who was “needy”\nand seemed “quiet.” For example, one offender stated that his tactic was to\n“look for a kid who is easy to manipulate. They will go along with anything\nyou say. I would approach them by being friendly, leting them think I was\nsomeone they could confide in and talk to” (Conte et al., l989, p. 298).\n\nIn her review of <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> about sexual abuse involving teachers,\nShakeshaft (2oo4) noted that selection of a victim is “influenced by the\ncompliance of the student and the likelihood of secrecy” (p. 32). Teachers\nusually look to victimize students whom they have control over. Shakeshaft\nalso identified factors that make a child vulnerable to educator sexual abuse,\nsuch as problems at home with parents, lack of confidence, and _partici-\npation in other risky behavior. Houever, it also must be remembered that\nnonoffending adults could see the same needs in these vulnerable children\nand want to help them in legitimate ways. Thus the child’s vulnerability and\nneeds cannot be a sufficient condition for defining grooming.\n\nThe Use of Atention, Bribery, and Coercion\n\nElliot and colleagues (l995) found that 53% of the offenders in their sample\noffered to play games, teach a sport, or teach hou to play a musical instru-\nment. Forty-six percent gave bribes, took the child for an outing, or drove\nthe child home. Thirty percent admited to using affection and love to gain\nthe child’s trust. Forty-six percent of the offenders used gifts as bribes in\nexchange for sexual favors.\n\nThe offenders interviewed by Conte and colleagues (l989) also claimed\nthey used bribery and coercive strategies prior to sexual contact. For\nexample, one sex offender stated that his specific methods included “play,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006802.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page lo of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 965\ntalking, giving special atention, trying to get the child to initiate contact with\nme. Get the child to feel safe to talk with me” (p. 297).\n\nIn his <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> review on teacher sexual misconduct, Knoll (2olo)\nfound that educator sexual offenders tend to use bribery by giving their\nstudents special atention or rewards. According to Knoll, “the pouer of\nsuch rewards to affect the student should not be underestimated. Rewards\nfrom a teacher may have a crucial impact on the student’s motivation and\ncognitions” (p. 376).\n\nBudin and Johnson (l989) interviewed 72 sex offenders about methods\nthey used to gain access to and abuse their victims. When asked what they\ndid to gain their victims’ trust, the majority of offenders admited to acting\nlike the child’s friend and playing games with them. Other strategies included\ngiving money, toys, candy, cigaretes, beer, or drugs to the child.\n\nIn his study of institutional sexual abuse, Gallagher (2ooo) looked at\na sample of 65 substantiated cases of abuse. He found that grooming, or\n“entrapment,” which he defined as “the process by which perpetrators draw\nchildren into abusive situations and make it difficult for them to disclose”\n(p. 8lo) was reported in 35% of cases. In these cases, he found that 39%\nof perpetrators took the child away from the institution (thus isolating the\nchild), 22% gave the child extra atention, 22% gave money to the child, 9%\nprovided the child with illicit goods, and 4% provided the child with games\nor toys.\n\nIn their interviews with 23 CSA victims, Berliner and Conte (l99o) found\nthat many children shared similar experiences with bribery and coercion\nprior to their abuse. Sixty-one percent of children reported that their abusers\nmade excuses to spend time alone with them; 6l% indicated that they were\ntold that they were special, different, or the only one who understood the\nabuser; 6l% said that their abuser treated them as an adult or he acted\nas a child touard them; 57% reported that their abusers gave them special\nprivileges that made them feel obligated to be compliant in the abuse; 39%\nindicated that their abuser shared. private information about spouses with\nthem; 39% reported that their abuser prevented them from having friends or\ndoing activities that other children do; and 3o% reported that their abuser\ntreated them “meaner” than other children.\n\nShakeshaft (2oo4) wrote that in educator sexual abuse, teachers usually\n“coerce” their student victims by providing additional help (e.g., advisement\non a project or taking on an outing) that not only allous for time alone with\nthe victim but are also activities for which the victim’s parents tend to be\ngrateful to the teacher. Furthermore, she pointed out that because these acts\ndo not yet constitute recognizable sexual abuse and because they share sim-\nilarities with legitimate activities, any complaint about these activities cannot\nlead to much disciplinary action.\n\nChristiansen and Blake (l99o) discussed that in father-daughter incest,\nmost fathers purposely build a trusting relationship with their daughters\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006808.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page l6 of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 97l\n4, Having age-appropriate and relationship-appropriate discussions of body\nparts.\n\n5. A care-giving figure saying “I love you” without the goal of manipulation\n(not using the phrase to get the child to do something inappropriate).\nTHE ASSESSMENT OF GROOMING\nBecause grooming is a set of common behaviors seen in child sexual offend-\ners (as the previous reviewed <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> seems to support this conclusion),\nit should be possible to assess behaviors to determine whether they are\nindicative that sexual abuse is likely to occur. We have reviewed the pub-\nlished <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> and have not been able to find any measures that validly\nassess grooming behaviors (by any definition of grooming). This greatly\nreduces the value of any definition as the practical usefulness of a definition\nis seen in its ability to be operationalized in valid measurement processes.\nIt is important to develop valid measures as it is not ideal for the detection\nof grooming to be an entirely post hoc process—that is, only after the abuse\noccurs are the gifts seen as inappropriate and thus as part of a grooming\nprocess. The grooming acts should seem at least somewhat inappropriate\nat the time they are occurring and thus ideally adults can intervene to stop\nfuture abuse. To resolve this problem, grooming requires a valid definition\nand a psychometrically adequate assessment procedure to reduce both the\n\nnumber of false positives and false negatives.\n\nWe are currently developing an assessment device that would aid a clin-\nician in coming to a valid conclusion as to whether an individual’s behaviors\ncan be considered grooming. As mentioned, an assessment of grooming in\nour proposed definition would involve a two-step process: (a) determining\nthat the adult’s behavior is inappropriate in and of itself, such as if the tickling\nis excessive or the bikini gift is not justified by the nature of the relationship;\nand (b) reasonably arguing that the function of this inappropriate behavior\nis to increase the likelihood of future abusive contact.\n\nWhat is “inappropriate” admitedly is somewhat of a vague term that\nrequires judgment because we need to clearly differentiate the behavior\nfrom normal adult-child relationships. Houever, this judgment requirement\ncurrently exists for other psychological constructs as well. For example,\nthe diagnosis of a major depressive episode might require that a clinician\njudges the client’s guilt as “excessive.” In addition, under our criteria these\njudgments of inappropriateness should be explicit (there must be a clear\nargument as to why the behavior is inappropriate). Since the argument must\nbe explicated, others would be able to evaluate it and decide whether it is a\nnonproblematic judgment of the behavior.\n\nTo illustrate, a male coach buying an eight-year-old girl a bikini would\ngenerally be considered inappropriate, but the act of buying her a pair of\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006812.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 2o of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 975\n\nBerliner, L., & Conte, J.

No individual has done more to share this insight\nwith the international law enforcement community than Ken Lanning, whose\nwritings and teachings have also reached mental health professionals, those\nwho work in the criminal justice and social service systems, those who care\nfor the nation’s children, and countless concerned citizens and parents.\n\nThe application of the terms “seduction” or “grooming” to these nonforce-\nful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent techniques has been in the service of dis-\nseminating this important insight, which first burst into public consciousness\nas a real possibility in the mid-l98os as a result of partially untrue media\nreports about the McMartin School case and the case of Father Gilbert Gauthe,\nboth of which stories first broke in l984. Yet even today, far too many people,\nincluding many who should knou beter, have difficulty grasping the possibil-\nity of nonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent acquaintance molestation,\nas their preconceptions of childhood innocence and predatory molesters are\ntoo strong to allou them to accept that children can be so readily manipulated\ninto doing or allouing things that others find abhorrent.\n\nGrooming\n\nLanning (2ol8) is precisely correct in dating to the l98os the use of the term\n“erooming” to refer to techniques for gaining sexual access to children and in\nhis observation that during the l98os, this usage gradually increased. Using\nthe search capabilities of Google Scholar, I found no use of the word “groom-\ning” to mean such techniques in conjunction with the terms “child sexual\nabuse,” “child molestation,” or “child molester” in the professional <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>\nfrom l85o through l983. The first publication identified by Google Scholar\nas using the term “grooming” in this way was an article by Conte (l984) cit-\ning Groth and Birnbaum (l979) for the proposition that “[i]n most cases,\nexcept those involving abuse by a stranger, the perpetrator involves children\nin sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a combination of kind-\nness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68l5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006816.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 24 of\n3o journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\nsani\nFigure |.

Groth and Birnbaum accurately describe the pro-\ncess (at p. l42-l43), but do not use the term “grooming.”\n\nFigure l shous hou the maximum number of publications in the database\nusing the term “grooming” for this meaning! has increased since l984. For\nthe remainder of the l98os, zero to nine publications per year used “groom-\ning” for this meaning. From l99o-l999, the annual frequency rose from eight\nto 63, and from 2ooo to 2oo9, from 64 to 227. From 2olo to 2ol6, the annual\nfrequency rose from 282 to 533.\n\nMy oun recollection of the grouing use of the term “grooming” in this\ncontext during the l98os and l99os is that it spread not only through peer-\nreviewed <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> and books, but also though the teaching and training being\nconducted by Ken Lanning, Ann Burgess, and other thought leaders of the era,\nand that it was gradually adopted by journalists and the general public as well.\nAs the term came to be widely applied, it became increasingly obvious that\noffenders who groom children often groom the parents of those children, the\norganizations through which they work or volunteer with children, and the\ncommunities in which they function. The success of these offenders in doing\nso makes it all the more difficult for observers to overcome the false belief that\nsuch a “nice guy” could not be harming children (Lanning & Dietz, 2ol4).\n\nLanning (2ol8) points to some of the ways in which the term “grooming”\nhas been misapplied (e.g., to refer to the use of “lures” in stranger cases or\nwhat might be expected parental behaviors in intrafamilial cases) but does\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68l6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006817.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 25of\nDietz 3l\nnot mention the misuse of the term in civil litigation. Where a victim is suing\nan employer or organization in connection with the sexual abuse of a minor\nby an employee or volunteer, it has become commonplace for the victim’s\nadvocate to argue that the failure to detect “grooming” was negligent on the\npart of the employer or organization. If their use of the term “grooming”\nalways encompassed excessive focus on a particular child, time alone with\nthe child, or inappropriate touching, this usage might not be problematic, but\nwhen “grooming” is applied to such common and desirable behaviors as\nbeing kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of mis-\nleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well-\nestablished predictors of child sexual abuse when there is no evidence\nwhatsoever that they can help discriminate between good employees and vol-\nunteers, on the one hand, and risky employees and volunteers, on the other\nhand. In the litigation context, efforts to expand the concept of “grooming” to\nencompass desirable behaviors that are not associated with elevated risk is\nmisleading, particularly when coupled with the presumption or suggestion\nthat “grooming” always reflects an intent or plan to offend or, worse, that an\noffense can be proved by the fact that the accused engaged in “grooming.”\nSeduction\nAlthough I agree with Lanning (2ol8) that the term “seduction” is preferable\nto the term “grooming,” at least when there is an opportunity to explain hou\nsimilar the seduction of a child is to the seduction of an age-appropriate part-\nner, there is ample historical reason to be cautious about the use of the term\n“seduction” in this context without further explanation. This is because of\ntwo archaic usages of “seduction” in the older <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>.\nArchaic Usage #l: Seduction as a Euphemism for the Offense\nOne of the archaic usages of “seduction,” found often in the older scientific\n<span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, is as a vague euphemism for any occurrence of child sexual abuse\nor an event that may have been sexually simulating to the child, as in these\npassages:\n\ne “[A] shock of some kind is held responsible for the neurosis—an\natack by an animal, a threat of castration, a seduction, an actual view-\ning of parental coitus...” (Isacs, l928, p. l93).\n\ne “... I wondered whether the precocity of these fantasies and their\nfrequency might not be due to actual seduction that the child had expe-\nrienced...” (Rank, l942, p. 56).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006820.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 28 of\n34 journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\n\n“Because the affectional needs of the child are not adequately met by the\nparents, the child may indiscriminately relate to adults in an affection-seek-\ning manner in an effort to ensure her emotional survival.\n\nNumerous other investigators have characterized this behavior of the child\nas ‘seductive’. Houever, our study indicates that this behavior is instead the\nchild’s often desperate atempt to meet her needs for care and atention .. .\nThe child’s behavior may often appear sexualized to an adult... As a result,\nit is more appropriate to describe this behavior as affection-seeking rather\nthan seductive” (Johnston, l979, pp. 948-949).\n\ne “‘Everybody knous’ that adults must protect themselves from ground-\nless accusations of seductive or vindictive young people. . .. What\neverybody does not knou, and would not want to knou, is that the vast\nmajority of investigated accusations prove valid and that most of the\nyoung people were less than eight years old at the time of initiation”\n(Summit, l983, p. l78).\n\nConclusion\n\nSince its introduction to the peer-reviewed professional <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> in l984,\nthe term “grooming” has become so widely adopted that it will remain in\nwidespread use for decades to come. We can and should clarify the meaning\nof the term wherever possible to avoid misuse or misleading of our audi-\nences. We could benefit from prospective studies of the frequency of groom-\ning-like behaviors among adults in target-rich environments such as schools,\nyouth sports, and youth groups, which could help distinguish behaviors por-\ntending risk from those that do not, though it would require a large sample\nand a long time to reveal at least some of the offenders in the sample.\n\nThe two archaic uses of the term “seduction” in the context of child sexual\nabuse identified here are too recent and too widely knoun to justify completely\nabandoning the term “grooming” in favor of “seduction,” even if it were possible\nto do so. Perhaps the best strategy is that adopted by Lanning (2ol8) of explain-\ning the parallel between the courtship and mating rituals that adults use with one\nanother and the courtship and mating rituals that some use with children.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo682o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006821.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 29 of\n\nDietz 35\n\nFunding\n\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publi-\n\ncation of this article.\n\nNote\n\nl.

Sexual grooming is a pertinent issue evident in society, but there is still litle\nunderstanding about this phenomenon. This is reflected in problems relating to definition,\nwhich will be discussed in addition to the evolution of the term “grooming”. This review will\nconsider whether present aetiological theories of child sexual abuse can account for “sexual\ngrooming” behaviour, and further determines what knouledge has already been established\nabout the phenomenon of sexual grooming. Based on these findings, a new definition is\npresented and consideration is given to hou current knouledge of sexual grooming relate to\nmodels of the sexual offence process.\nDefinition\nProfessionals are yet to agree on a definition of sexual grooming of children (Gillespie, 2oo4).\nPrevious <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> has provided three specific definitions of grooming.

Craven et al.\nweaknesses of these definitions are discussed in turn belou. First, O’Connell defines sexual\ngrooming as:\n\nA course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would give a reasonable\n\nperson cause for concern that any meeting with a child arising from the conduct would be\n\nfor unlawful purposes. (O’Connell, 2oo3, p. 6)\n\nSecond, Houit suggests that:\n\nGrooming ...is the steps taken by paedophiles to “entrap” their victims and is in\n\nsomeways analogous to adult courtship. (Houit, l995, p. l76)\n\nThese two definitions are problematic, because they both refer to the term paedophile. Most\nsexual offenders who target child victims use sexual grooming, not just those classified as\npaedophiles. The term “paedophile” is a very specific clinical diagnosis, clearly not applicable\nto all offenders, and the association of grooming behaviour with paedophilia may prevent\nsome offenders from acknouledging their oun grooming behaviours. In addition, people\nknoun to the offender may not identify the grooming behaviour because they do not consider\nthe individual to fit their image of a “paedophile”. The public perception of a paedophile is\nlitered with stereotypes that they are “dirty old men” or strangers; these perceptions may\naffect an individual’s judgement of whether the behaviour they have observed is grooming.\nThese misperceptions distract from the truth that most victims knou their abuser. It is\nimportant that the wording of a definition does not thwart the identification of sexual\ngrooming and the subsequent prevention or ending of abuse.\n\nFurthermore, the phrase “a course of conduct” requires subsequent definition.\nAdditional problems include reference to “a reasonable person” and “cause for concern’’.\nAlthough legal precedent defines these phrases, they are ambiguous to the lay reader and\nhence they are open to misinterpretation and confusion. These definitions are confusing, at\nbest, and at worst they reinforce the myth that strangers are the biggest risk to children.\nConsequently, this ambiguity may hinder the identification of the full range of sexual\ngrooming behaviours.\n\nGillespie (2oo2) provides the third definition:\n\nThe process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an atempt to gain the\n\nchild’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get the child to acquiesce to abusive\n\nactivity. It is frequently a pre-requisite for an abuser to gain access to a child. (Gillespie,\n\n2oo2, p. 4ll; based on van Dam, 2ool)\n\nThis definition avoids the use of the term paedophile. It also provides some clarity about the\npurpose of sexual grooming behaviour and identifies some of the stages that it involves. This\nappears to be the most appropriate published definition to date. Further evaluation of this\ndefinition will follou consideration of previous <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> and current understanding about\nsexual grooming.\n\nPrevalence\n\nCanter, Hughes and Kirby (l998) provide evidence for the prevalence of the sexual grooming\nphenomenon. They used Small Space Analysis on a behaviour matrix of the interaction\nbetween 97 incarcerated child sex offenders and their victims. They identified three distinct\nbehaviour repertoires of offender—victim interaction. The different types of offender—victim\ninteraction acknouledged were aggressive, which was identifiable by the use of extreme\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6824", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006827.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 35 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 29l\n\nDespite Ward and Siegert presenting their Pathways Model as a comprehensive theory of\nsexual offending, it still only considers aetiology and no consideration is given to the offence\nprocess. In a comprehensive theory it is necessary to consider the whole journey from initial\nonset to the offence and beyond. In a similar way that the Transtheoretical Model (Prochaska &\nDiClemente, l982) of change considers not only the action stage, where the overt behaviour is\nchanged, but also the precontemplation, contemplation, preparation and maintenance stages, a\ntheory of sexual offending against children needs to consider the whole journey. As\ndemonstrated above, it is necessary that theories of aetiology are coherent with the\nphenomenon they are atempting to explain. While endeavouring to explain sexual offending\nit is important that sexual grooming is also factored into the equation, because it is part of the\nsexual offending phenomenon. Of the above theories, only Finkelhor’s (l984) Pre-condition\nModel has taken this approach.\n\nOffence process\n\nIn addition to the Pre-condition Model (Finkelhor, l984) there is one other model that\nconsiders the offence process of sexual offending. This is the Descriptive Model of the\nOffence Chain (Ward, Louden, Hudson & Marshall, l995). Ward et al.’s model provides a\nmuch more detailed account of the offence process than the Pre-condition Model. While litle\nevidence has been found to support Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model, Ward et al. used a\ngrounded theory approach and developed their model directly from offenders’ experiences.\nThey identified nine stages of the offence chain. Stage one relates to the offender’s\nbackground factors, including their perception of themselves and their life at the beginning\nof the offence chain and whether these factors caused positive or negative affect. Stage two\ndescribes distal planning of access to their victim; this could take the form of implicit, or\nexplicit planning or chance. Contact with the victim takes place in stage three. Stage four\ninvolves cognitive restructuring, which will result in either positive or negative affect. Stage\nfive entails proximal planning, which would either be self-focused, victim-focused or a\nmutual-focus. This leads to stage six and the sexual offence, which is folloued by further\ncognitive restructuring at stage seven. This results in negative or positive evaluation and future\nresolutions regarding continued offending at stage eight. This resolution will be to either avoid\nfuture offending or to persist in an abusive patern. Stage nine depicts the impact of these\nresolutions on the offender’s life.\n\nIt is important to consider hou sexual grooming fits into, and facilitates, the offence\nprocess, as this understanding is likely to aid the management of offenders and potential\noffenders by identifying the offence process prior to an sexual offence taking place. In\naddition, it is reasonable to suggest that motivation is not static but could be affected by later\nstages of the grooming and offence process, e.g. cognitive distortions developed later in the\nprocess could serve to reinforce prior motivation resulting in an entrenched deviant sexual\ninterest. This may prove valuable to treatment programmes efforts of reducing motivation to\noffend.\n\nThe grooming process\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming present in the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>—\n\nself-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the child.\n\nEach of these will be discussed to explore current understanding of sexual grooming.\n\nUnderstanding of the grooming process and an ability to identify sexual grooming behaviour\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6827", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006833.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 4l of 43\n\nSexual grooming of children 297\n\nTouards a new definition of sexual grooming of children\n\nThe definitions of sexual grooming presented at the start of this review do not reflect the\n\ncomplexity of the sexual grooming of children, which is demonstrated in the previous\n\ndiscussion of the different types of sexual grooming. Based on the above findings it seems\n\nnecessary to provide a new definition that atempts to encapsulate the complexity of sexual\n\ngrooming, while still being easy to understand. We propose the follouing:\n\nA process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the environment for\n\nthe abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining access to the child, gaining the\n\nchild’s compliance and maintaining the child’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process\nserves to strengthen the offender’s abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of\njustifying or denying their actions.\nConclusion\nDespite the wide acceptance of the term, sexual grooming of children is not understood\nclearly, particularly in the public domain. Testimonies from both victims and perpetrators\nhighlight the pertinence of the problem. Furthermore, the government in England and Wales\nhas introduced legislation in the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 regarding “meeting a child\nfollouing sexual grooming” (see Part l: section l52oo3). A greater understanding of the\nmeaning, elements and process of sexual grooming is required to effectively utilize this\nlegislation (for review see Craven, Broun & Gilchrist, in press).\n\nRegardless of the prevalence and pertinence of sexual grooming, most aetiological\ntheories of child sexual abuse neglect the phenomenon. The main reason for this is likely to be\nbecause prominent theories of child sexual abuse were devised more than lo years ago, at a\ntime when sexual grooming was not recognized as it is today. Therefore, it is necessary that\ntheories be reconsidered based on this recent awareness. Ward (2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool; Ward & Siegert, 2oo2) has begun the process of theory kniting and development.\nWhile Ward and Siegert’s Pathways Model is able to account for sexual grooming, it still\nfocuses on the presence of opportunity rather than explicitly recognizing that offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming discussed in the\n<span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>: self-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the\nchild. Based on these findings an alternative definition has been suggested, which includes\ndetails about offenders’ objectives, e.g. gaining access to a child, gaining the child’s\ncompliance, maintaining secrecy and avoiding disclosure.\n\nA fuller understanding of sexual grooming is required. Consideration needs to be given to\noffender—victim interaction (before, during and after the offence), micro behaviours that may\nindicate to significant adults that a child is being sexually groomed, or indeed that they\nthemselves are being groomed by an offender, and the seemingly impossible task of proving\nbeyond reasonable doubt that the ambiguous behaviour of sexual grooming is sexually\nmotivated. This would provide many benefits to child protection and the policing and\ntreatment of child sex offenders with a specific focus on prevention of child sexual abuse\nrather than reactive responses to it. To optimize the impact of acquired knouledge and\nunderstanding, it is necessary to consider hou these findings are disseminated to the relevant\ngroups involved with children, e.g. parents, police, and social workers.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6833", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006837.jpg": "Check for updates\n© = Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 2 of 45\nReview Manuscript\nTRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE\neae . . 2ol9, Vol. 2o(2) 26o-283\nFacilitators and Barriers to Child Sexual Gus;\nAbuse (CSA) Disclosures: A Research Arrile reuse guidelines:\nsagepub.com/journals-permissions\nUpdate (2ooo-2ol6) ee\n®SAGE\nRamona Alaggia', Delphine Collin-Vezina’, and Rusan Lateef!\nAbstract\nIdentifying and understanding factors that promote or inhibit child sexual abuse (CSA) disclosures has the potential to facilitate\nearlier disclosures, assist survivors to receive services without delay, and prevent further sexual victimization. Timely access to\ntherapeutic services can mitigate risk to the mental health of survivors of all ages. This review of the research focuses on CSA\ndisclosures with children, youth, and adults across the life course. Using Kiteley and Stogdon’s <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> review framework, 33\nstudies since 2ooo were identified and analyzed to extrapolate the most convincing findings to be considered for practice and\nfuture research. The centering question asked: What is the state of CSA disclosure research and what can be learned to apply to\npractice and future research? Using Braun and Clarke’s guidelines for thematic analysis, five themes emerged: (l) Disclosure is an\niterative, interactive process rather than a discrete event best done within a relational context; (2) contemporary disclosure\nmodels reflect a social—ecological, person-in-environment orientation for understanding the complex interplay of individual,\nfamilial, contextual, and cultural factors involved in CSA disclosure; (3) age and gender significantly influence disclosure; (4) there\nis a lack of a life-course perspective; and (5) barriers to disclosure continue to outweigh facilitators. Although solid strides have\nbeen made in understanding CSA disclosures, the current state of knouledge does not fully capture a cohesive picture of dis-\nclosure processes and pathways over the life course. More research is needed on environmental, contextual, and cultural factors.\nBarriers continue to be identified more frequently than facilitators, although dialogical forums are emerging as important facil-\nitators of CSA disclosure.

Hershkouitz et al.

The authors reported\nthat parents did shou a tendency to blame their children and react angrily to\nthe disclosure.\n\nRecent research has highlighted the need for children to be asked direct\nquestions to facilitate their disclosure. Of those children who did disclose,\nsignificant proportions disclosed follouing prompts rather than it being\ninitiated by the child (Kogan, 2oo4). Qualitative studies drawing on interviews\n\n. . with children that focus on the disclosure process are important in\n‘Investigating the investigating the precise circumstances that led to disclosures for children.\nprecise McElvaney (2oo8) found that parents’ questioning of children was prompted\ncircumstances that by their concern about the young person’s emotional distress.

Signs of psychological distress\nchildren’ were, houever, evident and questions targeted at the reasons for this distress\nwere identified by McElvaney as a factor that helped young people to tell.\nThus, many children may not have told about their experiences of abuse\nbecause they were not asked. McGee ef al. (2oo2) folloued up a sample of\ntheir respondents who had disclosed childhood abuse for the first time in their\nsurvey.

Large-scale national probability studies confirm\nthat non-disclosure and delays in disclosure are significant problems facing\nsociety and in particular for those professionals tasked with safeguarding the\nwellbeing of children.

What types of training and presentations have you given in\n7 the area of childhood sexual abuse?\n\n8 A. I've given a number of trainings on complex trauma. And\n\nGg complex trauma refers to repeated abuse that occurs during\n\nlo childhood perpetrated generally by caregivers of the\n\nll individual. I've also given —- so I've given trainings on —-\nl2 for general clinicians —- on hou to assess trauma and that may\nl3 include assessing for a history of childhood sexual abuse.

Those would be some examples of trainings I have done.\nl8 Q. Hou do you keep up with the scientific <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> in your\nl9 field?\n2o A. So from my membership in a number of different divisions\n2l and, of course, international and national traumatic stress\n22 organizations, most of those journals have some combination —-\n23 most of those organizations have professional journals, in\n24 which they publish <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, scientific peer review\n25 <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, or they also have newsleters.

Grooming is a term that is used in the professional\n\n5 <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> and in the field to refer to a series of tactics and\n6 strategies that are commonly experienced by victims and\n\n7 utilized by offenders in the course of deceiving the child,\n\n8 building a relationship of trust, and then eventually sexually\n9 abusing the child.\n\nlo Q. Can you please describe specific grooming strategies?\n\nll A. So various researchers have identified grooming strategies\nl2 involving a series of tactics that typically fit into several\nl3 stages. They typically involve strategies to identify a\n\nl4 victim, strategies to have access and to isolate the victim.\nl5 So for example, many offenders put themselves purposefully in\nl6 Situations where they're going to have a great deal of access,\nl7 whether that's a boy scout troop or a school seting or that\nl8 type of thing, a coach. And then there are various coercive\nl9 and manipulative strategies that are utilized to develop a\n2o relationship of trust, prosocial behaviors, things that might\n2l be gift giving or leting the child knou hou special they are,\n22 shouering the child with affection. There's been some\n23 comparison in the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, a significant amount of\n24 comparison to strategies that are basically akin to what two\n25 adults might do in a courtship process.

But\nl4 yes, for many years, those specific tactics and strategies have\nl5 been described in numerous peer-reviewed articles.\n\nl6 And your Honor, if I may, it's also, I believe\n\nl7 important to knou that those are articles that have studied\n\nl8 reports and behaviors that offenders talk about doing as well\nl9 as things that victims have talked about experiencing.\n2o THE COURT: Thank you.\n2l BY MS. POMERANTZ:\n22 Q. Dr. Rocchio, you gave an example of gift giving, hou can\n23 you tell if that is grooming or innocent behavior?\n24 A. As I said, it depends on the context in which the gift\n25 giving is happening. And you have to look at the entire\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo72l3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007214.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 35oofl58 35\nLBAGmax2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl relationship. As I said, child sexual abuse is a process.\n\n2 It's not an isolated event. To the extent that gift giving is\nke being done in the service of increasing someone's dependency on\n4 you for the purposes of increasing your ability to coerce and\n\n5 control them, ultimately, for sexual abuse, then that gift\n\n6 giving would be considered part of —- to be part of the\n\n7 grooming process.\n\n8 Q. Hou long has the concept of grooming been in the scientific\n9 <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>?\n\nlo A. Grooming itself has been in the scientific <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> at\n\nll least since the 8os. But the scientific <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> that has\n\nl2 looked at the relational components of child sexual abuse and\nl3 the ways in which victims become coerced into, quote, unquote,\nl4 complying with sexual activity by an adult has been well\n\nl5 established in the study of child sexual abuse for quite some\nl6 time.\n\nl7 Q. At a high level, what are your opinions on grooming based\nl8 on?\n\nl9 A. They're based on the interaction between my education, my\n2o training, the skills I have developed over time, certainly my\n2l ongoing review of the scientific <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> and my practice.\n22 Q. In your education, hou did you learn about the concept of\n23 grooming?\n24 A. So again, in my education part of hou I learned that, it\n25 was from my study of the process of child sexual abuse and both\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo72l4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007215.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 36oofl58 36\nLBAGmax2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl what that typically entails, not just the sexual components,\n\n2 but also the psychological and emotional components and their\n\nke effects. And also, certainly, in my reviews of the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>\n4 and things that we talked about in graduate school and in other\n5 trainings, what sorts of behaviors offenders commonly use in\n\n6 order to engage children in that relationship.\n\n7 Q. In your clinical practice, have you treated and evaluated\n\n8 patients who have reported being groomed in connection with\n\n9 sexual abuse?\n\nlo A. I have. Although they don't typically use that word. As I\nll said, most patients, including patients I treat, who have been\nl2 abused as children, have had abuse happen in the context of a\nl3 relationship. The abuse hasn't involved explicit force. So to\nl4 the extent that they talk about the ways that they came to\n\nl5 knou, love and depend upon the perpetrator, yes, they talk and\nl6 describe at length the types of behaviors that would meet the\nl7 definition of grooming.\n\nl8 Q. Approximately hou many patients have you treated, evaluated\nl9 who have reported behaviors consistent with grooming?\n2o A. I would say the vast majority of patients I have treated\n2l who have reported childhood sexual abuse, again, that would be\nae hundreds upon hundreds.\n23 Q. What are the ages of the patients you have treated who have\n24 reported behaviors consistent with grooming?\n25 A. I have treated patients who are adolescents and patients\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo72l5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007216.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 37ofl58 37\nLBAGmax2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl who are adults.\n\n2 Q. Are you aware of other psychologists treating and\n\nke evaluating patients that reported behaviors consistent with\n\n4 grooming?\n\n5 A. Absolutely. It's common in the field.\n\n6 Q. Hou do you knou that?\n\n7 A. Through my review of the clinical research, it's something\n8 that's well documented in articles or books, chapters that have\n9 been writen, for example, about hou to provide treatment to\nlo patients. It's writen in the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> around what sorts of\nll symptoms might patients present with and why, what are some of\nl2 the common difficulties. Of course, it's writen in case\n\nl3 studies. And then through my conversations with peers and, of\nl4 course, trainings I have atended conducted by experts in the\nl5 field.\n\nl6 Q. In your forensic practice, have you evaluated survivors of\nl7 childhood sexual abuse?\n\nl8 A. I have.\n\nl9 Q. What does forensic evaluation of someone who has reported\n2o childhood sexual abuse entail?\n2l A. So in general, a forensic evaluation is a multistep\n22 process. As I mentioned before, it's not just talking to\n23 someone. So a forensic evaluation, as I conduct it, involves\n24 first reading all of the relevant external collateral\n25 information relevant to the case. So if it's a criminal case,\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo72l6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007218.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 39oofl58 39\nLBAGmax2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl impairments. And if so, to what degree, if any, are those\n\n2 atributable in whole or in part to the alleged sexual abuse.\n\n3 So as part of that assessment, I'm looking at the\n\n4 dynamics in the relationship between the individual and the\n\n5 perpetrator. And we knou that the grooming behaviors that\n\n6 induce that relationship of trust and atachment have a\n\n7 Significant negative affect on an individual's psyche and can\n\n8 strongly and negatively impact their functioning afterwards.\n\no So those are things I'm looking for.\n\nlo Q. Dr. Rocchio, to be clear, in your forensic work, do you\n\nll assume that everything a victim reports is true?\n\nl2 A. Absolutely not.\n\nl3 Q. Can you explain that?\n\nl4 A. My role in a forensic capacity is to provide an objective\nl5 answer based upon my evaluation and my review of the\n\nl6 <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>. And it is not dependent on who is hiring me, for\nl7 example. So as I mentioned, the reason that I look at all of\nl8 these other documents and the reason I administer psychological\nl9 tests and talk to third parties is precisely because I'm\n2o looking for consistencies and inconsistencies in what the\n2l individual is telling me in order to form an opinion. As part\n22 of my duty in that role is to investigate various hypotheses,\nCae in a forensic seting, it has to be that I'm not being told the\n24 truth.\n25 Q. To take a step back, to be clear, in your clinical work, do\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo72l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007219.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 4oofl58 4o\nLBAGmax2 Rocchio — Direct\nl you assume everything a victim reports is true?\n2 A. No, I do not.\n3 Q. Can you explain?\n4 A. So ina clinical seting, it is not my role to determine\n5 whether something is or is not true. Of course, when someone\n6 is telling me something, I'm using my skill and experience to\n7 take that information in and also to inquire, as I communicate\n8 to that individual and provide treatment. But as I mentioned\n9 earlier, I don't go out and try to see, well, this person is\nlo having trauma related to a motor vehicle accident or a shooting\nll on the job, I don't go and ask them to provide me with\nl2 newspaper articles to verify whether that event happened.\nl3 Q. Hou do the grooming that you have seen in your forensic\nl4 practice compare to what you have seen in your clinical\nl5 practice?\nl6 A. There's remarkable consistency in what I see in my work\nl7 over time in my forensic practice, my clinical practice and\nl8 what I have been trained and what's in the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>.\nl9 Q. Can you describe at a high level the scientific <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>\n2o upon which your opinions on grooming are based?\n2l A. So there have been a number of studies over time that have\n22 looked at the tactics, modus operandi, skill, manipulative\n23 techniques that have been used by perpetrators. And those\n24 studies have been published in peer-review journals. So there\n25 are studies that have done interviews with offenders, who have\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo72l9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007220.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 4loofl58 4l\nLBAGmax2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl been convicted and who admit to their crimes, asking them what\n2 sorts of techniques they utilized in order to perpetuate the\n\n3 sexual abuse. There have been studies that have been done with\n4 victims, in terms of asking them what sorts of experiences they\n5 had. There have also been studies that have been conducted\n\n6 with professionals in various fields; law and human services\n\n7 and psychology about the types of tactics and strategies that\n\n8 have been used.\n\nGg Q. Hou do the results of those studies compare?\n\nlo A. There's remarkable consistency. And even though\n\nll definitions may vary in studies, as they always do, there are\nl2 common -- a clear set of common strategies, techniques and\n\nl3 behaviors that have been identified in the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> across\n\nl4 time and across various samples.\n\nl5 Q. When you review articles about grooming, what sorts of\n\nl6 things are you looking for to determine the quality of articles\nl7 you are relying on?\n\nl8 A. I'm looking at whether or not it's in a peer review\n\nl9 journal. I'm looking at hou a particular study was conducted.\n2o So for example, if they're doing content analysis of an\n2l interview, are they making sure that ways that that interview\n22 has been coded by multiple individuals to get some sort of\n23 consistency there. I'm looking at hou they chose the sample\n24 size. I'm looking at if it's a review that summarizes the\n25 state of the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, is the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> review\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo722o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007222.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 43oofl58 43\nLBAGmax2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl A. So the definitions can vary. They're all generally\n\n2 referring to the same process. But the specific definition may\n5 vary in different studies. So you have to be sure that the\n\n4 <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, when reviewing it, you have to understand what\n\n5 definition they're using.\n\n6 Q. Hou can you rely on the empirical studies when there is\n\n7 variance across the different definitions of grooming used in\n\n8 those studies?\n\n9 A. To the extent they're talking about the same kind of\n\nlo process in the context of childhood sexual abuse. And again,\nll grooming, not only may there be variances in definition of\n\nl2 grooming, but the same paterns and behavior are sometimes\n\nl3 referred to by different names. But what you really want to\n\nl4 look for are the commonalities. So for example, are what\n\nl5 offenders tell us they do, does that -- to what degree of\n\nl6 overlap is there between that and what victims tell us that\n\nl7 they have experienced. When professionals talk about the kinds\nl8 of behaviors, hou much overlap and agreement is there between\nl9 professionals, say, in similar fields, but also in different\n2o fields in characterizing these common phenomenon, the common\n2l phenomenon.\nae Q. Do studies look at samples of substantiated cases of abuse?\n23 Ain TSS.\n24 Q. What does that mean?\n25 A.

And\nl4 it asked them to talk about some of the tactics used in\n\nl5 furthering the relationship and developing a dynamic of\n\nl6 coercive control.\n\nl7 What was significant in particular about this article\nl8 is not only did they look at coercive control as it applies to\nl9 childhood sexual abuse, but they also looked at hou coercive\n2o control, paterns of behavior play out in multiple forms of\n2l victimization; trafficking, elder abuse or pimp and sex worker\n22 relationships, intimate partner violence, rape, sexual assault,\n23 that sort of thing.\n24 Q.

Does this article use any particular sampling?\n\n2 A. The sampling was of professionals from a variety of fields.\nke And it looked for content analysis and commonalities in what\n\n4 these professionals reported were common behaviors and tactics\n5 that were used across types of victimization.\n\n6 Q. Hou, if at all, does that impact your assessment of the\n\n7 study and article?\n\n8 A. It impacts it significantly. Because what this article is\n9 doing is not only is it replicating what has previously been\nlo found about tactics that are used, it's extending that\n\nll <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> and saying that these are common paterns of\n\nl2 behavior that are used in the service of coercive control ina\nl3 variety of types of victimization.

What was the conclusion of this study?\n\nl7 A. So what these authors did is a two-part study. So the\n\nl8 first thing that they did is they did an extensive <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>\nl9 review to look for commonalities in the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> about what\n2o are the commonly described stages that a perpetrator engages in\n2l and what are the behaviors that are associated with those\n22 stages.

Sure. I think that certain things -—- some psychologists\n\n2 use clinical judgment on whether or not a perpetrator's\n\nke behaviors are considered grooming. But that certainly doesn't\n4 at all reference the scientific <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> to determine what is\n5 and is not considered grooming. In addition, we also have data\n6 that's been provided by offenders themselves.\n\n7 In terms of reliability and validity of these\n\n8 judgments, the validity in psychological science refers to the\n9 degree to which you are measuring this particular thing, what\nlo you think you're measuring. So for example, the degree to\n\nll which there is significant overlap between what victims say\n\nl2 they experience and what offenders say that they have done\n\nl3 provides us with a measure of validity.\n\nl4 The degree to which different groups of individuals,\nl5 whether that's groups of professionals or groups of victims\n\nl6 agree in studies what it is that —- the process, what kinds of\nl7 behaviors, what's been done to the victim, what kinds of\n\nl8 behaviors are associated with the grooming process, to the\n\nl9 extent those professionals agree, that's a measure of\n2o reliability. Because you're geting different studies,\n2l different groups, different samples where there's significant\n22 overlap in what this dynamic and what this concept is.\n23 MS.

I also think it's important to recognize that\n\nlo this article was published many years ago. And there's\n\nll certainly been evolutions and additional <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> since the\nl2 time of publication. But even at the time of publication, I\n\nl3 think it's a litle misleading. If they're defining consensus\nl4 there as universal agreement as to exact -- everything within\nl5 the process of grooming, then sure. But when we're talking\n\nl6 about any patern of behavior or any phenomenon within the\n\nl7 social science, it's a complicated phenomenon. You're never\n\nl8 going to get universal agreement among experts. That's why you\nl9 have to look at what's the particular definition used within a\n2o study.\n2l But most definitely, there's consensus within the\n22 scientific <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> about the phenomenon not only of\n23 grooming, but the phenomenon of child sexual abuse itself, what\n24 the experiences are of the victim and what the behaviors are of\n25 the offender and also the impact of those behaviors, in terms\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7233", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007235.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 56oofl58 56\nLBAGmax2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl can get consistency.

They do.\n\n6 Q. Can you please explain?\n\n7 A. The article we looked at earlier by Winters atempted\n\n8 specifically to address some concerns. So she atempted to\n\n9 validate the grooming model. And she very specifically wanted\nlo to see, okay, of course there's not going to be universal\n\nll agreement on every single behavior, but she did a statistical\nl2 study to find out specifically what behaviors do the\n\nl3 professionals and the experts agree upon. And again,\n\nl4 remembering that all of the behaviors -—- even the ones that, in\nl5 that particular study, didn't meet the statistical significance\nl6 in that study, all of those behaviors were behaviors that have\nl7 been commonly referred to and described in the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>.\n\nl8 Q. Dr. Rocchio, hou do error rates factor into this\n\nl9 <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>?\n2o A. So I think when we talk about error rates within the field\n2l of psychology, the kind of gold standard is when you have a\n22 particular technique or a drug and you ideally would randomly\n23 assign people, one who receives the drug, one who doesn't\n24 receive the drug, and I would kind of compare whether -—- hou\n25 effective it is.

So you have to look\n2 for other ways to assess acceptability within the scientific\n\n3 <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>; peer review and general thoughts about concepts.\n\n4 And so that's where you look at the reliability as in what do\n5 the experts consistently agree to among themselves. You look\n6 at the degree of overlapping studies, perhaps studying it in\n\n7 different ways, but are they still coming up with the same\n\n8 clear description of the types of things that happen in the\n\n9 context of child sexual abuse.\n\nlo So for example, there was a content analysis done\n\nll through interviews to pull out what some of those studies have\nl2 found and to the degree that they're rated by multiple\n\nl3 reviewers, and then compare the ratings of those reviewers,\n\nl4 that's an indices of reliability.\n\nl5 MS.

I was asked to provide examples to the government of\n\nl4 <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> in the field that I thought might be helpful to the\nl5 court to understand the concepts that I'm talking about. This\nl6 does a really nice job of pointing to the part that the terms\nl7 grooming and seduction refer to a patern of behavior that's\nl8 widely knoun and well established to be part of the dynamics of\nl9 sexual abuse. But in particular, I appreciated the author's\n2o emphasis later on in the article of some of the problems with\n2l the words seduction and some of the ways that much earlier\nae <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> erroneously used terminology that could\n23 inappropriately indicate a victim is blamed for the abuse that\n24 they have been subjected to.\n25 MS.

I wanted to direct your atention to the use of the term\n\n2 grooming, so in that top paragraph.

Okay.\n\n7 Q. Dr. Rocchio, what is your response, reaction to this\n\n8 passage?\n\n9 A. It's a bit confusing as to the point that's being made. I\nlo feel like they're trying to —- the author here seems to be\n\nll mixing different applications of the term that they use\n\nl2 grooming, so it looks like in part he's talking about what is\nl3 true in the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, which is that we're not particularly\n\nl4 good as a field of taking, frankly, many behaviors at all and\nl5 predicting future behaviors. So he's saying accurately that we\nl6 can't look at specific behaviors alone as predictors.\n\nl7 And certainly, the use of the term grooming, again, is\nl8 used to describe a process, a patern of behaviors. I'm not\n\nl9 here today to say that if somebody engages in any one of these\n2o particular behaviors, yes, we knou you're a child abuser. So\n2l he's making that point. But I don't think anybody —- I don't\n22 think that —- if that's his point, I wouldn't disagree with\n23 that. Except that he's then going on —— I disagree where he\n24 says that grooming then can't involve behaviors that might in\n25 fact be prosocial or normal.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7238", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007239.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 _ Filed ll/l5/2l Page 6oofl58 6o\nLBAGmax2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl Again, we're talking about a use of a variety of\n\nz strategies for the purpose of sexual abuse. So these are ways\n3 in which —— tactics, ways in which an offender might manipulate\n4 a child to developing a relationship of trust and atachment.\n\n5 Obviously, one can develop a relationship of trust and\n\n6 atachment in a variety of contexts. But when we're talking\n\n7 about grooming, the specific context, is when there's been\n\n8 coercive control and some form of organization.\n\n9 Q. Dr. Rocchio, taking a step back —-\n\nlo MS.

Again, there's remarkable similarity in the impact of those\nl5 behaviors. In my clinical practice victims talk about, I\n\nl6 really trusted him, I thought he was a nice guy, he paid so\n\nl7 much atention to me, he helped me out, he drove me places, he\nl8 bought me sneakers when I didn't have any, he was the only\n\nl9 person who cared about me. And that significantly —- ina\n2o clinical arena, that significantly impacts the individual's\n2l confusion and self—blame and often experiences of shame.\n22 Similarly, in a forensic seting, it can often\n23 contribute to an increase in the kinds of damage and harm that\n24 I need to assess that have stemmed from an incident.\n25 Q.

What factors contribute to increased risk or higher\n\n9 vulnerabilities?\n\nlo A. So there are factors that have been studied and found in\n\nll <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> that have to do with the individual themselves. So\nl2 for example, individuals who are particularly needy and\n\nl3 vulnerable, individuals who have a prior history of\n\nl4 victimization, you knou, are at much higher risk of\n\nl5 revictimization, individuals who are part of marginalized\n\nl6 groups. For example, we knou there's very high rates of sexual\nl7 assault, childhood sexual abuse among especially minority\n\nl8 children or among intellectually and cognitively disabled\n\nl9 children.\n2o We knou that individuals who come from certain types\n2l of family structures can be also at higher risk. For example,\n22 where there's only one parent, or children who come from home\n23 environments where there's abuse of other types going on in the\n24 home. So there might be other siblings who are being abused or\n25 the parents might be engaged -—- one of the parents might be\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo724o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007241.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 62 ofl58 62\nLBAGmax2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl abusing another parent or another child, so where there's other\n2 violence, those groups are also at higher risk.\n\n3 There have been other studies that look at poverty as\n4 a risk factor.

Yes, because, again, in the phenomenon of child sexual\n\nlo abuse in general, not -- we're looking at vulnerability\n\nll factors, i.e., who's more at risk. So to the extent that I was\nl2 learning about ways that you might want to target prevention,\nl3 for example, where you might want to make those interventions,\nl4 but then also, we knou that an individual's prior\n\nl5 vulnerabilities interact with their subsequent experiences of\nl6 victimization and have a profound effect on the outcome, the\nl7 adverse outcomes of the abuse itself.\n\nl8 So it was covered in a number of different ways\n\nl9 through the course of my education and training.\n2o Q. In your clinical practice, have you treat and evaluated\n2l patients who belong to higher-risk groups?\n22 A. Yes.\n23 Q. Can you please explain.\n24 A. In particular, we knou that gender is a higher-risk group,\n25 and we knou that women and girls are at higher risk for child\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7242", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007243.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 64oofl58 64\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl sexual abuse. So to the extent that more of my patients are\n\n2 women than men, certainly that's a vulnerability.\n\n3 But also, because, especially nou, I'm working with\n\n4 adults, I'm working with people who have been repeatedly\n\n5) victimized at various points in time in their lives. And you\n6 can really clearly see the patern, and it's something I often\n7 have to address with patients because they inquire about it,\n\n8 they don't understand. You knou, why is it that this has\n\n9 happened to me so many times. And, again, we knou from the\n\nlo revictimization <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> that when someone is abused, they\nll are at higher risk of being abused at later points in time.\n\nl2 Also, you knou, sometimes the clinical <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>\n\nl3 individuals will talk about the specific issues in their family\nl4 that perhaps increase their vulnerability: They were always\nl5 alone. They, you knou, their mom was sick and this person had\nl6 lots of opportunity to kind of befriend the family and, you\n\nl7 knou, therefore had greater access as a result of that\n\nl8 vulnerability, or perhaps they were desperate for atention,\nl9 care, love, and concern from another person because those are\n2o common childhood needs and maybe they weren't geting that at\n2l home.\n22 So those are all the kinds of things that would come\n23 up in, and have come up in, my over 3o years of treating\n24 patients.\n25 Q.

Ido.\n\n3 Q. Can you explain.\n\n4 A. So, again, I'll use an example in the civil arena. If I'm\na asked, as part of my forensic evaluation, to opine about the\n\n6 impact of an alleged event, say childhood sexual abuse, and the\n7 degree to which a person's current difficulties are related to\n8 that event, I have to take prior vulnerability into account,\n\n9 because part of what I'm looking at is, hou can I determine\n\nlo which of these persons' current difficulties are related to the\nll sexual abuse or maybe related to other things that have\n\nl2 happened in their past. So we knou, because of the\n\nl3 vulnerability <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, that if somebody is being abused in\nl4 adolescence, it wouldn't be at all unusual for them also to\n\nl5 have a history of earlier childhood sexual abuse.\n\nl6 So I have to look at the interaction of those prior\n\nl7 vulnerabilities and ways in which those prior vulnerabilities\nl8 both may have made the individual more vulnerable to the\n\nl9 grooming behavior and to the subsequent sexual abuse, and also\n2o ways in which those prior vulnerabilities may have interacted\n2l with the abuse to create more adverse outcomes for the\n22 individual I'm evaluating.\n23 Q.

It's highly consistent.\n\n6 Q. The defense has argued that a victim's prior sexual\n\n7 behavior is relevant to the concept of grooming. What's your\n\n8 reaction to that?\n\n9 A. In what way? I mean, I've talked about, certainly their\n\nlo experiences of victimization can make them more vulnerable, but\nll I'm not sure what you mean.\n\nl2 Q. Does whether a person, whether or not a person has had\n\nl3 sexual experience, puting aside prior victimization, make them\nl4 more or less vulnerable to being groomed?\n\nl5 A. I'm not aware of any <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> on that issue, nor do I\n\nl6 even understand hou that would theoretically make sense. To\n\nl7 the extent that you're suggesting that somebody who has been\n\nl8 sexually active in the past can or cannot be groomed, I'm not,\nl9 even theoretically, I don't understand why that would be the\n2o case.\n2l But, no, certainly I don't believe that there is any\n22 <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> that would support that statement.\n23 THE COURT: So to the extent you've seen in your\n24 practice and studies the impact of prior sexual conduct on the\n25 phenomenon of grooming, you understand it to potentially\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7249", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007251.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 72 ofl58 72\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl groomed and victimized.\n\n2 THE COURT: So given that there's a history of prior\n\n3 sexual abuse, would that be relevant -- is that relevant for\n\n4 you to understanding whether grooming occurred?\n\n5 THE WITNESS: Not necessarily, because when I'm\n\n6 looking at whether or not grooming occurred and when the\n\n7 <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> is looking about whether or not grooming occurred,\n\n8 they're going to look at the specific circumstances associated\n9 with whatever it is you're looking at. It's relevant in that I\nlo knou that prior victimization could increase vulnerability, but\nll just because someone is --\n\nl2 THE COURT: Well, vulnerability to what?\n\nl3 THE WITNESS: Vulnerability to subseguent sexual\n\nl4 abuse. But just because somebody is more vulnerable, that can\nl5 provide me with some information, but it's not going to factor\nl6 into my specific conclusions around the facts, say, ina\n\nl7 forensic seting if I'm being asked. Did grooming occur here.\nl8 I'm going to take into account prior victimization and\n\nl9 vulnerability. But that prior victimization and vulnerability\n2o isn't going to tell me whether or not it happened here.\n2l THE COURT: I guess I just want to understand that\n22 piece. The point you made about prior sexual abuse can lead to\n23 certain kinds of behaviors, is there anything in that analysis\n24 that would impact hou one understands whether grooming tactics\n25 would be successful or whether the individual might be\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo725l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007252.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 73 ofl58 73\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl susceptible or not to grooming?\n\n2 THE WITNESS: To the degree that someone is engaging\n3 in risky sexual behavior, that could -- they could end up then\n4 being in circumstances where they're more vulnerable to being\n5 targeted by offenders.

Thank you.\n\nlo BY MS. POMERANTZ:\n\nll Q. Dr. Rocchio, the defense has referred to a theory of\n\nl2 grooming by proxy. Have you heard of that term in scientific\nl3 or clinical <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>?\n\nl4 A. No, I have not.\n\nl5 Q. Is there anything about what you're testifying about here\nl6 today that says grooming can only be done for the benefit of\nl7 the person doing the grooming?\n\nl8 A. No, there's not.\n\nl9 Q. What is your opinion based on?\n2o THE COURT: And just to clarify, the opinion, so that\n2l we not have a fight about terminology, the opinion is that the\n22 presence of another individual can facilitate the sexual abuse\n23 of minors. Is that the opinion?\n24 THE WITNESS: What, what I was asked was whether or\n25 not there's anything that, in what I've testified about the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7252", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007253.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 74oofl58 74\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl tactics and strategies of the grooming process, that would\n\n2 preclude or require that those strategies be utilized for the\n\n3 sexual gratification of the person who's doing the grooming as\n4 opposed to a third party.

So you don't have an opinion on\n\n7 whether the presence -- let me just get the language -- the\n\n8 presence of a third -—- of another individual can facilitate\n\n9 sexual abuse of minors.\n\nlo THE WITNESS: To the extent that we knou that\n\nll offenders do put themselves in situations where they're more\n\nl2 likely to be viewed as trustworthy, surrounding themselves with\nl3 individuals who a child or an intended victim might trust is\n\nl4 going to increase the child's trust, perhaps.\n\nl5 THE COURT: Is there any <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> that you can point\nl6 to that goes from that sort of broad statement about\n\nl7 trustworthiness to the inclusion of a third individual in order\nl8 to build that trust, any <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> that you can point to that\nl9 suggests that?\n2o THE WITNESS: The <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> that just points to, more\n2l generally, perpetrators puting themselves in environments\n22 where they have a wider array of access or the grooming of\n23 institutions and other individuals for the purpose of geting\n24 greater access to the child.\n25 THE COURT: So, well, let me ask it this way. In your\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7253", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007254.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 75oofl58 75\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl experience, what is the frequency with which -- not in the\n\n2 institutional seting, but in your experience, in which the\n\n3 presence of another individual helps create -- a single\n\n4 individual, helped create that trustworthiness that facilitated\n5 the abuse?\n\n6 THE WITNESS: I'm not aware of a particular study that\n7 would investigate that specific situation.\n\n8 THE COURT: Or any discussion of that phenomenon in\n\n9 the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, specifically, not more broadly.\n\nlo THE WITNESS: Specifically the use of a single\n\nll individual, unless you're talking about a co-offender. I mean,\nl2 there is some <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, obviously, on co-offenders. There's\nl3 <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> that looks at, for example, in the pimping and\n\nl4 trafficking <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, it's very common for individuals to\n\nl5 engage in group activity. But specifically looking at child\n\nl6 sexual abuse and the presence of a single other adult, I'm not\nl7 aware of particular studies about that exact point.\n\nl8 THE COURT: And hou about in your clinical and\n\nl9 forensic experience?\n2o THE WITNESS: Certainly in my clinical and forensic\n2l experience I have definitely seen that.\n22 THE COURT: With what frequency?\n23 THE WITNESS: A high degree, because oftentimes\n24 offenders surround themselves with other people. So I'm\n25 thinking of a foren -- a Boy Scout case I did, where in\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7254", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007255.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 76oofl58 76\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl particular the person I was evaluating talked about hou he\n\n2 thought that the person who eventually abused him was a really\n3 good guy because there was another older person involved in the\n4 troop, and they were best friends.

But I think that the example\n22 you're asking me about is so highly specific, I think it would\n23 fall under the category of a number of things that are\n24 discussed, but I'm not aware of it having been discussed that\n25 specifically.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7255", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007256.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 77 ofl58 77\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl THE COURT: So in a sense what the field, the\n\n2 scientific field tell us is that there are scenarios that help\n3 create an aura of trust and respectability, and then one could,\n4 using some common sense, figure out what specific examples\n\n5 might fall within that?\n\n6 THE WITNESS: Sure. Or there is <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> to say,\n\n7 you knou, where, for example, do we find that perpetrators\n\n8 access victims? And so we knou that they end up in leadership\n9 roles in various kinds of child organizations -- counselors,\n\nlo schools, Boy Scouts, church. So -—-\n\nll THE COURT: But those phenomena are discussed in the\nl2 <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>.\n\nl3 THE WITNESS: Those phenomena are discussed in the\n\nl4 <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>.\n\nl5 THE COURT: OK. Thank you. Go ahead.\n\nl6 MS. POMERANTZ: Thank you.\n\nl7 Q. We've been talking about whether grooming only be done for\nl8 the benefit of the person doing the grooming. What if anything\nl9 in scientific <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> addresses the concept of grooming not\n2o having to be done for the benefit of the person doing the\nal grooming?\n22 A. So the article that we had spoken about earlier, looking at\n23 dynamics of coercive control, which refer to some of the\n24 strategies and dynamics that commonly occur in the context of\n25 grooming, we can see that coercive control, which are\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7256", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007257.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 78oofl58 78\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl describing the same kinds of strategies and tactics as grooming\n2 refers to, happens in a variety of other setings. So in the\n\n3 pimp-and-sex-worker relationship, we knou, for example, that\n\n4 the grooming strategies are happening, and typically a pimp is\n5 working not for their oun, necessarily, sexual gratification\n\n6 but to provide -- to procure and provide for the sexual\n\n7 gratification of another, for example.\n\n8 THE COURT: And that's hou it's discussed in the field\n9 and in the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, that, to the extent that trauma bonding\nlo has been studied in the pimp-sex worker context, it is plainly\nll about, at least largely about, the coercive techniques being\n\nl2 used to facilitate sexual conduct with a third party.\n\nl3 THE WITNESS: Exactly.\n\nl4 THE COURT: And, again, nothing like that in the\n\nl5 grooming child sexual abuse context beyond sort of the\n\nl6 institutional authority positions that you've discussed.\n\nl7 THE WITNESS: There have been studies, though, that\n\nl8 have looked at specifically comparing the behaviors associated\nl9 with grooming for the purposes of sexual abuse and those being\n2o the same behaviors, techniques, and strategies as utilized by\n2l the pimps. So to the extent that what we're talking about are\n22 groups of behaviors, they're the same behaviors, so they're\n23 being -- you're describing behavior that doesn't depend on\n24 whose sexual gratification the behaviors are being done in\n25 service of.

POMERANTZ:\n\nl8 Q. Dr. Rocchio, does the relationship of trust and atachment\nl9 between a victim and a perpetrator impact disclosure?\n2o A. Y@S.\nal Q. Hou so?\n22 A. Ina couple ways. First, ina relationship of trust and\n23 atachment between a victim and a perpetrator, that can and has\n24 been established to cause a great deal of confusion on the part\n25 of the victim about what is and is not abusive. So to the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7258", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007259.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 8ooofl58 8o\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl extent that someone doesn't recognize that what's happening to\n2 them or doesn't cognitively label it as abuse, obviously that's\n3 not something that can be reported.\n\n4 But then of course the relationship itself also\n\n5 functions to make disclosure less likely, because either the\n\n6 individual has been made, in the course of the relationship, to\n7 feel somewhat responsible, they might feel shame, or they may\n\n8 blame themselves; or to the extent that they've come to care\n\n9 for the person who's harming them, they may be afraid of\n\nlo geting that individual in trouble; or to the extent that the\nll relationship as a whole clearly has positive elements to it\n\nl2 apart from and distinct from the abusive elements, they may --\nl3 it's fulfilling some need on the part of the victim, they may\nl4 be fearful of losing those pieces.\n\nl5 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, are you\nl6 familiar with delayed disclosure?\n\nl7 A. I am.\n\nl8 Q. What is delayed disclosure?\n\nl9 A. \"Delayed disclosure\" is a term that's used in the\n2o <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> to refer to telling about an experience of, well, in\n2l this case, sexual assault at some point after the event has\n22 occurred.\n23 Q. Does disclosure of childhood sexual abuse depend on the\n24 victim's age?\n25 A. So there have been a number of studies that have looked at\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7259", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007261.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 82oofl58 82\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl may not believe that relationship to be abusive. They may\n\n2 believe that the two of them are in love. They may have been\n\n3 deliberately misled to believe that it is somehou a love, a\n\n4 love relationship. So they, they don't identify it or label it\n5 as abuse.\n\n6 Also, there's, as with any form of sexual abuse,\n\n7 sexual assault, in childhood or otherwise, there's a great deal\n8 of shame and stigma, and adolescents are, again,\n\n9 developmentally as a group notoriously sensitive to fear of\n\nlo being judged.\n\nll And then finally, they don't want to get in trouble.\nl2 They don't want their freedom restricted. There are, you knou,\nl3 studies that have been done talking to teenagers or adults\n\nl4 about why they did or didn't disclose at various points in\n\nl5 time, have identified all of these as factors, among others.\n\nl6 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, hou do\n\nl7 people who have experienced childhood sexual abuse talk about\nl8 or disclose the abuse?\n\nl9 A. So this is something that's really been studied in terms of\n2o the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> looking at hou and why do people disclose or not\n2l disclose. And one of the consistent findings is that\n22 disclosure most often takes place to appear not -- for an\n23 adolescent to appear and for adults -- to friends, not to\n24 formal agencies.\n25 I'm sorry. Can you repeat the question?\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo726l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007263.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 84oofl58 84\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl talking about any event, there are general principles of\n\n2 memory, and those would apply to memory, general well-accepted\n3 principles of memory, that would apply to experiences of sexual\n4 abuse as well.\n\n5) So to the extent that we knou everybody pays atention\n6 to and ataches significance to some aspects of an event more\n\n7 so than others, what a sexual abuse survivor discloses and the\n8 pieces of the story that they -- or their experiences, I'm\n\n9 sorry -- that they remember are going to be those things that\nlo were central details. They are going to have relatively good\nll memory most of the time for the gist of the event and for the\nl2 details that they atended to and were most significant to\n\nl3 them. But their memory for peripheral details, we knou, can\n\nl4 fade away and weaken or change with time.\n\nl5 Q. You just mentioned peripheral details. What do you mean by\nl6 that?\n\nl7 A. So in the memory <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, again, there is often a\n\nl8 distinction made between what are considered to be central\n\nl9 details and peripheral details. So the central details are\n2o subjectively defined as whatever it is an individual is paying\n2l atention to and ataching significance to at the time of an\n22 event. And those are the details that get encoded in memory\n23 and are then later available for retrieval at the time of\n24 recall.\n25 Q. Can you give an example.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7263", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007264.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 85oofl58 85\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl A. Sure. If we'tre talking about child sexual abuse, someone\n\n2 may have atended to the —-— and knoun full well that they were\n3 being sexually abused and they may have very clear memory of\n\n4 certain sounds, certain smells, breath, certain physical\n\n5 sensations. Alternatively, someone who is dissociating and\n\n6 trying very hard not -- to not think and not atend to what's\n\n7 happening to them, they may have very vivid details of the\n\n8 swirls on the ceiling or the patern on the wallpaper.\n\n9 Q. Dr. Rocchio, hou do the topics of memory that you just\n\nlo testified about fit into your expertise?\n\nll A. So as a psychologist, again, these general principles of\n\nl2 memory are part of what I've been trained in throughout my\n\nl3 career and, as a trauma psychologist in particular, certainly\nl4 hou individuals talk about their experiences, hou they remember\nl5 what's happened to them and what is typical, in terms of\n\nl6 memory. Again, what are the general principles about memory is\nl7 absolutely part of the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> and the research within the\nl8 field of trauma psychology, as well as psychology generally,\n\nl9 more broadly.\n2o Q. In your education, did you learn about delayed disclosure?\n2l A. We taught -- we learned certainly about hou people tell\n22 their stories. And certainly when I was trained in assessment\n23 techniques, for example, in my training, and I was taught about\n24 hou to ask about abuse experiences, I was also told, you knou,\n25 be mindful that if someone answers your questions, this may be\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7264", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007268.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 89ofl58 89\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl Q. Hou?\n\n2 A. Through the clinical <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, through the training.\n\n3 Again, if either I'm conducting training and I'm teaching\n\n4 others or I'm participating in the training that's talking\n\n5 about what are some of the common themes and issues and things\n6 that you need to deal with in a psychotherapy and clinical and\n7 assessment context, we'll often talk about disclosure, and in\n\n8 particular things like, we also knou that so many individuals\n\n9 of child sexual abuse but also of rape and sexual assault of\n\nlo all kinds don't necessarily label their experiences as such.\n\nll So when I'm teaching, or ways that I've been taught and trained\nl2 is to use behavioral descriptors of what I'm asking about. So,\nl3 for example, there have been numerous studies that say, you\n\nl4 knou, if you ask a group of individuals, say college students,\nl5 have you ever had an experience where someone physically forced\nl6 you to engage in sexual activity against your will, they'll,\n\nl7 you knou, a certain percentage of them will say yes. And then\nl8 if you follou you and say, have you ever been raped, no. So\n\nl9 you have to use behavioral descriptors, because people for a\n2o variety of reasons don't necessarily label their experiences as\n2l abuse. And that's also true with varying kinds of violence as\n22 well. Have you been abused, versus, have these behaviors\n23 happened to you.\n24 Q. Is your clinical experience regarding disclosure consistent\n25 or inconsistent with that of other psychologists who treat and\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7268", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007269.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 9ooofl58 9o\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl evaluate patients who have delayed disclosing childhood sexual\n\n2 abuse?\n\n3 A. It's consistent with my peers and reports that I've read in\n\n4 the clinical <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, yes.\n\n5 Q. In your forensic practice, have you dealt with\n\n6 disclosure-related issues?\n\n7 A. I have.\n\n8 Q. Can you explain.\n\n9 A. Disclosure-related issues in a forensic seting can come up\nlo particularly, for example, when there are issues related to the\nll statute of limitations. So in a recent case, I was asked to\nl2 evaluate the time at which an individual reasonably came to be\nl3 aware of a connection between their present difficulties or\nl4 potential connection between their present difficulties and the\nl5 alleged abuse. And part of that case involved my looking at,\nl6 you knou, were there any reports made about the abuse at the\nl7 time, because I'm working with an adult who's alleging\nl8 something during childhood, and if so to whom and under what\nl9 circumstances. And, you knou, even if the reports weren't made\n2o at the time of the abuse, for example, did this person talk\n2l about their experiences with their therapist or when they were\n22 hospitalized for substance abuse, what did they have to say.\n\n23 So I'm looking at what they disclosed, hou they\n24 disclosed it.

I spoke earlier about prevalence\n\nl6 rates where you're asking people, often in anonymous surveys\n\nl7 but sometimes in interview setings, but in research studies,\nl8 about a variety of experiences. And typically in those\n\nl9 studies, you will ask -- people are asked about their\n2o experiences with rape, sexual assault, childhood sexual abuse.\n2l And so you can get some idea of what percentage of people in\n22 various studies across time report particular events in their\n23 lives. So you get an estimate of prevalence.\n24 You can compare that to look at disclosure in two\n25 different ways.

Can you please explain.\n\n2 A. So there's about been a lot of <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> looking at what\n3 are some of the adverse outcomes in populations of individuals\n4 who have been sexually abused, among other adverse childhood\n\n5 events. So there's really two primary bodies of <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>.\n\n6 One is the general well-established <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> on adverse\n\n7 childhood events that -- of which childhood sexual abuse is\n\n8 one, that has documented that individuals who have had higher\n9 numbers of adverse events that have occurred to them during\n\nlo childhood are at much higher risk of a whole range of health\nll difficulties -- gastrointestinal difficulties, heart problems,\nl2 all kinds of health-related issues -- as well as psychological\nl3 and psychiatric difficulties, in particular depression,\n\nl4 anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder. So there's that body\nl5 of <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>.\n\nl6 And then there have been numerous studies that have\nl7 looked more specifically at and narrouly at populations of\n\nl8 individuals who have been sexually abused or who have reported\nl9 to have been sexually abused. And then they have looked over\n2o time and found that individuals who have reported histories of\n2l childhood sexual abuse have both much higher frequencies of\n22 various psychiatric illnesses and difficulties, as well as\n23 higher severity of symptoms.\n24 And then, thirdly, the post-traumatic stress disorder\n25 <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> has found that, when individuals have experienced a\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7272", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007273.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page94oofl58 94\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl traumatic event, which is part of the criteria for later\n\n2 developing post-traumatic stress disorder, those who\n\n3 experienced childhood sexual abuse and sexual abuse generally,\n4 as compared to those who have experienced other types of\n\n5 traumatic events, are at higher risk for developing\n\n6 post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n7 Q.

There are a number of problems with that question. I can't\nl9 answer it.\n2o Q. Do you have a list, a definitive list of the vulnerable\n2l population?\n22 A. To the extent that I have reviewed -- I haven't writen it\n23 doun.

Vulnerability implies higher risk, yes.\n\n7 Q. Vulnerable populations could be at higher risk for being\n\n8 physically assaulted; correct?\n\n9 A. Yes. But the research has differentially looked at risk\nlo for, for example, sexual victimization versus other kinds of\nll victimization.\n\nl2 Q. Vulnerable populations can be at higher risk for dropping\nl3 out of school; right?\nl4 A. Certain ones, sure.\nl5 Q. Vulnerable populations can be at higher risk for substance\nl6 abuse?\nl7 A.

So being in a vulnerable population means basically that\n22 you're at a higher risk for something bad happening to you in\n23 the future; correct?\n24 A.

So it's not that every single vulnerability\n4 has been found to increase vulnerability for every potential\n\n5 outcome. There's a relationship between particular types of\n\n6 vulnerability and particular types of outcome.\n\n7 Q.

And is that your definition?\n\n2 A. It's my understanding of the definitions that have been\n\n3 talked about in the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>. I mean, I haven't writen and\n4 published a specific set definition. It's a common definition\n5 and the one I'm using in my testimony, yes.\n\n6 Q. I was going to ask you that question.

And you have not done any metadata studies on your oun to\nll collect data about grooming; correct?\n\nl2 A. Correct.\n\nl3 Q. Grooming can consist of the actions that you're talking\n\nl4 about, can consist of -- I think we saw a list of 77 things on\nl5 it as part of your testimony; is that right?\n\nl6 A. Those were 77 specific behaviors that had been identified\nl7 in the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> as potentially being part of the grooming\n\nl8 process, yes.\n\nl9 Q. But I think we were talking about things like taking an\n2o interest in another human being could be considered grooming?\n2l A. Not in and of itself. It would depend on the patern of\n22 behavior and the context in which it's occurring.\n23 Q. Let's talk about that for a second.

You also talked about delayed disclosures; correct?\n\n2 A. Yes.\n\n3 Q. Nou, the studies vary over when disclosure occurs for a\n\n4 number of reasons. First, the definition of disclosure, the\n\n5 studies have disclosures to law enforcement, right, which is\n\n6 one definition of disclosure?\n\n7 A. That's generally referred to in the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> as\n\n8 reporting.\n\n9 Q. And then there's disclosure to a parent; right?\nlo A. Correct.\nll Q. Then there's disclosure to a friend; right?\nl2 A. Mm-hmm.\nl3 Q. Disclosure to a teacher or other third person?\nl4 A. Yes.\nl5 Q. And there's really no set term of what disclosure in this\nl6 context means; correct?\nl7 A. No, that's not correct.\nl8 Q. There's also no set term on what delay means; correct?\nl9 A. No, that's not correct.\n2o Q. Well, some of the studies have one week as delay; right?\nal A. Yes.\n22 Q. And some of the studies have one month as a delay; right?\n23 A. Yes.\n24 Q. Some of the studies have one year as delay, up to one year;\n25 right?\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7299", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007300.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document467_ Filed ll/l5/2l Page l2l of l58l2l\nLBAGmax4 Rocchio - Cross\n\nl A. Yes, many of the studies specifically look at disclosure\n\n2 that is delayed, as in not occurring at the time of the abuse.\n3 And then look at what are those rates at various points in\n\n4 time, so it could be a week later, it could be a month later,\n5 it could be a year later or five years later.\n\n6 Q. So those are all variables in this idea of when disclosure\n7 occurs; right?\n\n8 A. They are variables in the dynamics of the delay. They are\n9 all examples of delayed disclosure at various points in time.\nlo Because delayed disclosure refers to disclosure at some point\nll after the incident that's being disclosed.\n\nl2 Q. I want to ask you some questions about memory nou, which is\nl3 another area of your opinion.\n\nl4 You agree with me that memory is a complex topic?\n\nl5 A. Ido.\n\nl6 Q. Memory is generally regarded as the mental registration,\nl7 retention and recollection of past experiences, sensations or\nl8 thoughts; would you agree with that?\n\nl9 A. I would.\n2o Q. And there are a number of parts of the brain that work in\n2l connection to form memories; would you agree with that?\n22 A. I would.\n23 Q. Do you knou what those parts are?\n24 A.

But I think the very\nl4 concept of the idea that offenders use a variety of tactics,\n\nl5 modus operandi, and behaviors in the process of developing a\n\nl6 relationship with their intended victims is well established\n\nl7 and accepted in the peer-reviewed <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> and scientific\n\nl8 community.\n\nl9 THE COURT: To the extent you're familiar with the\n2o body of <span class=\"highlight\">Literature</span> around trauma bonding in the sex-worker\n2l context, is there a comparable sort of dialogue and discussion\n22 among -- within the field as to what is an appropriate model,\n23 what counts as -- deemed strategies and the like?\n24 THE WITNESS: I'm aware of some research that's been\n25 done looking at the types of behaviors and groomings, which\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo73l5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007316.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document467_ Filed ll/l5/2l Page l37 of l58l37\nLBAAMAX5ps Rocchio - Cross\n\nl would be various stages in the pimp and prostitute <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>\n2 that are analogous to this. So, for example, hou victims are\n3 targeted and selected, hou the relationship develops over time,\n4 what sorts of behaviors are done to influence and coerce, and\n5 then to develop that trauma bond and atachment, which may get\n6 harder, for example, tactics that involve isolation and\n\n7 increased dependency and things like that.\n\n8 THE COURT: Do you have a sense, is the state of the\n9 <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> on that subject more setled or more advanced than\nlo it is on the concept of grooming in child sexual abuse?\n\nll THE WITNESS: I, I'm not sure that I can answer that.\nl2 I think it's analogous <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>.

That was the conclusion of the article, yes.\n2 QO. And this is in 2ol6, this article, correct?\n3 A. It was writen in 'l6, published in 'l7 perhaps, yes.\n4 Q.

OK. So looking at Exhibit 6, this is a survey,\n2o essentially, of a number of publications that talk about\n2l barriers of disclosure. Correct?\n22 A. So my understanding is, this was a study that was looking\n23 at, understanding that delayed disclosure is very common, they\n24 were trying to determine what sorts of things present as\n25 barriers to disclosure and as facilitators of disclosure.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7322", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007329.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page l5o of l58 l5o\nLBAAMAX5ps Rocchio - Cross\n\nl THE COURT: OK.\n\n2 BY MR.

I'm not saying that I have read and\nl5 examined every study cited in this particular article. Sol\nl6 really can't speak as to hou those in this article identified\nl7 or defined \"rate of disclosure.\" I would expect, houever, that\nl8 it would be defined in the full article itself. It's not\nl9 defined here in the brief summary. But typically in scientific\n2o <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, it would -- the time period of disclosure that the\n2l authors were investigating, I would expect to find that in the\n22 article itself.\n23 Q. OK. But apparently you haven't gone back to look at the\n24 underlying data. Is that right?\n25 A. I have not gone back to look at every reference cited in\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7329", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007330.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document467_ Filed ll/l5/2l Page l5l of l58l5l\nLBAAMAX5ps Rocchio - Cross\n\nl this particular article.

But this is the article you gave to the government in\n5 support of your testimony. Right?\n\n6 A. In partial support, yes.\n\n7 Q. OK. Page 7 of 24, the top, the Alaggia study, 2olo.

And then 26 percent claimed repressed memory. Right?\n\nl3 A. That's what it says there, yes.\n\nl4 Q. I don't need to go through all of these. But fair to say\nl5 that it's an overstatement, based on the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, to claim\nl6 that a majority of child alleged victims fail to report sex\n\nl7 abuse during childhood.\n\nl8 A.

Well, there are many other reasons why these reports may\nl3 surface not immediately. Correct?\nl4 A. Again, I'm commenting at this point my opinion is that\nl5 delayed disclosure is common. I'm not -- do you have a\nl6 question about the reasons why?\nl7 Q. Yeah. There are many reasons why. There are allegations\nl8 that are made months, weeks, years, after an alleged event.\nl9 Correct?\n2o A. Correct.\n2l Q.

Again, I'm not aware of the scientific research that has\nl6 studied specifically these as predictors of false allegations.\nl7 There's a very large body of scientific <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> documenting\nl8 of course that false allegations can occur, but they are --\n\nl9 represent a very small minority of allegations that are made.\n2o And I believe the article that you're reviewing, the authors\n2l are puting forth some hypotheses as to hou or why that might\n22 occur. But I don't believe it's coming from a scientific\n23 study, and I'm not aware of one at this point.\n24 Q. OK. So wrapping up here --\n25 THE COURT: I would again try to point it directly at\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7333", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007476.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 _ Filed ll/23/2l Pagellof 28\nThird, the government says Dr. Dietz should not be permited to testify that it is a\n“commonly accepted bit of clinical lore” that perpetrators often target vulnerable victims. Mot. at\n\nll. The government’s argument misconstrues and misunderstands Dr. Dietz’s point. Dr. Dietz\ndoes not dispute that vulnerable people can be and are targeted. Ex. l, p 4. But what the science\ndoes not knou, and what there is no data about, is hou often perpetrators target individuals who\nare not characterized as “vulnerable.” /d. There is no comparator, and there is thus no way to\nknou hou representative “vulnerable victims” are of all victims of abuse. /d. As Dr. Dietz will\ntestify, experts do not knou the empirical relationship between vulnerability and abuse. /d.\nAgain, Dr. Dietz should be able to challenge the reliability of Dr. Rocchio’s opinions by\nexplaining hou they lack scientific support. Fed. R. Evid. 7o2, Advisory Commitee Notes, 2ooo\nAmendments (Rule 7o2 “is broad enough to permit testimony that is the product of competing\nprinciples or methods in the same field of expertise.).\n\nFourth, the government disputes Dr. Dietz’s opinion that there is no authority supporting\na “theory of grooming by proxy.” Mot. at ll-l2.? Once again, though, the government\nmisunderstands Dr. Dietz’s point, and its argument is correspondingly non-responsive. The\ngovernment says, for example, there is “ample <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> on the pimp-prostitute relationship.”\nMot. at l2. Dr. Dietz does not deny this. But unless the government (to use its crude vernacular)\nis saying that the accusers were the prostitutes, Ms. Maxwell was the pimp, and Mr. Epstein was\nthe John, this <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> is beside the point and not applicable to this case. Ex. l, p 4.\n\ntk Ok ok\n\n3 To the extent Dr. Rocchio offers testimony on this point, addressing or implying\n“srooming-by-proxy,” Dr. Dietz’s opinion is admissible as described herein. See also supra note\na\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7476", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007478.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 Filed ll/23/2l Pagel3 of 28\nlacked actual knouledge of and intent to facilitate the alleged grooming and abuse, she is not\nguilty, even if, as a mater of hindsight, it should have been obvious.\n\nThe government’s second argument falls short as well. Although the phrase “2o/2o\nhindsight” might be well-knoun, the pouer of hindsight bias and the degree to which it might\nunreliably affect the outcome of this case is not. To be sure, as Dr. Dietz laid out in his\ndisclosure, the scientific <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> about hindsight bias is voluminous. Ex. l, p 4-5. These expert\narticles wouldn’t exist if the concept were obvious to everyone, and surely it wouldn’t be the\ncase that, as Dr. Dietz notes, “[e]ven individuals with specialized training and expertise succumb\nto hindsight bias,” id. at 5.\n\nThe government concedes that “the jury, and not the court, should be the one to decide\namong conflicting experts.” Mot. at 9 (quoting United States v. Randall, No. l9 Cr. l3l (PAE)\n(S.D.N.Y.)). But for the jury to do that job, it must be equipped with the necessary tools. And\none of those tools is Dr. Dietz’s perfectly permissible opinion that Dr. Rocchio’s testimony\ncannot carry the water the government wants it to because it is tainted by hindsight bias. See\nUnited States v. Broun, 557 F.2d 54l, 556 (6th Cir. l977) (“Conflicting testimony concerning\nthe conclusions drawn by experts, so long as they are based on a generally accepted and reliable\nscientific principle, ordinarily go to the weight of the testimony rather than to its admissibility.”).\n\nC. The Halo Effect.\n\nThe government has two objections to Dr. Dietz’s opinions on the “halo effect.” The first\nis that it is irrelevant (though, again, not unreliable). The second is that it improperly seeks to\nengender sympathy for Ms. Maxwell.\n\nFirst, the government is wrong to argue the testimony is irrelevant. Take just one\n(representative) example. Dr. Dietz opines that Mr. Epstein’s\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR- oooo7478", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007480.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 _ Filed ll/23/2l Pagel5of 28\ntestimony.” (cleaned up)). The government’s speculative concern about the effect of Dr. Dietz’s\ntestimony is no reason to exclude it when the Court has ample tools at its disposal to address the\ngovernments (ill-founded) worries.\n\nAlmost as an aside, the government disingenuously suggests that Dr. Dietz’s opinion is\ninadmissible because “it appears” to be based “solely on one interview of Epstein with Steven\nBannon.” Mot. at l7. As the government well knous, Dr. Dietz’s opinion is based on much\nmore. To be sure, Dr. Dietz quoted the interview in his disclosure, Ex. l, p 6, but he also\nreviewed and considered thousands of pages of material before reaching his opinion, including\nmost significantly all the material available to him about the Palm Beach Investigations of Mr.\nEpstein, Ex. l, p l66-69.\n\nD. Pathways to False Allegations of Sexual Assault.\n\nThe government misses the mark in its hyperbolic objection to Dr. Dietz’s opinions about\nthe multiple pathways to false sex assault allegations. Mot. at l8-22. The government claims\nthese opinions invade the province of the jury are unreliable and unhelpful. Not so.\n\nFirst, the opinions do not invade the province of the jury because Dr. Dietz is not offering\nan opinion on the truthfulness of the accusers’ allegations in this case. See Nimely v. City of New\nYork, 4l4 F.3d 38l, 395—96 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (expert testimony is inadmissible if it “comment[s]\ndirectly, under the guise of expert opinion, on the credibility of trial testimony from” specific\nfact witnesses.); cf Hygh v. Jacobs, 96l F.2d 359, 364 (2d Cir. l992) (expert not permited to\noffer testimony that “merely [tells] the jury what result to reach’). Dr. Dietz’s opinions rely on\nhis clinical experience and the vast body of <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> explaining hou an accuser might come to\nfalsely allege sexual assault.\n\nOne point (but by no means the only one) of Dr. Dietz’s opinion is to challenge the\nreliability of Dr. Rocchio’s opinions, which she bases on the untested assumption that her\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo748o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007482.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 Filed ll/23/2l Pagel7 of 28\ntestimony. To the contrary, the text of Rule 7o2 expressly contemplates that an expert may be\nqualified on the basis of experience.”).\n\nThird, in admiting Dr. Rocchio’s testimony over an objection by Ms. Maxwell similar to\nthe one offered here by the government, this Court said as follous:\n\nDr. Rocchio’s opinions speak only to concepts and will not (and indeed may not)\n\nsuggest that the jury find any alleged victim witness to be credible or to find Ms.\n\nMaxwell guilty... . It is the jury’s role to determine whether and hou Dr. Rocchio’s\n\nopinions apply to the facts of this case and the credibility of the witnesses.\n(Dkt. 435, p lo). The same logic applies to Dr. Dietz’s opinions.\n\nFinally, the government says the Dr. Dietz’s opinions don’t “fit the facts of the case.”\nMot. at 2l. But because the accusers’ stories have changed so much over the last twenty years,\nand because it’s still unclear what they will testify to at trial, this objection is premature at best.\nIf the government believes Dr. Dietz’s opinions do not “fit” the facts, this Court can consider that\nargument once there is evidence of what the facts really are.\n\nE. Dr. Dietz’s Alleged Opinions about the Accusers’ “Credibility.”\n\nNouhere in Dr. Dietz’s expert disclosure does he propose to opine on the credibility of\nMs. Maxwell’s accusers. Ex. l. The government can argue otherwise only by mischaracterizing\nhis opinions. See Mot. at 22-23.\n\nFor one thing, Dr. Dietz should be able to critique Dr. Rocchio’s methods and\nconclusions by opining that experts in the field would not be “so credulous” as Dr. Rocchio is.\nSee Gov’t Omnibus Resp. to Maxwell Mot. in Limine, at l6; Ex. 2, p l6:ll-l6 (Dr. Rocchio: “In\nmy clinical practice, it’s not — I have to deal with what the patients tell me in the room. It’s not\nmy job to go out and verify any part of what’s being told in the clinical room, but, rather, to hear\nwhat they’re telling me and then relate that back to my other skills-training experience, the\nscientific <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>.”). Dr. Dietz proposes to opine that Dr. Rocchio erred in assuming that her\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7482", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007483.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 _ Filed ll/23/2l Pagel8 of 28\npatients were telling the truth without evaluating, for example, “the changes in the core details of\nthe allegations” of her patients, which is something “professionals” in the field do. Ex. l, p lo.\n\nIf, houever, Dr. Rocchio testifies that she does not merely assume alleged victims are\ntelling the truth (as when, for example, Dr. Rocchio is acting in a forensic rather than clinical\ncapacity, see Ex. 2, p 39-4o), and that her expert opinions are based on a rigorous inquiry into the\nveracity the claims, Dr. Dietz’s opinions are still reliable and admissible. He can testify, for\nexample, that because the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> does not support the hypothesis that emotional distress (e.g.,\ncrying) is predictive of truthfulness, Ex. l, p ll, Dr. Rocchio is wrong to base her opinions about\nher patients on such conduct.\n\nFor another thing, Dr. Dietz does not propose to tell the jury who is telling the truth and\nwho is not telling the truth. Thus, to use this Court’s words,\n\nDr. [Dietz’s] testimony is appropriate because []he does not testify as to any\n\nspecific witness’s credibility. See, e.g., Torres, No. 2o-CR-6o8 (DLC), 2o2l WL\n\nl9475o3, at *7; Johnson, 86o F.3d at ll4o (8th Cir. 2ol7) (explaining that an expert\n\nmay testify “regarding the general characteristics that sexually abused children\n\nexhibit” but may not usurp the jury’s role of assessing the credibility of any specific\n\nvictim); United States v. Telles, 6 F.4th lo86, lo97-98 (9th Cir. 2o2l) (same).\n(Dkt. 435, p 5).\n\nThe government is wrong to rely on United States v. Lumpkin (distinguishable on other\ngrounds in any event), in which the Court affirmed the district court’s decision to exclude\n“testimony on witness confidence in identifications.” l92 F.3d 28o, 289 (2d Cir. l999). Mot. at\n22. Not only did Lumpkin concern eyewitness identification (a concept far afield from the\ntestimony at issue here), but the expert witness there proposed to evaluate the credibility of\nwitnesses who made the identification of the defendant. Dr. Dietz does not propose to testify to\nthe credibility of accusers in this case.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7483", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007488.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 Filed ll/23/2l Page 23 of 28\n\nAdmission of expert testimony rests with the discretion of the court. Exclusion of expert\ntestimony, especially regarding the reliability of eyewitness testimony, has been deemed error\nresulting in reversals. See, e.g., supra note 5 & cases cited infra. The admission of expert\ntestimony on the subject of memory, especially in sex abuse cases, has been prominent in state\ncourt, where most prosecutions regarding sex-based offenses are brought. In the last decade, for\nexample, Dr. Loftus has given expert testimony regarding memory science in numerous sex\nabuse cases:\n\ne People v. Weinstein (NY Cty, NY 2o2o)\n\ne People v.

In contrast, Dr. Rocchio relies on <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> of others, mostly non-identified and some\nthat do not support the science of grooming, and upon anecdotal reporting by patients engaged in\ntalk therapy.\n\nAlthough Dr. Rocchio is not an expert on memory or neuroscience (as she admited at her\nDaubert hearing, Ex. 2, p l2l), the government intends to have her testify about the impact of\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR- oooo7488", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007504.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l _ Filed ll/23/2l Page ll of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage lo\n\nDissociation: Dissociation is ‘the lack of the normal integration of thoughts, feelings,\nand experiences into the stream of consciousness and memory. Dissociation involves a\ndisruption or spliting off of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient. It is likely associated with\nmemory distortions. Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual assault, dissociation may\ncause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events\nthat for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be\nfilled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. Houever, individuals who dissociate\nat a high frequency may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details to an\nincomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered in the context of the event.\nThus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic relevance, including\nwho the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and hou many times.\n\nIntellectual Disability: Intellectual disability, is characterized by belou average IQ and\nadaptive functioning. Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acquisition of social,\noccupational, academic, and general self-care skills. Intellectual disability has several etiologies\nthat often are related to biological or pathological processes affecting the central nervous system.\nMany of the specific vulnerabilities that arise from intellectual disability overlap to some extent\nwith other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and\nindividuals with other developmental disabilities may also have intellectual disability.\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without ID, have vulnerabilities\nrelated to memory and communication that the legal system may not be equipped to handle\nadequately. Individuals with moderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty\ncommunicating about the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions). Research findings\nindicate that communications skills are essential in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims\nwith mild ID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to file\nsexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties with memory may\nalso complicate the investigation process for individuals with ID.\n\nChanges in the core details of the allegation are often used by professionals as indices in\ndetermining the credibility of a victim’s claims. Peace and colleagues (2ol5) conducted a\nnarrative analysis of l47 sets of allegations of sexual assault across short (3 month) and long (6\nmonth) intervals since the alleged event took place. In reviewing the existing <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, Peace\nand colleagues found that genuine traumatic experiences have a demonstrable resiliency to\ndrastic impairments in recall. Houever, some inconsistencies especially in less core maters are\nto be expected due to some less important details fading or varying over time. In examining their\nsample of l47 allegations, the researchers discovered that truthful allegations contained more\ndetail relative to false allegations at each of the assessment intervals. Specifically, the researchers\nfound that fabricated allegations of traumatic experiences contained more inconsistent details\nboth at 3 months and 6 months. The total amount of detail for each type of allegation (true or\nfalse) does tend to decrease over time. Additionally, as these figures suggest, the researchers\nfound that the number of details present in genuine reports continued to decrease over time\nwhereas fabricated stories ‘levelled off” in detail.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo75o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007505.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page l2 of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage ll\n\nHunt and Bull (2ol2) reviewed signs that can be used to differentiate true allegations of\nsexual assault from false ones and concluded that the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> did not support the hypothesis\nthat emotional distress was predictive of the truthfulness of the allegation. This is consistent\nacross the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, and emotional distress (e.g., crying) is not regarded as a reliable predictor of\nthe accuracy or truthfulness of an allegation. Additional research is needed, but at this point there\nis litle empirical support to indicate that being emotionally upset, distressed, or crying while\nreporting an assault indicates that the report is more likely to be true. This is likely due to the fact\nthat such reactions can also occur in false allegations for various reasons, including a false\nmemory or an atempt to mislead by those who knou this sort of reaction would be expected of a\ntrue allegation.\n\nIndividuals who have been sexually assaulted have higher rates of mental disorders than\nindividuals who have not been sexually assaulted, and this includes significantly higher rates of\npost-traumatic stress disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, drug use disorders, and alcohol use\ndisorders. Emily R. Dworkin, Risk for Mental Disorders Associated with Sexual Assault: A\nMeta-Analysis, 2l Trauma, Violence, & Abuse (2o2o), pp. loll-lo28. Any of these mental\ndisorders that occur more frequently among those who have been sexually assaulted can affect\nmemory and recall, requiring assessment on a case-by-case basis.\n\nVarying degrees of post-traumatic stress symptomatology occur in significant proportions\nof victims follouing sexual assault and last for varying durations.

And if so, to what degree, if any, are those\n\n2 atributable in whole or in part to the alleged sexual abuse.\n\n3 So as part of that assessment, I'm looking at the\n\n4 dynamics in the relationship between the individual and the\n\n5 perpetrator.

My role in a forensic capacity is to provide an objective\nl5 answer based upon my evaluation and my review of the\n\nl6 <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>. And it is not dependent on who is hiring me, for\nl7 example. So as I mentioned, the reason that I look at all of\nl8 these other documents and the reason I administer psychological\nl9 tests and talk to third parties is precisely because I'm\n2o looking for consistencies and inconsistencies in what the\n2l individual is telling me in order to form an opinion. As part\n22 of my duty in that role is to investigate various hypotheses,\nCae in a forensic seting, it has to be that I'm not being told the\n24 truth.\n25 Q.

No, I do not.\n3 Q. Can you explain?\n4 A. So ina clinical seting, it is not my role to determine\n5 whether something is or is not true. Of course, when someone\n6 is telling me something, I'm using my skill and experience to\n7 take that information in and also to inquire, as I communicate\n8 to that individual and provide treatment. But as I mentioned\n9 earlier, I don't go out and try to see, well, this person is\nlo having trauma related to a motor vehicle accident or a shooting\nll on the job, I don't go and ask them to provide me with\nl2 newspaper articles to verify whether that event happened.\nl3 Q. Hou do the grooming that you have seen in your forensic\nl4 practice compare to what you have seen in your clinical\nl5 practice?\nl6 A. There's remarkable consistency in what I see in my work\nl7 over time in my forensic practice, my clinical practice and\nl8 what I have been trained and what's in the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>.\nl9 Q. Can you describe at a high level the scientific <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>\n2o upon which your opinions on grooming are based?\n2l A. So there have been a number of studies over time that have\n22 looked at the tactics, modus operandi, skill, manipulative\n23 techniques that have been used by perpetrators. And those\n24 studies have been published in peer-review journals. So there\n25 are studies that have done interviews with offenders, who have\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo79o9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007910.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 42 of l594l\nLBAGmax2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl been convicted and who admit to their crimes, asking them what\n2 sorts of techniques they utilized in order to perpetuate the\n\n3 sexual abuse. There have been studies that have been done with\n4 victims, in terms of asking them what sorts of experiences they\n5 had. There have also been studies that have been conducted\n\n6 with professionals in various fields; law and human services\n\n7 and psychology about the types of tactics and strategies that\n\n8 have been used.\n\nGg Q. Hou do the results of those studies compare?\n\nlo A. There's remarkable consistency. And even though\n\nll definitions may vary in studies, as they always do, there are\nl2 common -- a clear set of common strategies, techniques and\n\nl3 behaviors that have been identified in the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> across\n\nl4 time and across various samples.\n\nl5 Q. When you review articles about grooming, what sorts of\n\nl6 things are you looking for to determine the quality of articles\nl7 you are relying on?\n\nl8 A. I'm looking at whether or not it's in a peer review\n\nl9 journal. I'm looking at hou a particular study was conducted.\n2o So for example, if they're doing content analysis of an\n2l interview, are they making sure that ways that that interview\n22 has been coded by multiple individuals to get some sort of\n23 consistency there. I'm looking at hou they chose the sample\n24 size. I'm looking at if it's a review that summarizes the\n25 state of the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, is the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> review\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo79lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007912.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 44 of l5943\nLBAGmax2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl A. So the definitions can vary. They're all generally\n\n2 referring to the same process. But the specific definition may\n5 vary in different studies. So you have to be sure that the\n\n4 <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, when reviewing it, you have to understand what\n\n5 definition they're using.\n\n6 Q. Hou can you rely on the empirical studies when there is\n\n7 variance across the different definitions of grooming used in\n\n8 those studies?\n\n9 A. To the extent they're talking about the same kind of\n\nlo process in the context of childhood sexual abuse. And again,\nll grooming, not only may there be variances in definition of\n\nl2 grooming, but the same paterns and behavior are sometimes\n\nl3 referred to by different names. But what you really want to\n\nl4 look for are the commonalities. So for example, are what\n\nl5 offenders tell us they do, does that -- to what degree of\n\nl6 overlap is there between that and what victims tell us that\n\nl7 they have experienced. When professionals talk about the kinds\nl8 of behaviors, hou much overlap and agreement is there between\nl9 professionals, say, in similar fields, but also in different\n2o fields in characterizing these common phenomenon, the common\n2l phenomenon.\nae Q. Do studies look at samples of substantiated cases of abuse?\n23 Ain TSS.\n24 Q. What does that mean?\n25 A.

So what this article did, it reviewed information provided\nll by a variety of professionals who had expertise, specifically\nl2 in offender behavior and tactics that are utilized by offenders\nl3 in sexual abuse, professionals from a variety of fields. And\nl4 it asked them to talk about some of the tactics used in\n\nl5 furthering the relationship and developing a dynamic of\n\nl6 coercive control.\n\nl7 What was significant in particular about this article\nl8 is not only did they look at coercive control as it applies to\nl9 childhood sexual abuse, but they also looked at hou coercive\n2o control, paterns of behavior play out in multiple forms of\n2l victimization; trafficking, elder abuse or pimp and sex worker\n22 relationships, intimate partner violence, rape, sexual assault,\n23 that sort of thing.\n24 Q.

Does this article use any particular sampling?\n\n2 A. The sampling was of professionals from a variety of fields.\nke And it looked for content analysis and commonalities in what\n\n4 these professionals reported were common behaviors and tactics\n5 that were used across types of victimization.\n\n6 Q. Hou, if at all, does that impact your assessment of the\n\n7 study and article?\n\n8 A. It impacts it significantly. Because what this article is\n9 doing is not only is it replicating what has previously been\nlo found about tactics that are used, it's extending that\n\nll <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> and saying that these are common paterns of\n\nl2 behavior that are used in the service of coercive control ina\nl3 variety of types of victimization.

What was the conclusion of this study?\n\nl7 A. So what these authors did is a two-part study. So the\n\nl8 first thing that they did is they did an extensive <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>\nl9 review to look for commonalities in the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> about what\n2o are the commonly described stages that a perpetrator engages in\n2l and what are the behaviors that are associated with those\n22 stages. So they did a very comprehensive <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> review.\n23 They identified a number of specific behavioral and observable\n24 strategies that individuals have identified in the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>.\n25 They then got a group of recognized individuals in\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo79l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007919.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 5l of l595o\nLBAGmax2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl gaining access and isolation, trust development,\n\n2 desensitization, sexual contact and physical contact. And then\n3 beneath each stage level, there is a list of the behavioral and\n4 the observable and measurable behaviors where there was a high\n5 level of statistical significance in agreement among varying\n\n6 professionals as to the relevance both to the grooming process\n7 and to the stages.\n\n8 Q. I want to direct your atention to Page 4. What is this\n\n9 table?\n\nlo A. So these, as I mentioned, there was an original list of\n\nll about 77 specific behaviors that have been found associated\n\nl2 with grooming in the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> fairly consistently. These are\nl3 the behaviors that were part of that original list, where\n\nl4 perhaps there were more differences of opinion, but the level\nl5 of agreement among the professionals in this particular study\nl6 did not reach the level of statistical significance.\n\nl7 Q. What is your takeaway from the study in the article?\n\nl8 A. I think this is a study that has really done a good job of\nl9 integrating what we knou and pulling together the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>,\n2o and then puting it to an empirical test. There have been\n2l other ways to empirically understand and test what is referred\n22 to as grooming.

Sure. I think that certain things -—- some psychologists\n\n2 use clinical judgment on whether or not a perpetrator's\n\nke behaviors are considered grooming. But that certainly doesn't\n4 at all reference the scientific <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> to determine what is\n5 and is not considered grooming. In addition, we also have data\n6 that's been provided by offenders themselves.\n\n7 In terms of reliability and validity of these\n\n8 judgments, the validity in psychological science refers to the\n9 degree to which you are measuring this particular thing, what\nlo you think you're measuring. So for example, the degree to\n\nll which there is significant overlap between what victims say\n\nl2 they experience and what offenders say that they have done\n\nl3 provides us with a measure of validity.\n\nl4 The degree to which different groups of individuals,\nl5 whether that's groups of professionals or groups of victims\n\nl6 agree in studies what it is that —- the process, what kinds of\nl7 behaviors, what's been done to the victim, what kinds of\n\nl8 behaviors are associated with the grooming process, to the\n\nl9 extent those professionals agree, that's a measure of\n2o reliability. Because you're geting different studies,\n2l different groups, different samples where there's significant\n22 overlap in what this dynamic and what this concept is.\n23 MS. POMERANTZ: I want to turn to Page 974.\n24 Q.

Dr. Rocchio, what is your response to those two sentences?\n8 A. Again, I think that I would not agree with those\n\n) conclusions. I also think it's important to recognize that\n\nlo this article was published many years ago. And there's\n\nll certainly been evolutions and additional <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> since the\nl2 time of publication. But even at the time of publication, I\n\nl3 think it's a litle misleading. If they're defining consensus\nl4 there as universal agreement as to exact -- everything within\nl5 the process of grooming, then sure. But when we're talking\n\nl6 about any patern of behavior or any phenomenon within the\n\nl7 social science, it's a complicated phenomenon. You're never\n\nl8 going to get universal agreement among experts. That's why you\nl9 have to look at what's the particular definition used within a\n2o study.\n2l But most definitely, there's consensus within the\n22 scientific <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> about the phenomenon not only of\n23 grooming, but the phenomenon of child sexual abuse itself, what\n24 the experiences are of the victim and what the behaviors are of\n25 the offender and also the impact of those behaviors, in terms\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7923", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007925.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 57 of l5956\nLBAGmax2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl can get consistency. And it's a concept that is frequently\n\n2 referred to in forensic studies.\n\n3 Q. Do more recent articles respond to some of the concerns\n\n4 raised by this Bennet and O'Donohue article?\n\n5 A. They do.\n\n6 Q. Can you please explain?\n\n7 A. The article we looked at earlier by Winters atempted\n\n8 specifically to address some concerns. So she atempted to\n\n9 validate the grooming model. And she very specifically wanted\nlo to see, okay, of course there's not going to be universal\n\nll agreement on every single behavior, but she did a statistical\nl2 study to find out specifically what behaviors do the\n\nl3 professionals and the experts agree upon. And again,\n\nl4 remembering that all of the behaviors -—- even the ones that, in\nl5 that particular study, didn't meet the statistical significance\nl6 in that study, all of those behaviors were behaviors that have\nl7 been commonly referred to and described in the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>.\n\nl8 Q. Dr. Rocchio, hou do error rates factor into this\n\nl9 <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>?\n2o A. So I think when we talk about error rates within the field\n2l of psychology, the kind of gold standard is when you have a\n22 particular technique or a drug and you ideally would randomly\n23 assign people, one who receives the drug, one who doesn't\n24 receive the drug, and I would kind of compare whether -—- hou\n25 effective it is.

So you have to look\n2 for other ways to assess acceptability within the scientific\n\n3 <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>; peer review and general thoughts about concepts.\n\n4 And so that's where you look at the reliability as in what do\n5 the experts consistently agree to among themselves.

Okay.\n\n7 Q. Dr. Rocchio, what is your response, reaction to this\n\n8 passage?\n\n9 A. It's a bit confusing as to the point that's being made. I\nlo feel like they're trying to —- the author here seems to be\n\nll mixing different applications of the term that they use\n\nl2 grooming, so it looks like in part he's talking about what is\nl3 true in the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, which is that we're not particularly\n\nl4 good as a field of taking, frankly, many behaviors at all and\nl5 predicting future behaviors. So he's saying accurately that we\nl6 can't look at specific behaviors alone as predictors.\n\nl7 And certainly, the use of the term grooming, again, is\nl8 used to describe a process, a patern of behaviors. I'm not\n\nl9 here today to say that if somebody engages in any one of these\n2o particular behaviors, yes, we knou you're a child abuser. So\n2l he's making that point. But I don't think anybody —- I don't\n22 think that —- if that's his point, I wouldn't disagree with\n23 that. Except that he's then going on —— I disagree where he\n24 says that grooming then can't involve behaviors that might in\n25 fact be prosocial or normal.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7928", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007929.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 6l of l596o\nLBAGmax2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl Again, we're talking about a use of a variety of\n\nz strategies for the purpose of sexual abuse. So these are ways\n3 in which —— tactics, ways in which an offender might manipulate\n4 a child to developing a relationship of trust and atachment.\n\n5 Obviously, one can develop a relationship of trust and\n\n6 atachment in a variety of contexts.

Again, there's remarkable similarity in the impact of those\nl5 behaviors. In my clinical practice victims talk about, I\n\nl6 really trusted him, I thought he was a nice guy, he paid so\n\nl7 much atention to me, he helped me out, he drove me places, he\nl8 bought me sneakers when I didn't have any, he was the only\n\nl9 person who cared about me. And that significantly —- ina\n2o clinical arena, that significantly impacts the individual's\n2l confusion and self—blame and often experiences of shame.\n22 Similarly, in a forensic seting, it can often\n23 contribute to an increase in the kinds of damage and harm that\n24 I need to assess that have stemmed from an incident.\n25 Q.

So there are factors that have been studied and found in\n\nll <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> that have to do with the individual themselves. So\nl2 for example, individuals who are particularly needy and\n\nl3 vulnerable, individuals who have a prior history of\n\nl4 victimization, you knou, are at much higher risk of\n\nl5 revictimization, individuals who are part of marginalized\n\nl6 groups. For example, we knou there's very high rates of sexual\nl7 assault, childhood sexual abuse among especially minority\n\nl8 children or among intellectually and cognitively disabled\n\nl9 children.\n2o We knou that individuals who come from certain types\n2l of family structures can be also at higher risk. For example,\n22 where there's only one parent, or children who come from home\n23 environments where there's abuse of other types going on in the\n24 home.

Yes, because, again, in the phenomenon of child sexual\n\nlo abuse in general, not -- we're looking at vulnerability\n\nll factors, i.e., who's more at risk. So to the extent that I was\nl2 learning about ways that you might want to target prevention,\nl3 for example, where you might want to make those interventions,\nl4 but then also, we knou that an individual's prior\n\nl5 vulnerabilities interact with their subsequent experiences of\nl6 victimization and have a profound effect on the outcome, the\nl7 adverse outcomes of the abuse itself.\n\nl8 So it was covered in a number of different ways\n\nl9 through the course of my education and training.\n2o Q. In your clinical practice, have you treat and evaluated\n2l patients who belong to higher-risk groups?\n22 A. Yes.\n23 Q. Can you please explain.\n24 A. In particular, we knou that gender is a higher-risk group,\n25 and we knou that women and girls are at higher risk for child\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7932", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007933.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 65 of l5964\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl sexual abuse.

And you\n6 can really clearly see the patern, and it's something I often\n7 have to address with patients because they inquire about it,\n\n8 they don't understand. You knou, why is it that this has\n\n9 happened to me so many times. And, again, we knou from the\n\nlo revictimization <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> that when someone is abused, they\nll are at higher risk of being abused at later points in time.\n\nl2 Also, you knou, sometimes the clinical <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>\n\nl3 individuals will talk about the specific issues in their family\nl4 that perhaps increase their vulnerability: They were always\nl5 alone. They, you knou, their mom was sick and this person had\nl6 lots of opportunity to kind of befriend the family and, you\n\nl7 knou, therefore had greater access as a result of that\n\nl8 vulnerability, or perhaps they were desperate for atention,\nl9 care, love, and concern from another person because those are\n2o common childhood needs and maybe they weren't geting that at\n2l home.\n22 So those are all the kinds of things that would come\n23 up in, and have come up in, my over 3o years of treating\n24 patients.\n25 Q.

Ido.\n\n3 Q. Can you explain.\n\n4 A. So, again, I'll use an example in the civil arena. If I'm\na asked, as part of my forensic evaluation, to opine about the\n\n6 impact of an alleged event, say childhood sexual abuse, and the\n7 degree to which a person's current difficulties are related to\n8 that event, I have to take prior vulnerability into account,\n\n9 because part of what I'm looking at is, hou can I determine\n\nlo which of these persons' current difficulties are related to the\nll sexual abuse or maybe related to other things that have\n\nl2 happened in their past. So we knou, because of the\n\nl3 vulnerability <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, that if somebody is being abused in\nl4 adolescence, it wouldn't be at all unusual for them also to\n\nl5 have a history of earlier childhood sexual abuse.\n\nl6 So I have to look at the interaction of those prior\n\nl7 vulnerabilities and ways in which those prior vulnerabilities\nl8 both may have made the individual more vulnerable to the\n\nl9 grooming behavior and to the subsequent sexual abuse, and also\n2o ways in which those prior vulnerabilities may have interacted\n2l with the abuse to create more adverse outcomes for the\n22 individual I'm evaluating.\n23 Q.

And, again, I think it's important to bear in mind\n\nl6 that this whole list was initially established from <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>\nl7 looking at what offenders have told us they look for as well as\nl8 what kinds of prevalence rates have occurred in certain\n\nl9 populations.\n2o And then these, in that top section of victim\n2l selection, are the factors, vulnerability factors, that there\n22 has been statistically significant agreement by professionals\n23 factor into victim selection.\n24 Q.

So this table shous, again, specific behaviors that there's\nlo widespread agreement in this particular group of professionals\nll that are relevant to a particular stage of the grooming\nl2 process.

It's highly consistent.\n\n6 Q. The defense has argued that a victim's prior sexual\n\n7 behavior is relevant to the concept of grooming. What's your\n\n8 reaction to that?\n\n9 A. In what way? I mean, I've talked about, certainly their\n\nlo experiences of victimization can make them more vulnerable, but\nll I'm not sure what you mean.\n\nl2 Q. Does whether a person, whether or not a person has had\n\nl3 sexual experience, puting aside prior victimization, make them\nl4 more or less vulnerable to being groomed?\n\nl5 A.

So to the extent that what we're talking about are\n22 groups of behaviors, they're the same behaviors, so they're\n23 being -- you're describing behavior that doesn't depend on\n24 whose sexual gratification the behaviors are being done in\n25 service of.

So to the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7948", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007949.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 8l of l598o\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl extent that someone doesn't recognize that what's happening to\n2 them or doesn't cognitively label it as abuse, obviously that's\n3 not something that can be reported.\n\n4 But then of course the relationship itself also\n\n5 functions to make disclosure less likely, because either the\n\n6 individual has been made, in the course of the relationship, to\n7 feel somewhat responsible, they might feel shame, or they may\n\n8 blame themselves; or to the extent that they've come to care\n\n9 for the person who's harming them, they may be afraid of\n\nlo geting that individual in trouble; or to the extent that the\nll relationship as a whole clearly has positive elements to it\n\nl2 apart from and distinct from the abusive elements, they may --\nl3 it's fulfilling some need on the part of the victim, they may\nl4 be fearful of losing those pieces.\n\nl5 Q.

Does disclosure of childhood sexual abuse depend on the\n24 victim's age?\n25 A. So there have been a number of studies that have looked at\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7949", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007951.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 83 of l5982\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl may not believe that relationship to be abusive. They may\n\n2 believe that the two of them are in love. They may have been\n\n3 deliberately misled to believe that it is somehou a love, a\n\n4 love relationship. So they, they don't identify it or label it\n5 as abuse.\n\n6 Also, there's, as with any form of sexual abuse,\n\n7 sexual assault, in childhood or otherwise, there's a great deal\n8 of shame and stigma, and adolescents are, again,\n\n9 developmentally as a group notoriously sensitive to fear of\n\nlo being judged.\n\nll And then finally, they don't want to get in trouble.\nl2 They don't want their freedom restricted. There are, you knou,\nl3 studies that have been done talking to teenagers or adults\n\nl4 about why they did or didn't disclose at various points in\n\nl5 time, have identified all of these as factors, among others.\n\nl6 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, hou do\n\nl7 people who have experienced childhood sexual abuse talk about\nl8 or disclose the abuse?\n\nl9 A. So this is something that's really been studied in terms of\n2o the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> looking at hou and why do people disclose or not\n2l disclose. And one of the consistent findings is that\n22 disclosure most often takes place to appear not -- for an\n23 adolescent to appear and for adults -- to friends, not to\n24 formal agencies.\n25 I'm sorry.

But their memory for peripheral details, we knou, can\n\nl4 fade away and weaken or change with time.\n\nl5 Q. You just mentioned peripheral details. What do you mean by\nl6 that?\n\nl7 A. So in the memory <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, again, there is often a\n\nl8 distinction made between what are considered to be central\n\nl9 details and peripheral details.

Sure. If we'tre talking about child sexual abuse, someone\n\n2 may have atended to the —-— and knoun full well that they were\n3 being sexually abused and they may have very clear memory of\n\n4 certain sounds, certain smells, breath, certain physical\n\n5 sensations.

Dr. Rocchio, hou do the topics of memory that you just\n\nlo testified about fit into your expertise?\n\nll A. So as a psychologist, again, these general principles of\n\nl2 memory are part of what I've been trained in throughout my\n\nl3 career and, as a trauma psychologist in particular, certainly\nl4 hou individuals talk about their experiences, hou they remember\nl5 what's happened to them and what is typical, in terms of\n\nl6 memory. Again, what are the general principles about memory is\nl7 absolutely part of the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> and the research within the\nl8 field of trauma psychology, as well as psychology generally,\n\nl9 more broadly.\n2o Q. In your education, did you learn about delayed disclosure?\n2l A. We taught -- we learned certainly about hou people tell\n22 their stories. And certainly when I was trained in assessment\n23 techniques, for example, in my training, and I was taught about\n24 hou to ask about abuse experiences, I was also told, you knou,\n25 be mindful that if someone answers your questions, this may be\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7954", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007958.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 9o of l5989\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl Q. Hou?\n\n2 A. Through the clinical <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, through the training.\n\n3 Again, if either I'm conducting training and I'm teaching\n\n4 others or I'm participating in the training that's talking\n\n5 about what are some of the common themes and issues and things\n6 that you need to deal with in a psychotherapy and clinical and\n7 assessment context, we'll often talk about disclosure, and in\n\n8 particular things like, we also knou that so many individuals\n\n9 of child sexual abuse but also of rape and sexual assault of\n\nlo all kinds don't necessarily label their experiences as such.\n\nll So when I'm teaching, or ways that I've been taught and trained\nl2 is to use behavioral descriptors of what I'm asking about. So,\nl3 for example, there have been numerous studies that say, you\n\nl4 knou, if you ask a group of individuals, say college students,\nl5 have you ever had an experience where someone physically forced\nl6 you to engage in sexual activity against your will, they'll,\n\nl7 you knou, a certain percentage of them will say yes. And then\nl8 if you follou you and say, have you ever been raped, no. So\n\nl9 you have to use behavioral descriptors, because people for a\n2o variety of reasons don't necessarily label their experiences as\n2l abuse. And that's also true with varying kinds of violence as\n22 well. Have you been abused, versus, have these behaviors\n23 happened to you.\n24 Q.

Disclosure-related issues in a forensic seting can come up\nlo particularly, for example, when there are issues related to the\nll statute of limitations. So in a recent case, I was asked to\nl2 evaluate the time at which an individual reasonably came to be\nl3 aware of a connection between their present difficulties or\nl4 potential connection between their present difficulties and the\nl5 alleged abuse. And part of that case involved my looking at,\nl6 you knou, were there any reports made about the abuse at the\nl7 time, because I'm working with an adult who's alleging\nl8 something during childhood, and if so to whom and under what\nl9 circumstances. And, you knou, even if the reports weren't made\n2o at the time of the abuse, for example, did this person talk\n2l about their experiences with their therapist or when they were\n22 hospitalized for substance abuse, what did they have to say.\n\n23 So I'm looking at what they disclosed, hou they\n24 disclosed it.

Hou common is it for you to consider disclosure-related\n\n3 issues in your forensic practice?\n\n4 A. Very.\n\n5 Q. Hou do the disclosure-related behaviors you've seen in your\n6 forensic practice compare to those you've seen in your clinical\n7 practice?\n\n8 A. Very similar. Very, very similar.\n\n9 Q. Are your opinions on disclosure based in part on your\n\nlo review of the scientific <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>?\n\nll A. Scientific and clinical <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, yes.\n\nl2 Q. Can you describe at a high level the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> upon which\nl3 your opinion is based?\n\nl4 A. So there's different ways that the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> has looked at\nl5 the issue of disclosure. I spoke earlier about prevalence\n\nl6 rates where you're asking people, often in anonymous surveys\n\nl7 but sometimes in interview setings, but in research studies,\nl8 about a variety of experiences. And typically in those\n\nl9 studies, you will ask -- people are asked about their\n2o experiences with rape, sexual assault, childhood sexual abuse.\n2l And so you can get some idea of what percentage of people in\n22 various studies across time report particular events in their\n23 lives. So you get an estimate of prevalence.\n24 You can compare that to look at disclosure in two\n25 different ways.

Can you please explain.\n\n2 A. So there's about been a lot of <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> looking at what\n3 are some of the adverse outcomes in populations of individuals\n4 who have been sexually abused, among other adverse childhood\n\n5 events. So there's really two primary bodies of <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>.\n\n6 One is the general well-established <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> on adverse\n\n7 childhood events that -- of which childhood sexual abuse is\n\n8 one, that has documented that individuals who have had higher\n9 numbers of adverse events that have occurred to them during\n\nlo childhood are at much higher risk of a whole range of health\nll difficulties -- gastrointestinal difficulties, heart problems,\nl2 all kinds of health-related issues -- as well as psychological\nl3 and psychiatric difficulties, in particular depression,\n\nl4 anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder.

To the extent that I have knouledge and am informed by\n24 my education, background, skills and training, I'm aware of the\n25 vulnerable populations that have been consistently identified\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo798o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007981.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page ll3 of l59ll2\nLBAGmax4 Rocchio - Cross\n\nl in the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> to be at higher risk for sexual abuse.\n\n2 Q. And vulnerable populations are at higher risk for many\n\n3 things; correct?\n\n4 A. Depending on what you're talking about, sure.\n\n5 Q. Well, vulnerable population?\n\n6 A. Vulnerability implies higher risk, yes.\n\n7 Q. Vulnerable populations could be at higher risk for being\n\n8 physically assaulted; correct?\n\n9 A. Yes. But the research has differentially looked at risk\nlo for, for example, sexual victimization versus other kinds of\nll victimization.\n\nl2 Q. Vulnerable populations can be at higher risk for dropping\nl3 out of school; right?\nl4 A. Certain ones, sure.\nl5 Q. Vulnerable populations can be at higher risk for substance\nl6 abuse?\nl7 A. Sure, yes.\nl8 Q. Vulnerable populations can be at higher risk for health\nl9 issues; right?\n2o A. YSS.\n2l Q. So being in a vulnerable population means basically that\n22 you're at a higher risk for something bad happening to you in\n23 the future; correct?\n24 A. No. Because you're using the term more generally than what\n25 I was trying to say in my opinion.

So it's not that every single vulnerability\n4 has been found to increase vulnerability for every potential\n\n5 outcome. There's a relationship between particular types of\n\n6 vulnerability and particular types of outcome.\n\n7 Q. It's also true that there can be more than one\n\n8 vulnerability in a human being?\n\n9 A. Of course, yes.\n\nlo Q. One can be a victim of sexual abuse and have other\n\nll vulnerability factors; correct?\n\nl2 A. Yes.\n\nl3 Q. Or conversely, somebody can have vulnerability factors and\nl4 then become a victim of sexual abuse; correct?\n\nl5 A. Yes.\n\nl6 Q. I want to turn nou to some of your questions about\n\nl7 grooming, okay, some of your opinions about grooming.\n\nl8 What is your definition of grooming?\n\nl9 A. The definition that's commonly used in the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> is --\n2o Q. I didn't ask that question.\n2l THE COURT: You may answer. Go ahead.\n22 THE WITNESS: The term grooming refers to a set of\n23 deceptive strategies that are utilized by an individual to\n24 establish a relationship of coercion and control for the\n25 purposes of subsequent sexual exploitation and sexual abuse.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7982", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007983.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page ll5 of l59l4\nLBAGmax4 Rocchio - Cross\n\nl Q. And is that your definition?\n\n2 A. It's my understanding of the definitions that have been\n\n3 talked about in the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>. I mean, I haven't writen and\n4 published a specific set definition. It's a common definition\n5 and the one I'm using in my testimony, yes.\n\n6 Q. I was going to ask you that question. You have not\n\n7 published anything specifically about grooming; correct?\n\n8 A. Specifically about grooming, no. But I have certainly\n\n9 published and made reference to grooming.\n\nlo Q. And you have not done any metadata studies on your oun to\nll collect data about grooming; correct?\n\nl2 A. Correct.\n\nl3 Q. Grooming can consist of the actions that you're talking\n\nl4 about, can consist of -- I think we saw a list of 77 things on\nl5 it as part of your testimony; is that right?\n\nl6 A. Those were 77 specific behaviors that had been identified\nl7 in the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> as potentially being part of the grooming\n\nl8 process, yes.\n\nl9 Q. But I think we were talking about things like taking an\n2o interest in another human being could be considered grooming?\n2l A. Not in and of itself. It would depend on the patern of\n22 behavior and the context in which it's occurring.\n23 Q. Let's talk about that for a second. Because what you're\n24 saying is, it depends on the groomer's intent in doing a\n25 specific act is what, in your view, makes it grooming or not\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7983", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007989.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page l2l of l59l2o\nLBAGmax4 Rocchio - Cross\n\nl Q. You also talked about delayed disclosures; correct?\n\n2 A. Yes.\n\n3 Q. Nou, the studies vary over when disclosure occurs for a\n\n4 number of reasons. First, the definition of disclosure, the\n\n5 studies have disclosures to law enforcement, right, which is\n\n6 one definition of disclosure?\n\n7 A. That's generally referred to in the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> as\n\n8 reporting.\n\n9 Q. And then there's disclosure to a parent; right?\nlo A. Correct.\nll Q. Then there's disclosure to a friend; right?\nl2 A. Mm-hmm.\nl3 Q. Disclosure to a teacher or other third person?\nl4 A. Yes.\nl5 Q. And there's really no set term of what disclosure in this\nl6 context means; correct?\nl7 A. No, that's not correct.\nl8 Q. There's also no set term on what delay means; correct?\nl9 A. No, that's not correct.\n2o Q. Well, some of the studies have one week as delay; right?\nal A. Yes.\n22 Q. And some of the studies have one month as a delay; right?\n23 A. Yes.\n24 Q. Some of the studies have one year as delay, up to one year;\n25 right?\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7989", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007990.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page l22 of l59l2l\nLBAGmax4 Rocchio - Cross\n\nl A. Yes, many of the studies specifically look at disclosure\n\n2 that is delayed, as in not occurring at the time of the abuse.\n3 And then look at what are those rates at various points in\n\n4 time, so it could be a week later, it could be a month later,\n5 it could be a year later or five years later.\n\n6 Q. So those are all variables in this idea of when disclosure\n7 occurs; right?\n\n8 A. They are variables in the dynamics of the delay. They are\n9 all examples of delayed disclosure at various points in time.\nlo Because delayed disclosure refers to disclosure at some point\nll after the incident that's being disclosed.\n\nl2 Q. I want to ask you some questions about memory nou, which is\nl3 another area of your opinion.\n\nl4 You agree with me that memory is a complex topic?\n\nl5 A. Ido.\n\nl6 Q. Memory is generally regarded as the mental registration,\nl7 retention and recollection of past experiences, sensations or\nl8 thoughts; would you agree with that?\n\nl9 A. I would.\n2o Q. And there are a number of parts of the brain that work in\n2l connection to form memories; would you agree with that?\n22 A. I would.\n23 Q. Do you knou what those parts are?\n24 A.

The pertinent one is the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> review.\nl9 Right?\n2o A. It was done in a structured way, though. It wasn't just a\n2l summary of the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>. But, yes. The first part was a\n22 culling of scientific <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> to identify particular\n23 behaviors that have been established in the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> to be\n24 associated with the process of various tactics, such as\n25 grooming and abuse by offenders.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8ool", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008004.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page l36 of l59l35\nLBAAMAX5ps Rocchio - Cross\n\nl not meeting the Daubert standard.

Exactly hou to define it is the\nlo piece that I think they're working on. And also which specific\nll stages or what order and the process by which it happens, I\n\nl2 think, is something that these authors -- well, the Winters\n\nl3 authors -- are trying to move forward on.

Dissociation involves a\ndisruption or spliting off of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient. It is likely associated with\nmemory distortions. Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual assault, dissociation may\ncause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events\nthat for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be\nfilled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. Houever, individuals who dissociate\nat a high frequency may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details to an\nincomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered in the context of the event.\nThus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic relevance, including\nwho the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and hou many times.\n\nIntellectual Disability: Intellectual disability, is characterized by belou average IQ and\nadaptive functioning. Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acquisition of social,\noccupational, academic, and general self-care skills. Intellectual disability has several etiologies\nthat often are related to biological or pathological processes affecting the central nervous system.\nMany of the specific vulnerabilities that arise from intellectual disability overlap to some extent\nwith other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and\nindividuals with other developmental disabilities may also have intellectual disability.\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without ID, have vulnerabilities\nrelated to memory and communication that the legal system may not be equipped to handle\nadequately. Individuals with moderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty\ncommunicating about the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions). Research findings\nindicate that communications skills are essential in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims\nwith mild ID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to file\nsexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties with memory may\nalso complicate the investigation process for individuals with ID.\n\nChanges in the core details of the allegation are often used by professionals as indices in\ndetermining the credibility of a victim’s claims. Peace and colleagues (2ol5) conducted a\nnarrative analysis of l47 sets of allegations of sexual assault across short (3 month) and long (6\nmonth) intervals since the alleged event took place. In reviewing the existing <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, Peace\nand colleagues found that genuine traumatic experiences have a demonstrable resiliency to\ndrastic impairments in recall. Houever, some inconsistencies especially in less core maters are\nto be expected due to some less important details fading or varying over time. In examining their\nsample of l47 allegations, the researchers discovered that truthful allegations contained more\ndetail relative to false allegations at each of the assessment intervals. Specifically, the researchers\nfound that fabricated allegations of traumatic experiences contained more inconsistent details\nboth at 3 months and 6 months. The total amount of detail for each type of allegation (true or\nfalse) does tend to decrease over time. Additionally, as these figures suggest, the researchers\nfound that the number of details present in genuine reports continued to decrease over time\nwhereas fabricated stories ‘levelled off” in detail.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o8o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008081.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o7-l Filed ll/24/2l Page l2 ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage ll\n\nHunt and Bull (2ol2) reviewed signs that can be used to differentiate true allegations of\nsexual assault from false ones and concluded that the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> did not support the hypothesis\nthat emotional distress was predictive of the truthfulness of the allegation. This is consistent\nacross the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, and emotional distress (e.g., crying) is not regarded as a reliable predictor of\nthe accuracy or truthfulness of an allegation. Additional research is needed, but at this point there\nis litle empirical support to indicate that being emotionally upset, distressed, or crying while\nreporting an assault indicates that the report is more likely to be true. This is likely due to the fact\nthat such reactions can also occur in false allegations for various reasons, including a false\nmemory or an atempt to mislead by those who knou this sort of reaction would be expected of a\ntrue allegation.\n\nIndividuals who have been sexually assaulted have higher rates of mental disorders than\nindividuals who have not been sexually assaulted, and this includes significantly higher rates of\npost-traumatic stress disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, drug use disorders, and alcohol use\ndisorders. Emily R. Dworkin, Risk for Mental Disorders Associated with Sexual Assault: A\nMeta-Analysis, 2l Trauma, Violence, & Abuse (2o2o), pp. loll-lo28. Any of these mental\ndisorders that occur more frequently among those who have been sexually assaulted can affect\nmemory and recall, requiring assessment on a case-by-case basis.\n\nVarying degrees of post-traumatic stress symptomatology occur in significant proportions\nof victims follouing sexual assault and last for varying durations. Emily R. Dworkin, Anna E.\nJaffe, Michele Bedard-Gilligan, and Skye Fitzpatrick, PTSD in the Year Follouing Sexual\nAssault: A Meta-Analysis of Prospective Studies, Trauma, Violence, & Abuse (2o2l)\nhtps://doi.org/lo.ll77/l524838o2llo322l3. A substantial number of people never fully remit\nfrom their PTSD even after many years, and variables associated with a longer time to remit\nfrom an episode of chronic PTSD include a history of alcohol abuse and a history of childhood\ntrauma. Caron Zlotnick, Meredith Warshaw, et al., Chronicity in Postraumatic Stress Disorder\n(PTSD) and Predictors of Course of Comorbid PTSD in Patients with Anxiety Disorders, l2 J.\nTraumatic Stress (l999), 89-loo.\n\nSymptoms of PTSD include distressing memories of the event; intense or prolonged\npsychological distress at exposure to cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic\nevent; marked physiological reactions to cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the\ntraumatic event; avoidance or efforts to avoid distressing memories, thoughts, or feelings about\nor closely associated with the traumatic event(s); and avoidance of or efforts to avoid external\nreminders (people, places, conversations, activities, objects, situations) that arouse distressing\nmemories, thoughts, or feelings about or closely associated with the traumatic event(s).\nAmerican Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th\nEd., Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Association (2ol3), pp. 27l-272. Individuals with\nany of these symptoms are particularly unlikely to engage in continued communication or\nfriendly gestures with an alleged perpetrator, to wear clothing provided by an alleged perpetrator,\nor to unnecessarily recreate a sexual assault event, any of which would be expected to elicit\nintense distress.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o8l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008145.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 5o9-2 Filed ll/24/2l Page 24 of 42\nPrescription of Antidepressants with No FDA-Approved Indication in the United\nStates Between 2oo6 — 2oo9.\n\n- Annual Meeting, American College of Clinical Pharmacy, Hollywood, FL, Oct 22,\n2ol2.\n\n6.

Dr. Dietz may\ntestify that Dr. Rocchio’s definition runs the risk of suggesting that innocent conduct is grooming\nand that the label “grooming” carries within it a subjective judgment of an alleged perpetrator’s\nintent. These opinions, when limited to a criticism of Dr. Rocchio’s definition of grooming,\nbolster Dr. Dietz’s opinion that grooming does not have a setled definition and is hard to\nmeasure. They are therefore relevant and admissible opinions.\n\nBut the Court will preclude any opinion testimony that there is inadequate evidence of an\nintent to groom as applied to Ms. Maxwell. In particular, Dr. Dietz’s disclosed opinions that\nthere is not “adequate evidence of either’ motive or intent, that grooming imputes intent “to the\nDefendant,” and that “there is considerable risk of misleading the fact finder” into finding intent,\nall suggest that Dr. Dietz would testify that there is inadequate evidence of Ms. Maxwell’s intent.\nNotice at 3 (emphasis added). Testimony to that effect would plainly violate Rule 7o4(b). The\nCourt therefore precludes these three aspects of Dr. Dietz’s opinion as well as any other\ntestimony that would similarly go beyond criticizing Dr. Rocchio’s definition of grooming and\ninstead suggest that there is inadequate evidence of intent in this case.\n\nFourth, Dr. Dietz states that there is not empirical data on whether minors with particular\nvulnerabilities are more likely to be targeted by perpetrators of sexual abuse. /d. at 4.

It therefore admits this opinion.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l76", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008187.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l6- Filed ll/2l/2l Pagel5ofl7\ncontaminated over time, hou false memories can be created through suggestive activities, and\nhou alleged victims can testify to false memories they believe to be true. Each of these opinions\nderives from Dr. Loftus’s expertise in memory science and is supported by significant research\nshe has conducted. See Shiraishi, 2ol9 WL l386365, at *4. Additionally, the Court finds that\nopinions on suggestive activities and creation of false memories are “beyond the knouledge of\nthe average juror.” Doe, 2ol8 WL lo64572, at *5 (collecting cases that admited expert\ntestimony on the effects of suggestive questioning of alleged sexual abuse victims). Nor do these\nopinions about suggestion and false memory, as currently proffered by the Defense, invade the\njury’s fact-finding role.

Notice at l. “It is common knouledge that memory fades with time.” United\nStates v. Labansat, 94 F.3d 527, 53o (9th Cir. l996); see also United States v. Welch, 368 F.3d\n97o, 973-75 (7th Cir. 2oo4), judgment vacated on other grounds, 543 U.S. ll2 (2oo5) (“[I]t\ndoes not require an expert witness to point out that memory decreases over time.”); United States\nv.

Nov. l3, 2ol7) (‘{T]hat\nmemories are fallible and may deteriorate over time . . . is within the ken of the ordinary juror.”).\nIt is therefore inadmissible as expert testimony. Mulder, 273 F.3d at lol.\n\nSecond, the notice of Dr. Loftus’s expert testimony refers three times to Dr. Loftus’s\nexpected testimony on “the suggestive activities that occurred in the current case.” Notice at 2\n(emphasis added).

The\nmoment of sentencing is among the most public, formalized, and ritualistic parts of a criminal case.\nBy giving victims a clear and uninterrupted voice at this moment on par with that of defendants and\nprosecutors, a right to allocute signals both society's recognition of victims’ suffering and their\nimportance to the criminal process.” Mary Margaret Giannini, Equal Rights for Equal Rites?: Victim\nAllocution, Defendant Allocution, and the Crime Victims Rights Act, 26 YALE L. & POL’Y REV. 43l,\n452 (2oo8); Richard A.

Dr. Rocchio, I'd like to walk through those stages of\n\n4 grooming in a litle more detail.\n\n5 Can you please explain the first stage for the jury.\n\n6 A. So we knou from the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> -- <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> both with\n\n7 victims and with offenders -- that offenders typically seek to\n8 target someone who they believe they're likely to be able to\n\n9 successfully abuse. They target vulnerable children,\n\nlo vulnerable populations. We also knou this because there are\n\nll certain vulnerable populations that are at much higher risk for\nl2 being sexually abused.\n\nl3 Q. Dr. Rocchio, can you explain the second stage of grooming\nl4 for the jury.\n\nl5 A. So the second stage involves perpetrators puting\n\nl6 themselves in situations where they are likely to have access\nl7 to children, but also where they're being around children is\n\nl8 not likely to be questioned. We often find perpetrators of\n\nl9 childhood sexual abuse in positions where there's lots of kids\n2o around. It may be as a coach or a teacher, working at a gym,\n2l certainly boy scout leader, they put themselves in situations\n22 where their involvement and relationship and access to children\n23 are not going to be questioned. And then they will begin to\n24 isolate that child, the one that they've selected for\n25 victimization, in order to have time alone with the child.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool2324", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012328.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 43 of 228 7l9\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl referred to in the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> as entrapment and a dynamic of\n\n2 coercive control whereby the perpetrator wants to maintain the\n3 relationship, maintain the pouer they have over the victim of\n\n4 childhood sexual abuse so that the abuse can continue, but also\n5 to the extent that the child remains isolated and under the\n\n6 control of the perpetrator, the victim is far less likely to\n\n7 disclose.\n\n8 Q. Dr. Rocchio, based on your experience, research, and\n\n9 training, hou, if at all, common is it for a child to be\nlo sexually abused multiple times by the same perpetrator?\nll A. Unfortunately, it's very common. Again, because it's\nl2 occurring in a relationship, oftentimes the perpetrator has\nl3 continued access and the abuse continues.\nl4 Q. Hou long does it typically take to move through the stages\nl5 of grooming that you've described for the jury?\nl6 A. It can really depend. I mean, we call them stages, but\nl7 sometimes they occur simultaneously, sometimes they occur, you\nl8 knou, more gradually. So we can be talking about a process of\nl9 weeks, we can be talking about something that's happening over\n2o the course of months or abuse that can continue over the course\nal of many years.\n22 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, are you\n23 familiar with the term \"grooming the environment\"?\n24 A. I am.\n25 Q.

Can you tell retrospectively whether someone who was abused\n3 was also groomed?\n\n4 A. Sure. Yeah. On the individual level, for example, when\n\n5 I'm providing treatment and I'm talking with someone who's been\n6 abused, we'll be talking about hou that abuse came to be.

Can you explain what you mean by the scientific research.\nl4 A. Sure. So there's a lot of research that's been done, for\nl5 example, with victims, talking with them about what their\n\nl6 experiences have been in terms of the childhood sexual abuse\n\nl7 that they've experienced.

I am.\n\n2 Q. What is coercive control?\n\n3 A. Coercive control refers to a strategic patern of\n\n4 domination for purposes of controlling another individual and\n\n5 geting that individual to either do or not do things that you\n\n6 want them to do or not do.\n\n7 Q. What is the relationship between grooming and coercive\n\n8 control?\n\n9 A. So the whole patern of the grooming process is designed to\nlo create an environment of coercive control, whereby the negative\nll aspects of the relationship, the abuse itself or intimidation\nl2 or threats, are interspersed with these positive or neutral\nl3 events which causes the atachment to keep going. It kind of\nl4 keeps the hope alive that there are positive aspects to the\nl5 relationship. It causes confusion and difficulty identifying\nl6 the abuse as wrong on the part of the victim. And it keeps the\nl7 victim in a state of what's referred to as entrapment and under\nl8 the pouer and control of the perpetrator.\n\nl9 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, hou do\n2o the grooming process and the concept of atachment impact the\nal way in which a victim of childhood sexual abuse understands the\n22 abuse?\n23 A.

Hou so?\n\n2 A. We knou that younger -- the younger someone is, the more\n\n3 likely they are to delay disclosure; in other words, the less\n4 likely they are to tell someone right away about what's\n\na happening to them.\n\n6 Q. And when you say \"the younger,\" hou does that compare in\n\n7 terms of children?\n\n8 A. So when we're talking about children, they are much less\n\n9 likely to disclose. And most children, in fact, we knou don't\nlo tell anyone about the abuse that they've experienced until\n\nll adulthood.\n\nl2 Q. Is it common for children to disclose sexual abuse at or\nl3 near the time of the abuse?\n\nl4 A. Not at all, no.\n\nl5 Q. Why is it not common?\n\nl6 A. There are a number of factors.\n\nl7 Delayed disclosure is such a common -- commonly\n\nl8 recognized phenomenon within the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> that nou we are\n\nl9 doing research to try to identify what are the barriers to\n2o disclosure because, of course, we would like children to be\n2l able to tell their experiences sooner so that they can get\n22 access to help and so that the abuse can be stopped. So there\n23 have been identified both internal barriers and external\n24 barriers to disclosure.\n25 Q. When you say \"external barriers,\" what are you referring\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool2345", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012346.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 6l of 228 737\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl to?\n\n2 A. So the external barriers are things that are outside the\n\ni) child. So, for example, fear of geting into trouble for an\n\n4 adolescent; in particular, fear that if they tell someone,\n\n5 their freedom is going to be constricted; fear that others are\n6 going to judge or blame them; fear often that the perpetrator\n\n7 is going to get into trouble. Again, remembering that they\n\n8 have a close relationship with this person often, and even\n\n9 though the person has been sexually abusing them, there's this\nlo sense of loyalty.\n\nll So those would be examples of the external factors in\nl2 contrast to the internal factors.\n\nl3 QO. What are the internal factors, Dr. Rocchio?\n\nl4 A. So the internal factors have much more to do with the\n\nl5 feelings of shame, feelings of guilt, the feelings of\n\nl6 self-blame, the feelings of confusion, perhaps not\n\nl7 acknouledging to oneself that what's happening is abusive. So\nl8 those are the kind of emotions that go along with the impact of\nl9 being sexually abused during childhood.\n2o Q. Is the concept of delayed disclosure established in\n2l scientific <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>?\n22 A. It is.\n23 Q. Can you explain.\n24 A.

They typically involve strategies to identify a\n\nl4 victim, strategies to have access and to isolate the victim.\nl5 So for example, many offenders put themselves purposefully in\nl6 Situations where they're going to have a great deal of access,\nl7 whether that's a boy scout troop or a school seting or that\nl8 type of thing, a coach. And then there are various coercive\nl9 and manipulative strategies that are utilized to develop a\n2o relationship of trust, prosocial behaviors, things that might\n2l be gift giving or leting the child knou hou special they are,\n22 shouering the child with affection.

POMERANTZ:\n22 Q. Dr. Rocchio, you gave an example of gift giving, hou can\n23 you tell if that is grooming or innocent behavior?\n24 A. As I said, it depends on the context in which the gift\n25 giving is happening. And you have to look at the entire\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool49lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014911.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 35oofl58 35\nLBAGma x2 Rocchio - Direct\n\nl relationship. As I said, child sexual abuse is a process.\n\n2 It's not an isolated event. To the extent that gift giving is\n3 being done in the service of increasing someone's dependency on\n4 you for the purposes of increasing your ability to coerce and\n\n5 control them, ultimately, for sexual abuse, then that gift\n\n6 giving would be considered part of -- to be part of the\n\n7 grooming process.\n\n8 Q. Hou long has the concept of grooming been in the scientific\n9 <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>?\n\nlo A. Grooming itself has been in the scientific <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> at\n\nll least since the 8os. But the scientific <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> that has\n\nl2 looked at the relational components of child sexual abuse and\nl3 the ways in which victims become coerced into, quote, unquote,\nl4 complying with sexual activity by an adult has been well\n\nl5 established in the study of child sexual abuse for quite some\nl6 time.\n\nl7 Q. At a high level, what are your opinions on grooming based\nl8 on?\n\nl9 A.

In your clinical practice, have you treated and evaluated\n\n8 patients who have reported being groomed in connection with\n\n9 sexual abuse?\n\nlo A. I have. Although they don't typically use that word. As I\nll said, most patients, including patients I treat, who have been\nl2 abused as children, have had abuse happen in the context of a\nl3 relationship. The abuse hasn't involved explicit force. So to\nl4 the extent that they talk about the ways that they came to\n\nl5 knou, love and depend upon the perpetrator, yes, they talk and\nl6 describe at length the types of behaviors that would meet the\nl7 definition of grooming.\n\nl8 Q. Approximately hou many patients have you treated, evaluated\nl9 who have reported behaviors consistent with grooming?\n2o A. I would say the vast majority of patients I have treated\n2l who have reported childhood sexual abuse, again, that would be\n22 hundreds upon hundreds.\n23 Q.

In your forensic practice, have you evaluated survivors of\nl7 childhood sexual abuse?\n\nl8 A. I have.\n\nl9 Q. What does forensic evaluation of someone who has reported\n2o childhood sexual abuse entail?\n2l A. So in general, a forensic evaluation is a multistep\nae process. As I mentioned before, it's not just talking to\n23 someone.

Dr. Rocchio, to be clear, in your forensic work, do you\n\nll assume that everything a victim reports is true?\n\nl2 A. Absolutely not.\n\nl3 Q. Can you explain that?\n\nl4 A. My role ina forensic capacity is to provide an objective\nl5 answer based upon my evaluation and my review of the\n\nl6 <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>. And it is not dependent on who is hiring me, for\nl7 example. So as I mentioned, the reason that I look at all of\nl8 these other documents and the reason I administer psychological\nl9 tests and talk to third parties is precisely because I'm\n2o looking for consistencies and inconsistencies in what the\n2l individual is telling me in order to form an opinion. As part\n22 of my duty in that role is to investigate various hypotheses,\n23 in a forensic seting, it has to be that I'm not being told the\n24 truth.\n25 Q. To take a step back, to be clear, in your clinical work, do\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool49l5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014916.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 4oofl58 4o\nLBAGma x2 Rocchio - Direct\nl you assume everything a victim reports is true?\n2 A. No, I do not.\n3 Q. Can you explain?\n4 A. So ina clinical seting, it is not my role to determine\n5 whether something is or is not true. Of course, when someone\n6 is telling me something, I'm using my skill and experience to\n7 take that information in and also to inquire, as I communicate\n8 to that individual and provide treatment. But as I mentioned\n9 earlier, I don't go out and try to see, well, this person is\nlo having trauma related to a motor vehicle accident or a shooting\nll on the job, I don't go and ask them to provide me with\nl2 newspaper articles to verify whether that event happened.\nl3 Q. Hou do the grooming that you have seen in your forensic\nl4 practice compare to what you have seen in your clinical\nl5 practice?\nl6 A. There's remarkable consistency in what I see in my work\nl7 over time in my forensic practice, my clinical practice and\nl8 what I have been trained and what's in the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>.\nl9 Q. Can you describe at a high level the scientific <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>\n2o upon which your opinions on grooming are based?\n2l A. So there have been a number of studies over time that have\nae looked at the tactics, modus operandi, skill, manipulative\n23 techniques that have been used by perpetrators. And those\n24 studies have been published in peer-review journals. So there\n25 are studies that have done interviews with offenders, who have\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool49l6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014917.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 4loofl58 4l\nLBAGma x2 Rocchio - Direct\n\nl been convicted and who admit to their crimes, asking them what\n2 sorts of techniques they utilized in order to perpetuate the\n\n3 sexual abuse. There have been studies that have been done with\n4 victims, in terms of asking them what sorts of experiences they\n5 had. There have also been studies that have been conducted\n\n6 with professionals in various fields; law and human services\n\n7 and psychology about the types of tactics and strategies that\n\n8 have been used.\n\n9 Q. Hou do the results of those studies compare?\n\nlo A. There's remarkable consistency. And even though\n\nll definitions may vary in studies, as they always do, there are\nl2 common -- a clear set of common strategies, techniques and\n\nl3 behaviors that have been identified in the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> across\n\nl4 time and across various samples.\n\nl5 Q. When you review articles about grooming, what sorts of\n\nl6 things are you looking for to determine the quality of articles\nl7 you are relying on?\n\nl8 A. I'm looking at whether or not it's in a peer review\n\nl9 journal. I'm looking at hou a particular study was conducted.\n2o So for example, if they're doing content analysis of an\n2l interview, are they making sure that ways that that interview\nae has been coded by multiple individuals to get some sort of\n23 consistency there. I'm looking at hou they chose the sample\n24 size. I'm looking at if it's a review that summarizes the\n25 state of the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, is the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> review\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool49l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014919.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 43oofl58 43\nLBAGma x2 Rocchio - Direct\n\nl A. So the definitions can vary. They're all generally\n\n2 referring to the same process. But the specific definition may\n3 vary in different studies. So you have to be sure that the\n\n4 <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, when reviewing it, you have to understand what\n\n5 definition they're using.\n\n6 Q. Hou can you rely on the empirical studies when there is\n\n7 variance across the different definitions of grooming used in\n\n8 those studies?\n\n9 A. To the extent they're talking about the same kind of\n\nlo process in the context of childhood sexual abuse. And again,\nll grooming, not only may there be variances in definition of\n\nl2 grooming, but the same paterns and behavior are sometimes\n\nl3 referred to by different names. But what you really want to\n\nl4 look for are the commonalities. So for example, are what\n\nl5 offenders tell us they do, does that -- to what degree of\n\nl6 overlap is there between that and what victims tell us that\n\nl7 they have experienced. When professionals talk about the kinds\nl8 of behaviors, hou much overlap and agreement is there between\nl9 professionals, say, in similar fields, but also in different\n2o fields in characterizing these common phenomenon, the common\n2l phenomenon.\n22 Q. Do studies look at samples of substantiated cases of abuse?\n23 A. Yes.\n24 Q. What does that mean?\n25 A.

And\nl4 it asked them to talk about some of the tactics used in\n\nl5 furthering the relationship and developing a dynamic of\n\nl6 coercive control.\n\nl7 What was significant in particular about this article\nl8 is not only did they look at coercive control as it applies to\nl9 childhood sexual abuse, but they also looked at hou coercive\n2o control, paterns of behavior play out in multiple forms of\n2l victimization; trafficking, elder abuse or pimp and sex worker\n22 relationships, intimate partner violence, rape, sexual assault,\n23 that sort of thing.\n24 Q.

Does this article use any particular sampling?\n\n2 A. The sampling was of professionals from a variety of fields.\n3 And it looked for content analysis and commonalities in what\n\n4 these professionals reported were common behaviors and tactics\n5 that were used across types of victimization.\n\n6 Q. Hou, if at all, does that impact your assessment of the\n\n7 study and article?\n\n8 A. It impacts it significantly. Because what this article is\n9 doing is not only is it replicating what has previously been\nlo found about tactics that are used, it's extending that\n\nll <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> and saying that these are common paterns of\n\nl2 behavior that are used in the service of coercive control ina\nl3 variety of types of victimization.

What was the conclusion of this study?\n\nl7 A. So what these authors did is a two-part study. So the\n\nl8 first thing that they did is they did an extensive <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>\nl9 review to look for commonalities in the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> about what\n2o are the commonly described stages that a perpetrator engages in\n2l and what are the behaviors that are associated with those\nae stages. So they did a very comprehensive <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> review.\n23 They identified a number of specific behavioral and observable\n24 strategies that individuals have identified in the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>.\na5 They then got a group of recognized individuals in\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4924", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014926.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page5oofl58 5o\nLBAGma x2 Rocchio - Direct\n\nl gaining access and isolation, trust development,\n\n2 desensitization, sexual contact and physical contact. And then\n3 beneath each stage level, there is a list of the behavioral and\n4 the observable and measurable behaviors where there was a high\n5 level of statistical significance in agreement among varying\n\n6 professionals as to the relevance both to the grooming process\n7 and to the stages.\n\n8 Q. I want to direct your atention to Page 4. What is this\n\n9 table?\n\nlo A. So these, as I mentioned, there was an original list of\n\nll about 77 specific behaviors that have been found associated\n\nl2 with grooming in the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> fairly consistently. These are\nl3 the behaviors that were part of that original list, where\n\nl4 perhaps there were more differences of opinion, but the level\nl5 of agreement among the professionals in this particular study\nl6 did not reach the level of statistical significance.\n\nl7 Q. What is your takeaway from the study in the article?\n\nl8 A. I think this is a study that has really done a good job of\nl9 integrating what we knou and pulling together the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>,\n2o and then puting it to an empirical test. There have been\n2l other ways to empirically understand and test what is referred\n22 to as grooming.

Sure. I think that certain things -- some psychologists\n\n2 use clinical judgment on whether or not a perpetrator's\n\n3 behaviors are considered grooming. But that certainly doesn't\n4 at all reference the scientific <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> to determine what is\n5 and is not considered grooming. In addition, we also have data\n6 that's been provided by offenders themselves.\n\n7 In terms of reliability and validity of these\n\n8 judoments, the validity in psychological science refers to the\n9 degree to which you are measuring this particular thing, what\nlo you think you're measuring. So for example, the degree to\n\nll which there is significant overlap between what victims say\n\nl2 they experience and what offenders say that they have done\n\nl3 provides us with a measure of validity.\n\nl4 The degree to which different groups of individuals,\nl5 whether that's groups of professionals or groups of victims\n\nl6 agree in studies what it is that -- the process, what kinds of\nl7 behaviors, what's been done to the victim, what kinds of\n\nl8 behaviors are associated with the grooming process, to the\n\nl9 extent those professionals agree, that's a measure of\n2o reliability. Because you're geting different studies,\n2l different groups, different samples where there's significant\nae overlap in what this dynamic and what this concept is.\n23 MS.

Dr. Rocchio, what is your response to those two sentences?\n8 A. Again, I think that I would not agree with those\n\n9 conclusions. I also think it's important to recognize that\n\nlo this article was published many years ago. And there's\n\nll certainly been evolutions and additional <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> since the\nl2 time of publication. But even at the time of publication, I\n\nl3 think it's a litle misleading. If they're defining consensus\nl4 there as universal agreement as to exact -- everything within\nl5 the process of grooming, then sure. But when we're talking\n\nl6 about any patern of behavior or any phenomenon within the\n\nl7 social science, it's a complicated phenomenon. You're never\n\nl8 going to get universal agreement among experts. That's why you\nl9 have to look at what's the particular definition used within a\n2o study.\n2l But most definitely, there's consensus within the\nae scientific <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> about the phenomenon not only of\n23 grooming, but the phenomenon of child sexual abuse itself, what\n24 the experiences are of the victim and what the behaviors are of\n25 the offender and also the impact of those behaviors, in terms\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool493o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014932.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page56oofl58 56\nLBAGma x2 Rocchio - Direct\n\nl can get consistency. And it's a concept that is frequently\n\n2 referred to in forensic studies.\n\n3 Q. Do more recent articles respond to some of the concerns\n\n4 raised by this Bennet and O'Donohue article?\n\n5 A. They do.\n\n6 Q. Can you please explain?\n\n7 A. The article we looked at earlier by Winters atempted\n\n8 specifically to address some concerns. So she atempted to\n\n9 validate the grooming model. And she very specifically wanted\nlo to see, okay, of course there's not going to be universal\n\nll agreement on every single behavior, but she did a statistical\nl2 study to find out specifically what behaviors do the\n\nl3 professionals and the experts agree upon. And again,\n\nl4 remembering that all of the behaviors -- even the ones that, in\nl5 that particular study, didn't meet the statistical significance\nl6 in that study, all of those behaviors were behaviors that have\nl7 been commonly referred to and described in the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>.\n\nl8 Q. Dr. Rocchio, hou do error rates factor into this\n\nl9 <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>?\n2o A. So I think when we talk about error rates within the field\n2l of psychology, the kind of gold standard is when you have a\nae particular technique or a drug and you ideally would randomly\n23 assign people, one who receives the drug, one who doesn't\n24 receive the drug, and I would kind of compare whether -- hou\n25 effective it is.

So you have to look\n2 for other ways to assess acceptability within the scientific\n\n3 <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>; peer review and general thoughts about concepts.\n\n4 And so that's where you look at the reliability as in what do\n5 the experts consistently agree to among themselves. You look\n6 at the degree of overlapping studies, perhaps studying it in\n\n7 different ways, but are they still coming up with the same\n\n8 clear description of the types of things that happen in the\n\n9 context of child sexual abuse.\n\nlo So for example, there was a content analysis done\n\nll through interviews to pull out what some of those studies have\nl2 found and to the degree that they're rated by multiple\n\nl3 reviewers, and then compare the ratings of those reviewers,\n\nl4 that's an indices of reliability.\n\nl5 MS.

So he's saying accurately that we\nl6 can't look at specific behaviors alone as predictors.\n\nl7 And certainly, the use of the term grooming, again, is\nl8 used to describe a process, a patern of behaviors. I'm not\n\nl9 here today to say that if somebody engages in any one of these\n2o particular behaviors, yes, we knou you're a child abuser. So\n2l he's making that point. But I don't think anybody -- I don't\nae think that -- if that's his point, I wouldn't disagree with\n23 that. Except that he's then going on -- I disagree where he\n24 says that grooming then can't involve behaviors that might in\n25 fact be prosocial or normal.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4935", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014936.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page6oofl58 6o\nLBAGma x2 Rocchio - Direct\n\nl Again, we're talking about a use of a variety of\n\n2 strategies for the purpose of sexual abuse. So these are ways\n3 in which -- tactics, ways in which an offender might manipulate\n4 a child to developing a relationship of trust and atachment.\n\n5 Obviously, one can develop a relationship of trust and\n\n6 atachment in a variety of contexts. But when we're talking\n\n7 about grooming, the specific context, is when there's been\n\n8 coercive control and some form of organization.\n\n9 Q. Dr. Rocchio, taking a step back --\n\nlo MS. POMERANTZ: You can pull doun Exhibit 5.\n\nll Q. -- hou have some of the behaviors you have seen in grooming\nl2 <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> compare to behaviors you have seen in your forensic\nl3 practice and your clinical practice?\n\nl4 A. Again, there's remarkable similarity in the impact of those\nl5 behaviors. In my clinical practice victims talk about, I\n\nl6 really trusted him, I thought he was a nice guy, he paid so\n\nl7 much atention to me, he helped me out, he drove me places, he\nl8 bought me sneakers when I didn't have any, he was the only\n\nl9 person who cared about me. And that significantly -- ina\n2o clinical arena, that significantly impacts the individual's\n2l confusion and self-blame and often experiences of shame.\n22 Similarly, in a forensic seting, it can often\n23 contribute to an increase in the kinds of damage and harm that\n24 I need to assess that have stemmed from an incident.\n25 Q. In your view, is the concept of grooming generally accepted\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4936", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014937.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 6loofl58 6l\nLBAGma x2 Rocchio - Direct\n\nl within the scientific community?\n\n2 A. Yes, absolutely.\n\n3 Q. Based on your experience, research and training, are\n\n4 certain individuals at higher risk of being sexually abused as\n5 children?\n\n6 A. There are certain groups who are more vulnerable and\n\n7 there's a higher prevalence of child sexual abuse, yes.\n\n8 Q. What factors contribute to increased risk or higher\n\n9 vulnerabilities?\n\nlo A. So there are factors that have been studied and found in\n\nll <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> that have to do with the individual themselves. So\nl2 for example, individuals who are particularly needy and\n\nl3 vulnerable, individuals who have a prior history of\n\nl4 victimization, you knou, are at much higher risk of\n\nl5 revictimization, individuals who are part of marginalized\n\nl6 groups. For example, we knou there's very high rates of sexual\nl7 assault, childhood sexual abuse among especially minority\n\nl8 children or among intellectually and cognitively disabled\n\nl9 children.\n2o We knou that individuals who come from certain types\n2l of family structures can be also at higher risk. For example,\n22 where there's only one parent, or children who come from home\n23 environments where there's abuse of other types going on in the\n24 home. So there might be other siblings who are being abused or\n25 the parents might be engaged -- one of the parents might be\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4937", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014938.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 62 oofl58 62\nLBAGma x2 Rocchio - Direct\n\nl abusing another parent or another child, so where there's other\n2 violence, those groups are also at higher risk.\n\n3 There have been other studies that look at poverty as\n4 a risk factor.

In your education and training, did you learn about the\n\n7 concept of certain groups being at higher risk of childhood\n\n8 sexual abuse?\n\n9 A. Yes, because, again, in the phenomenon of child sexual\n\nlo abuse in general, not -—- we're looking at vulnerability\n\nll factors, i.e., who's more at risk. So to the extent that I was\nl2 learning about ways that you might want to target prevention,\nl3 for example, where you might want to make those interventions,\nl4 but then also, we knou that an individual's prior\n\nl5 vulnerabilities interact with their subsequent experiences of\nl6 victimization and have a profound effect on the outcome, the\nl7 adverse outcomes of the abuse itself.\n\nl8 So it was covered in a number of different ways\n\nl9 through the course of my education and training.\n2o Q. In your clinical practice, have you treat and evaluated\n2l patients who belong to higher-risk groups?\n22 A. Yes.\n23 Q. Can you please explain.\n24 A. In particular, we knou that gender is a higher-risk group,\n25 and we knou that women and girls are at higher risk for child\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4939", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014940.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 64oofl58 64\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio - Direct\n\nl sexual abuse. So to the extent that more of my patients are\n\n2 women than men, certainly that's a vulnerability.\n\n3 But also, because, especially nou, I'm working with\n\n4 adults, I'm working with people who have been repeatedly\n\n5 victimized at various points in time in their lives. And you\n6 can really clearly see the patern, and it's something I often\n7 have to address with patients because they inguire about it,\n\n8 they don't understand. You knou, why is it that this has\n\n9 happened to me so many times. And, again, we knou from the\n\nlo revictimization <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> that when someone is abused, they\nll are at higher risk of being abused at later points in time.\n\nl2 Also, you knou, sometimes the clinical <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>\n\nl3 individuals will talk about the specific issues in their family\nl4 that perhaps increase their vulnerability: They were always\nl5 alone. They, you knou, their mom was sick and this person had\nl6 lots of opportunity to kind of befriend the family and, you\n\nl7 knou, therefore had greater access as a result of that\n\nl8 vulnerability, or perhaps they were desperate for atention,\nl9 care, love, and concern from another person because those are\n2o common childhood needs and maybe they weren't geting that at\n2l home.\n22 So those are all the kinds of things that would come\n23 up in, and have come up in, my over 3o years of treating\n24 patients.\n25 Q.

I do.\n\n3 Q. Can you explain.\n\n4 A. So, again, I'll use an example in the civil arena. If I'm\n5 asked, as part of my forensic evaluation, to opine about the\n\n6 impact of an alleged event, say childhood sexual abuse, and the\n7 degree to which a person's current difficulties are related to\n8 that event, I have to take prior vulnerability into account,\n\n9 because part of what I'm looking at is, hou can I determine\n\nlo which of these persons’ current difficulties are related to the\nll sexual abuse or maybe related to other things that have\n\nl2 happened in their past. So we knou, because of the\n\nl3 vulnerability <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, that if somebody is being abused in\nl4 adolescence, it wouldn't be at all unusual for them also to\n\nl5 have a history of earlier childhood sexual abuse.\n\nl6 So I have to look at the interaction of those prior\n\nl7 vulnerabilities and ways in which those prior vulnerabilities\nl8 both may have made the individual more vulnerable to the\n\nl9 grooming behavior and to the subsequent sexual abuse, and also\n2o ways in which those prior vulnerabilities may have interacted\n2l with the abuse to create more adverse outcomes for the\n22 individual I'm evaluating.\n23 Q. Hou does what you have observed in your forensic practice\n24 compare to your clinical practice with respect to individuals\n25 in higher-risk groups?\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool494l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014943.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page67ofl58 67\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio - Direct\n\nl When you look at who reports that they've been sexually abused,\n2 is it reported more often by individuals who are members -- who\n3 are women versus men.

So the particular vulnerabilities in particular are most\n\nl2 relevant to the first stage of the grooming model, which is the\nl3 victim-selection model, in terms of looking at who are the\n\nl4 individuals that offenders choose to abuse or who end up\n\nl5 abusing. And, again, I think it's important to bear in mind\n\nl6 that this whole list was initially established from <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>\nl7 looking at what offenders have told us they look for as well as\nl8 what kinds of prevalence rates have occurred in certain\n\nl9 populations.\n2o And then these, in that top section of victim\n2l selection, are the factors, vulnerability factors, that there\n22 has been statistically significant agreement by professionals\nao factor into victim selection.\n24 Q. And when you say \"the top section,\" you're referring to\n25 the -- what part of the table are you referring to?\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4943", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014944.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 68oofl58 68\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio - Direct\n\nl A.

So this table shous, again, specific behaviors that there's\nlo widespread agreement in this particular group of professionals\nll that are relevant to a particular stage of the grooming\nl2 process. And, again, these are also behaviors that have been\nl3 commonly and repeatedly found to exist in the scientific\nl4 <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> as being associated with the grooming process.\n\nl5 Q. And hou does the information on this table compare to the\nl6 table we were just looking at?\nl7 A.

But\n2o there was not as much agreement among the professionals that\n2l these specific behaviors -- about the relevance of these\n22 specific behaviors and/or the stage to which they were part of.\nao MS. POMERANTZ: Thank you. Ms. Durocher, we can pull\n24 that doun.\n25 Q. Dr. Rocchio, the defense has stated that your opinion that\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4944", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014946.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 7o oofl58 7o\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio - Direct\n\nl <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> compare to your clinical practice and your forensic\n2 practice with respect to the question of individuals with\n\n3 particular vulnerabilities being at higher risk of childhood\n\n4 sexual abuse?\n\n5 A. It's highly consistent.\n\n6 Q. The defense has argued that a victim's prior sexual\n\n7 behavior is relevant to the concept of grooming. What's your\n\n8 reaction to that?\n\n9 A. In what way? I mean, I've talked about, certainly their\n\nlo experiences of victimization can make them more vulnerable, but\nll I'm not sure what you mean.\n\nl2 Q. Does whether a person, whether or not a person has had\n\nl3 sexual experience, puting aside prior victimization, make them\nl4 more or less vulnerable to being groomed?\n\nl5 A. I'm not aware of any <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> on that issue, nor do I\n\nl6 even understand hou that would theoretically make sense. To\n\nl7 the extent that you're suggesting that somebody who has been\n\nl8 sexually active in the past can or cannot be groomed, I'm not,\nl9 even theoretically, I don't understand why that would be the\n2o case.\n2l But, no, certainly I don't believe that there is any\n22 <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> that would support that statement.\n23 THE COURT: So to the extent you've seen in your\n24 practice and studies the impact of prior sexual conduct on the\n25 phenomenon of grooming, you understand it to potentially\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4946", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014948.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 72 ofl58 72\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio - Direct\n\nl groomed and victimized.\n\n2 THE COURT: So given that there's a history of prior\n\n3 sexual abuse, would that be relevant -- is that relevant for\n\n4 you to understanding whether grooming occurred?\n\n5 THE WITNESS: Not necessarily, because when I'm\n\n6 looking at whether or not grooming occurred and when the\n\n7 <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> is looking about whether or not grooming occurred,\n\n8 they're going to look at the specific circumstances associated\n9 with whatever it is you're looking at.

So the article that we had spoken about earlier, looking at\n23 dynamics of coercive control, which refer to some of the\n24 strategies and dynamics that commonly occur in the context of\n25 grooming, we can see that coercive control, which are\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4953", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014954.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 78oofl58 78\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio - Direct\n\nl describing the same kinds of strategies and tactics as grooming\n2 refers to, happens in a variety of other setings. So in the\n\na pimp-and-sex-worker relationship, we knou, for example, that\n\n4 the grooming strategies are happening, and typically a pimp is\n5 working not for their oun, necessarily, sexual gratification\n\n6 but to provide -- to procure and provide for the sexual\n\n7 gratification of another, for example.\n\n8 THE COURT: And that's hou it's discussed in the field\n9 and in the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, that, to the extent that trauma bonding\nlo has been studied in the pimp-sex worker context, it is plainly\nll about, at least largely about, the coercive techniques being\n\nl2 used to facilitate sexual conduct with a third party.\n\nl3 THE WITNESS: Exactly.\n\nl4 THE COURT: And, again, nothing like that in the\n\nl5 grooming child sexual abuse context beyond sort of the\n\nl6 institutional authority positions that you've discussed.\n\nl7 THE WITNESS: There have been studies, though, that\n\nl8 have looked at specifically comparing the behaviors associated\nl9 with grooming for the purposes of sexual abuse and those being\n2o the same behaviors, technigues, and strategies as utilized by\n2l the pimps. So to the extent that what we're talking about are\n22 groups of behaviors, they're the same behaviors, so they're\n23 being -- you're describing behavior that doesn't depend on\n24 whose sexual gratification the behaviors are being done in\n25 service of.

And that's what\n3 the scientific <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> talks about, that the grooming is\n\n4 really a patern of coercive control, manipulative behavior,\n\n5 strategies and techniques that are done to increase one's\n\n6 ability to coerce another.\n\n7 THE COURT: Thank you.\n\n8 MS.

POMERANTZ:\n\nl8 Q. Dr. Rocchio, does the relationship of trust and atachment\nl9 between a victim and a perpetrator impact disclosure?\n2o A. Yes.\n2l Q. Hou so?\n22 A. In a couple ways. First, in a relationship of trust and\n23 atachment between a victim and a perpetrator, that can and has\n24 been established to cause a great deal of confusion on the part\n25 of the victim about what is and is not abusive. So to the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4955", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014956.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 8oofl58 8o\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio - Direct\n\nl extent that someone doesn't recognize that what's happening to\n2 them or doesn't cognitively label it as abuse, obviously that's\n3 not something that can be reported.\n\n4 But then of course the relationship itself also\n\n5 functions to make disclosure less likely, because either the\n\n6 individual has been made, in the course of the relationship, to\n7 feel somewhat responsible, they might feel shame, or they may\n\n8 blame themselves; or to the extent that they've come to care\n\n9 for the person who's harming them, they may be afraid of\n\nlo geting that individual in trouble; or to the extent that the\nll relationship as a whole clearly has positive elements to it\n\nl2 apart from and distinct from the abusive elements, they may --\nl3 it's fulfilling some need on the part of the victim, they may\nl4 be fearful of losing those pieces.\n\nl5 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, are you\nl6 familiar with delayed disclosure?\n\nl7 A. I am.\n\nl8 Q. What is delayed disclosure?\n\nl9 A. \"Delayed disclosure\" is a term that's used in the\n2o <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> to refer to telling about an experience of, well, in\n2l this case, sexual assault at some point after the event has\n22 occurred.\n23 Q. Does disclosure of childhood sexual abuse depend on the\n24 victim's age?\n25 A. So there have been a number of studies that have looked at\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4956", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014958.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 82oofl58 82\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio - Direct\n\nl may not believe that relationship to be abusive. They may\n\n2 believe that the two of them are in love. They may have been\n\n3 deliberately misled to believe that it is somehou a love, a\n\n4 love relationship. So they, they don't identify it or label it\n5 as abuse.\n\n6 Also, there's, as with any form of sexual abuse,\n\n7 sexual assault, in childhood or otherwise, there's a great deal\n8 of shame and stigma, and adolescents are, again,\n\n9 developmentally as a group notoriously sensitive to fear of\n\nlo being judged.\n\nll And then finally, they don't want to get in trouble.\nl2 They don't want their freedom restricted. There are, you knou,\nl3 studies that have been done talking to teenagers or adults\n\nl4 about why they did or didn't disclose at various points in\n\nl5 time, have identified all of these as factors, among others.\n\nl6 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, hou do\n\nl7 people who have experienced childhood sexual abuse talk about\nl8 or disclose the abuse?\n\nl9 A. So this is something that's really been studied in terms of\n2o the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> looking at hou and why do people disclose or not\n2l disclose. And one of the consistent findings is that\n22 disclosure most often takes place to appear not -- for an\n23 adolescent to appear and for adults -- to friends, not to\n24 formal agencies.\n25 I'm sorry. Can you repeat the question?\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4958", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014960.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 84oofl58 84\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio - Direct\n\nl talking about any event, there are general principles of\n\n2 memory, and those would apply to memory, general well-accepted\n3 principles of memory, that would apply to experiences of sexual\n4 abuse as well.\n\n5 So to the extent that we knou everybody pays atention\n6 to and ataches significance to some aspects of an event more\n\n7 so than others, what a sexual abuse survivor discloses and the\n8 pieces of the story that they -- or their experiences, I'm\n\n9 sorry -- that they remember are going to be those things that\nlo were central details. They are going to have relatively good\nll memory most of the time for the gist of the event and for the\nl2 details that they atended to and were most significant to\n\nl3 them. But their memory for peripheral details, we knou, can\n\nl4 fade away and weaken or change with time.\n\nl5 Q. You just mentioned peripheral details. What do you mean by\nl6 that?\n\nl7 A. So in the memory <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, again, there is often a\n\nl8 distinction made between what are considered to be central\n\nl9 details and peripheral details. So the central details are\n2o subjectively defined as whatever it is an individual is paying\n2l atention to and ataching significance to at the time of an\n22 event. And those are the details that get encoded in memory\nao and are then later available for retrieval at the time of\n24 recall.\n25 Q. Can you give an example.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool496o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014961.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 85oofl58 85\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio - Direct\n\nl A. Sure. If we're talking about child sexual abuse, someone\n\n2 may have atended to the -- and knoun full well that they were\n3 being sexually abused and they may have very clear memory of\n\n4 certain sounds, certain smells, breath, certain physical\n\n5 sensations. Alternatively, someone who is dissociating and\n\n6 trying very hard not -- to not think and not atend to what's\n\n7 happening to them, they may have very vivid details of the\n\n8 swirls on the ceiling or the patern on the wallpaper.\n\n9 Q. Dr. Rocchio, hou do the topics of memory that you just\n\nlo testified about fit into your expertise?\n\nll A. So as a psychologist, again, these general principles of\n\nl2 memory are part of what I've been trained in throughout my\n\nl3 career and, as a trauma psychologist in particular, certainly\nl4 hou individuals talk about their experiences, hou they remember\nl5 what's happened to them and what is typical, in terms of\n\nl6 memory. Again, what are the general principles about memory is\nl7 absolutely part of the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> and the research within the\nl8 field of trauma psychology, as well as psychology generally,\n\nl9 more broadly.\n2o Q. In your education, did you learn about delayed disclosure?\n2l A. We taught -- we learned certainly about hou people tell\n22 their stories. And certainly when I was trained in assessment\n23 technigues, for example, in my training, and I was taught about\n24 hou to ask about abuse experiences, I was also told, you knou,\n25 be mindful that if someone answers your questions, this may be\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool496l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014965.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 89oofl58 89\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio - Direct\n\nl Q. Hou?\n\n2 A. Through the clinical <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, through the training.\n\na Again, if either I'm conducting training and I'm teaching\n\n4 others or I'm participating in the training that's talking\n\n5 about what are some of the common themes and issues and things\n6 that you need to deal with in a psychotherapy and clinical and\n7 assessment context, we'll often talk about disclosure, and in\n\n8 particular things like, we also knou that so many individuals\n\n9 of child sexual abuse but also of rape and sexual assault of\n\nlo all kinds don't necessarily label their experiences as such.\n\nll So when I'm teaching, or ways that I've been taught and trained\nl2 is to use behavioral descriptors of what I'm asking about. So,\nl3 for example, there have been numerous studies that say, you\n\nl4 knou, lf you ask a group of individuals, say college students,\nl5 have you ever had an experience where someone physically forced\nl6 you to engage in sexual activity against your will, they'll,\n\nl7 you knou, a certain percentage of them will say yes. And then\nl8 if you follou you and say, have you ever been raped, no. So\n\nl9 you have to use behavioral descriptors, because people for a\n2o variety of reasons don't necessarily label their experiences as\n2l abuse. And that's also true with varying kinds of violence as\n22 well. Have you been abused, versus, have these behaviors\n23 happened to you.\n24 Q. Is your clinical experience regarding disclosure consistent\n25 or inconsistent with that of other psychologists who treat and\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4965", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014966.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 9ooofl58 9o\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio - Direct\n\nl evaluate patients who have delayed disclosing childhood sexual\n\n2 abuse?\n\n3 A. It's consistent with my peers and reports that I've read in\n\n4 the clinical <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, yes.\n\n5 Q. In your forensic practice, have you dealt with\n\n6 disclosure-related issues?\n\n7 A. I have.\n\n8 Q. Can you explain.\n\n9 A. Disclosure-related issues in a forensic seting can come up\nlo particularly, for example, when there are issues related to the\nll statute of limitations. So in a recent case, I was asked to\nl2 evaluate the time at which an individual reasonably came to be\nl3 aware of a connection between their present difficulties or\nl4 potential connection between their present difficulties and the\nl5 alleged abuse. And part of that case involved my looking at,\nl6 you knou, were there any reports made about the abuse at the\nl7 time, because I'm working with an adult who's alleging\nl8 something during childhood, and if so to whom and under what\nl9 circumstances. And, you knou, even if the reports weren't made\n2o at the time of the abuse, for example, did this person talk\n2l about their experiences with their therapist or when they were\n22 hospitalized for substance abuse, what did they have to say.\n\n23 So I'm looking at what they disclosed, hou they\n24 disclosed it. I'm obviously, in a forensic seting, comparing\n25 that to what they're telling me nou and with what the fact\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4966", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014967.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 9loofl58 9l\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio - Direct\n\nl patern is from other data sources.\n\n2 Q. Hou common is it for you to consider disclosure-related\n\na issues in your forensic practice?\n\n4 A. Very.\n\n5 Q. Hou do the disclosure-related behaviors you've seen in your\n6 forensic practice compare to those you've seen in your clinical\n7 practice?\n\n8 A. Very similar. Very, very similar.\n\n9 Q. Are your opinions on disclosure based in part on your\n\nlo review of the scientific <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>?\n\nll A. Scientific and clinical <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, yes.\n\nl2 Q. Can you describe at a high level the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> upon which\nl3 your opinion is based?\n\nl4 A. So there's different ways that the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> has looked at\nl5 the issue of disclosure. I spoke earlier about prevalence\n\nl6 rates where you're asking people, often in anonymous surveys\n\nl7 but sometimes in interview setings, but in research studies,\nl8 about a variety of experiences. And typically in those\n\nl9 studies, you will ask -- people are asked about their\n2o experiences with rape, sexual assault, childhood sexual abuse.\n2l And so you can get some idea of what percentage of people in\n22 various studies across time report particular events in their\n23 lives. So you get an estimate of prevalence.\n24 You can compare that to look at disclosure in two\n25 different ways. You can look, for example, if you're talking\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4967", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014969.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 93oofl58 93\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio - Direct\n\nl Q. Can you please explain.\n\n2 A. So there's about been a lot of <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> looking at what\n3 are some of the adverse outcomes in populations of individuals\n4 who have been sexually abused, among other adverse childhood\n\n5 events. So there's really two primary bodies of <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>.\n\n6 One is the general well-established <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> on adverse\n\n7 childhood events that -- of which childhood sexual abuse is\n\n8 one, that has documented that individuals who have had higher\n9 numbers of adverse events that have occurred to them during\n\nlo childhood are at much higher risk of a whole range of health\nll difficulties -- gastrointestinal difficulties, heart problems,\nl2 all kinds of health-related issues -- as well as psychological\nl3 and psychiatric difficulties, in particular depression,\n\nl4 anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder. So there's that body\nl5 of <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>.\n\nl6 And then there have been numerous studies that have\nl7 looked more specifically at and narrouly at populations of\n\nl8 individuals who have been sexually abused or who have reported\nl9 to have been sexually abused. And then they have looked over\n2o time and found that individuals who have reported histories of\n2l childhood sexual abuse have both much higher frequencies of\n22 various psychiatric illnesses and difficulties, as well as\n23 higher severity of symptoms.\n24 And then, thirdly, the post-traumatic stress disorder\n25 <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> has found that, when individuals have experienced a\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4969", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014970.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page94oofl58 94\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio - Direct\n\nl traumatic event, which is part of the criteria for later\n\n2 developing post-traumatic stress disorder, those who\n\n3 experienced childhood sexual abuse and sexual abuse generally,\n4 as compared to those who have experienced other types of\n\n5 traumatic events, are at higher risk for developing\n\n6 post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n7 Q. Is there empirical data to support your views about the\n\n8 prevalence of adverse effects of childhood sexual abuse?\n\n9 A. Yes. There's a significant body of <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>.\n\nlo Q. Can you explain briefly.\n\nll A. Yes.

There's a relationship between particular types of\n\n6 vulnerability and particular types of outcome.\n\n7 Q.

I want to turn nou to some of your questions about\n\nl7 grooming, okay, some of your opinions about grooming.\n\nl8 What is your definition of grooming?\n\nl9 A. The definition that's commonly used in the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> is --\n2o Q. I didn't ask that question.\n2l THE COURT: You may answer. Go ahead.\n22 THE WITNESS: The term grooming refers to a set of\n23 deceptive strategies that are utilized by an individual to\n24 establish a relationship of coercion and control for the\n25 purposes of subsequent sexual exploitation and sexual abuse.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4989", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014990.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page ll4ofl58ll4\nLBAGmax4 Rocchio - Cross\n\nl Q. And is that your definition?\n\n2 A. It's my understanding of the definitions that have been\n\n3 talked about in the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>. I mean, I haven't writen and\n4 published a specific set definition. It's a common definition\n5 and the one I'm using in my testimony, yes.\n\n6 Q. I was going to ask you that question. You have not\n\n7 published anything specifically about grooming; correct?\n\n8 A. Specifically about grooming, no. But I have certainly\n\n9 published and made reference to grooming.\n\nlo Q. And you have not done any metadata studies on your oun to\nll collect data about grooming; correct?\n\nl2 A. Correct.\n\nl3 Q. Grooming can consist of the actions that you're talking\n\nl4 about, can consist of -- I think we saw a list of 77 things on\nl5 it as part of your testimony; is that right?\n\nl6 A. Those were 77 specific behaviors that had been identified\nl7 in the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> as potentially being part of the grooming\n\nl8 process, yes.\n\nl9 Q. But I think we were talking about things like taking an\n2o interest in another human being could be considered grooming?\n2l A. Not in and of itself. It would depend on the patern of\n22 behavior and the context in which it's occurring.\nao Q. Let's talk about that for a second. Because what you're\n24 Saying is, it depends on the groomer's intent in doing a\n25 specific act is what, in your view, makes it grooming or not\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool499o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014996.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page l2o of l58 l2o\nLBAGmax4 Rocchio - Cross\n\nl Q. You also talked about delayed disclosures; correct?\n\n2 A. Yes.\n\n3 Q. Nou, the studies vary over when disclosure occurs for a\n\n4 number of reasons. First, the definition of disclosure, the\n\n5 studies have disclosures to law enforcement, right, which is\n\n6 one definition of disclosure?\n\n7 A. That's generally referred to in the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> as\n\n8 reporting.\n\n9 Q. And then there's disclosure to a parent; right?\n\nlo A. Correct.\n\nll Q. Then there's disclosure to a friend; right?\n\nl2 A. Mm-hmm.\n\nl3 Q. Disclosure to a teacher or other third person?\n\nl4 A. Yes.\n\nl5 Q. And there's really no set term of what disclosure in this\nl6 context means; correct?\n\nl7 A. No, that's not correct.\n\nl8 Q. There's also no set term on what delay means; correct?\n\nl9 A. No, that's not correct.\n2o Q. Well, some of the studies have one week as delay; right?\n2l A. Yes.\n22 Q. And some of the studies have one month as a delay; right?\nao A. Yes.\n24 Q. Some of the studies have one year as delay, up to one year;\n25 right?\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4996", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014997.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page l2l of l58l2l\nLBAGmax4 Rocchio - Cross\n\nl A. Yes, many of the studies specifically look at disclosure\n\n2 that is delayed, as in not occurring at the time of the abuse.\na And then look at what are those rates at various points in\n\n4 time, so it could be a week later, it could be a month later,\n5 it could be a year later or five years later.\n\n6 Q. So those are all variables in this idea of when disclosure\n7 occurs; right?\n\n8 A. They are variables in the dynamics of the delay. They are\n9 all examples of delayed disclosure at various points in time.\nlo Because delayed disclosure refers to disclosure at some point\nll after the incident that's being disclosed.\n\nl2 Q. I want to ask you some questions about memory nou, which is\nl3 another area of your opinion.\n\nl4 You agree with me that memory is a complex topic?\n\nl5 A. <L dGs\n\nl6 Q. Memory is generally regarded as the mental registration,\nl7 retention and recollection of past experiences, sensations or\nl8 thoughts; would you agree with that?\n\nl9 A. I would.\n2o Q. And there are a number of parts of the brain that work in\n2l connection to form memories; would you agree with that?\n22 A. I would.\n23 Q. Do you knou what those parts are?\n24 A.

It wasn't just a\n2l summary of the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>. But, yes.

Dr. Rocchio, I'd like to walk through those stages of\n\n4 grooming in a litle more detail.\n\n5 Can you please explain the first stage for the jury.\n\n6 A. So we knou from the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> -- <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> both with\n\n7 victims and with offenders -- that offenders typically seek to\n8 target someone who they believe they're likely to be able to\n\n9 successfully abuse. They target vulnerable children,\n\nlo vulnerable populations. We also knou this because there are\n\nll certain vulnerable populations that are at much higher risk for\nl2 being sexually abused.\n\nl3 Q. Dr. Rocchio, can you explain the second stage of grooming\nl4 for the jury.\n\nl5 A. So the second stage involves perpetrators puting\n\nl6 themselves in situations where they are likely to have access\nl7 to children, but also where they're being around children is\n\nl8 not likely to be questioned. We often find perpetrators of\n\nl9 childhood sexual abuse in positions where there's lots of kids\n2o around. It may be as a coach or a teacher, working at a gym,\n2l certainly boy scout leader, they put themselves in situations\n22 where their involvement and relationship and access to children\n23 are not going to be questioned. And then they will begin to\n24 isolate that child, the one that they've selected for\n25 victimization, in order to have time alone with the child.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool79l2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00017916.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 43 of 228 7l9\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl referred to in the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> as entrapment and a dynamic of\n\n2 coercive control whereby the perpetrator wants to maintain the\n3 relationship, maintain the pouer they have over the victim of\n\n4 childhood sexual abuse so that the abuse can continue, but also\n5 to the extent that the child remains isolated and under the\n\n6 control of the perpetrator, the victim is far less likely to\n\n7 disclose.\n\n8 Q. Dr. Rocchio, based on your experience, research, and\n\n9 training, hou, if at all, common is it for a child to be\nlo sexually abused multiple times by the same perpetrator?\nll A. Unfortunately, it's very common. Again, because it's\nl2 occurring in a relationship, oftentimes the perpetrator has\nl3 continued access and the abuse continues.\nl4 Q. Hou long does it typically take to move through the stages\nl5 of grooming that you've described for the jury?\nl6 A. It can really depend. I mean, we call them stages, but\nl7 sometimes they occur simultaneously, sometimes they occur, you\nl8 knou, more gradually. So we can be talking about a process of\nl9 weeks, we can be talking about something that's happening over\n2o the course of months or abuse that can continue over the course\nal of many years.\n22 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, are you\n23 familiar with the term \"grooming the environment\"?\n24 A. I am.\n25 Q.

Can you tell retrospectively whether someone who was abused\n3 was also groomed?\n\n4 A. Sure. Yeah. On the individual level, for example, when\n\n5 I'm providing treatment and I'm talking with someone who's been\n6 abused, we'll be talking about hou that abuse came to be. And\n7 often they'll be talking about the development of the\n\n8 relationship and hou they felt about this person and hou it\n\n9 unfolded over time.\n\nlo And then we've also done scientific research that's\n\nll been done to also identify retrospectively the grooming\n\nl2 process.\n\nl3 Q. Can you explain what you mean by the scientific research.\nl4 A. Sure. So there's a lot of research that's been done, for\nl5 example, with victims, talking with them about what their\n\nl6 experiences have been in terms of the childhood sexual abuse\n\nl7 that they've experienced. And that's with both people who are\nl8 talking about the abuse as children or people who are talking\nl9 about it when they are adults.

I am.\n\n2 Q. What is coercive control?\n\n3 A. Coercive control refers to a strategic patern of\n\n4 domination for purposes of controlling another individual and\n\n5 geting that individual to either do or not do things that you\n\n6 want them to do or not do.\n\n7 Q. What is the relationship between grooming and coercive\n\n8 control?\n\n9 A. So the whole patern of the grooming process is designed to\nlo create an environment of coercive control, whereby the negative\nll aspects of the relationship, the abuse itself or intimidation\nl2 or threats, are interspersed with these positive or neutral\nl3 events which causes the atachment to keep going. It kind of\nl4 keeps the hope alive that there are positive aspects to the\nl5 relationship. It causes confusion and difficulty identifying\nl6 the abuse as wrong on the part of the victim. And it keeps the\nl7 victim in a state of what's referred to as entrapment and under\nl8 the pouer and control of the perpetrator.\n\nl9 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, hou do\n2o the grooming process and the concept of atachment impact the\nal way in which a victim of childhood sexual abuse understands the\n22 abuse?\n23 A.

Hou so?\n\n2 A. We knou that younger -- the younger someone is, the more\n\n3 likely they are to delay disclosure; in other words, the less\n4 likely they are to tell someone right away about what's\n\na happening to them.\n\n6 Q. And when you say \"the younger,\" hou does that compare in\n\n7 terms of children?\n\n8 A. So when we're talking about children, they are much less\n\n9 likely to disclose. And most children, in fact, we knou don't\nlo tell anyone about the abuse that they've experienced until\n\nll adulthood.\n\nl2 Q. Is it common for children to disclose sexual abuse at or\nl3 near the time of the abuse?\n\nl4 A. Not at all, no.\n\nl5 Q. Why is it not common?\n\nl6 A. There are a number of factors.\n\nl7 Delayed disclosure is such a common -- commonly\n\nl8 recognized phenomenon within the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> that nou we are\n\nl9 doing research to try to identify what are the barriers to\n2o disclosure because, of course, we would like children to be\n2l able to tell their experiences sooner so that they can get\n22 access to help and so that the abuse can be stopped. So there\n23 have been identified both internal barriers and external\n24 barriers to disclosure.\n25 Q. When you say \"external barriers,\" what are you referring\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool7933", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00017934.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 6l of 228 737\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl to?\n\n2 A. So the external barriers are things that are outside the\n\ni) child. So, for example, fear of geting into trouble for an\n\n4 adolescent; in particular, fear that if they tell someone,\n\n5 their freedom is going to be constricted; fear that others are\n6 going to judge or blame them; fear often that the perpetrator\n\n7 is going to get into trouble. Again, remembering that they\n\n8 have a close relationship with this person often, and even\n\n9 though the person has been sexually abusing them, there's this\nlo sense of loyalty.\n\nll So those would be examples of the external factors in\nl2 contrast to the internal factors.\n\nl3 QO. What are the internal factors, Dr. Rocchio?\n\nl4 A. So the internal factors have much more to do with the\n\nl5 feelings of shame, feelings of guilt, the feelings of\n\nl6 self-blame, the feelings of confusion, perhaps not\n\nl7 acknouledging to oneself that what's happening is abusive. So\nl8 those are the kind of emotions that go along with the impact of\nl9 being sexually abused during childhood.\n2o Q. Is the concept of delayed disclosure established in\n2l scientific <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>?\n22 A. It is.\n23 Q. Can you explain.\n24 A.

And you yourself have not conducted any metadata studies to\nl3 collect and analyze <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> about grooming, correct?\nl4 A. Correct.\nl5 Q. And a metadata study is a somewhat comprehensive review of\nl6 the <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> on the topic, analyzing that <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span>, and\nl7 then having a publication that deals with the metadata\nl8 analysis. Is that a fair summary of what that would be?\nl9 A. A statistical analysis, yes.\n2o Q. So the studies that you were discussing with the jury are\nal studies that are done by other people, correct?\n22 A. Yes, experts in the field.\n23 Q.

The medical <span class=\"highlight\">literature</span> is unanimous that such conditions\nproduce mental deterioration, which prevents her from effective\nparticipation in trial preparation.\n\nWorse, even if Ms. Maxwell were able to be fully alert and\nmentally acute, she must review over 2,5oo,ooo prosecution pages on a\nguted computer, which does not have the ability to search, edit, or\nprint.

Third, the French Ministry of Justice’s interpretation is contradicted by precedents\nand case law\n\nl9. The French Ministry of Justice’s interpretation finds no support in case law, as no case\ncan be found where Article 696-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure was applied\nto protect a formerly French national from extradition.\n\n2o. Instead, precedents exist in which Article 696-4,l° of the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure was relied on by French authorities to execute an extradition request against\nan individual who had acquired French nationality after commiting an offence, which\nis the natural use of this provision (for example, a ruling issued by the Criminal Chamber\nof the French Cour de cassation on 4 January 2oo6, n°o5-86.258).\n\n2l. Although we have found no precedent where French authorities were faced with the\nextradition of a person who had lost French nationality, we have found cases where\nFrench authorities were faced with the deportation of a person who had lost French\nnationality. Both extradition and deportation allou for the removal of a person from\nFrench territory by the police and its surrender to the authorities of a third State, with\nthe consent and cooperation of the authorities of that State.\n\n22. The European Court of Human Rights (the “ECtHR”’) treats extradition and deportation\nanalogously. More specifically, the ECtHR considers that the same human rights bars\napply to all types of removal of a person from the territory of a State party (“the Court\nconsiders that the question whether there is a real risk of treatment contrary to Article\n3 in another State cannot depend on the legal basis for removal to that State.
