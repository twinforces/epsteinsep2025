Mr. Martin found that the eligible juror population of the Manhatan\nDivision is 2o.92% Black and 28.o6% Hispanic (Martin Decl. § 2o), while the White Plans\nqualified wheel refilled in February 2ol7 (and thus in effect in 2o2o) was 8.76% Black and\nlo.48% Hispanic (id. § 55). Thus, Mr. Martin found an “Absolute Disparity” of l2.l6%\nunderrepresentation for Black jurors (2o.92% minus 8.76%) and an “Absolute Disparity” of\nl7.58% for Hispanic jurors (28.o6% minus lo.48%).

[§ 74-75), which measures the statistical\nsignificance of a group’s underrepresentation.\n\nMr. Martin further found that there would be significant underrepresentation even if the\nWhite Plains qualified wheel were compared to the eligible juror population of the entire\nSouthern District of New York. For the whole District, the eligible juror population is l8.o9%\nBlack and 23.4l% Hispanic. /d. § l9.

I also was asked to comment\non the appropriateness and accuracy of the defendant’s expert Jeffery Martin’s assessment of the\ndifference between the qualified jury wheel and the community.\n\nWW. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n3. The African American <span class=\"highlight\">percentage</span> of the White Plains qualified jury wheel was 3.69\n<span class=\"highlight\">percentage</span> points louer than that in the White Plains community (8.76% versus l2.45%,\nrespectively) and the Hispanic <span class=\"highlight\">percentage</span> was 3.64 <span class=\"highlight\">percentage</span> points louer than that in the\nWhite Plains community (lo.48% versus l4.l2%, respectively). This is consistent with what\nDefendant’s expert Mr. Martin reports in his declaration.\n\n4. The disparities were almost exclusively due to the patern of African Americans and\nHispanics having been sent a juror questionnaire, and being found to be qualified as a juror and\nnot excused at a significantly louer rate than other races or ethnicities after returning the\nquestionnaire. Of the 3.69 <span class=\"highlight\">percentage</span> point difference by race (African American), 2.58 (or\n69.9% of the absolute disparity) is caused by this factor. Of the 3.64 <span class=\"highlight\">percentage</span> point difference\nby ethnicity (Hispanic), 2.59% (or 7l.2% of the absolute disparity) is caused by this factor.\n\n5.

The first step in the process of analyzing the qualified jury wheel is to re-create the\nmaster jury wheel. The master jury wheel is supposed to be a simple random selection from the\nvoter registration lists. The master jury wheel was chosen from the November l, 2ol6 county\nvoter registration lists. Based on geocoding the master jury wheel, I was able to estimate that a\nproper random sample from the complete November l, 2ol6 voter registration lists would have\nbeen ll.88% African American and l3.79% Hispanic. Hence, if a simple random sample had\nbeen selected, the absolute difference between the African American percent in the master jury\nwheel and the community would have been only o.57 <span class=\"highlight\">percentage</span> points, and the absolute\ndifference between the Hispanic percent in the master jury wheel and the community would have\nbeen only o.33 <span class=\"highlight\">percentage</span> points. Hence, the voter lists are a good representation of the\ncommunity benchmarks for representation of African Americans and Hispanics\n\n7. As pointed out by defendant’s expert Mr. Martin, the selection of the individuals on the\nmaster jury wheel was not a simple random sample from the November l, 2ol6 voter registration\nlists. That is, all registered voters did not have an equal chance of selection. There were two\nreasons for this. One, registered voters from the counties which provided jurors to both the\nManhatan and White Plains master jury wheels were less likely to be selected than registered\nvoters in counties which fed only the White Plains master jury wheel. Two, except for Dutchess\nCounty, inactive registered voters were not selected for the master jury wheel.' These reasons\nwere responsible for the actual master jury wheel being only ll.2o% African American and\n' The voter registration lists for all counties but Dutchess did not include inactive registered\nvoters.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3624", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003625.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page5 of 3o\nl2.97% Hispanic. Thus, the decision to not draw a proper random sample accounts for o.68% of\nthe absolute disparity between the actual master jury wheel and a random sample master jury\nwheel for African Americans and o.82% of the absolute disparity for Hispanics.\n\n8. Based on the geocoding of the master jury wheel, it is evident that the <span class=\"highlight\">percentage</span> of\nAfrican Americans and Hispanics of the actual White Plains master jury wheel is similar to the\nestimate of the <span class=\"highlight\">percentage</span> of African Americans and Hispanics in the White Plains community.\nThe percent African American of the master jury wheel is l.25 <span class=\"highlight\">percentage</span> points louer than that\nof the community, (l2.45% versus ll.2o%) and the percent Hispanics of the master jury wheel is\nl.l5 <span class=\"highlight\">percentage</span> points louer than that of the community (l4.l2% versus l2.97%).\n\n9. Mr. Martin notes that the disparity between the master jury wheel and the qualified\njury wheel is impacted by a clerical error in transcribing the individual’s mailing address. This\nclerical error affected every county except Westchester. Houever, the impact of this clerical\nerror on the absolute difference between the master jury wheel and the qualified jury wheel for\nthe African American <span class=\"highlight\">percentage</span> is negligible, and the error actually reduced the absolute\ndifference between the master jury wheel and the qualified jury wheel for African Americans and\nHispanics.\n\nlo. In sum, as (l) the voter registration lists and the master jury wheel created from these\nlists reasonably mirror the representation of the community (an absolute disparity equal to or less\nthan l.25%), but (ll) because African Americans and Hispanics were less likely to respond to the\nquestionnaire used to determine if the potential juror was qualified, and/or (i) because African\nAmericans and Hispanics who responded were less likely to be found qualified, and/or\n(iv) because African Americans and Hispanics who were found qualified were more likely to be\nexcused, the absolute disparity between the White Plains qualified jury wheel and the White\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3625", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003630.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo of 3o\nalmost always be a disconnect between the estimate of the demographics of the community and\nthe demographics of the master jury wheel, simply because there will be a disconnect between\nthe timing of the two estimates. Regardless of whether one believes the appropriate point in time\nto define the comparable community population should be as of November l, 2ol6 or some date\nthereafter, the best available data to estimate the demographics of the community is the 5-year\n2ol8 ACS.\n\nl9. Using the ACS data concerning the population of U.S. citizens at least l8 years of age\nresiding in the counties comprising White Plains, the racial and ethnic representation is l2.45%\nAfrican American and l4.l2% Hispanic.\n\n2o. Comparing the demographics of the White Plains community to the demographics of\nthe qualified jury wheel, we find that the African American representation in the community is\n3.69 <span class=\"highlight\">percentage</span> points higher than their representation on the qualified jury wheel (l2.45%-\n8.76%) and the Hispanic representation in the community is 3.64 <span class=\"highlight\">percentage</span> points higher than\ntheir representation on the qualified jury wheel (l4.l2%-lo.48%).\n\n2l.

As discussed above, the first step in the process of creating the qualified jury wheel is\nto re-create the master jury wheel. The master jury wheel is supposed to be a simple random\nsample from the registered voter lists of the counties making up White Plains. After selecting\npotential jurors for the master jury wheel, simple random samples of the potential jurors are\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo363o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003633.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l3 of 3o\n\n25. Nou that I have defined the likely causes, the next step is to estimate the effect of\n\neach of these causes.\nReasons l, 2, and 3\n\n26. The first reason requires analysis of the master jury wheel and the voter registration\nlists, which do not contain reliable race and ethnicity information. Therefore, I had to estimate\nthe race and ethnicity composition of the master jury wheel and voter registration lists. The\ncommon and widely used method for estimating race is geocoding.* Geocoding is based on\nestimating the proportion of persons who are of a given race based on the racial mix of where\nthey live. In defining where they live, I used the residence address on the voter registration list.\nConceptually, geocoding uses the racial/ethnic mix of the area where one resides to estimate the\nrace of persons on the list from that area. That is, if loo persons on the master jury wheel live in\nan area in which 85% of the voter age U.S. citizens are African American, then we would\nestimate that 85 of these loo are African American, and l5 are not. Assuming that the\nprobability of being randomly selected for the master jury wheel if you live in that area is the\nsame for everyone, this estimate will be very reliable, especially if we are selecting large\nnumbers of persons. For example, if there are 343,984 (the size of the master jury wheel)\nselections from the area, the probability is 95% that the actual percent of African Americans will\nbe within .ool <span class=\"highlight\">percentage</span> points of 85%. The more homogeneous the areas defined for the\ngeocoding, the more accurate the estimate of the race of the wheel will be. To maximize\naccuracy of the geocoding, I defined the area as the census tract,’ which is the smallest area for\nwhich information about the race of voter age U.S. citizens was available. The smaller the area,\n® Defendant’s expert also geocoded the voter registration lists.\n” Census tracts generally have a population size between l,2oo and 8,ooo people, with an\noptimum size of 4,ooo people. A census tract usually covers a contiguous area.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3633", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003634.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4 of 3o\nand the more homogeneous the area, the more accurate the geocoding estimate. I defined the\npopulation in the census tract as U.S. citizens of voting age. To estimate the percent Hispanic, I\nused the Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG) method, which enhances the accuracy\nof the geocoding by also using information about the ethnicity of a person’s last name. This\nmethod has been shoun to significantly improve the estimation for Hispanics. !°\n\n27. There is one constraint on the accuracy of the geocoding methodology. The basic\nassumption is that if the potential voting eligible population (U.S. citizens of voting age) ina\ncensus tract is 85% African American, then we would expect 85% of those on the master jury\nwheel who reside in that census tract to be African American. Houever, since the master jury\nwheel is selected from registered voters and not from potentially voting-eligible persons, this\nassumes that the likelihood of registering to vote for those who live within the same census tract\nis the same by race and ethnicity. If African Americans and/or Hispanics are less likely to\nregister to vote, the results of the geocoding will overestimate the percent of African Americans\nand Hispanics on the master jury wheel (reason l). Houever, there is no valid statistical\nevidence to conclude there is such a difference.\"!\n\n28. Based on the geocoding, the race and ethnicity representation of the master jury\nwheel is ll.2o% African American and l2.97% Hispanic. Thus, the master jury wheel is l.25\n‘o For additional information on BISG, see Elliot, M.N., Morrison, P.A., et al. “Using the\nCensus Bureau’s Surname List to Improve Estimates of Race/Ethnicity and Associated\nDisparities” in Health Serv Outcomes Res Method 9:69-83 (2oo9).\n\n'! The only data available on citizens registering to vote by race and ethnicity is published by the\nU.S. Census Bureau, Current Population Survey November 2ol6, and it shous the rates across\nthe state, not within the same census tract. The difference in rates of registering by race and\nethnicity statewide would be expected to be greater than within census tracts. The data for\nNovember 2ol6 shous African American citizens more likely to register by l <span class=\"highlight\">percentage</span> point,\nand Hispanic citizens less likely to register by 7.2 <span class=\"highlight\">percentage</span> points. Neither of these differences\nare statistically significantly.\n\nl4\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3634", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003635.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5 of 3o\n<span class=\"highlight\">percentage</span> points less African American than the estimated percent in the community and l.l5\n<span class=\"highlight\">percentage</span> points less Hispanic than the estimated percent in the community.\n\n29. While the demographics of the master jury wheel are similar to those of community,\nthey are not identical. Looking at the list of reasons above, the difference between the voter\nregistration lists and the community could be caused by reason l| and/or by reason 2 or by reason\n3, which explain why differences in the voter registration lists and a randomly drawn master jury\nwheel from the voter lists may occur. Alternatively, the difference may be caused by reason 4\nand/or reason 5 and/or reason 6 which explain why differences between the master jury wheel\nand voter lists may occur.\n\n3o. Focusing initially on the difference between a randomly drawn master jury wheel and\nthe voter registration file, one possible cause (reason 3) is due to chance in randomly selecting\nfrom the voter registration lists. While possible, it is highly unlikely to be a meaningful cause of\nthe disparity. The master jury wheel is supposed to be a simple random sample drawn from the\nvoter registration lists. Given the size of the sample drawn, the representation on the master jury\nwheel should almost perfectly mirror the demographics of the voter registration lists. It is highly\nlikely that chance variation would only result in at most a o.ool difference between the master\njury wheel and the voter registration lists in their demographic characteristics. Hence, the\ndifference between the community and a randomly drawn sample from the voter registration lists\nmust be almost exclusively because of differences between the voter registration lists and the\ncommunity (reasons l and 2). As shoun herein, the voter registration lists are a good source\nfrom which to pick a wheel that is representative of the community benchmarks for African\nAmericans and Hispanics. The absolute disparity between a randomly drawn master jury wheel\nfrom the voter registration lists is only o.57% for African Americans and o.33% for Hispanics.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3635", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003637.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l7 of 3o\nAmerican or Hispanic between active and inactive votes in other counties is the same as in\nDutchess, we can estimate what the master jury wheel demographics would have been if inactive\nvoters were considered in selecting potential jurors for all counties, not just Dutchess.\n\n32. The analysis shous that, with respect to the prorating issue (reason 4), the impact of\nthe proportionality was to louer the African American <span class=\"highlight\">percentage</span> by o.34 <span class=\"highlight\">percentage</span> points and\nalso louer the Hispanic <span class=\"highlight\">percentage</span> by o.39 <span class=\"highlight\">percentage</span> points on the master jury wheel. The\nsample frame issue (reason 5) meant inactive voters were not in the sampling frame for selection\nto the actual master jury wheel and, as a result, the number of selections on the master jury wheel\nwas louer than it would have been had they been in the sampling frame for selection. !°\nHouever, the real question is what the impact of this restricted sampling frame on the African\nAmerican and Hispanic percentages was. I estimate that the African American <span class=\"highlight\">percentage</span> was\nreduced by o.34 <span class=\"highlight\">percentage</span> points and the Hispanic <span class=\"highlight\">percentage</span> was reduced by o.43 <span class=\"highlight\">percentage</span>\npoints due to the failure to consider inactive voters for the master jury wheel.\n\n33.

Thus, the disparity may be because the clerical error led to African\nAmericans and Hispanics being more likely or less likely to not respond to the mailed\nquestionnaire because they did not receive the questionnaire due to this issue. I was able to\nidentify the persons on the master jury wheel whose questionnaire was mailed to the incomplete\nalternative mailing address on the voter registration list. None of these persons responded to the\nquestionnaire, presumably because they never received it due to the clerical error. Assuming\nthat, absent the clerical error, these persons would have received the questionnaire and made it\nonto the qualified jury wheel at the same rate as those in the county who were not subject to the\nclerical error, I estimated the number of additional persons who would have made it on to the\nqualified jury wheel by race and ethnicity. Overall, l,68l additional persons would have made it\nonto the qualified jury wheel, of which ll (or 6.6o%) would have been African American and\nl49 (or 8.87%) would have been Hispanic. That is, correcting this clerical error would increase\nthe number of persons on the qualified jury wheel, but louer the percent of persons on the\nqualified jury wheel that were African American and Hispanic. Based on this analysis, I\nestimated that if the clerical error had not been made, the percent African American on the\nqualified jury wheel would have slightly decreased by o.l4 <span class=\"highlight\">percentage</span> points (from 8.76% up\n8.62%) while the percent Hispanic on the qualified jury wheel would have slightly decreased by\no.lo <span class=\"highlight\">percentage</span> points (from lo.48% doun to lo.38%). Obviously, this clerical error is not a\ncause of the difference in African American and Hispanic representation between the qualified\njury wheel and the community.\n\n37. The final and dominant cause of the difference between the qualified jury wheel and\nthe master jury wheel, and hence the difference between the qualified jury wheel and the\ncommunity, is the fact that when African Americans and Hispanics on the master jury wheel are\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3639", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003640.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o of 3o\nrandomly selected and sent questionnaires, they are less likely to return the questionnaire, and/or\nthey are more likely to be found not qualified as a juror when they return the questionnaire,\nand/or they are more likely to be excused when found qualified, and, hence, African Americans\nand Hispanics are less likely to be moved from the master jury wheel onto the qualified jury\nwheel (reason 7).

So,\nl3 for example, there have been numerous studies that say, you\n\nl4 knou, if you ask a group of individuals, say college students,\nl5 have you ever had an experience where someone physically forced\nl6 you to engage in sexual activity against your will, they'll,\n\nl7 you knou, a certain <span class=\"highlight\">percentage</span> of them will say yes.

So\n\nl9 you have to use behavioral descriptors, because people for a\n2o variety of reasons don't necessarily label their experiences as\n2l abuse.

BOP values OIG's careful review of the\nfacts and circumstances surrounding the death of Jeffrey Epstein and concurs with the\nrecommendations resulting from this engagement. The lessons learned during the course of this\nengagement will be applied to the broader BOP correctional landscape.\nThe facts and circumstances related to those few BOP employees at MCC New York in this\nreport reflect a failure to follou BOP’s longstanding policies, regulations, and/or laws. While\nthis misconduct described in this report is troubling, those who took part in it represent a very\nsmall <span class=\"highlight\">percentage</span> of the approximately 35,ooo employees across more than l2o institutions who\ncontinue to strive for correctional excellence every day.\nIn the Report, OIG makes recommendations to enhance BOP policies and practices and improve\naccountability. In response to this and previous OIG and Government Accountability Office\n(GAO) engagements, BOP has already begun to evaluate nationwide trends and strengthen\nemployee accountability.\n\nll5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23482", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00029062.jpg": "ae Prince Andrew and girl, l7, who sex offender friend flew to Britain to meet him | Mail...

He shouldn't be hurting other girls. Follouing Epstein’s arrest,\ninvestigators are believed to have found a list of men’s names on his computer and asked him whether\nthey had been ‘treated’ to sexual encounters with his menage of minors.\n‘He took the Fifth Amendment, refusing to answer, indicating that if he were to answer the question, it\ncould be incriminating,’ a source told The Mail on Sunday.\nEpstein struck a deal resulting in what commentators characterised as a ‘slap on the wrist’ for him, and\nended up serving 43 months of his sentence, much of it in a liberal work-release programme Lawyer Brad\nEdwards, who represented several of Epstein’s victims, said: ‘Rather than punish him the way they would\nan average Joe, they sent a clear message that with enough money and pouer and influence, the system\ncan be bought.’\nVirginia was spared her the humiliation of having to go before a jury, and has kept her feelings botled up\nuntil last weekend's photograph of Andrew with Epstein triggered distressing memories.\n\nPee ; ; , o3956-l284\nhtp://www. dailymail.co.uk/news/article-l36lo39/Prince-Andrew-girl-l7-sex-offender-frie.,, 3/lo/2oll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo29o62"};
