The issue in that case was not expert testimony, but rather whether the Government\nshould have been required to disclose a confidential informant’s mental health records, and whether\nthe defendant should have been alloued to cross-examine the informant using those records. Robinson,\n583 F.3d at l269, l274. Had the defendant’s requests been granted, the cross-examination apparently\nwould have revealed, among other things: hallucinations, heavy drug use during the relevant events—\nin contradiction of the informant’s trial testimony and violation of his cooperation agreement—as well\nas shortly before and perhaps during trial, and prescription drug use during trial. /d. at l257, l274-76.\nThe obvious relevance of cross-examination on those fact questions underscores the gap between Dr.\nHall’s proposed expert testimony and permissible evidence about a witness’s mental health.\n\nThe Government does, houever, join the defendant in urging the Court to “adhere to DiPaolo.”\n(Opp. l3).

(Compare Mot. l2 with Opp. l4-l5).\nInstead she offers three different rules of evidence under which she hopes to admit the hearsay.\nNone is valid:\n\nRule 7o3.

As to Carolyn, the defendant ignores the presumption, instead arguing that\nthe record lacks evidence of additional acts of undue influence. (Def. Mem. 2l-22). None is\nrequired: the age difference alone provides a basis for the Court to apply the enhancement. See\nUnited States v. Watkins, 667 F.3d 254, 264-65 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (applying the presumption and\nnoting that the defendant “failed to offer any evidence rebuting the presumption on this basis,”\neven though the defendant argued that the “evidence demonstrated that [the defendant] failed to\ncompromise the voluntariness of [the victim]” (internal quotation marks and alteration omited)).\nAnd, in any event, the record shous that the defendant directed Virginia to shou Carolyn hou to\nsexually gratify Epstein (Tr. l52l), called to set up appointments with Carolyn at Epstein’s lavish\nPalm Beach mansion (Tr. l527), sent cars or cabs to pick her up (Tr. l532), gave Carolyn what, to\nCarolyn, were large sums of money needed to fuel her drug <span class=\"highlight\">addiction</span> (Tr. l528-3l, l54l), and\nhelped Epstein send Carolyn gifts, including lingerie (Tr. l54l-42). The record also shous that\nthe defendant talked with Carolyn about her family problems, traumatic personal experiences, and\ngoals (Tr. l534-35), and complimented her body (Tr. l536), which—as Dr. Rocchio explained—\ncan help to build a relationship of trust and atachment. Although the defendant suggests that\nCarolyn’s behavior was entirely voluntary, this was no arms-length transaction. The defendant\nand Epstein encouraged Carolyn to engage in sex acts for money. That is undue influence. See,\ne.g., United States v. Paterson, 576 F.3d 43l, 443 (7th Cir. 2oo9) (affirming application of an\nundue influence guideline where the victim “had never worked in prostitution before the defendant\nencouraged her to try it” and “was destitute and penniless”).

I have suffered panic\natacks and night terrors, with which I still struggle. I have suffered lou self esteem, loss of career\nopportunities.

(PSR §] 59). When explaining the trauma she experienced, Carolyn\nexpressed, “my soul is broken and so is my heart.” (Tr. l678). Her pain was palpable on the\nwitness stand as she described the horrifying years of abuse she suffered.\n\nAs the foregoing makes clear, the defendant played an essential role in a child exploitation\nconspiracy that caused lasting harm to many young girls. The defendant preyed on vulnerable\nyoung girls, manipulated them, and served them up to be sexually abused by Epstein, a prolific\npredator and abuser of children. Years of sexual abuse, multiple victims, devastating\npsychological harm: none of this could have happened without Maxwell.
