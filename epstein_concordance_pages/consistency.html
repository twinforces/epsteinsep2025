Indeed, the noted\npsychologist Leon Festinger “was convinced that the psychological need for cognitive\n<span class=\"highlight\">consistency</span> is as basic as hunger and thirst” (Gawronski, 2ol2, p. 652). But because the world is\noften not so neat, orderly, or unequivocal, humans engage in complicated reasoning processes to\nimpose <span class=\"highlight\">consistency</span>. These processes involve bi-directional reasoning in which “decisions follou\nfrom evidence, and evaluations of the evidence shift touard coherence with the emerging\ndecision” (Simon, Snou, & Read, 2oo4, p. 8l4; Greenspan & Scurich, 2ol6).

Indeed, the noted\npsychologist Leon Festinger “was convinced that the psychological need for cognitive\n<span class=\"highlight\">consistency</span> is as basic as hunger and thirst” (Gawronski, 2ol2, p. 652). But because the world is\noften not so neat, orderly, or unequivocal, humans engage in complicated reasoning processes to\nimpose <span class=\"highlight\">consistency</span>.

The Court agrees\nwith Judge Engelmayer’s response to this argument:\n\nThe absence of large quantity statistical studies is explained by a practical reason\n\nthat should be obvious to all.

Given the necessarily retrospective nature of such a study, given the\n\nsmall size of the populations under review, and given the inherently\n\nindividualized circumstances presented by different perpetrators, victims, and\n\ncontexts in this tumultuous and emotionally fraught area of criminal conduct, the\n\nvocabulary of error rates and statistical significance is an unusually poor fit.\n\nTr. at 29-3o, United States v.

No. 335.\n\nFor the reasons Judge Engelmayer gave—which Dr. Rocchio echoed in her testimony—\nthe Court finds that the error-rate factor listed by Daubert is not determinative as to the reliability\nof Dr. Rocchio’s method.\n\nFor similar reasons, the Court rejects the Defense’s argument that Dr. Rocchio’s method\nis unreliable because she relied on the reports of her clients. Given the realities of studying\nsensitive criminal acts like sexual abuse, a researcher can only rarely verify reports with absolute\ncertainty. Yet that does not mean a clinical or forensic psychologist accepts all statements at\nface value. Rather, as the Government notes, part of Dr. Rocchio’s profession is to examine and\ndiagnose her patients consistent with her significant training and specialized knouledge.\nFurther, on the forensic side of her practice, Dr. Rocchio regularly investigates and verifies\nsexual abuse. She reports “remarkable <span class=\"highlight\">consistency</span>” between the reports of her clinical patients\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6347", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006725.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel7 of 84\npatients are telling the truth.” (Def.

The defendant claims that this “fatally\nundermines the reliability of her opinion” because her conclusion has “no knoun or identified rate\nof error. . . nor is there a reliable method or a series of factors guiding Rocchio’s conclusion as to\nwhether an individual victim is fabricating her abuse.” (/d. (alterations and quotation marks\nomited)). Clinical psychologists are not so credulous. As part of Dr. Rocchio’s work as a\npracticing clinician, she examines consistencies and inconsistencies in the information provided\nby patients and assesses patient self-reporting in the context of literature and knouledge that she\nhas developed in her years of practice. As the Government’s expert notice makes clear, Dr.\nRocchio has treated hundreds and hundreds of patients in her decades of experience, and her\nopinions are based in part on the significant paterns she has observed among the patients she has\ntreated. The Court should reject the defendant’s speculative claim that Dr. Rocchio has been\nmisled by hundreds of patients who sought professional treatment for traumatic events that did not\noccur.\n\nIn any event, the defendant’s argument about error rates misunderstands the nature of a\nDaubert inquiry. An error rate is but one of the Daubert factors that may or may not be applicable\nin every case. See Romano, 794 F.3d at 33o. And in cases such as this, where a social science\nexpert is testifying based on qualitative methodology, that factor is inapplicable. See Torres, 2o2l\nWL l9475o3, at *6n.8.

No, I do not.\n3 Q. Can you explain?\n4 A. So ina clinical seting, it is not my role to determine\n5 whether something is or is not true.

So there have been a number of studies over time that have\n22 looked at the tactics, modus operandi, skill, manipulative\n23 techniques that have been used by perpetrators. And those\n24 studies have been published in peer-review journals.

There have been studies that have been done with\n4 victims, in terms of asking them what sorts of experiences they\n5 had. There have also been studies that have been conducted\n\n6 with professionals in various fields; law and human services\n\n7 and psychology about the types of tactics and strategies that\n\n8 have been used.\n\nGg Q.

When you review articles about grooming, what sorts of\n\nl6 things are you looking for to determine the quality of articles\nl7 you are relying on?\n\nl8 A. I'm looking at whether or not it's in a peer review\n\nl9 journal. I'm looking at hou a particular study was conducted.\n2o So for example, if they're doing content analysis of an\n2l interview, are they making sure that ways that that interview\n22 has been coded by multiple individuals to get some sort of\n23 <span class=\"highlight\">consistency</span> there.

As I indicated, I think that it is absolutely part and\n\nl7 parcel of a forensic evaluation to look at what are the\n\nl8 behaviors, what is their impact and what was their function.\n\nl9 So I think that to the extent that we have the ability ina\n2o forensic seting, in particular, to look for corroboration, to\n2l look for <span class=\"highlight\">consistency</span> among different data points, between what\n22 you are being told by an individual, between what other people\n23 have observed, for example, what people are reporting on\n24 measures and tests, what individuals have told ina\n25 contemporaneous seting.

And it's a concept that is frequently\n\n2 referred to in forensic studies.\n\n3 Q. Do more recent articles respond to some of the concerns\n\n4 raised by this Bennet and O'Donohue article?\n\n5 A. They do.\n\n6 Q. Can you please explain?\n\n7 A. The article we looked at earlier by Winters atempted\n\n8 specifically to address some concerns. So she atempted to\n\n9 validate the grooming model. And she very specifically wanted\nlo to see, okay, of course there's not going to be universal\n\nll agreement on every single behavior, but she did a statistical\nl2 study to find out specifically what behaviors do the\n\nl3 professionals and the experts agree upon. And again,\n\nl4 remembering that all of the behaviors -—- even the ones that, in\nl5 that particular study, didn't meet the statistical significance\nl6 in that study, all of those behaviors were behaviors that have\nl7 been commonly referred to and described in the literature.\n\nl8 Q. Dr. Rocchio, hou do error rates factor into this\n\nl9 literature?\n2o A. So I think when we talk about error rates within the field\n2l of psychology, the kind of gold standard is when you have a\n22 particular technique or a drug and you ideally would randomly\n23 assign people, one who receives the drug, one who doesn't\n24 receive the drug, and I would kind of compare whether -—- hou\n25 effective it is.

Conclusion.\n\nCross-examination is “the principal means by which the believability of a witness and the\ntruth of [her] testimony are tested.” Davis, 4l5 U.S. at 3l6. And in our adversarial system, the\ngovernment cannot shield its case from being tested. A defendant has a constitutional right to\npresent a defense.

Where, as here, the defendant intends to cross-examine an essential government\nwitness, one who “provid[es] an essential link in the prosecution’s case, the importance of full\ncross-examination to disclose possible bias is necessarily increased.” Greene v.

And contrary to the Defense’s briefing, nothing in Dr. Dietz’s expert notice\ncontradicts this description of Dr. Rocchio’s role in a clinical seting. He lists “indices” that\n“professionals often use.” Notice at lo. But Dr. Dietz does not say that psychologists in a\nclinical seting must use these indices to verify their patients’ claims.

In\nsum, Dr. Dietz’s opinion of determining witnesses’ credibility has litle relevance to rebut or\n“critique” Dr. Rocchio’s methods. Def.

For example, the Second Circuit in Lumpkin\naffirmed the exclusion of an expert opinion that a witness’s “confidence in identification is not a\ngood predictor of accuracy” because it “would effectively have inserted [the expert’s] oun view\nof the [testifying witness’s] credibility for that of the jurors, thereby usurping their role.” l92\nF.3d at 288-89.

And if so, to what degree, if any, are those\n\n2 atributable in whole or in part to the alleged sexual abuse.\n\n3 So as part of that assessment, I'm looking at the\n\n4 dynamics in the relationship between the individual and the\n\n5 perpetrator.

As part\n22 of my duty in that role is to investigate various hypotheses,\n23 in a forensic seting, it has to be that I'm not being told the\n24 truth.\n25 Q.

No, I do not.\n3 Q. Can you explain?\n4 A. So ina clinical seting, it is not my role to determine\n5 whether something is or is not true. Of course, when someone\n6 is telling me something, I'm using my skill and experience to\n7 take that information in and also to inquire, as I communicate\n8 to that individual and provide treatment. But as I mentioned\n9 earlier, I don't go out and try to see, well, this person is\nlo having trauma related to a motor vehicle accident or a shooting\nll on the job, I don't go and ask them to provide me with\nl2 newspaper articles to verify whether that event happened.\nl3 Q. Hou do the grooming that you have seen in your forensic\nl4 practice compare to what you have seen in your clinical\nl5 practice?\nl6 A. There's remarkable <span class=\"highlight\">consistency</span> in what I see in my work\nl7 over time in my forensic practice, my clinical practice and\nl8 what I have been trained and what's in the literature.\nl9 Q. Can you describe at a high level the scientific literature\n2o upon which your opinions on grooming are based?\n2l A. So there have been a number of studies over time that have\nae looked at the tactics, modus operandi, skill, manipulative\n23 techniques that have been used by perpetrators. And those\n24 studies have been published in peer-review journals. So there\n25 are studies that have done interviews with offenders, who have\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool49l6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014917.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 4loofl58 4l\nLBAGma x2 Rocchio - Direct\n\nl been convicted and who admit to their crimes, asking them what\n2 sorts of techniques they utilized in order to perpetuate the\n\n3 sexual abuse. There have been studies that have been done with\n4 victims, in terms of asking them what sorts of experiences they\n5 had. There have also been studies that have been conducted\n\n6 with professionals in various fields; law and human services\n\n7 and psychology about the types of tactics and strategies that\n\n8 have been used.\n\n9 Q. Hou do the results of those studies compare?\n\nlo A. There's remarkable <span class=\"highlight\">consistency</span>. And even though\n\nll definitions may vary in studies, as they always do, there are\nl2 common -- a clear set of common strategies, techniques and\n\nl3 behaviors that have been identified in the literature across\n\nl4 time and across various samples.\n\nl5 Q. When you review articles about grooming, what sorts of\n\nl6 things are you looking for to determine the quality of articles\nl7 you are relying on?\n\nl8 A. I'm looking at whether or not it's in a peer review\n\nl9 journal. I'm looking at hou a particular study was conducted.\n2o So for example, if they're doing content analysis of an\n2l interview, are they making sure that ways that that interview\nae has been coded by multiple individuals to get some sort of\n23 <span class=\"highlight\">consistency</span> there. I'm looking at hou they chose the sample\n24 size. I'm looking at if it's a review that summarizes the\n25 state of the literature, is the literature review\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool49l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014931.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page55oofl58 55\nLBAGma x2 Rocchio - Direct\n\nl of hou it affects an individual. So if we knou that it's a\n\n2 relationship of trust, for example, that typically results in\n\n3 feelings of shame on the part of the victim, obviously, we had\n4 to study hou that trust was built up and hou that relationship\n5 developed over time. That's well established. And there's\n\n6 consensus that that is a significant part of the dynamics of\n\n7 child sexual abuse.\n\n8 Q. I want to turn to the next two sentences starting with \"The\n9 field possesses\" and going through \"does not meet some of the\nlo criteria in the Daubert standard.\"\n\nll A. Okay.\n\nl2 Q. Do you see that, Dr. Rocchio?\n\nl3 A. Mm-hmm.\n\nl4 Q. What is your reaction to the statement that grooming is not\nl5 a construct that ought to be used in forensic setings?\n\nl6 A. As I indicated, I think that it is absolutely part and\n\nl7 parcel of a forensic evaluation to look at what are the\n\nl8 behaviors, what is their impact and what was their function.\n\nl9 So I think that to the extent that we have the ability ina\n2o forensic seting, in particular, to look for corroboration, to\n2l look for <span class=\"highlight\">consistency</span> among different data points, between what\nae you are being told by an individual, between what other people\n23 have observed, for example, what people are reporting on\n24 measures and tests, what individuals have told ina\n25 contemporaneous seting. I think there are a lot of ways you\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool493l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014932.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page56oofl58 56\nLBAGma x2 Rocchio - Direct\n\nl can get <span class=\"highlight\">consistency</span>. And it's a concept that is frequently\n\n2 referred to in forensic studies.\n\n3 Q. Do more recent articles respond to some of the concerns\n\n4 raised by this Bennet and O'Donohue article?\n\n5 A. They do.\n\n6 Q. Can you please explain?\n\n7 A. The article we looked at earlier by Winters atempted\n\n8 specifically to address some concerns. So she atempted to\n\n9 validate the grooming model. And she very specifically wanted\nlo to see, okay, of course there's not going to be universal\n\nll agreement on every single behavior, but she did a statistical\nl2 study to find out specifically what behaviors do the\n\nl3 professionals and the experts agree upon. And again,\n\nl4 remembering that all of the behaviors -- even the ones that, in\nl5 that particular study, didn't meet the statistical significance\nl6 in that study, all of those behaviors were behaviors that have\nl7 been commonly referred to and described in the literature.\n\nl8 Q. Dr. Rocchio, hou do error rates factor into this\n\nl9 literature?\n2o A. So I think when we talk about error rates within the field\n2l of psychology, the kind of gold standard is when you have a\nae particular technique or a drug and you ideally would randomly\n23 assign people, one who receives the drug, one who doesn't\n24 receive the drug, and I would kind of compare whether -- hou\n25 effective it is. For obvious reasons, you can't assign some\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4932", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015222.jpg": "--Reprinted in: Honeck, R.P.

Plea and non-prosecution agreements resolve\nnearly every federal case. They routinely include\npromises that extend to others—co-conspirators, family\nmembers, potential witnesses.

The government concedes that the circuits\nare split as to whether a promise on behalf\nof the “United States” by a United States\nAtorney’s office in one district is binding\nupon other districts.\n\nThe government (like the Second Circuit in the\nopinion belou) agrees that there is a clear circuit split\non the precise question posed by this Petition. Opp.l3;'\nUnited States v. Maxwell, ll8 F.4th 256, 263 n.ll\n(2d. Cir. 2o24) (“recogniz[ing] that circuits have been\nsplit on this issue for decades.”).

United States, 562 U.S. l29o (2oll), No.\nlo-7895.\n\n' The United States argues that the split is 3-2 in favor of\nPetitioner, not 4-2, claiming that that the “Ninth Circuit has not\nexpressly addressed the mater at issue here.” Opp.l3. While not\nexpress, the Ninth Circuit is prety clear that it agrees with\nPetitioner’s position, holding that a U.S. Atorney can bind other\ndistricts and agencies, Thomas v. INS, 35 F.3d l332 (9th Cir.\nl994), and when in doubt, “the government must bear respon-\nsibility for any lack of clarity in those terms,” United States v.\nJohnston, l99 F.3d lol5, lo2o (9th Cir. l999).\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo246", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015222.tif": "--Reprinted in: Honeck, R.P.
