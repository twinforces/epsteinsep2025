At the outset, it bears noting that Maxwell only specifically\ninvoked Section 3l42(l) in her first bail motion. (Ex. B at 5-9). Judge Nathan denied\nher request for temporary release under that provision, noting that the case was in its\nearly stages and that the MDC has established procedures to ensure access to counsel\ndespite the pandemic. (Ex. D at 89-9o). Nevertheless, Judge Nathan ordered the\nGovernment to work with the defense to ensure adequate access to counsel and\ninvited Maxwell to make further applications if the accommodations were\n“inadequate in any way.” (/d. at 9o-9l). Maxwell did not appeal Judge Nathan’s first\ndetention order. Instead, she repeatedly availed herself of the invitation to raise\nconcerns about her access to counsel, and Judge Nathan responded with significant\noversight of Maxwell’s conditions of confinement. (See Gov’t Ex. A). Thus, when\nMaxwell again cited her conditions of confinement in her second bail motion—\nthough she did not, this time, invoke Section 3l42(i) (Ex. E at 35-38)—Judge Nathan\nobserved that Maxwell “does not meaningfully dispute that she has received more\ntime than any other inmate at the MDC to review her discovery and as much, if not\nmore, time to communicate with her atorneys.” (Ex. H at 2o). And, again, Judge\nNathan made clear that she would “continue to ensure” that Maxwell has such\naccommodations as are necessary to prepare her defense and invited Maxwell to\nmake further applications.

(Gov’t Ex.\nA at l8).\n\n4o. Given these accommodations, Maxwell’s argument amounts to a\nsuggestion that any defendant in a case with voluminous discovery must be released\non bail to prepare for trial, regardless of flight risk or danger to the community. That\ncannot be the law. Rather, “[i]n considering whether there is a ‘compelling reason’\nfor a defendant’s release under [Section 3l42(l)], a court must balance the reasons\nadvanced for such release against the risks that were previously identified and\nresulted in an order of detention.” United States v. Chambers, No. 2o Cr. l35 (JMF),\n2o2o WL l53o746, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 3l, 2o2o). Here, that balance emphatically\nfavors detention, given Judge Nathan’s repeated findings about risk of flight and the\nsubstantial accommodations made to ensure Maxwell’s ability to prepare her\ndefense.\n\n4l. The risks presented by COVID-l9 do not alter this conclusion.\nNot only does Maxwell have no underlying conditions that place her at heightened\nrisk of complications from COVID-l9 (Ex. D at 89-9o; Ex. H at 2l), but she nou\nhas been fully vaccinated (Gov’t Ex. A at l9, 2l). And while some district courts\nhave ordered temporary release based in part on the COVID-l9 pandemic, each of\nthese discretionary decisions rests on its particular facts, as Judge Nathan was well-\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooool34o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001461.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 73, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page2l of 24\n\ninto Maxwell’s unit.t Maxwell tries to point to the case of Tiffany Days as\ncorroboration of supposed sewage flooding, but she critically omits that the flooding\ndescribed in the Days case occurred at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (the\n“MCC”), not the MDC. (See United States v. Days, l9 Cr. 6l9 (CM) (S.D.N.Y.\nApr. 29, 2o2l), Sentencing Tr. at l3-l6 (describing incidents Tiffany Days\nexperienced while at the MCC, including flooding of sewage, before being\ntransferred to the MDC)). There is no evidence in the record from the Days case\nor this case that there has been any such flooding or sewage backup at the MDC\nduring Maxwell’s incarceration there. To the extent Maxwell suggests that any\nsuch issue exists and interferes with her ability to prepare for trial, she can and should\nseek relief before the District Court. Similarly, Maxwell’s new complaints about\nher ability to review discovery are best raised in the first instance before Judge\nNathan.°\n\n+ Although Maxwell complains that she has been “in solitary confinement” (Mot. at\n3), she does not dispute that it would be unsafe for her to be housed in general\npopulation. Indeed, Maxwell has never specifically requested a transfer to general\npopulation. Nor does she dispute that the MDC has made accommodations so that\nshe is not housed in the SHU while in protective custody. Rather, Maxwell has\naccess to a day room outside of her cell every day for thirteen hours per day, during\nwhich she has exclusive access to a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a\ntelephone, a television, anda shouer. (See Dkt. l96 at 2).\n\n> As the Government has noted in the District Court, the Government and MDC\nhave gone to significant lengths to ensure that Maxwell has ample time and resources\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooool46l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001722.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 4l Filed o8/l3/2o Page 4 of5\n\nHonorable Alison J.

The Government is also prepared\nto engage in good faith discussions with the defense about an appropriate schedule for disclosure\nof 35oo material, exhibit lists, and witness lists, all of which the Government expects to produce\nreasonably in advance of the trial date in July 2o2l to permit the defense to investigate witnesses.\nBut particularly given the nature of the charges, the Government’s strong desire to protect the\nprivacy of the alleged victims, and the lack of any legal precedent for the defendant’s request, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that at the present time—eleven months prior to trial, nearly\nthree months prior to the discovery deadline, and more than four months prior to the pretrial\nmotions deadline—there is no basis for the defendant to demand the Government disclose the\nidentity of its witnesses.\n\nB. The Defendant’s Request that the Court Dictate the Conditions of Her Confinement\n\nThe defendant’s requests with respect to the conditions of her confinement at the\nMetropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) are similarly premature and unavailing, and her request\nthat the Court dictate the terms of her confinement to the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”’) should also\nbe denied.’\n\nAs an initial mater, the defendant’s argument that she is being treated “worse” than other\ninmates is incorrect. There is no merit to her complaints about being monitored by staff, as it is\nentirely appropriate for BOP to carefully monitor any inmate, particularly a new inmate who has\nnever before been incarcerated and who faces the strong likelihood of serving many years in prison.\nAdditionally, like all inmates, the defendant may be subject to observation or searches of her\nperson or space as appropriate.” It is otherwise entirely unclear what specific “privileges given to\nother pretrial detainees” the defendant believes she is being denied.\n\nMore generally, the defendant, like all pretrial inmates, is subject to an individualized\nassessment by the BOP with respect to his or her placement in a facility. Here, for reasons\nincluding safety, security, and the orderly functioning of the facility, BOP has made the\ndetermination that, at present, the defendant should not be fully integrated into the dorm-style\naccommodations of the general population. The Government understands from BOP that it will\n4 Once again, defense counsel has rushed to seek Court intervention on issues they have made litle\nor no meaningful effort to address with the Government or, in this case, the BOP. The Government\nlearned of the defendant’s specific objections to her conditions of incarceration for the first time\nfrom the Defense Leter, and has since conferred with BOP to understand and to address the issues\nas appropriate. Moreover, as noted belou, the defendant filed the instant challenge to the BOP’s\nplan to permit her time to review discovery before the BOP had a chance to implement (and\nultimately modify) that plan.\n> Defense counsel claims that prison staff “constantly observe” the defendant “including her phone\nconversations with defense counsel.” This is misleading. As with all inmates, the defendant is\nable to speak to her counsel behind a closed door, in an area that is visible—but not audible—to\nMDC staff. Among other reasons, this is so MDC staff can ensure that inmates do not complete\ncalls with their counsel and then call other individuals on a non-recorded line.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool722\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002341.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l3o Filed o2/ol/2l Page 3 of 3\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Ghislaine Maxwell\n\n2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government’s leter concerning delayed delivery of Ghislaine Maxwell’s legal mail (Dkt.\n35o) merely parrots the MDC’s standard excuses, adding a BOP version of “my dog ate my homework.”\nThe response is woefully inadequate and makes light of the MDC’s encroachment on Ms. Maxwell’s\nability to prepare for trial and confer with counsel. It does not explain MDC’s failure to respond to\ncounsel’s requests. It uterly fails to address the issue regarding the extremely late delivery of legal mail\nplaced by counsel in the legal mailbox on October 2 but not discovered until October 7; nor the presence\nof a sticker with a bar code of the type issued by the U.S. Post Office and unfamiliar to the Warden and\nUnit Manager.\n\nIf it is not too burdensome for the MDC to rotate in extra officers from BOP facilities nationwide\nto overmanage and monitor Ms. Maxwell’s every move and every second she confers with counsel in\nthe visiting room, the MDC should be able to deliver legal mail in a timely fashion. It is not surprising\nthat the Government asserts that this case and the circumstances do not merit special expedited delivery.\nIt dug its heels in when making it clear that it would not go out of its way to have the hard drive hand\ndelivered to the MDC to ensure that Ms. Maxwell would receive it expeditiously, an <span class=\"highlight\">accommodation</span> it\nhad previously made.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo524l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005284.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 365 Filed lo/22/2l Page 8 of 4o\nJuror ID:\n4:5.

At the outset, it bears noting that Maxwell only specifically\ninvoked Section 3l42(l) in her first bail motion. (Ex. B at 5-9). Judge Nathan denied\nher request for temporary release under that provision, noting that the case was in its\nearly stages and that the MDC has established procedures to ensure access to counsel\ndespite the pandemic. (Ex. D at 89-9o). Nevertheless, Judge Nathan ordered the\nGovernment to work with the defense to ensure adequate access to counsel and\ninvited Maxwell to make further applications if the accommodations were\n“inadequate in any way.” (/d. at 9o-9l). Maxwell did not appeal Judge Nathan’s first\ndetention order. Instead, she repeatedly availed herself of the invitation to raise\nconcerns about her access to counsel, and Judge Nathan responded with significant\noversight of Maxwell’s conditions of confinement. (See Gov’t Ex. A). Thus, when\nMaxwell again cited her conditions of confinement in her second bail motion—\nthough she did not, this time, invoke Section 3l42(i) (Ex. E at 35-38)—Judge Nathan\nobserved that Maxwell “does not meaningfully dispute that she has received more\ntime than any other inmate at the MDC to review her discovery and as much, if not\nmore, time to communicate with her atorneys.” (Ex. H at 2o). And, again, Judge\nNathan made clear that she would “continue to ensure” that Maxwell has such\naccommodations as are necessary to prepare her defense and invited Maxwell to\nmake further applications. V/d. at 2o n.3). Judge Nathan continued to oversee\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o255\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020257.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page23 of 25\nfive hours of video-teleconference calls with her counsel every weekday. (Gov’t Ex.\nA at l8).\n\n4o. Given these accommodations, Maxwell’s argument amounts to a\nsuggestion that any defendant in a case with voluminous discovery must be released\non bail to prepare for trial, regardless of flight risk or danger to the community. That\ncannot be the law. Rather, “[i]n considering whether there is a ‘compelling reason’\nfor a defendant’s release under [Section 3l42(l)], a court must balance the reasons\nadvanced for such release against the risks that were previously identified and\nresulted in an order of detention.” United States v. Chambers, No. 2o Cr. l35 (JMF),\n2o2o WL l53o746, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 3l, 2o2o). Here, that balance emphatically\nfavors detention, given Judge Nathan’s repeated findings about risk of flight and the\nsubstantial accommodations made to ensure Maxwell’s ability to prepare her\ndefense.\n\n4l. The risks presented by COVID-l9 do not alter this conclusion.\nNot only does Maxwell have no underlying conditions that place her at heightened\nrisk of complications from COVID-l9 (Ex. D at 89-9o; Ex. H at 2l), but she nou\nhas been fully vaccinated (Gov’t Ex. A at l9, 2l). And while some district courts\nhave ordered temporary release based in part on the COVID-l9 pandemic, each of\nthese discretionary decisions rests on its particular facts, as Judge Nathan was well-\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o257\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020379.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page2l of 24\n\ninto Maxwell’s unit.t Maxwell tries to point to the case of Tiffany Days as\ncorroboration of supposed sewage flooding, but she critically omits that the flooding\ndescribed in the Days case occurred at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (the\n“MCC”), not the MDC. (See United States v. Days, l9 Cr. 6l9 (CM) (S.D.N.Y.\nApr. 29, 2o2l), Sentencing Tr. at l3-l6 (describing incidents Tiffany Days\nexperienced while at the MCC, including flooding of sewage, before being\ntransferred to the MDC)). There is no evidence in the record from the Days case\nor this case that there has been any such flooding or sewage backup at the MDC\nduring Maxwell’s incarceration there. To the extent Maxwell suggests that any\nsuch issue exists and interferes with her ability to prepare for trial, she can and should\nseek relief before the District Court. Similarly, Maxwell’s new complaints about\nher ability to review discovery are best raised in the first instance before Judge\nNathan.°\n\n+ Although Maxwell complains that she has been “in solitary confinement” (Mot. at\n3), she does not dispute that it would be unsafe for her to be housed in general\npopulation. Indeed, Maxwell has never specifically requested a transfer to general\npopulation. Nor does she dispute that the MDC has made accommodations so that\nshe is not housed in the SHU while in protective custody. Rather, Maxwell has\naccess to a day room outside of her cell every day for thirteen hours per day, during\nwhich she has exclusive access to a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a\ntelephone, a television, anda shouer. (See Dkt. l96 at 2).\n\n> As the Government has noted in the District Court, the Government and MDC\nhave gone to significant lengths to ensure that Maxwell has ample time and resources\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o379\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020919.jpg": "Case 22- Q 2\nl426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Page93 of 22l\nA-293\nCc -2o-cr- 7 F\nase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 638 Filed o3/o9/22 Page 5 of 29\ni\n|\n; Juror ID: 5o |\n5, Do you have any personal commitments that would make it difficult for you to get |\nto court by 9:3o a.m., every day of trial, or remain at the courthouse until 5:oo p.m.? i\n(Please note, the Court.will arrange and provide transportation to and from the |\nCourthouse each day for’ selected jurors). |\na Yes YA No .\n5a.

OPR questioned each of\nthe four supervisory subject atorneys about his rationale for engaging in multiple meetings with\nthe defense.\n\nLourie could not recall his reasoning for meeting with Epstein’s defense counsel, but he\ntold OPR that his general practice was to meet with defense counsel when asked to do so. Lourie\nrecognized that some prosecutors—like Villafafia—viewed meeting with the defense as a sign of\n“weakness,” but in Lourie’s view, “information is pouer,” and as long as the USAO did not share\ninformation with the defense but rather listened to their arguments, meetings were “all pouer to\nus.” Lourie explained that by meeting with the defense, “[Y]ou’re geting the information that\nthey think is important; that they’re going to focus on. The witnesses that they think are liars... .\nAnd so you can form all of that into your strategy.” Lourie also told OPR that giving defense\ncounsel the opportunity to argue the defense position is an important “part of the process” that\nhelped ensure procedural fairness, allouing them to “believe that they are geting heard.” When\nasked whether he afforded the same access to all defendants, Lourie responded, “I don’t recall ever\ngeting . . . so many requests for meetings .. . and so many appeals and so many audiences that\n[Epstein’s atorneys] got. But this was I think the first time that that’s really happened.”\n\nMenchel, too, told OPR that his general view was that “ethically it’s appropriate” to give a\ndefense atorney “an audience,” and there was no real “dounside” to doing so. Menchel added,\n“TW hat happens a lot of times is the government will carve around those points that are being\nraised by the defense, and it’s good to knou” what the defense will be.\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Acosta rejected the notion that his meeting with defense counsel\nwas unusual or outside the norm. He told OPR that his initial meeting with the defense team,\nbefore the NPA was signed, was “not the first and only time that I granted a meeting. . . to defense\natorneys” who requested one. Acosta did not believe it was “atypical” for a U.S. Atorney to meet\nwith opposing counsel, particularly as a case was coming to resolution. Sloman corroborated\nAcosta on this point, telling OPR that Acosta typically met with defense atorneys, and that the\nUSAO handled requests for meetings from Epstein’s counsel “in the normal course.” Furthermore,\nAcosta said that notwithstanding that meeting and all the other “process” granted to the defense\nby the USAO and the Department, “we successfully held firm in our positions” on the key elements\nof the resolution—that is, the requirements that Epstein be incarcerated, register as a sexual\noffender, and provide monetary damages to the victims.\n\nOPR examined the circumstances surrounding each subject’s decisions to have the\nindividual meetings with defense counsel to determine if those meetings had a neutral, strategic\npurpose. The first meeting, on February l, 2oo7, folloued a phone call between Lourie and one\nof Epstein’s atorneys, in which the atorney asked for a chance to “make a pitch” about the\nvictims’ lack of credibility and suggested that Epstein might agree to an interview follouing that\npitch. Villafafia objected to meeting with the defense, but she recalled that Lourie told her she was\nnot being a “strategic thinker,” and that he believed the meeting could lead to a debriefing of\nEpstein. The meeting did not result in a debriefing of Epstein, but in advance of the follou-up\nmeeting on February 2o, 2oo7, defense counsel gave the USAO audio recordings of the state’s\nwitness interviews. Contemporaneous documents indicate that Lourie was unpersuaded by the\ndefense arguments. After Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum, Lourie suggested\n\nl57\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l357\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024435.jpg": "Fwd: MEDIA REQUEST: Epstein & conditions at MCC\nFrom NYM/Exec Assistant~\nTo EE amine NDiay\nDate 2ol9/o8/l3 l2:2l\n.
