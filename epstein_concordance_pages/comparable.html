Second, the conduct relevant to\nthe charged crimes allegedly took place in three different locations across the country (New\nYork, Florida, and New Mexico) and in at least one foreign jurisdiction (London, England) over\na four-year period. Hence, it will take time to investigate any witness statements pertaining to\nthe alleged conduct, as well as to identify and interview other witnesses who may contradict the\ngovernment’s witnesses. See United States v. Rueb, No. oo-CR-9l (RWS), 2ool WL 96l77, at\n*8-*9 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 5, 2ool) (disclosure ordered where evidence located in multiple locations\nand offenses spanned three-year “extended period of time”). In particular, international travel\nmay be necessary to investigate statements by witnesses located in England or other foreign\njurisdictions, as will depositions pursuant to Rule l5 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\nSee United States v.

Accordingly, this Court refuses the Defendant’s invitation to expand this “strictly\nlimited” category of “truly ‘exceptional’” circumstances absent binding authority. /d.\n\nSecond, even if a court must imply bias on the basis of a juror’s similar experience, the\nvoir dire in this case of <span class=\"highlight\">comparable</span> jurors evinces that Juror 5o’s personal experience is not so\nsimilar to the issues in this case as to constitute a “truly exceptional” situation. Nor is it\nsufficiently similar to warrant the Court’s exercise of discretion to infer bias. In arguing that\nJuror 5o’s experience is sufficiently similar, the Defendant highlights that Juror 5o was sexually\nabused as a minor on multiple occasions by “two people who were friends”—his stepbrother,\nwho was “someone familiar to him . . . who was part of his life,” and the stepbrother’s friend.\nMaxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 4. He also delayed reporting the abuse. /d. But the Defendant\noverlooks the important differences. Juror 5o was younger—ages 9 and lo—than the victims\ntestified they were when they were abused by the Defendant and Epstein. He disclosed his abuse\nto his mother in high school, unlike the victims here. And unlike the period of two years of\nabuse that Juror 5o endured, some of the trial witnesses testified about several years of abuse.\nLike Juror A and Juror B, the Court would not have implied or inferred bias if Juror 5o had\ndisclosed his experience during jury selection. The Court would have asked appropriate follou-\nup questions proffered by counsel and determined based on the juror’s answers to those\nquestions whether he could serve as a fair and impartial juror.\n\nJuror 5o is also dissimilar to the cases from other federal circuits and state courts cited by\nthe Defendant. For example, as noted above, the Defendant’s prominent citation to Sampson v.\nUnited States is misplaced because the juror in that case told a “litany of lies” bearing on a\nvariety of issues. 724 F.3d at l6l. Thus, unlike here, a “combination of factors” led the First\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo356", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010359.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 36 of 4o\npersonal memories, some from decades earlier and some involving sensitive or tragic events. So\nlong as jurors can be fair and impartial and decide the case based solely on the evidence and the\nlaw as instructed, then it is those “very human elements that constitute one of the strengths of our\njury system, and we cannot and should not excommunicate them from jury deliberations.” U.S.\nex rel. Owen, 435 F.2d at 8l8. In any event, Rule 6o6(b) bars the Court from relying on these\nstatements because they pertain to Juror 5o’s “mental processes concerning the verdict or\nindictment.” Fed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(l). “[P]arsing hou jurors considered the evidence or their\nmental states while hearing testimony is exactly what Tanner and the plain text of Rule 6o6(b)\nseek to prevent.” United States v. Leung, 796 F.3d lo32, lo36 (9th Cir. 2ol5) (cited favorably\nby United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23, l32 (2d Cir. 2ol8)); see also United States v. Abcasis,\n8ll F. Supp. 828, 834 (E.D.N.Y. l992) (Rule 6o6 does not permit inquiry into jurors’\ndiscussions or “reactions to the evidence as it developed” (cleaned up)).\n\nFinally, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s statements about his “healing process” and\nhis hearing testimony as to Question 25 “reveal just hou deeply the trauma affected him and\ncontinues to affect him.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 9. The Court is unpersuaded. First, at\nthe March 8 hearing, the Court rejected the Defendant’s proposed follou-up questions on\nJuror 5o’s “healing process” because the Defendant had not proposed <span class=\"highlight\">comparable</span> questions\nduring the voir dire process for other prospective jurors who indicated a personal history of\nsexual abuse on their questionnaires. Hearing Tr. at 28-29. Moreover, that an individual has\nundergone a “healing process” at some point in his life does not evince that the experience\ninterferes with his ability to be fair and impartial. Juror 5o credibly testified that his sexual abuse\nis not usually on his mind, that the subject mater would not upset him in a way that would\ndistract him from his duty, and that he would not think about his oun experience in a way that\n\n36\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo359", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010467.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 663 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 2l of 77\nwho have been found guilty of dissimilar conduct.”) (citing Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 55\n(2oo7)).\n\nIn addition, a non-guidelines sentence would avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. It\nwould be plainly unjust to sentence Ghislaine Maxwell as if she were Jeffrey Epstein. Had Epstein\nbeen tried on this indictment he would have been exposed to a <span class=\"highlight\">comparable</span> guideline range. Justice\nwould not be served by sentencing Ms. Maxwell to the extent of the more culpable Epstein. Nor\nshould she be sentenced as if she were Harvey Weinstein. Follouing a state jury trial convicting\nhim of forcible rape, Weinstein received a prison sentence of 23 years, less than the louest part of\nthe guideline range calculated by Probation for Ms. Maxwell.\n\nMoreover, a non-guidelines sentence would at least mitigate the drastic disparity between\nthe penalties under state and federal law in this case. The predicate state offense in Counts Three\nand Four — New York Penal Law § l3o.55 — is a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum term of\n9o days’ imprisonment. See United States v. Broun, 843 F.3d 74, 88-89 & n.2 (2d Cir. 2ol6)\n(Pooler, J., dissenting) (noting the stark difference in sentences for offenses involving the sexual\nexploitation of minors under federal law versus New York State law). Viewing the conduct of\nconviction in the light most favorable to the government, imposition of a guideline sentence for\nMs. Maxwell will lead to inequitable and disparate results.\n\nIn this case, the goals of sentencing will be achieved by a significant dounward variance\nfrom the unduly harsh Guidelines range of 292 - 365 months and Probation’s recommended 24o-\nmonth sentence for offense conduct that occurred l8 to 28 years ago and where a 6o-year-old\nfemale defendant with no prior- or post-offense history of misconduct requires no rehabilitation\nby incarceration and poses no risk of recidivism.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo467", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010481.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document663_ Filed o6/l5/22 Page 35of 77\n\nmore than prisoners in mainstream conditions, it follous that proportionality requires the severity\nof confinement be factored into sentencing. Courts sentence convicted offenders to prison as\npunishment. Courts order pretrial defendants detained to safeguard the community and to ensure\npresence at court proceedings, not for punishment. In evaluating the nature and extent of\npunishment, it is important to factor in the actual impact of the hardship on the defendant. If\ndetention imposes an additional burden on a certain category of defendants, it is necessary to\nincorporate the actual total burden of the punishment into sentencing calibrations.\n\nThe principle of proportionality requires that the additional burden experienced by Ms.\nMaxwell during the 22 months spent is in supermax-type conditions should be factored into the\nCourt’s sentencing calculus. Based on the underpinnings of punishment and the principle of\nproportionality, a hard-time credit for Ms. Maxwell’s unusual detention is warranted.\nImprisonment in any form is a severe hardship. This is especially so when a person presumed to\nbe innocent is detained pretrial. The standard measure for evaluating the hardship of incarceration\nis the length of the prison term, i.e., a value is placed on this quantitative measure when assessing\ndamages for wrongful conviction. Regardless of whether there is an objective mathematical\nformula for Ms. Maxwell’s unique situation, a meaningful credit is warranted.’\n\nThere is a manifestly stark qualitative difference in the degree of deprivation, restriction,\nand punishment between the first 22 months of Ms. Maxwell’s detention and her current detention\nin general population.

On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard\nfor Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the\nground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3)\nprovides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only\nby court order,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can\nmove to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nConsistent with the Rule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court\nrequired defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or\nconfidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also\ngave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the\nsubpoena as required by Rule l7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued.

Accordingly, this Court refuses the Defendant’s invitation to expand this “strictly\nlimited” category of “truly ‘exceptional’” circumstances absent binding authority. Jd.\n\nSecond, even if a court must imply bias on the basis of a juror’s similar experience, the\nvoir dire in this case of <span class=\"highlight\">comparable</span> jurors evinces that Juror 5o’s personal experience is not so\nsimilar to the issues in this case as to constitute a “truly exceptional” situation. Nor is it\nsufficiently similar to warrant the Court’s exercise of discretion to infer bias. In arguing that\nJuror 5o’s experience is sufficiently similar, the Defendant highlights that Juror 5o was sexually\nabused as a minor on multiple occasions by “two people who were friends”—his stepbrother,\nwho was “someone familiar to him . . . who was part of his life,” and the stepbrother’s friend.\nMaxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 4. He also delayed reporting the abuse. /d. But the Defendant\noverlooks the important differences. Juror 5o was younger—ages 9 and lo—than the victims\ntestified they were when they were abused by the Defendant and Epstein. He disclosed his abuse\nto his mother in high school, unlike the victims here. And unlike the period of two years of\nabuse that Juror 5o endured, some of the trial witnesses testified about several years of abuse.\nLike Juror A and Juror B, the Court would not have implied or inferred bias if Juror 5o had\ndisclosed his experience during jury selection. The Court would have asked appropriate follou-\nup questions proffered by counsel and determined based on the juror’s answers to those\nquestions whether he could serve as a fair and impartial juror.\n\nJuror 5o is also dissimilar to the cases from other federal circuits and state courts cited by\nthe Defendant. For example, as noted above, the Defendant’s prominent citation to Sampson v.\nUnited States is misplaced because the juror in that case told a “litany of lies” bearing on a\nvariety of issues. 724 F.3d at l6l. Thus, unlike here, a “combination of factors” led the First\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o976", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020979.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel53 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 36 of 4o\npersonal memories, some from decades earlier and some involving sensitive or tragic events. So\nlong as jurors can be fair and impartial and decide the case based solely on the evidence and the\nlaw as instructed, then it is those “very human elements that constitute one of the strengths of our\njury system, and we cannot and should not excommunicate them from jury deliberations.” U.S.\nex rel. Owen, 435 F.2d at 8l8. In any event, Rule 6o6(b) bars the Court from relying on these\nstatements because they pertain to Juror 5o’s “mental processes concerning the verdict or\nindictment.” Fed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(l). “[P]arsing hou jurors considered the evidence or their\nmental states while hearing testimony is exactly what Tanner and the plain text of Rule 6o6(b)\nseek to prevent.” United States v. Leung, 796 F.3d lo32, lo36 (9th Cir. 2ol5) (cited favorably\nby United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23, l32 (2d Cir. 2ol8)); see also United States v. Abcasis,\n8ll F. Supp. 828, 834 (E.D.N.Y. l992) (Rule 6o6 does not permit inquiry into jurors’\ndiscussions or “reactions to the evidence as it developed” (cleaned up)).\n\nFinally, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s statements about his “healing process” and\nhis hearing testimony as to Question 25 “reveal just hou deeply the trauma affected him and\ncontinues to affect him.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 9. The Court is unpersuaded. First, at\nthe March 8 hearing, the Court rejected the Defendant’s proposed follou-up questions on\nJuror 5o’s “healing process” because the Defendant had not proposed <span class=\"highlight\">comparable</span> questions\nduring the voir dire process for other prospective jurors who indicated a personal history of\nsexual abuse on their questionnaires. Hearing Tr. at 28-29. Moreover, that an individual has\nundergone a “healing process” at some point in his life does not evince that the experience\ninterferes with his ability to be fair and impartial. Juror 5o credibly testified that his sexual abuse\nis not usually on his mind, that the subject mater would not upset him in a way that would\ndistract him from his duty, and that he would not think about his oun experience in a way that\n\n36\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o979", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021707.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page6o of 93\n47\n\nMaxwell first relies on Section 3283’s use of the\nphrase “offense involving” the sexual abuse of a child,\nwhich, she contends, “dictates” looking only to the ele-\nments of the offense. (Br.43). But as this Court has al-\nready recognized, Section 3283's text “reaches beyond\nthe offense and its legal elements to the conduct ‘in-\nvolv[ed]’ in the offense”—a “linguistic expansion” that\nshous Congress’s intent for “courts to look beyond the\nbare legal charges in deciding whether § 3283 ap-\nplied.” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 59-6o; see also Niyha-\nwan v. Holder, 557 U.S. 29, 32, 38 (2oo9) (holding that\na statute that includes an “offense ... involves” phrase\nis “consistent with a circumstance-specific approach”).\nIndeed, the Third Circuit has expressly rejected an\n““assential ingredient’ test” <span class=\"highlight\">comparable</span> to the categor-\nical approach and instead applied case-specific analy-\nsis to determine that Section 3283 applied to travel\nwith intent to commit an illegal sex act with a minor,\nin violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2423(b). Schneider, 8ol F.3d\nat l96-97.\n\nMaxwell also argues that “the clear weight of au-\nthority” holds that statutes employing similar lan-\nguage “should be read through a categorical rather\nthan case-specific lens.” (Br.44-45). But the decisions\nshe cites involved statutes with other features favoring\nthe categorical approach, which are notably absent\nhere. Some cases involved statutes that defined a\n“crime of violence” as an offense that either “has as an\nelement” the use of physical force or “by its nature” in-\nvolves a substantial risk of force—language that in-\nvokes an elements-based approach. United States v.\nDavis, l389 S. Ct. 23l9, 2328-29 (2ol9); Leocal v. Ash-\ncroft, 543 U.S. l, 7 (2oo4).
