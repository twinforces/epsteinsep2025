STERNHEIAA\nanything like her current regime.* The follouing conditions and circumstances of her detention,\nindividually and collectively, compromise her opportunity to confer with counsel and prepare her\ndefense for trial and are detrimental to her physical health and psychological well-being:\n\nDe Facto Solitary Confinement: Ms. Maxwell is the sole inmate in a housing unit. By\nthis Court’s order she is permited out of her approximately 9-by-7-foot isolation cell from 7:oo\nam to 8:oo pm, houever, she is frequently picked up late and returned to her cell promptly.\nWhen out of her cell, she is the sole inmate in a fenced off area of an unoccupied dormitory unit,\nwhere she eats, shouers, and reviews legal work while continually guarded by three officers.\n\nDespite being housed on an entire floor by herself, Ms. Maxwell is forced back into a tiny\ncorner of the floor. She is needlessly kept in a 63-square-foot space. She gets very litle sleep,\nas she is frequently woken up by flashlights every l5 minutes, loud discussions among the\nguards, and adjustments of the supplemental camera. Ms. Maxwell is effectively being kept in\nsolitary confinement (she has nou been housed alone for well over loo days) and treated as if\nshe were on suicide watch even though she is not and has never been suicidal.\n\nThe psychological and physiological impact of solitary confinement is well documented.\nMs. Maxwell has not, by her conduct or by virtue of the charges, brought this type of\nconfinement upon herself. This must be considered punishment.\n\nFurther, she has been required to stand for an hour waiting for the lieutenant to move her\nand during “the count” of inmates she is restricted to her bunk despite being housed in a one-\ninmate unit. She has at times been forced to do a standup count after midnight. Nou she is\nrequired to remain on a bed for the duration of the count.\n\nExcessive Scanning and Strip Searching: Ms. Maxwell is searched more frequently and\nextensively than any other pretrial detainee of which we are aware. All security scans to which\nMs. Maxwell have been subjected have returned negative results. Each time Ms. Maxwell is\nmoved from the isolation cell, she is searched and her cell is searched, and the dormitory is\nsearched prior to when she arrives at the dormitory area. Her cell and possessions including her\nlegal papers are searched after she has been moved to the dormitory. The process is repeated\nwhen Ms. Maxwell is brought back to the isolation cell. Recently, Ms. Maxwell was searched at\nleast five separate times and strip-searched twice during one day.\n\nMs. Maxwell is subjected to a body scans each week, and until recently, she received\napproximately three per week. We assume these are to see if Ms. Maxwell has secreted anything\ninside her body. We do not understand why it is necessary for the BOP to administer body scans\non such a regular and frequent basis — and thereby repeatedly expose Ms. Maxwell to <span class=\"highlight\">radiation</span> —\n* Undersigned counsel has represented clients charged with terrorism-related offenses confined to the\nmost restrictive unit in the Metropolitan Correctional Center, Unit lo South, aka “the terrorist SHU”. In\naddition, counsel is Curcio counsel for a client authorized for the death penalty who is in general\npopulation at the MCC. Having visited BOP facilities during the past 35 years and representing clients\ncharged with the most heinous and violent crimes of murder, counsel had never had a client subjected to\nsuch punitive conditions of pretrial (or post-conviction) incarceration as in the present case.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool872\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007513.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page 2o of 375\nAmerican Psychological Association commitee work:\nMember, Communications Commitee, l975-76; Member, Magazine Task Force, l975-76;\nMember, Finance Commitee, l976-78; Member, Comm. on Organization of APA, l977-78;\nCommission on Organization, l978-82; Council of Representatives, Div. 3, l982-85;\nExecutive Commitee, Div. 4l, l98l-85; Member, Ethics Commitee, l984; National\nPolicy Studies Oversight Commitee, l986; Psychology Today, Board of Directors, l987-88;\nComm. on Division/APA Relations (CODAPAR), l988-89, Public Information Comm. l989-l992\nTask Force on Recovered Memories of Child Sexual Abuse, l993-96\nAssociation for Psychological Science (Formerly American Psychological Society) Commitee work:\nFund for Advancement of Psychological Science, Board Member, 2oo3- .

When the bright lights were turned off in her cell, bright lights remained on\ndirectly outside her cell; and the flashlight checks continued, a regime completely inappropriate\nfor a non-suicidal inmate. This unjustified sleep deprivation - which continued throughout trial\nand afterward - affected her general physical condition as well as her psychological well-being.\nThis practice does not exist in general population.\n\nDespite never being in contact with any other inmate, under continuous surveillance by\nprison guards and cameras, and escorted to and from any isolated location, she was subjected to\nan excessive number of physical searches on a daily basis: pat-doun searches, strip searches,\nbody-cavity searches. She was unnecessarily exposed to <span class=\"highlight\">radiation</span> from body scanners; and was\nfortunate not to contract COVID when guards, who were not required to take COVID tests, looked\nand searched inside her mouth. Her cell was searched multiple times daily. The searches were\nredundant, unreasonable, unnecessary, and abusive beyond any legitimate penological purpose,\nespecially where Ms. Maxwell had no opportunity to acquire contraband. See Hodges v. Stanley,\n7l2 F.2d 34, 35-36 (2d Cir. l983). At times, searches were conducted in inappropriate ways and\nwere especially painful humiliating and intimidating, as when her breasts and genitalia were\ntouched in a rough and reckless manner. Reports by Ms. Maxwell and counsel concerning sexually\ninappropriate searches by corrections officers went nouhere.\n\nIt is clearly established that excessive searches are unnecessary and unreasonable when a\nprisoner is isolated from other inmates and never out of range of the camera or a guard. Ms.\nMaxwell was searched every time she was removed from or returned to her isolation cell, even\nwhen she had no conceivable opportunity (let alone no intention) to obtain contraband. Clearly,\nthe search policy is one that was not applied consistently. Having been in general population for\nthe past two months, Ms. Maxwell has only been searched after contact visits with counsel.\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo47o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015216.jpg": "American Psychological Association commitee work:\nMember, Communications Commitee, l975-76; Member, Magazine Task Force, l975-76;\nMember, Finance Commitee, l976-78; Member, Comm. on Organization of APA, l977-78;\nCommission on Organization, l978-82; Council of Representatives, Div. 3, l982-85;\nExecutive Commitee, Div. 4l, l98l-85; Member, Ethics Commitee, l984; National\nPolicy Studies Oversight Commitee, l986; Psychology Today, Board of Directors, l987-88;\nComm. on Division/APA Relations (CODAPAR), l988-89, Public Information Comm. l989-l992\nTask Force on Recovered Memories of Child Sexual Abuse, l993-96\nAssociation for Psychological Science (Formerly American Psychological Society) Commitee work:\nFund for Advancement of Psychological Science, Board Member, 2oo3- .
