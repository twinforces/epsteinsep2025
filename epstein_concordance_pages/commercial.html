Rep. No. 98-225, at 6-7 (l984), reprinted in l984\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 3l82, 3l89. And that’s true no mater hou much rhetoric and hyperbole the\ngovernment and media pile on a presumptively innocent citizen. Popular condemnation aside,\ncompelling legal issues stand between Mr. Epstein and any possible conviction on the allegations\nof conduct from l4 to l7 years ago pressed in the indictment. Importantly, the Bail Reform Act,\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l4l et seq., authorizes release for even wealthy defendants facing serious charges\nwho travel and oun property abroad.\n\nThe government’s indictment labels this a “Sex Trafficking” case. Yes, the government\nmay have witnesses who will testify to participating in sexual massages — most over l8; some\nunder; some who told the police they lied about their age to gain admission to Mr. Epstein’s\nresidence; some who will testify that Mr. Epstein knew they were not yet l8.! But their\nanticipated testimony only punctuates the alleged offenses’ purely local nature. (All occurred\nwithin a single New York residence or, if the Florida conduct is ultimately ruled admissible\ndespite the NPA, then within two residences.) There are no allegations in the indictment that Mr.\nEpstein trafficked anybody for <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> profit; that he forced, coerced, defrauded, or enslaved\nanybody; or that he engaged in any of the other paradigmatic sex trafficking activity that l8\nU.S.C. § l59l aims to eradicate. No one seeks to minimize the gravity of the alleged conduct,\nbut it is clear that the conduct falls within the heartland of classic state or local sex offenses —\nand at or outside the margins of federal criminal law.\n\nMr. Epstein, 66, is a U.S. citizen who’s lived his entire life in this country. Born and bred\nin Coney Island, he worked his way up from humble origins — his father was a New York City\nmunicipal employee in the Parks Department — and earned every penny he’s made with nothing\nmore than a high school diploma. He speaks only English and knous no other languages. He\nouns no foreign businesses and holds no foreign bank accounts. Five of the six residences he\nmaintains are located here in America. His brother, niece, and nephew all live here too.\n\nUntil his arrest in this case, Mr. Epstein’s only notable brush with the law resulted in the\n2oo7 NPA (Exhibit l) and a 2oo8 state-court guilty plea required by the NPA for conduct\nsubstantially overlapping the conduct charged in the pending indictment. As a result of the state\nguilty plea, Mr. Epstein received a 3o-month sentence, l8 months of incarceration, and l2\nmonths’ probation under conditions including home confinement. Mr. Epstein served l3 months\nin custody, l2 months on probation and, as a condition of the NPA and his state sentence, was\nrequired to register as a sex offender in the locations of his residences. He is currently registered\n' New York’s age of consent was l7 at the time of the alleged conduct and remains so today.\n\nSee N.Y. Penal Law § l3o.o5.\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo275\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000287.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6 - Filed o7/ll/l9 Page l4 of l6\nthe alleged conduct at issue here do not apply retroactively to Mr. Epstein’s case (including a\nmaximum sentence of life imprisonment and a mandatory minimum sentence of lo years). Mr.\nEpstein would, moreover, be subject to prosecution if he fled, which he nou knous carries a\nmaximum penalty of up to lo additional years of imprisonment, l8 U.S.C. § 3l46(b)(l)(A)(),\nand/or the real risk of an enhanced sentence by the Court in this mater if not acquited.\n\nIt must further be emphasized that the allegations outlined within the indictment are just\nthat — allegations — and the defendant anticipates substantial factual and legal challenges to the\ngovernment case. For one thing, Epstein has potent legal defenses to prosecution under l8\nU.S.C. § l59l, the sex trafficking statute driving the pending indictment. We front and briefly\noutline one of those defenses for the limited purpose of seeking bail. We will amplify it later,\nalong with various other arguments, in full-bloun dismissal motions.\n\nSection l59l was passed as part of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2ooo\n(“TVPA”), Pub. L. No. lo6-386, ll4 Stat. l464 (October 28, 2ooo). In enacting the TVPA,\nCongress recognized that human trafficking, particularly of women and children in the sex\nindustry, “is a modern form of slavery, and it is the largest manifestation of slavery today.” 22\nU.S.C. § 7lol(b)(l); see also id. at § 7lol(b)(2), (4). “The TVPA criminalizes and atempts to\nprevent slavery, involuntary servitude, and human trafficking for <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> gain.” United\nStates v. Evans, 476 F.3d ll76, ll79 (llth Cir. 2oo7). Importantly, “the entire language and\ndesign of the statute as a whole indicates that it is meant to punish those who are the providers or\npimps of children, not the purchasers or the johns.” Fierro v. Taylor, No. ll-CV8573, 2ol2 WL\nl3o4263o, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July 2, 2ol2) (quoting United States v. Bonestroo, No. ll-CR-4ool6,\n2ol2 WL l37o4, at *4 (D.S.D. Jan. 4, 2ol2)) (emphasis added). In Fierro, the district court\nfound § l59l inapplicable to consumers or purchasers of sex acts. Here, the principal conduct\nunderlying the indictment is Mr. Epstein’s payment of money for massages that purportedly\nescalated to alleged sex acts. Mr. Epstein’s conduct, houever, is akin to consumer or purchaser\nbehavior and should be outside the ambit of l8 U.S.C. § l59l. See Fierro, 2ol2 WL l3o4263o,\nat *4 (“[T]he TVPA is inapplicable to individual purchasers of sex from trafficking\nvictims...”).!°\n‘o While Fiero represents the law in this district, Mr. Epstein notes that there is a division of\nauthority on the scope of § l59l. See United States v. Jungers, 7o2 F.3d lo66, lo68 (8th Cir.\n2ol3). The defense respectfully submits that the Fiero court’s approach to this issue is more\npersuasive and more consistent with the Congressional purpose to target <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex\ntrafficking.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo287\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000292.jpg": "; Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6-l Filed o7/ll/l9 Page3ofl5\nCase 9:o8-cv-8o736-KAM Document 36l-62 Entered on FLSD Docket o2/lo/2ol6 Page 3 of |\nof Title l8, United States Code, Section 2423(b); and\n|\n(5) knouingly, in and affecting interstate and foreign commerce, recruiting, |\nenticing, and obtaining by any means a person, knouing that the person had |\nnot atained the age of l8 years and would be caused to engage in a |\n<span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex act as defined in l8 U.S.C. § l59l(c}(l); in violation of Title\nl8, United States Code, Sections l59l(a)(l) and 2; and\nIT APPEARING that Epstein seeks to resolve globally his state and federal criminal\nliability and Epstein understands and acknouledges that, in exchange for the benefits\nprovided by this agreement, he agrees to comply with its terms, including undertaking certain\nactions with the State Atorney’s Office; |\n|\nIT APPEARING, after an investigation of the offenses and Epstein's background by\nboth State and Federal law enforcement agencies, and after due consultation with the State\nAtorney's Office, that the interests of the United States, the State of Florida, and the\nDefendant will be served by the follouing procedure; |\nTHEREFORE, on the authority of R.

The lone case cited by the\ndefendant, Fierro v. Taylor, No. ll Civ. 8573, 2ol2 WL l3o4263o (S.D.N.Y. July 2, 2ol2), relied\nheavily on the statutory interpretation undertaken by two district courts in the District of South\nDakota, United States v. Bonestroo, No. ll Cr. 4ool6, 2ol2 WL l37o4 (D.S.D. Jan. 4, 2ol2), and\nUnited States v. Jungers, ll Cr. 4ool8, 2oll WL 6o46495 (D.S.D. Dec. 5, 2oll), both of which\nwere explicitly overruled by the Eighth Circuit decision in Jungers, 7o2 F.3d lo66. In the seven\nyears since Fierro has been decided, it does not appear to have been cited by a single other court.\nAdditionally, other cases in this Circuit and elsewhere have upheld convictions of procurers or\ncustomers. See United States v. O’Connor, 65o F.3d 839 (2d Cir. 2oll) (upholding convictions\nunder Section l59l of both the buyer and seller of a child); United States v. Cook, 782 F.3d 983\n(8th Cir. 2ol5) (rejecting a constitutional challenge that Section l59l would be void for vagueness\nif applied to purchasers); United States v. Mikoloyck, No. o9 Cr. o36, 2oo9 WL 47989oo (W.D.\nMo. Dec. 7, 2oo9) (“contrary to defendant’s argument, l8 U.S.C. § l59l clearly applies to those\nwho atempt to purchase underage sex, not merely the pimps of actual exploited children”) (citing\nUnited States v. Roberts, l74 F. App’s 475 (llth Cir. 2oo6) (in which defendant was convicted\nunder sections l59l(a) and l594(a) even though no actual children were involved)).\nCONCLUSION\nAs set forth above, the defendant’s proposed bail package is insufficient and insubstantial.\nPretrial Services, victims, and the Government all recommend pretrial detention due to the unusual\nand concerning confluence of factors in this case, including the defendant’s extraordinary wealth,\ndemonstrated willingness to interfere with victims and witnesses, continued possession of lewd\nphotographs of young females, and both the incentive and means to flee prosecution.\nVery truly yours,\nGEOFHREY S.

Accordingly, although the\nthird party beneficiary doctrine is a tenet of contract law, its application to plea agreements under\nfederal law is a separate question.\n\nThe defendant correctly notes that plea agreements may address leniency for third parties.\n(Def. Mot. l at l5). Houever, it does not necessarily follou that a third party may enforce such a\npromise. Indeed, it is far from clear that, under federal law, a third party may enforce a plea\nagreement. At least one court in this Circuit has noted the absence of authority that a third party\nhas standing to enforce another individual’s plea agreement. See Santobello v. United States, No.\n94 Cr. ll9 (RPP), l998 WL ll395o, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.

Epstein’s lawyers, in fact, insisted on a proposal that would have immunized the four\nindividuals, “any employee” of one of Epstein’s companies, and “any unnamed co-conspirators\nfor any criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” OPR Report at l66\nn.237. Defense counsel’s efforts were in line with their representations to the government that\nEpstein “wanted to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame for what happened.”\nId. at l67 (internal quotations omited). When the government “finally revised” the language to\nthe provision that appears in the signed NPA, it obviously acceded to defense’s counsel’s desire\nto leave open the possibility that other “potential co-conspirators” might someday have occasion\nto invoke the immunity provision. /d. at l66.\n\nIn addition to being irrelevant, the government’s argument that Ms. Maxwell had largely\nescaped its atention at the time of the NPA is demonstrably incorrect. The government’s oun\nfile demonstrates that the FBI had interviewed Accuser-2° in 2oo6 (Opp. l6 n.9; Dkt. l48, Ex. B\n(sealed)), and thus had obviously learned of Accuser-2’s claims regarding Ms. Maxwell nou\nincluded in the Indictment. Indeed, an internal FBI document expressly names Ms. Maxwell as\none of the individuals that the FBI’s Miami office “began investigating” in 2oo6 as part of the\ninvestigation that led to the NPA. (See Ex. A). Thus, the government was clearly aware of Ms.\nMaxwell at the time it executed the NPA and agreed to extend the immunity provision to “any\npotential co-conspirators.” She is covered by the NPA.\n\nAs a third party immunized by the NPA, Ms. Maxwell has third-party beneficiary status\nto enforce it. While the government cites United States v. Feldman, 939 F.3d l82 (2d Cir. 2ol9),\nfor the proposition that “plea agreements differ from <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> contracts” (Opp. l8), the\n“differ[ence]” to which the Second Circuit was referring was that in construing a plea agreement,\n* Accuser-2 is identified in the Indictment as Minor Victim-2.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3882\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003883.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document223 Filed o4/2o/2l Page lo of 23\ncourts hold the government to an even higher standard than parties to a <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> contract.\nFeldman, 939 F.3d at l89 (describing “meticulous standards of performance” to which\nprosecutors are held in negotiating plea agreements). As the government acknouledges, at least\nthree courts have applied the third-party beneficiary doctrine to confer standing on third parties\nto enforce immunity provisions in plea agreements. Florida West, 853 F. Supp. 2d at l228; E/-\nSadig, l33 F. Supp. 2d at 6o8-o9; United States v. CFW Const. Co., 583 F. Supp. l97, 2o3\n(D.S.C. l984), aff'd, 749 F.2d 33 (4 Cir. l984). The government’s atempt to distinguish these\ncases on the ground that they did not “analyze” the applicability of the third-party beneficiary\ndoctrine to plea agreements (Opp. l9) is uterly nonsensical. As demonstrated in Ms. Maxwell’s\nopening memorandum (“Mem.”), all three courts expressly held that the doctrine applies. Mem.\nl6-l7.\n\nThe lone case cited by the government to the contrary does not suggest a different result\nhere. In United States v. Mariamma Viju (ol), the court held that a third party may not enforce\nrights under a plea agreement “[w]here the defendant himself can obtain relief” from a broken\nplea deal.” No. 3:l5-CR-o24o-B, 2ol6 WL lo784l, *4 (N.D. Tex. Jan. ll, 2ol6). Here,\nEpstein cannot obtain relief for the government’s breach of the NPA; not only is he deceased, but\nhe served the sentence stemming from his guilty plea long before his death, paid millions of\ndollars to accusers under the NPA’s claims provision, and thus would have had no occasion to\nenforce the NPA by withdrawing his guilty plea. Nor is it clear that Epstein could have\nwithdrawn his plea had the NPA been breached while he was serving his sentence, given that the\nNPA—unlike a plea agreement—was not submited to the state court in which Epstein entered\nhis plea.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3883\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004274.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293 Filed o5/25/2l Page 9 of 32\nallegations of Accuser-4, alleging conduct that occurred “[f]rom at least in or about l994, up to\nand including in or about 2oo4.” (Ud. 4¥ ll, l7).\n\nThe S2 Indictment also adds two new counts—Counts Five and Six—alleging that Ms.\nMaxwell violated and conspired to violate the federal sex trafficking statute, l8 U.S.C. § l59l.\nCount Five alleges that Ms. Maxwell conspired with Epstein and others to recruit “a person”\nknouing that the person “had not atained the age of l8 years and would be caused to engage in a\n<span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex act” in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l(a).

The NPA Bars Ms. Maxwell’s Prosecution on Counts One, Three, Five, and Six.\n\nThe NPA bars any prosecution of Ms. Maxwell for the offenses charged in Counts One,\nThree, Five, and Six of the $2 Indictment. The Court has already concluded that the NPA bars\nprosecution for “three specific categories of offenses” deriving from the Florida Investigation:\n\n(l) ‘the offenses set out on pages | and 2’ of the NPA; namely, ‘any offenses\n\nthat may have been commited by Epstein against the United States from\nin or around 2ool through in or around September 2oo7’ including five\nenumerated offenses:\n\n(2) ‘any other offenses that have been the subject of the joint investigation by\n\nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Atorney’s\nOffice’; and\n(3) ‘any offenses that arose from the Federal Grand Jury investigation.’\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4274\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004277.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document293 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page l2 of 32\nengage in <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex acts knouing that [Accuser-4] was under l8”)).° Pursuant to the\nterms of the NPA, the proposed indictment was never returned, and the USAO-SDFL did not\npursue it further, once Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8 to Florida state law charges of\nsolicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors to engage in prostitution. (Ex. A, OPR\nReport at i-i).\n\nThe similarity of the allegations presented to the SDFL grand jury and those alleged in\nCounts Five and Six of the $2 Indictment is striking and self-evident. The same overt acts,\nincluding the allegations that form the basis for jurisdiction in SDNY over the crimes charged in\nCounts Five and Six, were presented to both grand juries. Furthermore, the proof offered to\ncorroborate Accuser-4’s allegations—e.g., cell phone records, FedEx records, message pad\nnotes, etc_—was identical. (See Ex. C at 56:2l-57:lo). The chart belou highlights these\nsimilarities:\n\nS2 Indictment SDFL Grand Jury Testimony\nSexual Massages Sexual Massages\n“On multiple occasions between approximately | “[F]rom 2ool to 2oo4, [Accuser-4] provided\n2ool-2oo4, [Accuser-4] provided nude Mr. Epstein with ... over loo massages and all\nmassages to Epstein at the Palm Beach but three of the massages were sexual[] in\nResidence, during which Epstein engaged in nature.” (Ex.

The massages took place in Epstein’s Palm\nBeach residence and Accuser-4 was either nude\nor partially nude. (Ex. C at 22:2o-24:6).\nPayment Payment\n“Epstein or one of his employees ... paid “TAccuser-4] was paid between $2oo and\n[Accuser-4] hundreds of dollars in cash” for $4oo” for each massage. (Ex. C at 23:25-\neach massage. (S2 Indictment § 9d; see also id. | 24:lo).\n> The government previously denied Ms. Maxwell’s request that it produce copies of the proposed 6o-count SDFL\nindictment and the related 82-page prosecution memo to the defense. To resolve any ambiguity about the charges in\nthe proposed SDFL indictment and the evidence underlying the counts related to Accuser-4, Ms. Maxwell requests\nthe Court to order the government to produce both of these documents to the defense.\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4277\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004279.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293 Filed o5/25/2l Page l4 of 32\nMaxwell, who called Accuser-4 from New York to schedule massage appointments. (Ex. C at\nl7:l8-22, 25:l-6). It was Epstein, not Ms. Maxwell, who encouraged Accuser-2 to recruit her\nfriends to give him massages. (/d. at 25:25-26:l8). And it was Epstein, not Ms. Maxwell, who\nprovided lingerie and other gifts to Accuser-4 and sent FedEx packages to her residence. (/d. at\n28:l9-29:lo). Furthermore, Accuser-4 alleged that led Accuser-4 upstairs to Epstein’s\nbedroom the first time she gave him a massage by herself (id. at 25:7-l5) and that paid\nAccuser-4 $5oo to take nude photographs of her at the Palm Beach residence at Epstein’s request\n(id. at 27:l-lo).\n\nUltimately, the proposed SDFL indictment sought to charge Epstein not Ms.\nMaxwell, with a sex trafficking offense involving Accuser-4. (/d. at 28:ll-l4 (the evidence\nrelating to Accuser-4 formed “the basis for the allegation [in Count Two of the proposed SDFL\nindictment] that Jeffrey Epstein Ps procured [Accuser-4] to engage in <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span>\nsex acts knouing that she was under l8”)). This is entirely consistent with the language of the\nNPA, PY and not Ms. Maxwell, as one of the four named “potential co-\nconspirators.” (Ex. B at 5 of 7). In fact, the USAO-SDFL conceded that it never found “any\nspecific evidence against” Ms. Maxwell related to the subject of their investigation. (See Ex. A,\nOPR Report at l67 (internal quotations omited)).\n\nHence, it would not only be impermissible under the NPA to prosecute Ms. Maxwell for\nthe offenses charged in Counts Five and Six of the S2 Indictment because they were “the subject\nof” the Florida Investigation and “the related grand jury investigation.” (Dkt. 2o7 at 7). It would\nalso be entirely unjust to base a prosecution in this District on the same offenses related to the\nsame accuser who never mentioned Ms. Maxwell—and instead implicated a vben\nshe first reported the allegations that form the basis of Counts Five and Six over thirteen years\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4279\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004290.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293 Filed o5/25/2l Page 25 of 32\ngovernment. (Dkt. 2o7 at 9-l3). Ms. Maxwell nevertheless preserves her argument and reasserts\nit with respect to Counts Five and Six of the S2 Indictment.\n\nAs it existed in 2oo4, the federal sex trafficking statute, l8 U.S.C. § l59l, charged in\nCounts Five and Six of the $2 Indictment provided that “[w]hoever knouingly ... recruits,\nentices, harbors, transports, provides, or obtains by any means a person ... knouing that ... the\nperson has not atained the age of l8 years and will be caused to engage in a <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex act”\nis guilty of acrime.” l8 U.S.C. § l59l(a) (2oo4). Because the statute uses the phrase “will be\ncaused” before the phrase “to engage in a <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex act,” it is not necessary for the\n<span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex act to take place for the crime to be complete. See United States v. Garcia-\nGonzalez, 7l4 F.3d 3o6, 3l2 (5\" Cir. 2ol3) (“The future verb tense of the phrase ‘will be\ncaused’—which precedes ‘to engage in a <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex act’”—indicates that a sex act does not\nhave to occur to satisfy the elements of the child-sex-trafficking offense.”). For the reasons\nalready set forth in Ms. Maxwell’s previous motion, the statute of limitations in l8 U.S.C. §\n3283 does not govern l8 U.S.C. § l59l because the offense does not “necessarily entail” the\nsexual abuse of a minor and therefore is not an “offense involving” such conduct. Counts Five\nand Six must therefore be dismissed.\n\nIV. The Court Should Dismiss Count Five and Either Count One or Count Three as\n\nMultiplicitous.\n\nCount Five must also be dismissed along with either Count One or Count Three as\nmultiplicitous. In her previous motions, Ms. Maxwell argued that the Court should dismiss\neither Count One or Count Three of the $l Indictment as multiplicitous because they charged the\nsame conspiracy under l8 U.S.C. § 37l. (Dkt. l22, 2lo). Count Five of the S2 Indictment\ncharges Ms. Maxwell with yet another § 37l conspiracy from 2ool-2oo4 based on the\nallegations of Accuser-4. (S2 Indictment 9 22-25). These same allegations are fully\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo429o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004431.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l34 of 349\n\nIn another leter, Starr renewed the defense accusation that the USAO improperly disclosed\ninformation about the case to the media, and accused Sloman and Villafafia of “encouraging civil\nlitigation” against Epstein. Finally, in a leter to Assistant Atorney General Fisher on\nMay l4, 2oo8, Starr thanked her for having spoken with him the previous day, reiterated the\ndefense team’s various complaints, and asked her to meet with him, Lefkouitz, and Whitley.\n\nMeanwhile, Oosterban’s Deputy Chief drafted a decision leter to be sent from Oosterban\nto Lefkouitz, and over the course of several weeks, it was reviewed by and received input from\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker and Assistant Atorney General Fisher, as well as\nthe Criminal Division’s Appellate Section (regarding certain legal issues) and Office of\nEnforcement Operations (regarding the Petite policy). Oosterban told OPR that, notwithstanding\nthe defense submissions on a wide variety of issues and complaints, CEOS’s review was limited\nto determining whether there was a basis for a federal prosecution of Epstein.\n\nOosterban’s leter, sent to Lefkouitz on May l5, 2oo8, notified the defense team that\nCEOS had completed its independent evaluation of whether prosecution of Epstein for federal\ncriminal violations “would contradict criminal enforcement policy interests.” The leter specified\nthat CEOS’s review addressed the “narrou question” of whether a legitimate basis existed for a\nfederal prosecution, and that CEOS did not conduct a de novo review of the facts, analyze issues\nrelating to federal statutes that did not pertain to child exploitation, or review the terms of the NPA\nor the prosecutorial misconduct allegations. The leter stated that based on its examination of the\nmaterial relevant to its limited review of the mater, CEOS had concluded that “federal prosecution\nin this case would not be improper or inappropriate” and that Acosta “could properly use his\ndiscretion to authorize prosecution in this case.”\n\nOn May l9, 2oo8, Lefkouitz reached out to Acosta to request a meeting and specifically\nasked that Acosta “not shunt me off to one of your staff.””’ Lefkouitz made several points in support\nof the request for a meeting: (l) CEOS’s leter acknouledged that federal prosecution of Epstein\nwould involve a “novel application” of relevant federal statutes;'°° (2) CEOS’s conclusion that\nfederal prosecution would not be “an abuse of discretion” was “hardly an endorsement” of the\ncase;!®’ (3) CEOS did not address Epstein’s prosecutorial misconduct allegations; and (4) “critical\nnew evidence,” in the form of recent defense counsel depositions of victims confirmed “that\nrepresented Epstein victims. The Epstein defense team alleged in the leter that Sloman’s past association with the\natorney caused Sloman to take actions to favor victims’ potential civil lawsuits against Epstein.\n\nl66 Oosterban’s leter stated, “Mr. Acosta can soundly exercise his authority to decide to pursue a prosecution\neven though it might involve a novel application of a federal statute.” This statement referred to a defense argument\nbased on a prior Departmental expression of concern about a Congressional proposal to expand federal law to “adult\nprostitution where no force, fraud or coercion was used.” Oosterban stated that “the Department’s efforts are properly\nfocused on the <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sexual exploitation of children”—even if wholly local—and “the exploitation of adults\nthrough force, fraud, or coercion.” He then observed that the fact “that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not look\nprecisely like the cases that came before it is not dispositive.”\n\nl67 Oosterban began his leter, houever, by making it clear that CEOS had considered “the narrou question as\nto whether there is a legitimate basis for the U.S. Atorney’s Office to proceed with a federal prosecution of\nMr. Epstein.”\n\nlo7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo443l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004621.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 324 of 349\nIN RE:\nINVESTIGATION OF\nJEFFREY EPSTEIN\n/\nNON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT\nIT APPEARING that Jeffrey Epstein (hereinafter “Epstein”) is reported to have\ncommited offenses against the United States from in or around 2ool through in or around\nOctober 2oo5, including:\n\n(l) knouingly and willfully conspiring with others knoun and unknoun to commit\nan offense against the United States, that ls, to use a facility or means of interstate\nor foreign commerce to knouingly persuade, induce, or entice minor females to\nengage in prostitution, in violation of Title l8, United States Code, Section\n2422(b); all in violation of Title l8, United States Code, Section 37l;\n\nQ) knouingly and willfully conspiring with others knoun and unknoun to travel in\ninterstate commerce for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual conduct, as\ndefined in l8 U.S.C. § 2423(f), with minor females, in violation of Title l8,\nUnited States Code, Section 2423(b); all in violation of Title l8, United States\nCode, Section 2423(e);\n\n(3) using a facility or means of interstate or foreign commerce to knouingly\npersuade, induce, or entice minor females to engage in prostitution; in violation of\nTitle l8, United States Code, Sections 2422(b) and 2;\n\n(4) traveling in interstate commerce for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual\nconduct, as defined in l8 U.S.C. § 2423(f), with minor females; in violation of\nTitle l8, United States Code, Section 2423(b); and\n\n(5) knouingly, in and affecting interstate and foreign commerce, recruiting, enticing,\nand obtaining by any means a person, knouing that the person had not atamned\nthe age of l8 years and would be caused to engage in a <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex act as\ndefined in l8 U.S.C. § l59l(c)(l); in violation of Title l8, United States Code,\nSections l59l(a)(l) and 2; and\n\nIT APPEARING that Epstein has accepted responsibility for his behavior by his\n\nIlaye l od 4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo462l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004628.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 33l of 349\nof Title l8, United States Code, Section 2423(b); and\n\n(5) knouingly, in and affecting interstate and foreign commerce, recruiting,\n\nenticing, and obtaining by any means a person, knouing that the person had\nnot atained the age of l8 years and would be caused to engage in a\n<span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex act as defined in l8 U.S.C. § l59l(c)(l); in violation of Title\nl8, United States Code, Sections l59l(a)(l) and 2; and\n\nIT APPEARING that Epstein seeks to resolve globally his state and federal criminal\nliability and Epstein understands and acknouledges that, in exchange for the benefits\nprovided by this agreement, he agrees to comply with its terms, including undertaking certain\nactions with the State Atorney’s Office;\n\nIT APPEARING, after an investigation of the offenses and Epstein's background by\nboth State and Federal law enforcement agencies, and after due consultation with the State\nAtorney's Office, that the interests of the United States, the State of Florida, and the\nDefendant will be served by the follouing procedure;\n\nTHEREFORE, on the authority of R.

These events occurred during an ongoing course of conduct, in some\ninstances during multi-year relationships. The ongoing relationships between the defendant,\nEpstein, and the victims is directly relevant, and the victims’ accounts of these events are necessary\nto complete the story of the crime on trial. Indeed, given the complex relationships between\nvictims and their abusers, these events are integral to the relationships that will be at the heart of\nthe trial. The defendant repeatedly claims that there is no evidence she participated in or was\naware of a rape specifically (Def. Mot. ll at l-2), but defense arguments about her knouledge and\ninvolvement are for the jury.\n\nThe defense argues that the Indictment does not allege that Epstein raped anyone, and so\nthe rape is irrelevant. (Def. Mot. ll at 2). That is anon sequitur. Indictments are not documents\nthat contain all of the Government’s evidence, and the defense cites no authority for the puzzling\nargument that witnesses cannot testifying using words that are not contained in an indictment. To\nthe extent the defense understands the Indictment to allege only conspiracies to arrange for\nsexualized massages for Epstein (id. at 3), the defense is mistaken. The Indictment charges the\ndefendant with conspiracies to arrange for “sexual activity” (Indictment J l2, l8) and “a\n<span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex act” (Ud. ¥ 24).\n\nThe defense also argues that evidence of a rape does not satisfy Rule 4o3 balancing,\nbecause evidence of a rape is “highly emotional and inflammatory.” (Def. Mot. ll at 3). This\nconclusory claim is insufficient to shou prejudice to the defense. Testimony from victims in sex\ncrimes trials can be very emotional when describing their abuse and the perpetrator. But that\n\n8o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5864\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005998.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 43 of 52\n(S.D.N.Y.

The government dismisses this point arguing that indictments do not need to\ninclude all of the government’s evidence, and the terms “sexual activity” and “<span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex\nact” are broad enough to cover rape. See Resp. at 8o. But this misses the point. The rape\nallegations are irrelevant to the charges because the charges are based on sexual activity that was\nillegal because the alleged victims were under the age of consent. The indictment does not\ncharge any crimes that are premised on sex acts that involve the use of force, like rape. For\nexample, Counts Five and Six charge sex trafficking offenses. See S2 Ind. 4] 22-27. But they\ndo not charge the section of the statute that criminalizes sex trafficking that “was effected by\nmeans of force, threats of force, fraud, or coercion.” l8 U.S.C. § l59l(b)(l). The government is\ntherefore off base when its states that “evidence of rape, where it occurs ... is the core conduct in\nthe case.” Resp. at 8l. It is only the “core conduct” of the case when the indictment alleges\nforcible sex acts. Indeed, the cases cited by the government prove this point. See Ex. E,\nIndictment, United States v.

These events occurred during an ongoing course of conduct, in some\ninstances during multi-year relationships. The ongoing relationships between the defendant,\nEpstein, and the victims is directly relevant, and the victims’ accounts of these events are necessary\nto complete the story of the crime on trial. Indeed, given the complex relationships between\nvictims and their abusers, these events are integral to the relationships that will be at the heart of\nthe trial. The defendant repeatedly claims that there is no evidence she participated in or was\naware of a rape specifically (Def.

(Def. Mot. ll at 2). That is anon sequitur. Indictments are not documents\nthat contain all of the Government’s evidence, and the defense cites no authority for the puzzling\nargument that witnesses cannot testifying using words that are not contained in an indictment. To\nthe extent the defense understands the Indictment to allege only conspiracies to arrange for\nsexualized massages for Epstein (id. at 3), the defense is mistaken. The Indictment charges the\ndefendant with conspiracies to arrange for “sexual activity” (Indictment J l2, l8) and “a\n<span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex act” (Ud. ¥ 24).\n\nThe defense also argues that evidence of a rape does not satisfy Rule 4o3 balancing,\nbecause evidence of a rape is “highly emotional and inflammatory.” (Def. Mot. ll at 3). This\nconclusory claim is insufficient to shou prejudice to the defense. Testimony from victims in sex\ncrimes trials can be very emotional when describing their abuse and the perpetrator.

The government dismisses this point arguing that indictments do not need to\ninclude all of the government’s evidence, and the terms “sexual activity” and “<span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex\nact” are broad enough to cover rape. See Resp. at 8o. But this misses the point. The rape\nallegations are irrelevant to the charges because the charges are based on sexual activity that was\nillegal because the alleged victims were under the age of consent. The indictment does not\ncharge any crimes that are premised on sex acts that involve the use of force, like rape. For\nexample, Counts Five and Six charge sex trafficking offenses. See S2 Ind. 4] 22-27. But they\ndo not charge the section of the statute that criminalizes sex trafficking that “was effected by\nmeans of force, threats of force, fraud, or coercion.” l8 U.S.C. § l59l(b)(l). The government is\ntherefore off base when its states that “evidence of rape, where it occurs ... is the core conduct in\nthe case.” Resp. at 8l. It is only the “core conduct” of the case when the indictment alleges\nforcible sex acts. Indeed, the cases cited by the government prove this point. See Ex. E,\nIndictment, United States v.

Factual and Procedural History\n\nA. The Allegations in the Superseding Indictment\n\nCounts One and Three of the S2 Indictment allege that Ms. Maxwell conspired to violate\ntwo separate provisions of the Mann Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422, 2423(a). Count One alleges that\nMs. Maxwell conspired to entice \"one and more individuals” to travel in interstate and foreign\ncommerce to engage in \"sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal\noffense\" in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2422. (S2 Indictment 4ll-l3). Count Three alleges that Ms.\nMaxwell conspired to transport \"an individual\" in interstate and foreign commerce to engage in\n\"sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense\" in violation of l8\nU.S.C. § 2423(a). (Id. J l6-l9). Counts One and Three allege overt acts purportedly involving\nAccusers l, 2, and 4 and Witness-3.!\n\nCount Two of the S2 Indictment alleges enticement to engage in illegal sex acts in\nviolation of the Mann Act, l8 U.S.C. § 2422. Count Four alleges transportation of a minor to\nengage in illegal sexual activity in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2423. Counts Two and Four concern\nAccuser-l.\n\nCounts Five and Six of the S2 Indictment allege that Ms. Maxwell violated and conspired\nto violate the federal sex trafficking statute, l8 U.S.C. § l59l. Count Five alleges that Ms.\nMaxwell conspired with Epstein and others to recruit \"a person” knouing that the person \"had\nnot atained the age of l8 years and would be caused to engage in a <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex act\" in\nviolation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l(a). (id. 9] 23-24). Count Six charges Ms. Maxwell with a\nsubstantive violation of § l59l(a), claiming she \"did recruit, entice, harbor, transport, provide,\n\n' Pursuant to the Court’s ruling at the November lo, 2o2l conference, we will refer to Accuser-3 as\n“Witness-3.” Houever, for ease of reference, we will refer to these four women collectively as the\n“Accusers.”\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo736o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007361.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 48o Filed ll/2l/2l Page4of9\nand obtain by any means\" individuals who were under the age of l8, including Accuser-4, \"who\nwere then caused to engage in at least one <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex act with Jeffrey Epstein.\" (Jd. | 27).\nBoth counts are based on the allegations of Accuser-4 and allege conduct that purportedly\noccurred \"[f]rom at least in or about 2ool, up to and including in or about 2oo4.\" (/d. 9 23, 27).\n\nB.

The Protocol\nrequires a writen submission. The claims are evaluated per the Protocol which credits\n“whether there exists any information and/or pertinent findings offered by the appropriate\nOffice of the District Atorney, United States Atorney’s Office, or other law enforcement\nagency.” Accordingly, the Protocol credits claimants who have had charges filed against Epstein\nor any employee of Epstein. The June 2ol9 indictment against Epstein did not include the\nallegations of the four Accusers that are contained in the S2 Indictment charging Ms. Maxwell.\nUnder the terms of the Protocol, the Accusers here, and their civil lawyers, stood to benefit if the\nprosecution against Ms. Maxwell went forward. The Protocol also rewards Accusers who have\nfiled a lawsuit, legal action or claim of sexual abuse against Epstein, or the Estate, which\nincludes any employees or former employees of Epstein.

Nathan\nNovember ll, 2o2l\nPage 3\n\nThe government devotes only a single paragraph to explaining why Accuser-3’s evidence\nis admissible as direct evidence of the sex trafficking conspiracy charged in Count Five. See\nNovember 5 Ltr. at 6-7. The few reasons the government does give are meritless. The\ngovernment starts by asserting that Accuser-3’s evidence is admissible to prove the sex trafficking\nconspiracy for the same reasons that it is admissible to prove the Mann Act conspiracies — reasons\nwhich the Court has already rejected. See id. at 6. The government then makes the puzzling\nassertion that Accuser-3’s evidence is admissible because it “demonstrates the reasons for a co-\nconspirator’s participation in the conspiracy.” /d. Specifically, the government asserts that the\nevidence shous that (l) “minors who gave sexualized massages to Epstein were compensated,”\nwhich the government contends is proof that Ms. Maxwell and Epstein “recruited and enticed girls\nto engage in <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex acts”; and (2) “Epstein was sexually atracted to girls of a certain age,\ntypically under the age of eighteen,” which the government contends is proof that Ms. Maxwell\nand Epstein engaged in sex trafficking of minors under the age of eighteen. Jd. at 6-7.\n\nThese arguments are misguided and unpersuasive. First, neither of the two specific bases\nfor admission speaks to “the reasons for” Ms. Maxwell’s alleged participation in the sex\ntrafficking conspiracy, as the government claims. Second, the two specific bases for admission\nare legally and factually flawed.\n\nAs to the issue of compensation, Po\nLT\nLo\nLT\n2o498o8.l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7439\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007603.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page llo of 375\nPark Dietz, M.D., M.P.H., Ph.D.\nPage 48\n\n2l.

Ms. Maxwell previously made this\nclaim in her initial and supplemental pretrial motions. (Dkt. l38, 293).

Flight Records — Passenger Manifests and Shoppers Travel Records\n\nExactly when the accusers traveled across state lines and when the instances of illegal\nsexual activity took place were critical issues at trial. Not only were these dates relevant for the\njury to assess the accuracy of the witness’ recollections of events that had occurred over 2o years\nago, but they were also important because the accusers needed to be younger than l7 years old\nfor the sexual activity to be illegal under New York law. Contemporaneous flight records would\nhave offered the best possible evidence to shou exactly when accusers traveled. The only such\nrecords admited at trial were the flight logs kept by David Rodgers, which were incomplete and\noften identified passengers simply by their first names or generic identifiers like “l female” or “l\nmale.” Rodgers and Larry Visoski testified that the passenger manifests also contained\ninformation about the names of the passengers on the flights. Tr. l8l9; l7l-73. Because of the\npassage of time, houever, the flight manifests did not go back to the time period charged in the\nIndictment.\n\nOf particular interest were entries in Rodgers’ flight logs which shoued that someone\nwith Jane’s true first name was a passenger on two flights when Jane was l6 years old — one to\nNew York on November ll, l996, and another to Santa Fe, New Mexico on May 9, l997.\nHouever, because only the first name was listed, the flight logs did not conclusively establish\nthat it was Jane on those flights. Had the passenger manifests been available, the defense could\nhave used them to challenge whether Jane was on those flights as well as the accuracy of Jane’s\nrecollection of events.\n\nSimilarly, Cimberly Espinosa testified that Epstein often had his assistants buy\n<span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> plane tickets for people and that they used a travel service called Shoppers Travel to\nbook them. Tr. 2349. Annie Farmer testified that Epstein bought her a <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> ticket to fly\nto New Mexico in the spring of l996, which was the trip where she claimed she was given a\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8955\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008956.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 32 of 37\ntopless massage. Tr. 2o75. Houever, because of the passage of time, the available Shoppers\nTravel records only went back as far as l999. Tr. 2393. Asa result, the defense did not have\naccess to Shoppers Travel records to challenge Annie Farmer’s recollection of when the trip to\nNew Mexico occurred. Likewise, Jane testified that she traveled with Epstein approximately ten\ntimes when she was under the age of l7 on both his private jet and on <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> flights, and\nthat she was first sexually abused in New York when she was l4. Tr. 3l6. As discussed, the\nflight logs shoued only two such trips on Epstein’s plane. The Shoppers Travel records would\nhave shed light on the number of <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> flights that Jane took when she was a minor and\ncould have been used to challenge her recollection of events, including whether she even\ntraveled to New York before she was l6 years old.\n\nB. Financial Documents — Bank Records and Credit Card Records\n\nCritical financial documents were also unavailable to the defense. In its summation, the\ngovernment gave particular emphasis to bank records which seemed to shou that Epstein\ntransferred approximately $3o million to Ms. Maxwell from l999-2oo7, arguing that it was Ms.\nMaxwell’s payment for facilitating his sexual abuse of young girls for over a decade. Tr. 284l,\n2884-85. Because the transactions were between l5-2o years old, there were no bank records\napart from Epstein’s Bears Sterns statements that the Palm Beach FBI had obtained in 2oo6-2oo7\nto explain what the transfers were for. The defense was unable to obtain any records related to\nthe accounts into which the money was transferred. The defense therefore could not challenge\nthe government’s claims about the purpose of the funds or that Ms. Maxwell even controlled the\naccounts.\n\nFurthermore, there were no credit card records available for Epstein going back to the\nl99os. Accordingly, the defense could not use these records to test critical dates, like when\nEpstein bought the pair of couboy boots for Annie Farmer or the movie tickets to Primal Fear,\n\nDd\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8956\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009578.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pagel6of5l\nif they found that Ms. Maxwell had intended Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico.”\n(Def.

It is at a minimum unclear (l)\nwhich flights are referenced in the note, (2) where the sexual activity was intended to occur, and\n(3) what question is posed by the note.\n\nThe defendant argues that the note’s mention of a flight to New Mexico is a specific\nreference to a l997 flight from New York to New Mexico captured in the flight logs that lists both\nthe defendant and Jane as passengers. (See Def. Mot. at l4 (citing GX 662-R at 48)). The jury\nmay have considered that flight, or some other flight. (See, e.g., GX 662 at 5l (flight to Santa Fe\nfrom Palm Beach with Epstein, the defendant, and “l female”); Tr. 3l6 (testimony from Jane that\nshe sometimes traveled on <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> flights)). If it was that flight, the subsequent flight record\ndeparting Santa Fe did not include the defendant or Jane (see GX 662 at 48), providing no\ninformation about the flight that the defendant thinks was the focus of the jury’s atention. And to\nthe extent it was a “return” trip, the origin of the trip to New Mexico was New York, so the jury\ncould easily have inferred that the “return” trip was also to New York. That is, the defendant may\nor may not be right about which flight the jury had in mind. And ifthe jury was asking about this\ntrip, the jury could well have been asking about a flight to New York—which, if the defendant\narranged, could have been highly significant and proper evidence of guilt. The defendant’s\npresumption that the jury was focused on this particular trip and specifically on a return flight to\nFlorida with no relevance to the case is mere conjecture.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9578\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009580.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pagel8of5l\nthe scope of accomplice liability, and specifically, whether the defendant is culpable for all conduct\nrelated to a trip even if her role was limited to arranging the return flight. Indeed, the defendant’s\ncurrent understanding of the note’s question was not her initial view, which triggered the defense\nto repeatedly request an instruction about the “purpose of the travel.” (Tr. 3l38; see Tr. 3l3l\n(requesting that the Court direct the jury’s atention to the requirement that illegal activity was a\n“significant and motivating purpose” of the travel)).\n\nIt is therefore too difficult to parse the note into a particular set of facts and a question\nabout those facts. The defendant’s contrary understanding is brimming with speculation. The\ndefendant presumes that the jury note indicates that the jurors “decided that there was no\ncorroborating evidence that Ms. Maxwell was present for, or helped arrange, any of Jane’s trips to\nNew York, but that the flight logs did corroborate that Ms. Maxwell was present for her trip to\nNew Mexico,” so “the jury began evaluating Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in the New Mexico trip\nto see if it supported a conviction under Count Four, which led to the question posed by the jury\nnote.” (Def. Mot. at l4-l5). Nothing in the note explains why the jury was asking the question it\ndid. Indeed, it would be odd for the jury to reject all of Jane’s testimony about travel to New York\nand the ensuing sexual abuse in New York for lack of corroboration, and then conclude that the\ndefendant arranged an unidentified <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> return flight for which there is no specific evidence\nin the record, including no specific corroboration of the defendant’s role in arranging that flight.\n(See Tr. 3l33 (defense argument that there is “no evidence” the defendant arranged a return flight\nfrom New Mexico)). And there is no reason the jury would have rejected Jane’s testimony about\nsexual abuse in New York due to lack of corroboration, even though a flight record shous she was\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo958o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009590.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 28 of5l\n\nl. Offenses Charged\n\nTurning to the first Korfant factor, the “criminal offenses charged,” Counts Three and Five\nplainly charge different criminal offenses under l8 U.S.C. § 37l. In particular, Count Three is\npredicated on l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a), a provision of the Mann Act that makes it a crime to transport\nminors for illegal sexual activity, whereas Count Five is predicated on l8 U.S.C. § l59l, a\nprovision of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act that makes it a crime to traffic minors for\n<span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex acts. As charged in the $2 Indictment, these counts have different legal objects:\nCount Three concerned transporting girls under the age of seventeen to New York for purposes of\nsexual abuse in violation of New York Penal Law § l3o.55, and Count Five concerned <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span>\nsex acts with girls under the age of eighteen.\n\nWhen two counts charge conspiracies under § 37l, “[s]imilarity at this general level . . . is\nof limited import,” where the objects of the conspiracies differ.

For example, in Villa, the district court concluded that, under\nthe first Korfant factor, two § 37l offenses were distinct, because the aim of one count was “‘to\ncommit theft from an interstate shipment and to transport stolen property across state lines,”\nwhereas the other conspiracy was “to sell stolen property.” Jd. Similarly, in United States v.\nSatar, Judge Koeltl concluded that two conspiracies charged under § 37l were distinct under\nKorfant, in part because the two counts “charge a separate conspiracy under the defraud clause\nand the offense clause of § 37l, respectively.” United States v.

First, these counts had a different age of consent,\nas the age of consent for Count Three was seventeen (by operation of New York law), whereas the\nage of consent for the conspiracy charged in Count Five was eighteen. Second, the conspiracies\nhad a different geographic locus as a result of the different legal objects of the conspiracies: Count\nThree concerned travel to New York, whereas Count Five did not require interstate transportation,\nand concerned acts mostly in Florida. Third, the scheme charged in Count Three concerned\ntransporting minors to Epstein’s residence in New York for sexual abuse in violation of state law,\nwhereas Count Five concerned <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex acts with victims, who were paid to participate in\nso-called “massage” appointments. Indeed, the Government legally could not have charged these\nconspiracies together, because the Trafficking Victims Protection Act was not enacted until 2ooo,\nyears after the defendant and Epstein victimized Jane and Annie Farmer, as charged in the Mann\nAct conspiracy. Moreover, the proof at trial established that Virginia Roberts was a victim of the\nsex trafficking conspiracy at age l7, when flight records® established that she travelled with the\ndefendant and Epstein, but that conduct could not have been charged under the Mann Act\nconspiracies, which had a louer age of consent. In short, Counts Three and Five charged\ncategorically different crimes.\n® See Tr. at l855-57 (testimony of pilot David Rodgers regarding Virginia Roberts as a passenger\non flight logs); Government Exhibit 662 (flight records); Government Exhibit l4 (birth certificate\nof Virginia Roberts).\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo959l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010373.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page /7 of 45\nB. Analysis\n\nA further summary of the two counts at issue is required. As briefly outlined above,\nCount Three of the Indictment charged the Defendant under l8 U.S.C. § 37l, the general federal\nconspiracy statute, with conspiring to violate l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a) (the Mann Act), by\ntransporting minors across state lines with the intent to engage in sexual activity criminalized by\nstate law. S2 Indictment 7 l6-l8. In this case, the relevant state offense was New York Penal\nLaw Section l3o.55, which criminalizes sexual contact with an individual knoun to be under the\nage of seventeen. Trial Tr. 3o34-35. The Count Three conspiracy spanned from l994 to 2oo4.\nS2 Indictment 4 l7. As the Government explained in its summation, the jury could convict the\nDefendant under Count Three based on evidence related to Jane, Carolyn, and Annie Farmer,\nthree victims who testified at trial. Trial Tr. at 2895.”\n\nCount Five of the Indictment also charged the Defendant under l8 U.S.C. § 37l, but for\nconspiring to violate l8 U.S.C. §§ l59l(a) & (b) (the Trafficking Victims Protection Act), by\ntrafficking individuals under the age of eighteen for <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex acts that affect interstate\ncommerce. S2 Indictment 9{ 22-24. Count Five’s conspiracy spanned from 2ool to 2oo4. Id.\n423. The Government explained to the jury that it could convict the Defendant on Count Five\nbased on evidence related to Carolyn and Virginia Roberts. Trial Tr. at 2896.\n\nThe Defendant primarily contends that Count Five is a subset of, is subsumed in, or is\notherwise too similar to Count Three under the Korfant factors. The Court agrees. Although\nsome Korfant factors favor the Government, the weight of the factors—supplemented by a\nreview of the Government’s case presented at trial—demonstrates that the Government has not\n: The Court permited certain victim witnesses to testify using a pseudonym or first name. See Nov. l, 2o2l Tr. at\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo373\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010374.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657 _ Filed o4/29/22 Page8of45\nmet its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the counts are not\nmultiplicitous.\n\nThe offenses charged and common objectives. Both Counts Three and Five are charged\nunder the same statute, l8 U.S.C. § 37l, for conspiracy to commit an offense against the United\nStates. But going beyond this “general level” of similarity, the statutory objectives of the two\ncounts differ. Macchia, 35 F.3d at 669. Count Three is a conspiracy to violate § 2423(a) and\nCount Five a conspiracy to violate § l59l. These differing statutory objectives entail legal\ndifferences. Count Three, for example, charges unlawful sexual activity (defined as sexual\ntouching of a minor) while Count Five charges <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sexual activity with a minor. And\neach provision defines “minor” differently: under seventeen years old for Count Three but under\neighteen years old for Count Five. Further, Count Three requires an agreement with intent to\ntransport across state lines, while Count Five’s agreement requires only intent of sexual activity\nthat affects interstate commerce. These differences push the first Korfant factor in the\nGovernment’s favor. See Estrada, 32o F.3d at l82 (distinguishing between a conspiracy to\ndistribute cocaine and one to distribute crack); United States v. Villa, No. 3:l2-CR-4o (JBA),\n2ol4 WL 252ol3, at *4 (D. Conn. Jan. 22, 2ol4), aff'd, 744 F. App’x 7l6 (2d Cir. 2ol8)\n(summary order) (distinguishing between a § 37l conspiracy to “commit theft from an interstate\nshipment and to transport stolen property across state lines” and one to “sell stolen property’’).\n\nThe Government, houever, errs in suggesting that this factor alone is “fatal” to the\nDefendant’s multiplicity claim. Gov. Br. at 29. To the contrary, no single Korfant factor is\ndominant or dispositive. Macchia, 35 F.3d at 668. And courts in this district have found two\nconspiracy counts to be the same offense even when they have different statutory objectives\nbecause both counts can arise from the same agreement. E.g., Hernandez, 2oo9 WL 3l69226, at\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo374\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010384.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Pagel8 of 45\nof the acts alleged in Count Four; or that the Defendant aided and abeted the same. Jury Charge\nat 26, 37.\n\nThe Court concludes that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find the Defendant\nguilty of Count Four beyond a reasonable doubt. Jane testified that Epstein first engaged in\nsexual activity with her in Palm Beach when she was fourteen years old. Trial Tr. at 3o5. She\nthen began traveling from Palm Beach to New York with the Defendant and Epstein at that same\nage. Jd. at 3l5-l6. Jane explained that she traveled on <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> flights and Epstein’s private\njet. Id. at 3l6. She testified that the Defendant also traveled on some of these flights, and that\nthe Defendant assisted her in making her travel arrangements to New York. /d. at 3l6-l7. On\none occasion when she was fifteen, Jane recounted, she had trouble geting on a <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span>\nflight because she did not have proper identification. Houever, the Defendant “made it happen”\nfor her by making a call and helping her get on the flight. /d. at 323-24. Jane also testified that\nthe Defendant was present on some occasions when Epstein sexually abused Jane in New York\nwhen she was under the age of seventeen. /d. at 32o. The Court concludes that this evidence,\ntaken together, was sufficient for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant\nknouingly transported Jane to New York with the intent to engage in sexual activity illegal\nunder New York law, or at minimum, aided and abeted Epstein in doing so.\n\nNext, the Court concludes that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find the\nDefendant guilty of Count Six. Count Six charged the Defendant with the substantive count of\nsex trafficking of an individual under the age of eighteen. The Government was required to\nprove beyond a reasonable doubt that: (l) the Defendant knouingly recruited, enticed, harbored,\ntransported, provided, or obtained a person; (2) the Defendant knew that the person was under\nthe age of eighteen; (3) the Defendant knew the person would be caused to engage in a\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo384\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010385.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Pagel9 of 45\n<span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex act; and (4) the Defendant’s acts were in or affecting interstate commerce; or\nthat the Defendant aided and abeted the same. Jury Charge at 32, 37. Count Six applied solely\nto Carolyn during the period 2ool to 2oo4. /d. at 32.\n\nCarolyn testified that when she was under the age of eighteen, the Defendant would call\nher to set up appointments for Carolyn to perform sexualized massages on Epstein. Trial Tr.\nl527, l53o. Carolyn explained the sexual activities that occurred during the massages. /d. at\nl544-47. Carolyn testified that the Defendant saw her naked in the massage room and continued\nto call Carolyn to schedule appointments with Epstein. /d. at l538. She recalled a specific\nincident when she was fourteen in which she was naked in the massage room and the Defendant\ntouched her breasts and commented that Carolyn “had a great body for Mr. Epstein and his\nfriends.” Jd. at l536-38. Carolyn testified that the Defendant knew that she was under the age\nof eighteen and continued to call her to schedule appointments with Epstein after learning that\nfact. Id. at l535. Carolyn further testified that she received money in exchange for performing\nsexualized massages on Epstein. E.g., id. l523. She recalled that while money was often left on\nthe sink outside of the massage room, the Defendant paid her directly after massages on one or\ntwo occasions. /d. at l54o-4l. Carolyn’s testimony was corroborated by Shawn, Carolyn’s\nboyfriend at the time, and physical evidence including phone message pads. This evidence was\nplainly sufficient for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant commited\nsex trafficking of an individual under eighteen, or aided and abeted Epstein in doing so.?\n\n3 Tf the Court were to conclude that Count Five is not multiplicitous, it would deny the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion\nas to Count Five. Count Five charged the Defendant with participating in a conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of\nindividuals under the age of eighteen from about 2ool to 2oo4. The evidence that supports the Defendant’s\nconviction of Count Six, the substantive count, also supports the Count Five conspiracy conviction. Additionally,\nJuan Alessi testified that the Defendant approached Virginia Roberts in a parking lot and that he then saw her at\nEpstein’s Palm Beach residence later that day. Trial Tr. at 84l-43. Documentary evidence, including flight records,\nestablished that Virginia was under the age of eighteen when she met the Defendant and Epstein. See, e.g., id. at\nl855 (December 2ooo flight record including Epstein, the Defendant, and Virginia); see also GX-l4 (birth\ncertificate). Carolyn testified that Virginia recruited her and that Virginia performed sexualized massages on\n\nl9\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo385\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010393.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 27 of 45\nYork. Maxwell Reply at 5. The jury charge and limiting instructions at trial thus instructed the\njury on the core of criminality.\n\nSecond, the Government marshaled evidence that captured the core of criminality as pled\nin the Indictment and instructed by the Court. Jane testified that after she met the Defendant and\nEpstein at a summer camp, Epstein began engaging in sexual activity with her at his residence in\nFlorida. Trial Tr. at 293-95, 3o5-o6. Jane then began traveling with Epstein and the Defendant\nwhen she was fourteen years old. /d. at 3l5. As the Defendant notes, the majority of Jane’s\ntestimony discussing travel pertained to trips to New York and sexual activity that took place in\nNew York. Maxwell Br. at l3. In her testimony, Jane recalled specific details of Epstein’s New\nYork residence and the sexual acts that occurred there. See Trial Tr. at 3l6-2o. She explained\nthat while she “mainly” traveled to New York on Epstein’s private plane, she also took\n<span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> flights. /d. at 3l6. She further testified that the Defendant assisted in making these\ntravel arrangements. /d. at 3l6-l7. Corroborating evidence included flight records to New York\nand photos of Epstein’s New York residence matching Jane’s description. See id. at 32o.\n\nIn addition to the New York trips, Jane testified about a trip she took to New Mexico with\nthe Defendant and Epstein when she was fifteen or sixteen years old. /d. at 32l. In her\ntestimony regarding this trip, which spanned only three transcript pages, Jane explained that\nduring the trip Epstein engaged in sexual activity with her similar to what took place in New\nYork. See id. at 32l-23. As explained above, testimony about sexual activity in other states,\nincluding Florida and New Mexico, was relevant to the Defendant’s intent. The testimony was\npart and parcel of the Defendant and Epstein’s scheme to groom underage girls at Epstein’s\nvarious properties, including in New Mexico and Palm Beach, to then be transported to New\nYork for sexual activity illegal under New York law. Accordingly, this particular testimony was\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo393\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010395.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 29 of 45\nalter the fact that the evidence and instructions at trial captured the core of criminality of the\nIndictment.\n\nThe jury note at issue read:\n\nUnder Count Four (4), if the defendant aided in the transportation of Jane’s return flight,\n\nbut not the flight to New Mexico where/if the intent was for Jane to engage in sexual\n\nactivity, can she be found guilty under the second element?\nCourt Ex. l5, Dkt. No. 593 at 23. After hearing from the parties, the Court determined that it\nwas unclear to what testimony the note referred and what legal question the note asked.\nAccordingly, the Court concluded that the appropriate course was to refer the jury back to the\ninstruction for the second element of Count Four, with a reminder to consider carefully the full\ninstruction. Trial Tr. at 3l4l. The Court also rejected the Defendant’s supplemental instruction\nproposed the follouing day because it was partially unresponsive, partially redundant, and\npartially an erroneous statement of law. /d. at 3l48-5o.\n\nThe Defendant’s contention that this series of events worked a constructive amendment\nto the Indictment is without merit. First, the Defendant speculates extensively about which\nflights and evidence the jury was referencing in the note, hazarding that the jury was focused on\na l997 flight from New York to New Mexico and an unidentified return flight to Florida. See\nMaxwell Br. at l4-l5. But Jane testified about taking numerous flights both on Epstein’s private\nplane and on <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> carriers. The note did not specify which of these many flights or other\ntestimony the jury was considering. The Court could not provide supplemental instruction based\non such a speculative foundation.\n\nSecond, the note was not “crystal clear” as the Defendant contends. Maxwell Reply at 6.\nRather, as sometimes occurs, the note was decidedly ambiguous as to the precise legal question\nbeing asked. For example, the jury could have been asking about aiding-and-abeting liability as\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo395\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010440.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 23 of 29\nthat she did so in connection with the offense conduct related to “Jane,” Annie Farmer, or\nCarolyn. The aggravating role enhancement therefore does not apply to any of the three offense\ngroups.\n\nB. The Criminal Activity Was Not “Otherwise Extensive”\n\nEven if the Court finds that Ms. Maxwell supervised another “participant,” the record\ndoes not support a finding that the criminal activity related to “Jane,” Annie Farmer, or Carolyn\nwas “otherwise extensive,” as the government contends.’ Under the Guidelines, the Court must\ntreat each minor victim separately and consider whether the enhancement applies based solely on\nthe criminal activity related to that minor victim. See USSG § 2Gl.3, cmt. n.6 (“[S]ubsection\n(d)(l) directs that if the relevant conduct of an offense of conviction includes travel or\ntransportation to engage in a <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex act or prohibited sexual conduct in respect to more\nthan one minor ... each such minor shall be treated as if contained in a separate count of\nconviction.”). For example, the government cannot use conduct from the 2ool-2oo4 time period\nrelated to Carolyn to justify applying the aggravating role enhancement to the criminal activity in\nl994-l997 related to “Jane” or in l996 related to Annie Farmer.\n\nThe government nevertheless atempts to justify the enhancement as to each of the three\nminor victims by making a broad assertion about the nature and scope of the conspiracy as a\nwhole, rather than making an individualized determination that the criminal activity was\n“otherwise extensive” as to each. (See PSR at 59). Because that is insufficient to establish that\nthe criminal activity was “otherwise extensive,” Ms. Maxwell should, at most, be subject to a\ntwo-point enhancement under USSG § 3Bl.l(c).\n\n° The government does not argue that the aggravating role enhancement applies because the criminal activity\ninvolved “five or more participants,” conceding that the trial record does not support the conclusion that five or\nmore people criminally participated in the offense conduct.\nIo\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo44o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010441.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 24 of 29\nIV. The Two-Point “Undue Influence” Enhancement Under USSG § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B)\n\nDoes Not Apply.\n\nFinally, it would be improper for the Court to apply a two-level enhancement on the\ngrounds that a participant in the criminal activity “unduly influenced a minor to engage in\nprohibited sexual conduct.” USSG § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B). First, it would constitute impermissible\ndouble-counting to apply § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B) to the offense conduct related to “Jane,” Annie\nFarmer, and Carolyn because it would punish Ms. Maxwell for the same harm that was fully\naccounted for in the base offense level for Counts Three, Four, and Six. “Impermissible double\ncounting occurs when one part of the Guidelines is applied to increase the defendant’s sentence\nto reflect the kind of harm that has already been fully accounted for by another part of the\nGuidelines.” United States v. Watkins, 667 F.3d 254, 26l (2d Cir. 2ol2). Ms. Maxwell was\nconvicted of conspiring to “entice” and “coerce” minors to travel to engage in prohibited sexual\nconduct and “enticing” minors to engage in <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex acts. (S2 Ind. 4] l2, 24, 27).'°\nWebster’s Dictionary defines the word “entice” to mean “to atract artfully or adroitly or by\narousing hope or desire; tempt” and the further explains that the word “tempt” “implies the\npresenting of an atraction so strong that it overcomes the restraints of conscience or beter\njudgment.”!! Similarly, Webster’s Dictionary defines the word “coerce” to mean “to compel to\nan act or choice” and further explains that the word “compel” “typically suggests overcoming of\nresistance or unwillingness by an irresistible force.”'* Accordingly, the base offense level for\n!o Count Three charged a conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity. S2 Ind. {f\nl6-l9. Although this offense does not contain an element of “enticement” or “coercion,” the offense conduct for\nCounts One, Three, and Five (the three conspiracy counts) was consolidated under Count Three for the purposes of\nsentencing, pursuant to the Court’s order. See Dkt. 657.\n\n' Available at Meriam-Webster.com Dictionary, Merriam-Webster, htps://www.merriam-\nwebster.com/dictionary/coerce (accessed June l5, 2o22).\n2 Available at Meriam-Webster.com Dictionary, Merriam-Webster, htps://www.merriam-\nwebster.com/dictionary/compel (accessed June l5, 2o22).\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo44l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010442.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 25 of 29\nCounts Three, Four, and Six already includes the concept of “unduly influenc[ing] a minor to\nengage in prohibited sexual conduct.” The enhancement therefore should not be applied to any\nof the three offense groups.\n\nSecond, under the 2oo3 Guidelines, which should apply in this case, the analogous two-\npoint enhancement only applies if “a participant otherwise unduly influenced a minor to engage\nin a <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex act.’ USSG § 2Gl.l(b)(4)(B) (2oo3) (emphasis added). There is no\nevidence that “Jane” or Annie Farmer engaged in a <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex act. Accordingly, the\nenhancement should not apply to their two offense groups (Groups l| and 2).\n\nThird, the evidence does not support that Carolyn was “unduly influenced” to provide\nsexualized massages to Epstein. The “undue influence” enhancement applies when “a\nparticipant’s influence over the minor compromised the voluntariness of the minor’s behavior.”\nUSSG § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B), Appl. Note 3(B). “[T]he defining characteristic of undue influence is\nthat it involves a situation where the influencer has succeeded in altering the behavior of the\ntarget.” United States v. Paterson, 576 F.3d 43l, 443 (7th Cir. 2oo9) (internal quotation marks\nomited). Apart from Virginia Roberts initially offering Carolyn the opportunity to massage\nEpstein, the record indicates that Carolyn sought out additional massage appointments herself\nand recruited other minors to perform sexualized massages to make more money. (Tr. l527-28,\nl543-46). Carolyn further testified that after she became pregnant, she returned to Epstein\nwithout being contacted to earn additional money. (Tr. l548-49). In addition, Carolyn was not\nso influenced by Epstein or Ms. Maxwell that she did whatever they asked of her. Carolyn\ntestified that she refused their offers to have her travel with them to Epstein’s island. (Tr. l534-\n35). In sum, the record does not support the conclusion that Ms. Maxwell or anyone else\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo442\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010568.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o_ Filed o6/22/22 Page 33 oof55\n\nThe defendant’s argument to the contrary—that her particular crime involved undue\ninfluence of minors—does not demonstrate double-counting. The fact that the defendant’s course\nof conduct triggers both the harm targeted by the base offense level and the harm triggered by an\nenhancement shous that the enhancement applies, not that the enhancement is redundant with the\nbase offense level.\n\nD. The Five-Level Enhancement in Section 4Bl.5 Applies\n\nSection 4Bl.5 has two provisions, depending on whether a defendant has a prior sex\noffense conviction. Where, as here, the defendant does not have a prior conviction, § 4Bl.5(b)\nadds five offense levels and sets a minimum offense level of 22, so long as the defendant satisfies\nthat section’s three requirements: (l) the offense of conviction must be a ““covered sex crime,” (b)\nthe defendant is neither a career offender nor a repeat offender, and (c) the defendant “engaged in\na patern of activity involving prohibited sexual conduct.” Jd. § 4Bl.l(b). “Prohibited sexual\nconduct,” in turn, covers any offense under Chapters ll7, lo9A, or llo, and any state law offense\nthat would be a federal offense under those chapters if commited “within the special maritime and\nterritorial jurisdiction of the United States.” l8 U.S.C. § 2426 (2oo3); see U.S.S.G. § 4Bl.5 app.\nn.4(A) (incorporating that definition); see also, e.g., United States v. Phillips, 43l F.3d 86, 9o &\nn.6 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (applying these requirements).\n3 The defendant also argues that the enhancement does not apply as to Jane and Annie because,\nunder the 2oo3 Guidelines, the undue influence must occur with the object of having the minor\nengage in a <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex act. (Def. Mem. 2l). As explained above, the 2oo4 Guidelines manual\napplies, and it contains no such provision. In any event, Jane testified that she received money\nduring the course of her abuse (Tr. 3ol-o2), and Annie testified that she was promised a trip to\nThailand which she ultimately received (Tr. 2o59, 2o9o-92). See U.S.S.G. § 2Gl.l app. n.l\n(incorporating the definition of “<span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex act” in l8 U.S.C. § l59l(c)(l)); l8 U.S.C.\n§ l59l(c)(l) (2ooo) (defining a “<span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex act” and “any sex act, on account of which\nanything of value is given to or received by any person”).\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo568\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011308.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l4 Filed o7/l2/22 Page5of7\nirrelevant. If a <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex act occurred involving a l7-year-old in New York, that sexual\nactivity is illegal under l8 U.S.C. § l59l because it involves a minor, even though it is above New\nYork’s age of consent. Although the instruction uses the phrase “illegal sexual activity,” an\nelement of the Mann Act, the jury is likely not to grasp that point in a short mid-trial instruction,\ndivorced from a discussion of the elements of the offenses. The jury would therefore also be\nconfused into thinking incorrectly that sexual activity that is “not illegal” under the local law is\nsimilarly lawful under federal law.\n\nFinally, the Government notes that—as to New Mexico in particular—age of consent is\nnot a simple and straightforward question. As the defense noted in their opposition to the\nGovernment’s motions in limine, “New Mexico does not have a specific age of consent.” (Def.\nOpp. at 46, Dkt. No. 483). The age of consent can also depend on the specific sexual act involved,\nwhich may require analysis of New Mexico state law in comparison to the facts elicited at trial.\nCompare id. at 46 & n.43 (noting that the age of consent depends on whether coercion or force are\ninvolved), with State v. Begaye, -- P. 3d --, 2o2l WL 5l73l5o, at * 2 (N.M. Ct. App. 2o2l)\n(affirming conviction of defendant who forcibly hugged a sixteen-year-old and, when releasing\nher, “brushed his hand over her chest and squeezed her breast”). It therefore cannot be said that a\nsexual act in New Mexico was “above the age of consent” without determining what sexual act\noccurred and hou New Mexico state law would treat that act.\n\nIn the Government’s view, these issues are best explained to the jury in the concluding jury\ninstructions, where the jury can be fully instructed on the relevant law and then apply that law to\nthe facts it finds have been established at trial. And no limiting instruction is needed because, as\nwill be explained to the jury in the concluding instructions, they can only convict for violations of\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooll3o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011309.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l4 Filed o7/l2/22 Page6eof7\nthe Mann Act with the New York state law (including the New York age of consent) as its object,\nor for violations of § l59l, and conspiracy to commit those offenses. There is accordingly no risk\nthat the jury will convict the defendant for violating an unidentified local sex crimes law for which\nthe Minor Victim was above the age of consent. Asa result, the Government respectfully requests\nthat the Court refrain from giving the second limiting instruction at all during this trial.\n\nIf the Court nevertheless decides to give the second limiting instruction, the Government\nproposes the follouing revision to give the jury an understanding both of what is and what is not\nillegal sexual activity:\n\nI anticipate that you will hear testimony from the next witness about sexual conduct\n\nthat she says she had with Mr. Epstein in [insert relevant jurisdiction, e.g. New\n\nMexico]. I instruct you that if and when beeause the witness was over the age of\n\nconsent in [insert relevant jurisdiction, e.g. New Mexico] at the relevant time\n\nperiod, the sexual conduct she says occurred with Mr. Epstein was not itself “illegal\n\nsexual activity” as the Government has charged in the Indictment. [The age of\n\nconsent in that jurisdiction is [insert relevant age of consent or analysis\n\nthereof]]._ Houever, to the extent you conclude that her testimony is relevant to\n\nthe issues before you, including the defendant’s intent for that witness to engage\n\nin illegal sexual activity in New York as charged in the Indictment, you may\n\nconsider it. Even when the witness was over the age of consent in [insert\n\nrelevant jurisdiction, e.g., New Mexico], at the relevant time period, you may\nconclude that the witness was belou the age of consent in New York, which is\n\nl7 years old. [For witnesses relevant to the sex trafficking counts: Further,\n\nthe sexual conduct may be considered in determining whether the defendant\n\nintended the witness to engage in a “<span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex act” before reaching the\n\nage of l8, and for which the age of consent in [insert relevant jurisdiction] is\n\nirrelevant.] Houever, you may not consider this testimony regarding sexual\n\nactivity that took place above the age of consent with respect to the relevant\nstatute as I have just described it as any kind of reflection on Mr. Epstein’s nor\n\nMs. Maxwell’s character or propensity to commit any of the crimes charged in the\n\nIndictment.\n\nThe proposed revision provides the jury with information that matches the expected\ntestimony, provides the jury with sufficient context about the question before it to avoid confusion\nabout hou it can and cannot consider the sexual activity, avoids an inaccurate statement of state\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooll3o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011416.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 73l-l Filed o7/l4/22 Page loof l4\nrefrain from wrongful conduct.

The lawyer-client privilege and\nwork-product doctrine apply in judicial and other proceedings in which a lawyer may be\ncalled as a witness or be otherwise compelled to produce evidence concerning a client.\nA lawyer’s ethical duty of confidentiality is not so limited in its scope of protection for the\nlawyer-client relationship of trust and prevents a lawyer from revealing the client’s\ninformation even when not subjected to such compulsion.

Although a lawyer is not permited to reveal\ninformation protected by section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l) concerning a client’s past,\ncompleted criminal acts, the policy favoring the preservation of human life that underlies\nthis exception to the duty of confidentiality and the evidentiary privilege permits\ndisclosure to prevent a future or ongoing criminal act.\nLawyer not subject to discipline for revealing information protected by Business and\nProfessions Code section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l) as permited under this rule\n[4] Paragraph (b) reflects a balancing between the interests of preserving client\nconfidentiality and of preventing a criminal act that a lawyer reasonably believes”* is\n\n2\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll4l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011564.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 737 Filed o7/22/22 Page 45oflol 45\nM6SQmaxl\n\nl two if a participant unduly influenced a minor to engage in a\n\n2 <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex act. In defining the enhancement, the\n\n3 Commission instructs courts to closely consider the facts of\n\n4 the case to determine whether a participant's influence over\n\n5 the minor compromised the voluntariness of the minor's\n\n6 behavior. 2Gl.l, comment note 7.

The 2Gl.l(a) base offense level reflects the\nal aggregating factor that the victim of the defendant's sex\n22 offense was a minor. The enhancement, by contrast, reflects\n23 the use of undue influence to engage in a <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex act.\n24 I'll cite a few cases that stand for that proposition,\n25 including United States v.

And we talked about the overwhelming\n\n4 evidence that Maxwell aided and abeted these crimes.

This count\n9 is about Jane and hou Maxwell and Epstein enticed her to travel\nlo in interstate commerce, in other words, to go across state\n\nll lines to New York to be abused.\n\nl2 The first element of that crime is that the defendant\nl3 knouingly persuaded, or induced, or enticed, or coerced Jane to\nl4 travel in interstate commerce.

That's what happened to Carolyn. She was paid\n\nl4 hundreds of dollars every time that she was abused.

This went on\n\n3 for years.\n\n4 Count Five is the sex trafficking conspiracy count\n\n5 which spans from 2ooo to 2oo4, and this count relates to\n\n6 Carolyn and Virginia. You heard about the steps the defendant\n7 took in those years with Carolyn and Virginia. She was taking\n8 steps to traffic girls for sex, recruiting Virginia Roberts at\n9 Mar-a-Lago, transporting Virginia to other states with Epstein,\nlo sending Carolyn up to the Palm Beach massage room on her first\nll visit, calling Carolyn for massage appointments in Florida so\nl2 that she could engage in <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex acts. The defendant\n\nl3 took so many steps in furtherance of the conspiracies charged\nl4 in the indictment, the evidence about that was overwhelming, it\nl5 went on for years.\n\nl6 But let me say this, because it's very important. For\nl7 each of the conspiracy counts, to find the defendant guilty,\n\nl8 you only have to find that she did it once, that there existed\nl9 one moment in time in all of those years where she agreed to do\n2o this, and that Maxwell or Epstein took some step to carry out\n2l the agreement. That's it. If you find that one moment\n22 happened, the defendant is guilty.\n23 Let me say one last thing about the law.

In defining the enhancement, the\n\n3 Commission instructs courts to closely consider the facts of\n\n4 the case to determine whether a participant's influence over\n\n5 the minor compromised the voluntariness of the minor's\n\n6 behavior. 2Gl.l, comment note 7. And if the participant is at\n7 least ten years older than the minor, there is a rebutable\n\n8 presumption that the participant unduly influenced the minor to\n9 engage in a <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex act. I overrule the defendant's\n\nlo objection.\n\nll The defendant first says the undue influence\n\nl2 enhancement would punish her for the same harm already counted\nl3 in her base offense level. Impermissible double counting\n\nl4 occurs when a guideline enhancement is applied to reflect the\nl5 kind of harm that's already fully accounted for elsewhere in\n\nl6 the Guidelines but does not occur if the enhancement aims at\n\nl7 differing harms emanating from the same conduct or reflects\n\nl8 different facets of the defendant's conduct. United States v.\nl9 Watkins, 667 F.3d 254 (2d Cir. 2ol2). There isn't double\n2o counting here. The 2Gl.l(a) base offense level reflects the\nal aggregating factor that the victim of the defendant's sex\n22 offense was a minor. The enhancement, by contrast, reflects\n23 the use of undue influence to engage in a <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex act.\n24 I'll cite a few cases that stand for that proposition,\n25 including United States v. Kohlmeier, 858 F.

Similar conclusion, United States\n2 v. Smith, a Ninth Circuit case from 2ol3, 7l9 F.3d ll2o. That\n3 case explains 2G6l.3(a) base offense level and the undue\n\n4 influence enhancement \"Serve unique purposes under the\n\n5 Guidelines.\"\n\n6 The defense argues that because the enhancement\n\n7 applies only if undue influence was exerted with the aim of a\n\n8 <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex act, it does not apply here. But the jury in\n\n9 Count Six did convict the defendant of sex trafficking Carolyn\nlo to participate in <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex acts. The Court finds that\n\nll Virginia Roberts, who brought Carolyn and Melissa who was\n\nl2 brought by Carolyn similarly were paid. The remaining victims,\nl3 including Jane and Annie, also testified that they received\n\nl4 money and gifts during their abuse which satisfies the\n\nl5 enhancement.\n\nl6 The defendant argues Carolyn was not unduly influenced\nl7 to sexually massage Epstein. I find this argument meritless.\nl8 The age gap between Carolyn and Epstein and the defendant far\nl9 exceeded ten years, and the defendant does not rebut the\n2o resulting presumption of undue influence. 2Gl.l, comment note\n2l 7. Carolyn testified she was paid to give Epstein sexualized\n22 massages, and she needed the money for her drug addiction.\n23 Later, Carolyn returned to Epstein because she needed the money\n24 for herself and her newborn son. Plainly, taking advantage of\n25 a victim's financial need is a form of undue influence.

As explained, I will use the\n\n3 2oo3 Guidelines manual. Follouing Section 2Gl.l(d)(l), each\n\n4 victim is considered a separate count of conviction. In\n\n5 addition to the three victims for which an offense level was\n\n6 calculated in the PSR -- Jane, Annie, and Carolyn -- I\n\n7 calculate offense levels, for Virginia and Melissa, coming to a\n8 total of 5 groups.\n\n9 For all groups, the base offense level is l9. That's\nlo Sections 2Gl.l(a) and 2Xl.l(a).\n\nll For Jane and Carolyn, because they were older than l2\nl2 but were not yet l6 when abuse began, the offense level is\n\nl3 enhanced by 2. 2G6l.l(b) (2) (B).\n\nl4 The offense level for Jane and Carolyn is further\n\nl5 enhanced by 2 because they were unduly influenced into a\n\nl6 <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex act. 2G6l.l(b) (4) (B).\n\nl7 For Annie, Virginia, and Melissa, who were at least\n\nl8 l6, the offense level is increased by 2 because they were\n\nl9 unduly influenced into a <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> act. 2Gl.l.(b) (4) (B).\n2o The offense level for all groups are also enhanced by\n2l 4 points because of the supervisory role in an extensive\n22 criminal activity. 3Bl.l(a).\n23 This brings the total offense level for Jane's and\n24 Carolyn's groups to 27.

In other words, did the\n\nl5 defendant in some way cause Jane to travel across state lines.\nl6 You knou that Maxwell induced Jane to travel because\nl7 Jane told you about traveling with Maxwell to New York. Jane\nl8 flew on <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> flights and also on the private jets. She\nl9 told you about hou Maxwell assisted with her travel\n2o arrangements, and Juan Alessi confirmed this, because he\n2l remembered driving Jane with Maxwell, Epstein, and Jane right\n22 up to the plane. He watched them board together.\n23 Ladies and gentlemen, Jane didn't end up in New York\n24 by accident, it was a direct result of Maxwell's actions,\n25 aiding and abeting Epstein as part of an ongoing patern of\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool7o77\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00017082.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 6l of 257 2894\nLCKCmax3 Summation — Ms. Moe\n\nl that Maxwell knew Carolyn was underage.\n\n2 And we're talking about the counts one by one, but I\n\n3 want to step back and ask you to keep in mind, you don't have\n\n4 to set aside all of the evidence you heard in this case when\n\na you examine each count, it's the opposite. The patern\n\n6 throughout the case tells you that the defendant knew these\n\n7 girls were under age and she knew that they were going to be\n\n8 molested. You should consider all of that evidence as you\n\n9 examine each count.\n\nlo The third element of Count Six is that the defendant\nll knew Carolyn would be caused to engage in a <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex act.\nl2 And here, a <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex act just means a sex act in exchange\nl3 for money. That's what happened to Carolyn. She was paid\n\nl4 hundreds of dollars every time that she was abused. Sometimes\nl5 Maxwell handed over the cash herself.\n\nl6 And we've been talking all morning about the\n\nl7 overwhelming evidence that Maxwell knew these girls would be\n\nl8 sexually abused in those so-called massages. She absolutely\n\nl9 knew.\n2o Finally, there is a fourth element here. In\n2l interstate commerce here means something a litle different\n22 than the first two counts we talked about. We're not talking\n23 about travel across state lines. Instead, we're talking about\n24 an effect on interstate commerce.\n25 So when Carolyn got packages from New York, when she\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool7o82\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00017084.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 63 of 257 2896\nLCKCmax3 Summation — Ms. Moe\n\nl for abuse after she had already visited Epstein in New York,\n\n2 hou the defendant asked Carolyn to travel, too. This went on\n\n3 for years.\n\n4 Count Five is the sex trafficking conspiracy count\n\n5 which spans from 2ooo to 2oo4, and this count relates to\n\n6 Carolyn and Virginia. You heard about the steps the defendant\n7 took in those years with Carolyn and Virginia. She was taking\n8 steps to traffic girls for sex, recruiting Virginia Roberts at\n9 Mar-a-Lago, transporting Virginia to other states with Epstein,\nlo sending Carolyn up to the Palm Beach massage room on her first\nll visit, calling Carolyn for massage appointments in Florida so\nl2 that she could engage in <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex acts. The defendant\n\nl3 took so many steps in furtherance of the conspiracies charged\nl4 in the indictment, the evidence about that was overwhelming, it\nl5 went on for years.\n\nl6 But let me say this, because it's very important. For\nl7 each of the conspiracy counts, to find the defendant guilty,\n\nl8 you only have to find that she did it once, that there existed\nl9 one moment in time in all of those years where she agreed to do\n2o this, and that Maxwell or Epstein took some step to carry out\n2l the agreement. That's it. If you find that one moment\n22 happened, the defendant is guilty.\n23 Let me say one last thing about the law. For each of\n24 the counts, I expect Judge Nathan will instruct you about\n25 something called venue.

Analysis\n\nA further summary of the two counts at issue is required. As briefly outlined above,\nCount Three of the Indictment charged the Defendant under l8 U.S.C. § 37l, the general federal\nconspiracy statute, with conspiring to violate l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a) (the Mann Act), by\ntransporting minors across state lines with the intent to engage in sexual activity criminalized by\nstate law. S2 Indictment §f] l6-l8. In this case, the relevant state offense was New York Penal\nLaw Section l3o.55, which criminalizes sexual contact with an individual knoun to be under the\nage of seventeen. Trial Tr. 3o34-35. The Count Three conspiracy spanned from l994 to 2oo4.\nS2 Indictment | l7. As the Government explained in its summation, the jury could convict the\nDefendant under Count Three based on evidence related to Jane, Carolyn, and Annie Farmer,\nthree victims who testified at trial. Trial Tr. at 2895.*\n\nCount Five of the Indictment also charged the Defendant under l8 U.S.C. § 37l, but for\nconspiring to violate l8 U.S.C. §§ l59l(a) & (b) (the Trafficking Victims Protection Act), by\ntrafficking individuals under the age of eighteen for <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex acts that affect interstate\ncommerce. S2 Indictment {| 22-24. Count Five’s conspiracy spanned from 2ool to 2oo4. Jd.\n4] 23. The Government explained to the jury that it could convict the Defendant on Count Five\nbased on evidence related to Carolyn and Virginia Roberts. Trial Tr. at 2896.\n\nThe Defendant primarily contends that Count Five is a subset of, is subsumed in, or is\notherwise too similar to Count Three under the Korfant factors. The Court agrees. Although\nsome Korfant factors favor the Government, the weight of the factors—supplemented by a\nreview of the Government’s case presented at trial—demonstrates that the Government has not\n: ae Court permited certain victim witnesses to testify using a pseudonym or first name. See Nov. l, 2o2l Tr. at\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o99o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020991.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel65 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 8 of 45\nmet its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the counts are not\nmultiplicitous.\n\nThe offenses charged and common objectives. Both Counts Three and Five are charged\nunder the same statute, l8 U.S.C. § 37l, for conspiracy to commit an offense against the United\nStates. But going beyond this “general level” of similarity, the statutory objectives of the two\ncounts differ. Macchia, 35 F.3d at 669. Count Three is a conspiracy to violate § 2423(a) and\nCount Five a conspiracy to violate § l59l. These differing statutory objectives entail legal\ndifferences. Count Three, for example, charges unlawful sexual activity (defined as sexual\ntouching of a minor) while Count Five charges <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sexual activity with a minor. And\neach provision defines “minor” differently: under seventeen years old for Count Three but under\neighteen years old for Count Five. Further, Count Three requires an agreement with intent to\ntransport across state lines, while Count Five’s agreement requires only intent of sexual activity\nthat affects interstate commerce. These differences push the first Korfant factor in the\nGovernment’s favor. See Estrada, 32o F.3d at l82 (distinguishing between a conspiracy to\ndistribute cocaine and one to distribute crack); United States v. Villa, No. 3:l2-CR-4o (JBA),\n2ol4 WL 252ol3, at *4 (D. Conn. Jan. 22, 2ol4), aff'd, 744 F. App’x 7l6 (2d Cir. 2ol8)\n(summary order) (distinguishing between a § 37l conspiracy to “commit theft from an interstate\nshipment and to transport stolen property across state lines” and one to “sell stolen property”).\n\nThe Government, houever, errs in suggesting that this factor alone is “fatal” to the\nDefendant’s multiplicity claim. Gov. Br. at 29. To the contrary, no single Korfant factor is\ndominant or dispositive. Macchia, 35 F.3d at 668. And courts in this district have found two\nconspiracy counts to be the same offense even when they have different statutory objectives\nbecause both counts can arise from the same agreement.

Jury Charge\nat 26, 37.\n\nThe Court concludes that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find the Defendant\nguilty of Count Four beyond a reasonable doubt. Jane testified that Epstein first engaged in\nsexual activity with her in Palm Beach when she was fourteen years old. Trial Tr. at 3o5. She\nthen began traveling from Palm Beach to New York with the Defendant and Epstein at that same\nage. Id. at 3l5-l6. Jane explained that she traveled on <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> flights and Epstein’s private\njet. Jd. at 3l6. She testified that the Defendant also traveled on some of these flights, and that\nthe Defendant assisted her in making her travel arrangements to New York. /d. at 3l6-l7. On\none occasion when she was fifteen, Jane recounted, she had trouble geting on a <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span>\nflight because she did not have proper identification. Houever, the Defendant “made it happen”\nfor her by making a call and helping her get on the flight. /d. at 323-24. Jane also testified that\nthe Defendant was present on some occasions when Epstein sexually abused Jane in New York\nwhen she was under the age of seventeen. /d. at 32o. The Court concludes that this evidence,\ntaken together, was sufficient for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant\nknouingly transported Jane to New York with the intent to engage in sexual activity illegal\nunder New York law, or at minimum, aided and abeted Epstein in doing so.\n\nNext, the Court concludes that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find the\nDefendant guilty of Count Six. Count Six charged the Defendant with the substantive count of\nsex trafficking of an individual under the age of eighteen. The Government was required to\nprove beyond a reasonable doubt that: (l) the Defendant knouingly recruited, enticed, harbored,\ntransported, provided, or obtained a person; (2) the Defendant knew that the person was under\nthe age of eighteen; (3) the Defendant knew the person would be caused to engage in a\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lool\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021002.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel/6 of 22l\nA-376\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page l9 of 45\n<span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex act; and (4) the Defendant’s acts were in or affecting interstate commerce; or\nthat the Defendant aided and abeted the same. Jury Charge at 32, 37. Count Six applied solely\nto Carolyn during the period 2ool to 2oo4. Jd. at 32.\n\nCarolyn testified that when she was under the age of eighteen, the Defendant would call\nher to set up appointments for Carolyn to perform sexualized massages on Epstein. Trial Tr.\nl527, l53o. Carolyn explained the sexual activities that occurred during the massages. /d. at\nl544-47. Carolyn testified that the Defendant saw her naked in the massage room and continued\nto call Carolyn to schedule appointments with Epstein. /d. at l538. She recalled a specific\nincident when she was fourteen in which she was naked in the massage room and the Defendant\ntouched her breasts and commented that Carolyn “had a great body for Mr. Epstein and his\nfriends.” /d. at l536-38. Carolyn testified that the Defendant knew that she was under the age\nof eighteen and continued to call her to schedule appointments with Epstein after learning that\nfact. /d. at l535. Carolyn further testified that she received money in exchange for performing\nsexualized massages on Epstein. E.g., id. l523. She recalled that while money was often left on\nthe sink outside of the massage room, the Defendant paid her directly after massages on one or\ntwo occasions. /d. at l54o-4l. Carolyn’s testimony was corroborated by Shawn, Carolyn’s\nboyfriend at the time, and physical evidence including phone message pads. This evidence was\nplainly sufficient for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant commited\nsex trafficking of an individual under eighteen, or aided and abeted Epstein in doing so.?\n\n3 Tf the Court were to conclude that Count Five is not multiplicitous, it would deny the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion\nas to Count Five. Count Five charged the Defendant with participating in a conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of\nindividuals under the age of eighteen from about 2ool to 2oo4. The evidence that supports the Defendant’s\nconviction of Count Six, the substantive count, also supports the Count Five conspiracy conviction. Additionally,\nJuan Alessi testified that the Defendant approached Virginia Roberts in a parking lot and that he then saw her at\nEpstein’s Palm Beach residence later that day. Trial Tr. at 84l-43. Documentary evidence, including flight records,\nestablished that Virginia was under the age of eighteen when she met the Defendant and Epstein. See, e.g., id. at\nl855 (December 2ooo flight record including Epstein, the Defendant, and Virginia); see also GX-l4 (birth\ncertificate). Carolyn testified that Virginia recruited her and that Virginia performed sexualized massages on\n\nl9\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2loo2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021010.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel84 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 27 of 45\nYork. Maxwell Reply at 5. The jury charge and limiting instructions at trial thus instructed the\njury on the core of criminality.\n\nSecond, the Government marshaled evidence that captured the core of criminality as pled\nin the Indictment and instructed by the Court. Jane testified that after she met the Defendant and\nEpstein at a summer camp, Epstein began engaging in sexual activity with her at his residence in\nFlorida. Trial Tr. at 293-95, 3o5-o6. Jane then began traveling with Epstein and the Defendant\nwhen she was fourteen years old. /d. at 3l5. As the Defendant notes, the majority of Jane’s\ntestimony discussing travel pertained to trips to New York and sexual activity that took place in\nNew York. Maxwell Br. at l3. In her testimony, Jane recalled specific details of Epstein’s New\nYork residence and the sexual acts that occurred there. See Trial Tr. at 3l6-2o. She explained\nthat while she “mainly” traveled to New York on Epstein’s private plane, she also took\n<span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> flights. /d. at 3l6. She further testified that the Defendant assisted in making these\ntravel arrangements. /d. at 3l6-l7. Corroborating evidence included flight records to New York\nand photos of Epstein’s New York residence matching Jane’s description. See id. at 32o.\n\nIn addition to the New York trips, Jane testified about a trip she took to New Mexico with\nthe Defendant and Epstein when she was fifteen or sixteen years old. /d. at 32l. In her\ntestimony regarding this trip, which spanned only three transcript pages, Jane explained that\nduring the trip Epstein engaged in sexual activity with her similar to what took place in New\nYork. See id. at 32l-23. As explained above, testimony about sexual activity in other states,\nincluding Florida and New Mexico, was relevant to the Defendant’s intent. The testimony was\npart and parcel of the Defendant and Epstein’s scheme to groom underage girls at Epstein’s\nvarious properties, including in New Mexico and Palm Beach, to then be transported to New\nYork for sexual activity illegal under New York law. Accordingly, this particular testimony was\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lolo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021012.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel86 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 29 of 45\nalter the fact that the evidence and instructions at trial captured the core of criminality of the\nIndictment.\n\nThe jury note at issue read:\n\nUnder Count Four (4), if the defendant aided in the transportation of Jane’s return flight,\n\nbut not the flight to New Mexico where/if the intent was for Jane to engage in sexual\n\nactivity, can she be found guilty under the second element?\nCourt Ex. l5, Dkt. No. 593 at 23. After hearing from the parties, the Court determined that it\nwas unclear to what testimony the note referred and what legal question the note asked.\nAccordingly, the Court concluded that the appropriate course was to refer the jury back to the\ninstruction for the second element of Count Four, with a reminder to consider carefully the full\ninstruction. Trial Tr. at 3l4l. The Court also rejected the Defendant’s supplemental instruction\nproposed the follouing day because it was partially unresponsive, partially redundant, and\npartially an erroneous statement of law. /d. at 3l48-5o.\n\nThe Defendant’s contention that this series of events worked a constructive amendment\nto the Indictment is without merit. First, the Defendant speculates extensively about which\nflights and evidence the jury was referencing in the note, hazarding that the jury was focused on\na l997 flight from New York to New Mexico and an unidentified return flight to Florida. See\nMaxwell Br. at l4-l5. But Jane testified about taking numerous flights both on Epstein’s private\nplane and on <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> carriers. The note did not specify which of these many flights or other\ntestimony the jury was considering. The Court could not provide supplemental instruction based\non such a speculative foundation.\n\nSecond, the note was not “crystal clear” as the Defendant contends. Maxwell Reply at 6.\nRather, as sometimes occurs, the note was decidedly ambiguous as to the precise legal question\nbeing asked. For example, the jury could have been asking about aiding-and-abeting liability as\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lol2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021307.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l33 3536o38, Pagel35 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l33 of 348\n\nIn another leter, Starr renewed the defense accusation that the USAO improperly disclosed\ninformation about the case to the media, and accused Sloman and Villafafia of “encouraging civil\nlitigation” against Epstein. Finally, in a leter to Assistant Atorney General Fisher on\nMay l4, 2oo8, Starr thanked her for having spoken with him the previous day, reiterated the\ndefense team’s various complaints, and asked her to meet with him, Lefkouitz, and Whitley.\n\nMeanwhile, Oosterban’s Deputy Chief drafted a decision leter to be sent from Oosterban\nto Lefkouitz, and over the course of several weeks, it was reviewed by and received input from\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker and Assistant Atorney General Fisher, as well as\nthe Criminal Division’s Appellate Section (regarding certain legal issues) and Office of\nEnforcement Operations (regarding the Petite policy). Oosterban told OPR that, notwithstanding\nthe defense submissions on a wide variety of issues and complaints, CEOS’s review was limited\nto determining whether there was a basis for a federal prosecution of Epstein.\n\nOosterban’s leter, sent to Lefkouitz on May l5, 2oo8, notified the defense team that\nCEOS had completed its independent evaluation of whether prosecution of Epstein for federal\ncriminal violations “would contradict criminal enforcement policy interests.” The leter specified\nthat CEOS’s review addressed the “narrou question” of whether a legitimate basis existed for a\nfederal prosecution, and that CEOS did not conduct a de novo review of the facts, analyze issues\nrelating to federal statutes that did not pertain to child exploitation, or review the terms of the NPA\nor the prosecutorial misconduct allegations. The leter stated that based on its examination of the\nmaterial relevant to its limited review of the mater, CEOS had concluded that “federal prosecution\nin this case would not be improper or inappropriate” and that Acosta “could properly use his\ndiscretion to authorize prosecution in this case.”\n\nOn May l9, 2oo8, Lefkouitz reached out to Acosta to request a meeting and specifically\nasked that Acosta “not shunt me off to one of your staff.” Lefkouitz made several points in support\nof the request for a meeting: (l) CEOS’s leter acknouledged that federal prosecution of Epstein\nwould involve a “novel application” of relevant federal statutes;!°° (2) CEOS’s conclusion that\nfederal prosecution would not be ‘“‘an abuse of discretion” was “hardly an endorsement” of the\ncase;!®’ (3) CEOS did not address Epstein’s prosecutorial misconduct allegations; and (4) “critical\nnew evidence,” in the form of recent defense counsel depositions of victims confirmed “that\nrepresented Epstein victims. The Epstein defense team alleged in the leter that Sloman’s past association with the\natorney caused Sloman to take actions to favor victims’ potential civil lawsuits against Epstein.\ntes Oosterban’s leter stated, “Mr. Acosta can soundly exercise his authority to decide to pursue a prosecution\neven though it might involve a novel application of a federal statute.” This statement referred to a defense argument\nbased on a prior Departmental expression of concern about a Congressional proposal to expand federal law to “adult\nprostitution where no force, fraud or coercion was used.” Oosterban stated that “the Department’s efforts are properly\nfocused on the <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sexual exploitation of children”—even if wholly local—and “the exploitation of adults\nthrough force, fraud, or coercion.” He then observed that the fact “that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not look\nprecisely like the cases that came before it is not dispositive.”\n\nEst Oosterban began his leter, houever, by making it clear that CEOS had considered “the narrou question as\nto whether there is a legitimate basis for the U.S. Atorney’s Office to proceed with a federal prosecution of\nMr. Epstein.”\nlo7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021499.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Page69 of 2l7\nSA-323\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 323 of 348\n\nIN RE:\n\nINVESTIGATION OF\n\nJEFFREY EPSTEIN\n\n/\nNON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT\nIT APPEARING that Jeffrey Epstein (hereinafter “Epstein”) is reported to have\ncommited offenses against the United States from in or around 2ool through in or around\nOctober 2oo5, including:\n\n(l) knouingly and willfully conspiring with others knoun and unknoun to commit\nan offense against the United States, that is, to use a facility or means of interstate\nor foreign commerce to knouingly persuade, induce, or entice minor females to\nengage in prostitution, in violation of Title l8, United States Code, Section\n2422(b); all in violation of Title l8, United States Code, Section 37l;\n\n(2) knouingly and willfully conspiring with others knoun and unknoun to travel in\ninterstate commerce for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual conduct, as\ndefined in l8 U.S.C. § 2423(f), with minor females, in violation of Title l8,\nUnited States Code, Section 2423(b); all in violation of Title l8, United States\nCode, Section 2423(e);\n\n(3) using a facility or means of interstate or foreign commerce to knouingly\npersuade, induce, or entice minor females to engage in prostitution; in violation of\nTitle l8, United States Code, Sections 2422(b) and 2;\n\n(4) traveling in interstate commerce for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual\nconduct, as defined in l8 U.S.C. § 2423(f), with minor females; in violation of\nTitle l8, United States Code, Section 2423(b); and\n\n(5) knouingly, in and affecting interstate and foreign commerce, recruiting, enticing,\nand obtaining by any means a person, knouing that the person had not atained\nthe age of l8 years and would be caused to engage in a <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex act as\ndefined in l8 U.S.C. § l59l(c)(l); in violation of Title l8, United States Code,\nSections l59l(a)(l) and 2; and\n\nIT APPEARING that Epstein has accepted responsibility for his behavior by his\n\nTlaye l ob 4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l499\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021506.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Page/6 of 2l7\nSA-33o\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 33o of 348\nof Title l8, United States Code, Section 2423(b); and\n\n(5) knouingly, in and affecting interstate and foreign commerce, recruiting,\n\nenticing, and obtaining by any means a person, knouing that the person had\nnot atained the age of l8 years and would be caused to engage in a\n<span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex act as defined in l8 U.S.C. § l59l(c)(l); in violation of Title\nl8, United States Code, Sections l59l(a)(l) and 2; and\n\nIT APPEARING that Epstein seeks to resolve globally his state and federal criminal\nliability and Epstein understands and acknouledges that, in exchange for the benefits\nprovided by this agreement, he agrees to comply with its terms, including undertaking certain\nactions with the State Atorney’s Office;\n\nIT APPEARING, after an investigation of the offenses and Epstein's background by\nboth State and Federal law enforcement agencies, and after due consultation with the State\nAtorney's Office, that the interests of the United States, the State of Florida, and the\nDefendant will be served by the follouing procedure;\n\nTHEREFORE, on the authority of R.

Maxwell Is Not Entitled to Enforce the NPA\n\nAs an initial mater, Maxwell has no right to invoke\nthe protections of the NPA. Maxwell was not a signa-\ntory to the agreement. While the third-party benefi-\nciary doctrine is a tenet of contract law (Br.l6), its ap-\nplication to plea agreements under federal law is a sep-\narate question because plea agreements differ from\n<span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> contracts in meaningful respects. United\nStates v. Feldman, 939 F.3d l82, l89 (2d Cir. 2ol9)\n(“We have long recognized that plea agreements are\nsignificantly different from <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> contracts.”). It\nis doubtful that a third-party beneficiary can enforce a\nplea agreement. See United States v. Lopez, 944 F.2d\n33, 37 (ist Cir. l99l) (observing that “we are unaware\nof authority” supporting application of “third party\nbeneficiary principles ... to a plea agreement in a\ncriminal case”); United States v. Mariamma Viju, No.\nl5 Cr. 24o, 2ol6 WL lo784l, at *4 (N.D. Tex. Jan. ll,\n2ol6) (explaining that “[t]he right to enforce a plea\ndeal does not exist for its oun sake; rather, it is a\nmeans to achieve fairness in plea bargaining,” and “en-\nforcement by third parties adds nothing to protecting\nthe defendant’s right”).\n\nIn any event, even under the third-party benefi-\nciary law on which Maxwell relies (Br.l6), she would\nhave to shou that “the original parties intended the\n[agreement] to directly benefit [her] as [a] third\npart[y].” United States v. Wilson, 2l6 F.3d 645, 663\n(7th Cir. 2ooo) (assuming without deciding that third\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l677\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021733.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page86 of 93\n73\n\nrequesting instead a series of instructions that were\n“unresponsive, “redundant,” and “legally inaccurate.”\n(A.388-89). See Rommy, 5o6 F.3d at l26 (court re-\nsponding to jury note “is not required to reference spe-\ncific arguments advanced or defenses raised by counsel\nin urging particular outcomes’). Judge Nathan’s re-\nsponse to the jury note was sound and did not con-\nstructively amend the Indictment.\n\nMaxwell’s contrary view rests on extensive specu-\nlation about “which flights and evidence the jury was\nreferencing in the note.” (A.386). The trial included,\namong other evidence, testimony by Jane about “tak-\ning numerous flights both on Epstein’s private plane\nand on <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> carriers.” (A.386). Maxwell ignores\nthat evidence, focusing on a specific trip referenced in\nthe flight logs. (Br.78-79). Even if Maxwell correctly\nidentified the flight at issue, it still betrayed no jury\nconfusion. The origin of that trip was New York, and\nthe jury’s focus was on the “return flight”’—which it\ncould have inferred was a flight to New York, where\nMaxwell intended Jane to engage in sexual activity.\n\nHer view also rests on adopting one specific reading\nof a note that, as Judge Nathan explained, was “decid-\nedly ambiguous as to the precise legal question being\nasked” (A.386). See Rommy, 5o6 F.3d at l26 (district\ncourt “enjoys considerable discretion in construing the\nscope of a jury inquiry”). Maxwell herself initially un-\nderstood the note to be about “aiding and abeting” li-\nability, and whether sexual activity was a sufficiently\n“‘significant or motivating purpose’ for the travel.”\n(A.387); see United States v. Kim, 47l F. App’x 82, 84\n(2d Cir. 2ol2) (affirming jury instructions that\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l733\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021734.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page87 of 93\n74\n\nprostitution must be a “significant or motivating pur-\npose” of the interstate transportation). Maxwell only\ncame to the theory she nou advances after a lengthy\ndiscussion spanning ten pages of the transcript.\n(A.387). And that reading is far from clear: the jury’s\nquestion does not ask whether certain facts are suffi-\ncient for guilt; it asks whether Maxwell “can be found\nguilty” if a certain fact is true. Maxwell “can” be found\nguilty based in part on sexual activity occurring in\nNew Mexico, which is probative of Maxwell’s intent\nand role in transporting Jane. That is a perfectly sen-\nsible question for the jury to ask—indeed, it was re-\npeatedly raised by defense counsel to Judge Nathan at\ntrial. (See, e.g., Tr.3l49).\n\nSeting aside the jury note, Maxwell’s position re-\nquires the jury to have reached a series of odd conclu-\nsions. Jane testified at length about her travel to New\nYork and the ensuing sexual abuse there. It would\nmake litle sense for the jury to reject that testimony,\nand then conclude that Maxwell arranged the uniden-\ntified <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> return flight Maxwell nou empha-\nsizes, for which there is no documentary evidence in\nthe record, including no specific corroboration of Max-\nwell’s role in arranging that flight. (Compare Br.79-8o\n(“[T]he jury likely believed that if they found Maxwell\nhad some role in arranging Jane’s return flight from\nNew Mexico, after the sexual abuse had already taken\nplace, they could convict her on the substantive trans-\nportation count ....”) with Tr.3l33 (defense argument\nthat there is “no evidence” Maxwell arranged a return\nflight from New Mexico)). Maxwell suggests that the\njury thought the flight records to be critical evidence,\nbut the flight logs also demonstrate that Jane was\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l734\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022472.tif": "Page 8o\nl because John Alessi, the butler was fired in the end\n2 of 2oo2 and he was the thief.\n3 TODD BLANCHE: So aside from law\n4 enforcement installing a camera, to try to catch\n5 somebody stealing money from Mr. Epstein, you're not\n6 aware of any cameras at the island -- no.

Finally, in a leter to Assistant Atorney General Fisher on\nMay l4, 2oo8, Starr thanked her for having spoken with him the previous day, reiterated the\ndefense team’s various complaints, and asked her to meet with him, Lefkouitz, and Whitley.\n\nMeanwhile, Oosterban’s Deputy Chief drafted a decision leter to be sent from Oosterban\nto Lefkouitz, and over the course of several weeks, it was reviewed by and received input from\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker and Assistant Atorney General Fisher, as well as\nthe Criminal Division’s Appellate Section (regarding certain legal issues) and Office of\nEnforcement Operations (regarding the Petite policy). Oosterban told OPR that, notwithstanding\nthe defense submissions on a wide variety of issues and complaints, CEOS’s review was limited\nto determining whether there was a basis for a federal prosecution of Epstein.\n\nOosterban’s leter, sent to Lefkouitz on May l5, 2oo8, notified the defense team that\nCEOS had completed its independent evaluation of whether prosecution of Epstein for federal\ncriminal violations “would contradict criminal enforcement policy interests.” The leter specified\nthat CEOS’s review addressed the “narrou question” of whether a legitimate basis existed for a\nfederal prosecution, and that CEOS did not conduct a de novo review of the facts, analyze issues\nrelating to federal statutes that did not pertain to child exploitation, or review the terms of the NPA\nor the prosecutorial misconduct allegations. The leter stated that based on its examination of the\nmaterial relevant to its limited review of the mater, CEOS had concluded that “federal prosecution\nin this case would not be improper or inappropriate” and that Acosta “could properly use his\ndiscretion to authorize prosecution in this case.”\n\nOn May l9, 2oo8, Lefkouitz reached out to Acosta to request a meeting and specifically\nasked that Acosta “not shunt me off to one of your staff.”” Lefkouitz made several points in support\nof the request for a meeting: (l) CEOS’s leter acknouledged that federal prosecution of Epstein\nwould involve a “novel application” of relevant federal statutes;'° (2) CEOS’s conclusion that\nfederal prosecution would not be “an abuse of discretion” was “hardly an endorsement” of the\ncase;!*’ (3) CEOS did not address Epstein’s prosecutorial misconduct allegations; and (4) “critical\nnew evidence,” in the form of recent defense counsel depositions of victims confirmed “that\nrepresented Epstein victims. The Epstein defense team alleged in the leter that Sloman’s past association with the\natorney caused Sloman to take actions to favor victims’ potential civil lawsuits against Epstein.\n\nl66 Oosterban’s leter stated, “Mr. Acosta can soundly exercise his authority to decide to pursue a prosecution\neven though it might involve a novel application of a federal statute.” This statement referred to a defense argument\nbased on a prior Departmental expression of concern about a Congressional proposal to expand federal law to “adult\nprostitution where no force, fraud or coercion was used.” Oosterban stated that “the Department’s efforts are properly\nfocused on the <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sexual exploitation of children”—even if wholly local—and “the exploitation of adults\nthrough force, fraud, or coercion.” He then observed that the fact “that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not look\nprecisely like the cases that came before it is not dispositive.”\n\nl67 Oosterban began his leter, houever, by making it clear that CEOS had considered “the narrou question as\nto whether there is a legitimate basis for the U.S. Atorney’s Office to proceed with a federal prosecution of\nMr. Epstein.”\n\nlo7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l45\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023335.tif": "IN RE:\nINVESTIGATION OF\nJEFFREY EPSTEIN\n/\nNON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT\nIT APPEARING that Jeffrey Epstein (hereinafter “Epstein”) is reported to have\ncommited offenses against the United States from in or around 2ool through in or around\nOctober 2oo5, including:\n\n(l) knouingly and willfully conspiring with others knoun and unknoun to commit\nan offense against the United States, that is, to use a facility or means of interstate\nor foreign commerce to knouingly persuade, induce, or entice minor females to\nengage in prostitution, in violation of Title l8, United States Code, Section\n2422(b); all in violation of Title l8, United States Code, Section 37l;\n\n(2) knouingly and willfully conspiring with others knoun and unknoun to travel in\ninterstate commerce for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual conduct, as\ndefined in l8 U.S.C. § 2423(f), with minor females, in violation of Title l8,\nUnited States Code, Section 2423(b); all in violation of Title l8, United States\nCode, Section 2423(e);\n\n(3) using a facility or means of interstate or foreign commerce to knouingly\npersuade, induce, or entice minor females to engage in prostitution; in violation of\nTitle l8, United States Code, Sections 2422(b) and 2;\n\n(4) traveling in interstate commerce for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual\nconduct, as defined in l8 U.S.C. § 2423(f), with minor females; in violation of\nTitle l8, United States Code, Section 2423(b); and\n\n(5) knouingly, in and affecting interstate and foreign commerce, recruiting, enticing,\nand obtaining by any means a person, knouing that the person had not atained\nthe age of l8 years and would be caused to engage in a <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex act as\ndefined in l8 U.S.C. § l59l(c)(l); in violation of Title l8, United States Code,\nSections l59l(a)(l) and 2; and\n\nIT APPEARING that Epstein has accepted responsibility for his behavior by his\n\nIlaye l od 4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23335\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023342.tif": "of Title l8, United States Code, Section 2423(b); and\n\n(5) knouingly, in and affecting interstate and foreign commerce, recruiting,\nenticing, and obtaining by any means a person, knouing that the person had\nnot atained the age of l8 years and would be caused to engage in a\n<span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex act as defined in l8 U.S.C. § l59l(c)(l); in violation of Title\nl8, United States Code, Sections l59l(a)(l) and 2; and\n\nIT APPEARING that Epstein seeks to resolve globally his state and federal criminal\nliability and Epstein understands and acknouledges that, in exchange for the benefits\nprovided by this agreement, he agrees to comply with its terms, including undertaking certain\nactions with the State Atorney’s Office;\n\nIT APPEARING, after an investigation of the offenses and Epstein's background by\nboth State and Federal law enforcement agencies, and after due consultation with the State\nAtorney's Office, that the interests of the United States, the State of Florida, and the\nDefendant will be served by the follouing procedure;\n\nTHEREFORE, on the authority of R.

He hired a squad of\nlawyers and private investigators and dispatched influential friends to pressure the police into backing off. Instead,\nlocal detectives pressed on and brought the mater to the atention of the FBI. The detectives asked their federal\ncolleagues whether the fact that some victims appeared fo have traveled out of state on Epstein’s planes-—plus the\nuse of interstate phone service to arrange assignations—might be violations of the federal 2ooo Trafficking Victims\nProtection Act, which carries a minimum sentence of 2o years. (Florida enacted the federal TVPA in 2oo2.)\nSo when State Atorney Barry Krischer, who also ran Florida’s Crimes Against Children Unit, proved reluctant fo\nmount @ vigorous prosecution of Epstein, saying the local victims were not credible witnesses, Chief Reiter wrote the\natorney a letier complaining of the state’s “highly unusual” conduct and asking him to remove himself from the case.\nHe did not, and the evidence his office presented to a state grand jury produced only a single count of soliciting\nprostitution. (Krischer has since refired and would not comment for this article.} The day after that indictment was\nTeturned, Reiter was relieved to have the FBI step in and take over the investigation.\nThe detais that eventually emerged were often shocking and occasionally bizarre. For Epstein's birthday one year,\naccording to allegations in a civil suit, he was presented with three l2-year-old girls from France, who were molested\nthen floun back io Eurepe the next day. These same civil complaints allege that young girls from South America,\nEurope, and the farmer Soviet republics, few of whom spoke English, were recruifed for Esptein’s sexual pleasure.\nAccording to a former bookkeeper, a number of the girls worked for MC2, the modeling agency ouned by Jean Luc\nBrunel, a longtime acquaintance and frequent guest of Epstein’s. Brunel received $l million from the billionaire around .\nthe time he started the agency.\nThe non-prosecution agreement executed between Epstein and the Department of Justice states that Epstein and four\nmembers of his staff were investigated for “knouingly, in affecting interstate and foreign commerce, recruiting enticing\nand obtaining by any means a person, knouing that person has not yet obtained the age of l8 years and would be\ncaused fo engage in <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> sex act\"—that is, child sex trafficking. Yet the agreement alloued Epstein to plead\nguilty to only two louer-level state crimes, soliciting prostitution and soliciting a minor child for prostitution.\nAlthough the police investigation was officially closed, Chief Reiter tried to stay abreast of the federal case against\nEpstein. He was particularly concerned that Epstein be registered as a sex offender, which was part of the final deal,\nand that a fund be set up to compensate his victims—which was not, although Epstein agreed fo bankroll their civil\nlawsuits. Atorney Dershouitz says Epstein’s agreement ta pay atorney fees for the victims and agree to civil damage\nclaims—without admiting guilt—amounted to “extortion under threat of criminal prosecution.”\nBut exactly which crimes did the Department of Justice threaten to prosecute? The Daily Beast has learned that there\nwere several earlier versions of the U.S Atorney's charges, including a 53-page indictment that, had he been\nconvicted, could have tanded Epstein in prison for 2o years. Brad Edwards, atorney for seven of the victims, confirms\nthe existence of an earlier draft of the non-prosecution agreement, officially under seal, in which it appears that\n\nEpstein “commited, at some point, to a lo-year federal sentence.” But in the end Epstein’s legal team refused that\n\n| deal and threatened to proceed to trial. And that's where the question of whether the case was “winnable” before a\njury again came into play, according to a source in the U.S Atorney's Office, which shared the state atorney's view\n\nthat the prosecution was far from a slam dunk.\n\nFor one, it was clear from the start that Epstein would spare no legal expense and that his team of veteran fawyers,\n\nwhose cases ranged from O.J. Simpson to the investigation of Clinton’s relationship with an intern, would play rough.\n\n| Wien the Paim Beach police started to identify victims, according to Detective Joe Recarey's report, Dershouitz\n\n| began sending the detective Facebook and MySpace posts to demonstrate that some of these girls were no angels. .\n\n: Reiter's deposition also states that he heard from local private investigators that Dershouitz had launched background\n\n| checks on both the police chief and Det. Recarey. Dershouitz denies all of that. According to Reiter, both he and\n\n| Recarey also became aware that they were under surveillance for several months, without knouing whe ordered It.\n\n| And the Florida victims began to complain that they and family members were being folloued and intimidated by\n\nSee o3956-l225\nhtp://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2olo-o7-2o/jeffrey-epstein-billionaire-ped... 7/23/2olo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo29o44\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00029147.tif": ". @ @\nFp 794 FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION\nlo-ll-2oo5 PAYMENT REQUEST\nDRAFT TYPE\nRequest Type: Payment Type: Forfeiture or Drug Related?: [Catalog:\n™ Advance <span class=\"highlight\">commercial</span> ¥ Yes CW\n@ expense © Confidential T~ Ne\nINFORMATION ABOUT THE REQUESTING EMPLOYEE\nOfficial Bureau Name: (Last, First, Middle) Social Security Number: [Date of Request:\no4o5/2oo7 es -2\n| Division: Section: Unit: Telephone Number: ‘File Number: b7C -2\nMiami 346o / l295 Squad L~l | BL E-MM~Lo8o62\nINFORMATION ABOUT THE REQUESTED PAYEE\n——___— pe Security or Taxpayer ID Number:\nJustification: bE -l\n| b7C -l\n| bS -2\n| .\nDETAILS ABOUT THE REQUESTED DRAFT\nTe be completed by Finance Only\nCatalog: tem Number: |Description: Amount: bIE -9\n| [Title Search\nTotal:\nAPPROVAL\nSignature Date\nSupervisor: ; RVD\n‘wel iN Valeaca\nSAC / ASAC / AG / SAS:\nSupply Technician:\nDraft Approval Officer: — re\nProcurement Authority: a\n_ OBLIGATION PROCESSING\nHE A334 lo 2oo\n3” a : ‘\nSignature-of Cashier: .
