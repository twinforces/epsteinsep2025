Rather than\nwait a short time until residents of counties constituting the Manhatan Division of this District\ncould appear for grand jury service, the government, in its apparent determination to mark the\n<span class=\"highlight\">anniversary</span> of its indictment of Jeffrey Epstein with a July 2, 2o2o announcement of the\nindictment and arrest of Ghislaine Maxwell, sought and obtained an indictment of Ms. Maxwell\nthrough a grand jury drawn from the White Plains Division. In doing so, the government\nprocured Ms. Maxwell’s indictment using a grand jury pool that excluded residents of the\ncommunity in which Ms. Maxwell allegedly commited the offenses with which she is charged,\nand in which she will be tried, in favor of a grand jury drawn from a community in which Black\nand Hispanic residents are significantly underrepresented by comparison. The government thus\nviolated Ms. Maxwell’s Sixth Amendment right to be indicted by a grand jury drawn from a fair-\ncross section of the community.!\n\nIt was unnecessary for the government to take this step. According to an email from a\ncourt official filed in connection with a similar challenge to the government’s practice, a\nManhatan grand jury was seated as early as June 25, 2o2o—four days before Ms. Maxwell was\nindicted. See Exhibit A to Reply Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss, U.S. v. Balde,\nNo. l:2o-cr-oo28l-KPF (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No. 7o-l (filed Dec. 23, 2o2o). Had the government\nwaited until that time, it might have been unable to meet its arbitrary July 2 deadline, and its\npress conference touting the indictment and arrest of Ms. Maxwell might have had slightly less\n' The fact that Ms. Maxwell herself is neither Black nor Hispanic does not deprive of her of standing to raise this\nchallenge. “[T]he Sixth Amendment entitles every defendant to object to a venire that is not designed to represent a\nfair cross section of the community, whether or not the systematically excluded groups are groups to which he\nhimself belongs.” Holland v. Hlinois, 493 U.S. 474, 477 (l99o).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2324", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002331.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl26 Filed ol/25/2l Page ll of l3\n\nThus, regardless of whether the White Plains qualified jury wheel is compared to the\neligible juror population of the Manhatan Division or that of the entire District, Black and\nHispanic jurors are systematically underrepresented. Ms. Maxwell has therefore made a prima\nfacie shouing of a violation of the fair cross-section requirement.\n\nAccordingly, the government has the burden of shouing that atainment of a fair cross-\nsection would have been incompatible with a significant state interest. The government cannot\ndo so. To the extent that the government asserts a significant state interest in containing\nCOVID-l9, it cannot shou that atainment of a fair cross-section would have been incompatible\nwith that interest. As noted above, a Manhatan grand jury convened as early as June 25, 2o2o;\nthere appears to have been no reason, other than a publicity-driven desire to arrest Ms. Maxwell\non the <span class=\"highlight\">anniversary</span> of the Epstein indictment, why the government could not have waited until\nthat time. The indictment therefore violates Ms. Maxwell’s Sixth Amendment right and should\nbe dismissed.\n\nDated: January 25, 2o2l\nNew York, New York\nRespectfully submited,\n/s/ Mark. S. Cohen\nMark S.

Only at this time did the government, according to its oun account, decide to\nlaunch an investigation of Ms. Maxwell and prosecute her on allegations that it had previously,\nrepeatedly (and properly, since any charges would have been baseless) determined did not merit\ncharges. In short, the government’s response to the media frenzy was not to adhere to its earlier\nobjective analysis and consideration of the facts, but to feed the frenzy and substitute Ms.\nMaxwell for Epstein.\n\nThus, the government announced its arrest and indictment of Ms. Maxwell on July 2,\n2o2o, the exact <span class=\"highlight\">anniversary</span> of Epstein’s indictment. At an extraordinary press conference, the\nUnited States Atorney for this District described Ms. Maxwell’s prosecution as the “prequel” to\nthe Epstein indictment; thereafter, the then-Atorney General, in rare public comments on bail\nproceedings in an individual case, expressed his delight that “we were able to get Miss\nMaxwell.”\n\nBut in trying “to get” Ms. Maxwell, the government compromised its standards, cut\ncorners, and exceeded its authority under the law. This is shoun in the present motion and\nothers we are filing today, and includes the follouing:\n\n* The government has pressed forward with this case even though the NPA expressly\nprovides that “the United States .. . will not institute any criminal charges against any\npotential co-conspirators of Epstein.” Rather than argue, as it has time and again, that\nsuch agreements should be construed as drafted, the government does the opposite\nhere, retreating from the very agreement that its oun agents negotiated and agreed to\nwith the approval of senior levels of Main Justice.\n\n* The government has concocted a federal Mann Act case against Ms. Maxwell by\nalleging that, on some unspecified occasion during a four-year period between l994\nand l997, and in an unspecified manner, she somehou transported and caused a\nsingle individual to travel across state lines for purposes of engaging in unlawful\nsexual activity with Epstein. Those charges, in turn, require the government to allege\na violation of New York law relating to sexual activity. Here, the government has\nrelied upon an alleged class B misdemeanor that, if the state statute of limitations had\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo258o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002581.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 9 of 38\nnot expired, would be punishable by up to three months in prison — /ess time than Ms.\nMaxwell has already spent in pretrial detention. Yet, here, that misdemeanor has\nbeen set up as the basis for federal charges for which the government seeks to impose\nyears of imprisonment, if not the equivalent of a life term. Not only is this troubling\nin approach, but even the pieced-together Mann Act charges are time-barred under\nthe applicable statute of limitations.\n\n* Inseeking and obtaining confidential materials from pending civil litigation against\nMs. Maxwell, including the deposition transcripts that form the basis of the two\nperjury counts in the indictment, the government a\n\n* The government has based the two counts of perjury on poorly worded questions that\nwere immaterial to the defamation case in which the depositions were taken, and has\nimproperly joined those counts to the Mann Act charges, as addressed in today’s\nmotions to dismiss and to sever those counts.\n\n* In an effort to allou other accusers to testify against Ms. Maxwell, the government\nhas added two conspiracy counts and, as alleged “‘overt acts” in furtherance of a\npurported conspiracy to cause minors to travel, has tacked on allegations from two\nother accusers—one of whom is not alleged to have traveled at all (and who was\nabove the legal age of consent in England, where the alleged conduct took place).\n\n¢ [nits rush to arrest Ms. Maxwell on the <span class=\"highlight\">anniversary</span> of Epstein’s indictment and\nmaximize the announcement’s appeal to the media, the government indicted Ms.\nMaxwell using a White Plains grand jury, thereby violating Ms. Maxwell’s right to a\ngrand jury drawn from a fair cross-section of the community.\n\n* Finally, the government has charged multiplicitous conspiracy counts based on\nidentical conduct, failed to disclose the names of the accusing witnesses or provide\nspecific facts in the indictment that would permit Ms. Maxwell to adequately prepare\nfor trial, and impermissibly delayed bringing this prosecution for 25 years in violation\nof Ms. Maxwell’s due process rights.\n\nThe hue and cry against Ms. Maxwell is unprecedented in both scale and severity. Under\nour system of justice, the need for the Court’s careful scrutiny of the government’s conduct, and\nfor the protection of the constitutional rights of a defendant facing the equivalent of a life\nsentence, is at its highest. This case is not about “geting” Ms. Maxwell (or any other\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo258l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003160.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 226 of 239\navailable grand jury that day, due to the global pandemic®*—“was a deviation from the established\npractice of indicting defendants in the division where the offense is alleged to have occurred and\nwhere the case will be tried.” (Def.

Beginning on or about June 25, 2o2o, grand jury\nquorums returned in Manhatan, but with substantially less availability than before the pandemic.\nAs a result, the Government has sought indictments from grand juries siting in White Plains and\nManhatan, as availability permits. In this instance, the Government was prepared to indict on\nJune 29, 2o2o, and the only grand jury available in this District on that day sat in White Plains.\nThe global pandemic’s effect on grand jury availability continues to evolve, but at no point have\ngrand juries in White Plains or Manhatan resumed normal activity.\n\nThe defendant speculates that the Government sought an indictment on June 29, 2o2o\nbecause of some arbitrary desire to arrest the defendant on July 2, 2o2o, one year to the day after\na grand jury returned a sealed indictment charging Jeffrey Epstein with federal crimes on July 2,\n2ol9. (See, e.g., Def. Mot. 9 at l, 8). Seting aside the silliness of marking the <span class=\"highlight\">anniversary</span> of an\nindictment’s return, as opposed to the <span class=\"highlight\">anniversary</span> of the arrest itself, which took place on July 6,\n2ol9, there is no reality in the defense’s conspiracy theories.

While Ms.\nMaxwell was understandably not in the habit of volunteering her whereabouts given the\nintensity of the press atention, her counsel would have provided that information had the\ngovernment asked for it. The government never did.\n\n3. Ms. Maxwell Did Not Try to Avoid Arrest, Nor Was She “Good At”\nHiding\n\nSimilarly, had the government reached out to defense counsel before Ms. Maxwell’s\narrest, we would have willingly arranged for her self-surrender. We were never given that\nchance. Instead, the government arrested her in a totally unnecessary early morning raid\nwith multiple federal agents at her residence in New Hampshire, on the eve of the one-year\n<span class=\"highlight\">anniversary</span> of the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein, creating the misimpression that Ms. Maxwell\nwas hiding from them. That is simply not the case.\n\nThe government argued that the events of Ms. Maxwell’s arrest—in particular, that\nshe moved herself into an interior room when the officers approached the house and that\nthey found a cell phone wrapped in tin foil—evidence an atempt to evade law enforcement.\n(Tr. 32-34). As we previously explained to the Court, Ms. Maxwell was protecting herself\nfrom the press, not trying to avoid arrest. (Tr. 54-57).\n\nSince the hearing, we have obtained the accompanying statement from El\n| the head of the security company guarding Ms. Maxwell at the time of her arrest,\nwhich was not available at the time of the initial hearing. (Ex. S). Es statement\ndemonstrates that Ms. Maxwell was not avoiding arrest, but was follouing an agreed-upon\nprocedure to protect herself in the event of a potential threat to her safety or security.\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo43", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021074.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page27 of ll3\n\nThe Government announced its arrest of Maxwell on July 2, 2o2o, the\n<span class=\"highlight\">anniversary</span> of Epstein’s indictment. From that day, Maxwell was held in solitary\nconfinement in the Brooklyn Detention Center. As COVID raged, the District\nCourt denied four bail applications and dozens of applications to ameliorate\nMaxwell’s deplorable conditions of confinement. By the time of trial, Maxwell\nwas so disoriented and diminished that she was unable meaningfully to assist in her\noun defense, much less to testify.\n\nAs trial approached, the vilification of Maxwell was unprecedented in both\nscale and severity. The bipartisan political pressure to obtain a conviction was\nenormous. Judge Nathan refused to apply the NPA to Maxwell in accordance with\nits terms and refused to dismiss the case as time-barred. She precluded Maxwell\nfrom presenting a meaningful defense by excluding evidence and argument that\nwas central to her defense, such as the NPA, the 2oo6 FBI investigation, the terms\nof the VCP, and the direct involvement of the complainants’ civil atorneys in both\nthe VCP and the Government’s investigation.\n\nThe trial itself involved the testimony of four women, three of whom (Jane,\nKate, and Carolyn), were permited to testify under pseudonyms. The result\ntransformed the trial into a form of Kabuki theater designed to remind the jury at\nevery turn that these adult women were being protected because their privacy\ninterests, and not Maxwell’s constitutional right to a public trial, were paramount.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo74"};
