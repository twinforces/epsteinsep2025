Transcript of September ll, 2o2o Status\nConference at 43-44.! The Court nevertheless found that it did not have any conditions available\nthat could reasonably assure Mr. Robertson’s appearance or the safety of the community given his\nfailure to comply with conditions of release in the past. Jd. at 44-45. The Court also noted that\nwhile it was concerned about Mr. Robertson’s ability to meet with his atorneys to prepare for trial\nduring the pandemic, it had been informed that the defense team would be able to meet in\nconference rooms in the federal courthouse in <span class=\"highlight\">Albuquerque</span>.

The government opposes the requested reconsideration. Doc. 282.\n\nDISCUSSION\nl. Reconsideration is Proper on the Basis of New Evidence Previously Unavailable.\n\nAs an initial mater, Mr. Robertson has raised legitimate reasons for the Court to reconsider\nits earlier release decision. As the Court has previously explained, it is well-established in this\nCircuit that although the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure do not expressly authorize a motion\nfor reconsideration, such motions are proper in criminal cases. See United States v. Christy, 739\nF.3d 534, 539 (loth Cir. 2ol4). A district court thus may amend its interlocutory orders prior to\nentry of final judgment. See, e.g., Van Skiver v. United States, 952 F.2d l24l, l243 (loth Cir.\n' All references to the transcript are to the draft copy.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool294\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001295.jpg": "Gaseel2l\\7/oroo 2artauivient DocumMdil B62 Fileth662o6/PhgPaye & 6656\n\nl99l) (“The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not recognize a ‘motion to reconsider.’ Instead,\nthe rules allou a litigant subject to an adverse judgment to file either a motion to alter or amend\nthe judgment... or a motion seeking relief from the judgment.”); Trujillo v. Bd. of Educ. of\n<span class=\"highlight\">Albuquerque</span> Pub. Sch., 2l2 F. App’x 76o, 765 (loth Cir. 2oo7) (unpublished) (“A district court\nhas discretion to revise interlocutory orders prior to entry of final judgment.”). Hence, “[w]hen a\nparty seeks to obtain reconsideration of a non-final order, the motion is considered ‘an\ninterlocutory motion invoking the district court’s general discretionary authority to review and\nrevise interlocutory rulings prior to entry of final judgment.’” Wagner Equip. Co. v. Wood, 289\nF.R.D. 347, 349 (D.N.M. 2ol3) (quoting Wagoner v. Wagoner, 938 F.2d ll2o, ll22 n.l (loth Cir.\nl99l)). The Court’s authority, then, is sustained by the pragmatic reality that a “district court\nshould have the opportunity to correct alleged errors in its dispositions.” Christy, 739 F.3d at 539.\nConsequently, the district court enjoys “considerable discretion in ruling on a motion to\nreconsider.” Federated Touing & Recovery, LLC v. Praetorian Ins. Co., 283 F.R.D. 644, 65l\n(D.N.M. 2ol2) (citing Phelps v. Hamilton, l22 F.3d l3o9, l324 (loth Cir. l997)).\n\nThe scope of reconsideration, houever, is narrouly cabined and far more limited than in\nan ordinary appeal. That is, a motion to reconsider is an “inappropriate vehicle[] to reargue an\nissue previously addressed by the court when the motion merely advances new arguments, or\nsupporting facts which were available at the time of the original motion.” Servants of Paraclete\nv. Does, 2o4 F.3d loo5, lol2 (loth Cir. 2ooo) (citation omited). Rather, “[g]rounds warranting\na motion to reconsider include (l) an intervening change in the controlling law, (2) new evidence\npreviously unavailable, and (3) the need to correct clear error or prevent manifest injustice.” Jd.\n\nHere, several pieces of previously unavailable evidence justify the request for\nreconsideration. Servants of Paraclete, 2o4 F.3d at lol2. First, when the Court denied Mr.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool295\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001296.jpg": "CGaseel2l\\7/oroo 2artauivent Documdil B62 Fileeh662o6/PhgPage & 6656\nRobertson release in September of last year, it believed that he would only remain in pretrial\ndetention for three additional months until a December 7, 2o2o trial date. Doc. l94. As bad as\nthe pandemic had been to that point, the Court did not expect the federal judiciary to remain in a\nstate of near total suspension for another six months, requiring the trial to be continued twice more\nto the current April 5, 2o2l trial date. Second, when the Court denied Mr. Robertson release last\nSeptember, it was under the impression that he would be able to meet with his atorneys in person\nin conference rooms at the <span class=\"highlight\">Albuquerque</span> courthouse, mitigating the Court’s concerns about the\ndefense team’s ability to effectively prepare for trial. See supra at 4. The Court’s impression on\nthat point turned out to be incorrect: due to concerns about inmates meeting with atorneys and\nthen bringing COVID-l9 back into the jails, the idea of unrestricted atorney-client meetings at\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">Albuquerque</span> courthouse was ultimately rejected. Third, the Court is nou able to impose\nsignificantly stricter conditions of release because of its ability to release Mr. Robertson to La\nPasada Halfway House, an option with which it was not presented last September.\n\nI. Mr. Robertson’s Release to La Pasada Halfway House Under Extremely Strict\nand Carefully Tailored Conditions Will Reasonably Assure His Appearance and\nthe Safety of the Community Under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e).\n\nOn the merits, the Court has thoroughly considered the parties’ arguments, the UPSO’s\nrecommendations, Mr. Robertson’s Form l3 Presentence Investigation Report (PSR) and the\ninformation contained therein about his criminal history and prior performance on release, and the\napplicable law.

Transcript of September ll, 2o2o Status\nConference at 43-44.! The Court nevertheless found that it did not have any conditions available\nthat could reasonably assure Mr. Robertson’s appearance or the safety of the community given his\nfailure to comply with conditions of release in the past. Jd. at 44-45. The Court also noted that\nwhile it was concerned about Mr. Robertson’s ability to meet with his atorneys to prepare for trial\nduring the pandemic, it had been informed that the defense team would be able to meet in\nconference rooms in the federal courthouse in <span class=\"highlight\">Albuquerque</span>.

The government opposes the requested reconsideration. Doc. 282.\n\nDISCUSSION\nl. Reconsideration is Proper on the Basis of New Evidence Previously Unavailable.\n\nAs an initial mater, Mr. Robertson has raised legitimate reasons for the Court to reconsider\nits earlier release decision. As the Court has previously explained, it is well-established in this\nCircuit that although the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure do not expressly authorize a motion\nfor reconsideration, such motions are proper in criminal cases. See United States v. Christy, 739\nF.3d 534, 539 (loth Cir. 2ol4). A district court thus may amend its interlocutory orders prior to\nentry of final judgment. See, e.g., Van Skiver v. United States, 952 F.2d l24l, l243 (loth Cir.\n' All references to the transcript are to the draft copy.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020213.jpg": "Cass4 :27-o8,o284orMMt DoesuteAt BO l FROG O22o6/2ag Fades 6l6\n\nl99l) (“The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not recognize a ‘motion to reconsider.’ Instead,\nthe rules allou a litigant subject to an adverse judgment to file either a motion to alter or amend\nthe judgment... or a motion seeking relief from the judgment.”); Trujillo v. Bd. of Educ. of\n<span class=\"highlight\">Albuquerque</span> Pub. Sch., 2l2 F. App’x 76o, 765 (loth Cir. 2oo7) (unpublished) (“A district court\nhas discretion to revise interlocutory orders prior to entry of final judgment.”). Hence, “[w]hen a\nparty seeks to obtain reconsideration of a non-final order, the motion is considered ‘an\ninterlocutory motion invoking the district court’s general discretionary authority to review and\nrevise interlocutory rulings prior to entry of final judgment.’” Wagner Equip. Co. v. Wood, 289\nF.R.D. 347, 349 (D.N.M. 2ol3) (quoting Wagoner v. Wagoner, 938 F.2d ll2o, ll22 n.l (loth Cir.\nl99l)). The Court’s authority, then, is sustained by the pragmatic reality that a “district court\nshould have the opportunity to correct alleged errors in its dispositions.” Christy, 739 F.3d at 539.\nConsequently, the district court enjoys “considerable discretion in ruling on a motion to\nreconsider.” Federated Touing & Recovery, LLC v. Praetorian Ins. Co., 283 F.R.D. 644, 65l\n(D.N.M. 2ol2) (citing Phelps v. Hamilton, l22 F.3d l3o9, l324 (loth Cir. l997)).\n\nThe scope of reconsideration, houever, is narrouly cabined and far more limited than in\nan ordinary appeal. That is, a motion to reconsider is an “inappropriate vehicle[] to reargue an\nissue previously addressed by the court when the motion merely advances new arguments, or\nsupporting facts which were available at the time of the original motion.” Servants of Paraclete\nv. Does, 2o4 F.3d loo5, lol2 (loth Cir. 2ooo) (citation omited). Rather, “[g]rounds warranting\na motion to reconsider include (l) an intervening change in the controlling law, (2) new evidence\npreviously unavailable, and (3) the need to correct clear error or prevent manifest injustice.” Jd.\n\nHere, several pieces of previously unavailable evidence justify the request for\nreconsideration. Servants of Paraclete, 2o4 F.3d at lol2. First, when the Court denied Mr.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020214.jpg": "Casse :27-o8,o284orMMt DoesumePAtl BOR l FROG O22o6 24g Aagee t6l6\nRobertson release in September of last year, it believed that he would only remain in pretrial\ndetention for three additional months until a December 7, 2o2o trial date. Doc. l94. As bad as\nthe pandemic had been to that point, the Court did not expect the federal judiciary to remain in a\nstate of near total suspension for another six months, requiring the trial to be continued twice more\nto the current April 5, 2o2l trial date. Second, when the Court denied Mr. Robertson release last\nSeptember, it was under the impression that he would be able to meet with his atorneys in person\nin conference rooms at the <span class=\"highlight\">Albuquerque</span> courthouse, mitigating the Court’s concerns about the\ndefense team’s ability to effectively prepare for trial. See supra at 4. The Court’s impression on\nthat point turned out to be incorrect: due to concerns about inmates meeting with atorneys and\nthen bringing COVID-l9 back into the jails, the idea of unrestricted atorney-client meetings at\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">Albuquerque</span> courthouse was ultimately rejected. Third, the Court is nou able to impose\nsignificantly stricter conditions of release because of its ability to release Mr. Robertson to La\nPasada Halfway House, an option with which it was not presented last September.\n\nI. Mr. Robertson’s Release to La Pasada Halfway House Under Extremely Strict\nand Carefully Tailored Conditions Will Reasonably Assure His Appearance and\nthe Safety of the Community Under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e).\n\nOn the merits, the Court has thoroughly considered the parties’ arguments, the UPSO’s\nrecommendations, Mr. Robertson’s Form l3 Presentence Investigation Report (PSR) and the\ninformation contained therein about his criminal history and prior performance on release, and the\napplicable law. Although the government’s concerns are understandable, the Court ultimately\nbelieves that it can reasonably assure Mr. Robertson’s appearance and the safety of the community\nby releasing him to La Pasada Halfway House under a number of extremely strict and carefully\ntailored conditions.\n\nUnder l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e), a defendant must be released pending trial unless, after a\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00028719.jpg": "o8:o8 PQH API/HIT DATA o428l4\n------ QUERY ----- LNE TERM/\nNAME DOB DATE TIME AGN RSLT TYP REF LANE API\nEPSTEIN, JEFFREY E ol2o53 o3l7l4 oooo API R\nXXX -UNKNOWN AIRPORT (USED O DOC: 4699ll7o7 US P INSP: APIS QRY\nAPI DATA ----\nINDICATOR : R REPORTED\nCARRIER CODE : *GA GENERAL AVIATION\nFLT/VES NUMBER : N2l2JE\nARRIVAL LOCATION : XXX UNKNOWN AIRPORT (USED ON\nDEPARTURE LOCATION : ABQ <span class=\"highlight\">ALBUQUERQUE</span>\nTRANSMITTED BY : APGAS88J GENERAL AVIATION\nINBOUND/OUTBOUND  : OUTBOUND\n(b) (7) (E) (b) (7) (E)\nKey:\n*A - (b) (7) (E)\n*B - (b) (6), (b) (7) (C)\n*C - (b) (7) (E)\n*D - (b) (7) (E)\nDOJ-OGR-ooo287l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00031201.jpg": "<span class=\"highlight\">Albuquerque</span> Tribune Online Page l of 28\n| [x] <span class=\"highlight\">Albuquerque</span> Tribune SEARCH <span class=\"highlight\">ALBUQUERQUE</span>\n| CONTACT US New Mexico, U.S.A.\n\nHELP Cee 2\nCBUBSCRIBE pees a8\n| al\n-TrIg HOME ~|—~ | RICHARDSON'S CAMPAIGN\nion ps CONTRIBUTIONS\nCOB SEARCH\n[IMORTGAGES :\nCronus The top donations to gov. elect Bill\nrime Richardson's campaign came from:\n(OLOTTERY .\nCOPERSONALS l.
