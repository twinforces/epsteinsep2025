Stat.\n\n§ 796.o7), then pending in the State of Florida and to an additional state felony charge (not\npreviously charged or required by the State) of violating Fla. Stat. § 796.o3 (Case No. 2oo8-CF-\n938lAXX), a charge requiring registration as a sex offender. Mr. Epstein complied with all of\nhis obligations under the NPA.\n\nContrary to the government’s argument, the NPA was not limited to a “list of several\ndozen victims identified in the prior investigation ... .” Gov’t Bail Leter at 6-7. Indeed, the\nNPA contains no “list of several dozen victims” and regardless, the NPA immunized Mr. Epstein\nfrom prosecution “for the offenses set out on pages | and 2 of this Agreement,” allegedly\ncommited between 2ool-o7, as well as “any offenses that arose from the Federal Grand Jury\ninvestigation.” NPA at 2 (emphasis added). Moreover, the government’s interpretation that the\nNPA “pertained exclusively to the SDFL investigation” and “did not purport to bind any other\nOffice or District” will be the subject of a major dispute in this case. This is especially so\nbecause Mr. Epstein’s alleged conduct at his Palm Beach residence features prominently in the\nconspiracy count (Count l, 94 l4-l9, § 22.a, d, f) and is incorporated by <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> in the\nsubstantive charge (Count 2, ¥ 23).\n\nBeyond that, Mr. Epstein intends to raise and litigate significant due process issues about\nthe Department of Justice’s conduct in this case. Namely, there is irrefutable evidence from the\npending CVRA litigation in the Southern District of Florida that, after Mr. Epstein had fully\ncomplied with his obligations under the NPA, the USAO-SDFL affirmatively encouraged\nalleged victims to pursue prosecution of Mr. Epstein in other districts, in violation of the DOJ’s\ncommitment to a “global” resolution. See Exhibit 2, at 8-l2. The United States Atorney for the\nSouthern District of Florida, along with supervisory and line prosecutors from the USAO-SDFL,\ncorresponded on multiple occasions with, and personally conferred with, alleged victims and\ntheir lawyers to entertain discussions about the alleged victims’ desire to have Mr. Epstein\nprosecuted on federal charges. See id. at 9. Further, the Southern District of New York is likely\nrelying upon physical evidence seized in connection with the prior investigation, see Gov’t Bail\nLeter at 6 (discussing “corroborating evidence,” including “contemporaneous notes, messages . .\n., and call records”). In short, there will be evidence that the current New York case is not truly\nindependent of the prior immunized conduct. The evidence will shou that Mr. Epstein’s\nreasonable expectation that the NPA would “resolve globally [Mr. Epstein’s] state and federal\ncriminal liability” in exchange for Mr. Epstein’s compliance with the duties and obligations in\nthe NPA — which he fully performed — has been unconstitutionally undermined by the\ngovernment’s efforts to minimize the potential consequences of a CVRA conferral violation (one\nthat neither the government nor defense believes occurred but that was found to have occurred in\nthe CVRA litigation which is pending a decision on remedies) by returning an inextricably\nintertwined second federal prosecution just as the District Court in Florida is receiving\nsubmissions on remedy.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo28l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000341.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll Filed o7/l2/l9 Page l3 of l4\nHonorable Richard M.

Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o, 672 (2d Cir. l985) (per\ncuriam)). Moreover, any references in an NPA to the “Government” or the “United States” do not\nabrogate these principles. Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672 (“[A] plea agreement whereby a federal\nprosecutor agrees that ‘the Government’ will dismiss counts of an indictment . . . might be thought\nto bar the United States from reprosecuting the dismissed charges in any judicial district unless the\nagreement expressly limits the scope of the agreement . . . . Houever, the law has evolved to the\ncontrary.”). “The mere use of the term ‘government’ in the plea agreement does not create an\naffirmative appearance that the agreement contemplated barring districts other than the particular\ndistrict entering into the agreement.” United States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88, l2o (2d Cir. l998)\n(citations and internal quotation marks omited); see also United States v. Broun, No. 99-l23o,\n2oo2 WL 34244994, at *2 (2d Cir. Apr. 26, 2oo2) (in analyzing an SDFL plea agreement,\nreiterating the holding of Annabi and noting that it applies “even if the plea agreement purports to\nbind ‘the Government” or the “United States”) (summary order); United States v. Bruno, l59 F.\nSupp. 3d 3ll, 32l (E.D.N.Y. 2ol6) (“The Court disagrees with Defendant’s argument that the\nphrase ‘United States’ shous an intent to bind all United States Atorney’s Offices. Rather, the\nplea agreement covers only Defendant’s liability in the SDFL.”). ®\nIn sum, this issue is a distraction that has litle relevance to the bail determination and does\nnothing to address the defendant’s risk of flight or mitigate the danger he poses to the community.\nB. The Defendant Wrongly Argues the Statute Does Not Apply to His Sex Trafficking\nNext, the defendant wrongly argues that the “principal conduct” giving rise to the charges\nis his payment of underage girls for sex acts, and that such conduct could not possibly fall under\nthe charged statutes. As the defendant implicitly concedes, Release Motion at l4, this is an issue\nfor a motion to dismiss. Nevertheless, the defendant’s argument is incorrect for two reasons.\nFirst, although the defendant undoubtedly participated on the demand side of the crime, he\nwas also instrumental on the supply side given his role in recruiting and causing others to recruit\nadditional victims. He organized, funded, and perpetuated a sex trafficking scheme in two states,\nincluding with co-conspirators. The fact that he did so for his oun eventual and frequent sexual\ngratification does not vitiate his role in enticing and recruiting victims, consistent with the elements\nof the offense with which he is charged. The defendant was the leader of a sex-trafficking\nenterprise, not a mere consumer.\n’ This analysis similarly extends to a non-prosecution agreement. See United States v. Laskou,\n688 F. Supp. 85l, 854 (E.D.N.Y. l988) (“Defendant’s argument, in effect, is that unless there is\nan explicit statement to the contrary, it is presumed that a non-prosecution agreement binds offices\nof the United States Atorney that are not parties to the agreement. This position is at odds with\nthe law in this Circuit, which presumes a narrou reading of the boundaries of a plea agreement\nunless a defendant can affirmatively establish that a more expansive interpretation was\ncontemplated.”) (citing Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672).\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo34l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000350.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page8oflo\n\nHonorable Henry Pitman\n\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n\nJuly 8, 2ol9\n\nPage 8\nmerely reduce his head start should he decide to flee. See United States v. Zarger, No. oo Cr. 773,\n2ooo WL ll34364, at *l (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ooo) (Gleeson, J.) (rejecting defendant’s application\nfor bail in part because home detention with electronic monitoring “at best . . . limits a fleeing\ndefendant’s head start”); see also United States v.

Benatar, No. o2 Cr. o99, 2oo2 WL 3l4lo262, at *3 (E.D.N.Y.\nOct. lo, 2oo2) (same).\n\nFinally, there can be litle doubt that the defendant is in a position to abandon millions of\ndollars in cash and property securing any potential bond and still live comfortably for the rest of\nhis life. These resources, and the ease with which the defendant could flee and live outside the\nreach of law enforcement—particularly considering his vast wealth and lack of meaningful ties to\nthis District—make the risk of flight exceptionally high in this case, particularly when considered\nin conjunction with the strength of the government’s case and the lengthy sentence the defendant\ncould receive if convicted.\n\nB. The Defendant Poses a Risk of Danger to the Community and of Engaging in\nObstruction of Justice\n\nThe release of the defendant, under any conditions, would pose a significant threat to the\ncommunity and to the ongoing investigation.\n\nAs described above, where there is probable cause to believe that an individual has\ncommited an offense under l8 U.S.C. § l59l, it is presumed that no condition or combination of\nconditions can reasonably assure the safety of the community. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). Here, not\nonly is the defendant charged with very serious sex crimes against minors, he has already\npreviously admited to—and been convicted of—engaging in related conduct. Specifically, in\nJune 2oo8, the defendant pled guilty in state court to one count of procuring a person under the\nage of l8 for prostitution, a felony, and he currently is a registered sex offender, under\nclassification level three in New York—defined as presenting a “high” risk of commiting another\nsex crime and harm to the community. While the conduct presently alleged does not post-date the\n2oo8 conviction, it nevertheless underscores the risk he poses to the community if released.\n\nAdditionally, and in connection with the investigation of the defendant’s offense in Florida,\nthere were credible allegations that the defendant engaged in witness tampering, harassment, or\nother obstructive behaviors. In fact, according to publicly-filed court documents, there were\ndiscussions between prosecutors and the defendant’s then-counsel about the possibility of the\ndefendant pleading guilty to counts relating to “obstruction,” as well as “harassment,” with\n<span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to l8 U.S.C. § l5l2, which criminalizes “[t]ampering with a witness, victim, or\ninformant.” For example, in a communication from the defendant’s then-counsel to prosecutors\nin SDFL, his counsel set forth a possible factual proffer that included statements that the defendant\nhad “atempted to harass both [redacted] delay and hinder their receipt of a [redacted] to atend an\nofficial proceeding” and that the defendant “in particular, changed travel plans and flew with both\n[redacted] to the United States Virgin Islands rather than to an airport in New Jersey in order to\natempt to delay their receipt of what Mr. Epstein expected to be a [redacted]” and “further verbally\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo35o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000354.jpg": "Date: @:: BEACH POLICE a Page: |\nTine: EE Incident Report Program:\nCase No. . . . : (Continued)\nof call in seconds, inbound or outbound calls and calls made to or\nfrom (MM phone. on QR, 2oo6, at ll:o3 am, BM made a call\nto the victim JJ which lasted 492 seconds (8 minutes and 2 seconds).\nThe victim then returned the call at ll:l6 am which lasted 6 seconds.\n| The victim then made contact with JRR—Jat ll:22 am for 877.2 seconds\n| (l4 minutes and 6 seconds).

The transcript\nquotes the court, in pertinent part, as follous with <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to me and the article: “On a somewhat more\nserious note, don’t quote me on this, but it is my understanding that one of the authors of that article is :\nhimself counsel in one of the Epstein-related cases. I was surprised to learn that very recently. I’m\ncertain it is true. I was also surprised that that aspect was not disclosed in the Law Journal.” Later in the :\nhearing, atorney David Boies made comments consistent with those of the court.\nJust to clear up the evident misunderstanding: I have never been counsel to Epstein or his estate\nor to anyone in an Epstein-related case. I did serve as an expert witness, by way of expert declaration, in\nsupport of Professor Dershouitz’s motion to disqualify Mr. Boies and his law firm in Giuffre v. :\nDershouitz, l:l9-cv-o3377 (SDNY), a pending defamation case that might be described as “Epstein- /\nrelated.” My work as an expert witness, which concluded in June, did not involve my representation of, :\nor advocacy on behalf of, Professor Dershouitz. I did not serve as counsel or as an advocate on\nanyone’s behalf in co-authoring the law journal article.\nVery truly yours,\nBruce A. Green\ncc: AUSA Maurene Comey; Martin G.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses tn this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo848\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000849.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document l-2, o3/24/2o2l, 3o65965, Pagelo of 24\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\n<span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses tn this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo886\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000887.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 3-2, o3/24/2o2l, 3o65978, Pagell of 25\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\n<span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

Whether or not the accusers’ recollections as to Epstein are corroborated is irrelevant to\nthe strength of the evidence against Ms. Maxwell.\n\nThe only purported corroboration that pertains in any way to Ms. Maxwell is of marginal\nvalue. The government references rrr\n| | (/d. at ll). But even the government concedes that, at best,\nCiS\n\nIt is clear that the only evidence that Ms. Maxwell allegedly “groomed” the accusers or\nknouingly facilitated or participated in Epstein’s sexual abuse of minors will come solely from\nthe testimony of the three accusers. The government’s case against Ms. Maxwell therefore rests\nentirely on the credibility and reliability of these three witnesses. Moreover, the substantive\ncounts (Counts Two and Four) are based on the testimony of only one witness, Minor Victim-l.\nIt is also telling that the government does not even atempt to rebut the defense’s assertion that it\ndid not begin issuing subpoenas for documents related to Ms. Maxwell until just after the death\nof Jeffrey Epstein. This confirms that the case against Ms. Maxwell was assembled after the fact\n' The government also proffers that they will have “additional witnesses.” (Gov. Mem. at ll). But these are not\n“outcry” witnesses who will corroborate a contemporaneous account of abuse from one or more of the accusers.\nInstead, they will testify only that “both [Ms. Maxwell] and Epstein knew and interacted with certain minor victims\nwhen those victims were minors.” (/d.). Again, the fact that Ms. Maxwell may have “met and interacted with”\nsomeone when they were a minor proves absolutely nothing.\n* One of the witnesses has submited a leter to the Court. While the CVRA permits the right to be heard, the leter\nshould be given no legal weight in the Court’s bail analysis. See United States v. Turner, 367 F. Supp. 2d 3l9, 33l-\n32 (E.D.N.Y. 2oo5)\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll92\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001196.jpg": "CaSede2ot er Co F3ZocAdNt n DiteGmenolo2o Aled 42728)26 a Ragect l Gb l5\nPe Similarly, the financial report does not include\na future income stream for Ms. Maxwell or her spouse because it presents only historical\nand current assets.

Finally, the\n<span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> i is gratuitous.

She and her spouse have pledged all of\ntheir assets in support of the bond. Ms. Maxwell’s wealth is not a reason to deny her bail. It\nis a reason to set appropriately strict conditions that will result in significant financial\nconsequences to Ms. Maxwell and her friends and family if she leaves the country.

(/d. at 24-25). Regardless of whose money it was to begin with,\nall of the assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse will be forfeited if she flees and her a will be\nleft with nothing. Furthermore, the government’s assertion that they could not verify the spouse’s financial\ninformation because Ms. Maxwell did not provide his current banking information is false. (/d. at 24 n.9). The\ndefense provided the spouse’s current banking records and only redacted the name of the bank.\n\nfj\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll96\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001197.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD F3ocAdNt n DUE Gmeolo2o 2A ile@ 42738) 26adeageci A Ob l5\n(Gov.

The government suggests that purchasing a home using a trust and providing\na pseudonym to a real estate broker are indicative of her willingness and ability to live in hiding\nand somehou forecast Ms. Maxwell’s intention to flee. V/d.). These arguments are just further\nevidence that the government will frame every fact about Ms. Maxwell in the worst possible\nlight. As the defense has already argued extensively in its initial brief, these steps were borne\nout of necessity to protect Ms. Maxwell and her family from harassment and physical threats.\nMoreover, they are not predictive of flight. There is simply no basis to conclude, based on the\nmeasures that Ms. Maxwell was forced to take to protect herself and her family, that she would\nthen willingly abandon that family to become a fugitive from justice. To the contrary, she\nremained in the country precisely to remain close to them and to defend her case.\n\nD. Refusal of Extradition from France or the United Kingdom Is Highly\n\nUnlikely\n\nThe government dismisses Ms. Maxwell’s willingness to waive her extradition rights as\nto France and the United Kingdom as “meaningless” because Ms. Maxwell cannot guarantee\nwith absolute certainty that either country will enforce the waiver. (Gov. Mem. at l4). The\ngovernment misses the point: Ms. Maxwell’s willingness to do everything she can to eliminate\nher ability to refuse extradition to the fullest extent possible demonstrates her firm commitment\nto remain in this country to face the charges against her and, as Ms. Maxwell’s French and U.K.\nexperts confirm, there is every reason to believe that both authorities would consider the waiver\nas part of any extradition request.\n\nIn an atempt to counter William Julie’s expert report stating it is “highly unlikely” that\nthe French government would refuse to extradite Ms. Maxwell (Def. Mem., Ex. V at 2), the\ngovernment ataches a leter from the French Ministry of Justice ““MOJ’”) that references neither\nMr. Julie’s report nor Ms. Maxwell, but states generally that the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure “absolutely prohibits” the extradition of a French national.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in opposition to the defendant’s third\nmotion for release on bail, dated February 23, 2o2l (the “Third Bail Motion” or the “Motion’”).\n(Dkt. No. l6o). On July l4, 2o2o, after extensive briefing and a lengthy hearing, this Court\nconcluded that the defendant posed a serious flight risk and that no condition or combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance in court. On December 28, 2o2o, after the defendant\nrenewed her motion for release on bail (the “Second Bail Motion”) by essentially restating her\nprior arguments and presenting a more significant and specific bail package, this Court issued a\nthorough opinion and again concluded that the defendant “plainly poses a risk of flight” and denied\nthe motion for “substantially the same reasons that the Court denied” her first motion for release.\n(Dkt. No. lo6 at l-2 (“Dec. Op.”)). The defendant appealed this Court’s December 2o2o decision\nto the Second Circuit, and that appeal remains pending. Nou, the defendant asks the Court yet\nagain to reconsider its decision, and proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the bail\npackage the Court previously considered and rejected. For the reasons set forth belou, the Motion\nshould be denied. First, the Court does not have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion—in\nwhich she asks this Court to reconsider its December opinion—because the defendant has appealed\nthat December opinion to the Second Circuit. Second, even assuming the Court had jurisdiction\nto grant this latest bail application, the Court should adhere to its prior rulings because the\ndefendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and the additional bail conditions proposed\nby the defendant do not justify reversal of the Court’s prior findings that no combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance. The defendant’s Third Bail Motion should be denied.\n\nI. Background\n\nThe Government’s December l6, 2o2o opposition to the defendant’s Second Bail Motion\ndetails the background of the initial bail proceedings in this case and is incorporated by <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span>\nherein.

Ironically, her level of flight risk increases as the strength of government’s case\nagainst her diminishes. Ms. Maxwell has challenged the strength of the government’s case\nin pretrial motions pending before the Court. Among other things, Ms. Maxwell has\npersuasively argued that the Non-Prosecution Agreement entered into by Jeffrey Epstein in\n2oo7, which immunizes “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” bars Ms. Maxwell’s\nprosecution in this case, and that the counts charging her with alleged sexual abuse are\ntime-barred.\n\nThe government’s response to Ms. Maxwell’s pretrial motions shines further light\nof the weaknesses of its case. For example, the government concedes it cannot establish that\neither Ms. Maxwell or Epstein ever caused, or sought to cause, Accuser-3* to travel while she\nwas a minor or that she was underage when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein.\n(See Opp.l62-65 & fn. 57-58.)° Hence, her allegations cannot support the conspiracies charged\nin the Indictment, leaving the government with only two witnesses to prove the charges against\nMs. Maxwell. More importantly, in connection with the government’s response, it\nproduced documents indicating that government prosecutors misled a federal judge to\nobtain evidence against Ms. Maxwell (see, e.g.,. Opp. Ex. 4-7) - a shocking revelation that\nundermines the viability of the perjury counts, not to mention the integrity of the entire\n+ Accuser-3 is identified in the Indictment as “Minor Victim-3.”\n\n5 “Opp.” references are to page numbers of the Government’s Omnibus Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant’s\nPre-Trial Motions, dated February 26, 2o2l and not yet publicly filed.\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool262\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001294.jpg": "Gaseel2l'7/oroo 2artauivient DodumMdil B62 Fileth662o6/PhgPage af 6656\n\nthat it was “very concerned” about the amount of time Mr. Robertson had been in custody up to\nthat point, especially given that the already-minimal rehabilitative and mental health services in\njail had been further reduced by the pandemic.

The government opposes the requested reconsideration. Doc. 282.\n\nDISCUSSION\nl. Reconsideration is Proper on the Basis of New Evidence Previously Unavailable.\n\nAs an initial mater, Mr. Robertson has raised legitimate reasons for the Court to reconsider\nits earlier release decision. As the Court has previously explained, it is well-established in this\nCircuit that although the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure do not expressly authorize a motion\nfor reconsideration, such motions are proper in criminal cases. See United States v. Christy, 739\nF.3d 534, 539 (loth Cir. 2ol4). A district court thus may amend its interlocutory orders prior to\nentry of final judgment. See, e.g., Van Skiver v.

The government’s proposed\nrestriction is therefore “broader than necessary” to protect the privacy interests of these\nindividuals who have already chosen to self-identify, and will hinder the defense’s ability to\nconduct further factual investigation, prepare witnesses for trial, and advocate on Ms. Maxwell’s\nbehalf.\n\n* * *\nDOJ-OGR-ooool645\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001665.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 33 Filed o7/28/2o Page 2 of 7\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 2\nThe defendant’s demand that she and her counsel be permited to name any individuals who have\never publicly identified themselves as a victim of either Epstein or the defendant in any “public\nfora,” and at any time, without limitation, is extraordinarily broad, unnecessary, and inappropriate,\nand should be denied.\n\nAs an initial mater, there can be no serious question that there are significant privacy and\nvictim interests at issue here, which the Government Proposed Order seeks to protect. Particularly\nin the context of victim witnesses, there are compelling reasons to limit public disclosure of victim\nidentities and other sensitive information. Indeed, the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, l8 U.S.C. §\n377l, requires district courts to implement procedures to ensure that crime victims are accorded,\namong other rights, “[t]he right to be reasonably protected from the accused,” in addition to “[t]he\nright to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim’s dignity and privacy.” Id. §§\n(a)(l), (a)(8) (emphasis added). Moreover, “the public generally has a strong interest in protecting\nthe identities of . . . victims so that other victims will not be deterred from reporting such crimes.”\nUnited States v. Paris, 2oo7 WL l484974, at *2 (D. Conn. May l8, 2oo7).\n\nMoreover, and consistent with those interests, courts in this Circuit have routinely\nacknouledged the need to protect victim-witness identities. See, e.g., United States v. Corley,\nl3 Cr. 48 (AJN), 2ol6 WL 9o225o8, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6) (“Because Corley’s minor\nvictims have significant privacy and safety interests at stake, while Corley’s interests are minimal,\nthe Court finds good cause to modify the protective order in this case to prevent Corley from\nlearning the surnames of the minor victims.”); United States v. Kelly, o7 Cr. 374 (SJ), 2oo8 WL\n5o6882o, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. July lo, 2oo8) (“Given the potentially explicit nature of the government\nwitnesses’ expected testimony, the government argues that it is necessary to conceal their identity\nto protect them from public humiliation and embarrassment. This Court agrees. Thus, the parties\n[. . .] are hereby prohibited from releasing to anyone, including members of the press, the identity\nor any identifying information of the government’s witnesses.”). It is similarly routine in this\nDistrict for parties in a criminal case to refer to witnesses by pseudonyms (such as “Victim-l” or\n‘“‘Witness-l’’) to protect the privacy interests of third parties unless and until they testify publicly.\n\nThe Government’s proposed order endeavors to protect those interests by generally\nrequiring the parties to abstain from identifying any victim by name in any public statement or\nfiling while also ensuring that the defendant and her counsel are fully able to prepare for trial.\nIndeed, to facilitate the defendant’s investigation and preparation for trial, the Government’s\nproposal makes clear that defense counsel and defense staff, including defense investigators,\nshould not be prohibited from referencing identities of individuals in conversations with\nprospective witnesses, so long as those witnesses and their counsel abstain from further disclosing\nor disseminating any such identities. See Government Proposed Order § 5. The terms of the\nGovernment’s proposed order also would permit defense counsel to refer to any individual by\nname in any filing under seal, merely requiring redaction of identifying information or the use of\na pseudonym in public filings. The Government further proposes that defense counsel not be\nprohibited from publicly referencing individuals who have spoken—or who at some future time\nor deletes language in furtherance of its desire to publicly <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> victim identities in defense\nparagraphs 7, 9, and l7 (which are Government Proposed Order paragraphs 6, 7, and l6).\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool665\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001666.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 33 Filed o7/28/2o Page 3 of 7\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 3\nspeak—by name on the public record in this case, as one victim has already chosen to do, because\nthose victims, and only those victims, have affirmatively chosen to be publicly identified in\nconnection with this case. These proposals are reasonable, narrouly tailored, and not broader than\nnecessary to protect victims’ privacy interests, safety, and well-being, to avoid potential\nharassment of witnesses by the press and others, and to prevent undue embarrassment and other\nadverse consequences. At this stage in the case, permiting defense counsel to refer to witnesses\nby name in sealed filings, to refer to witnesses by name in the course of private conversations\nduring their investigation, and to refer by name to individuals who have made the affirmative\nchoice to be identified by name in connection with this criminal case is more than enough to enable\nthe defendant ability to vigorously pursue her defense.\n\nThe defendant has rejected this proposal because, as noted above, she believes that she and\nher counsel should be permited to “publicly referenc[e]” individuals, by name, who have “spoken\non the public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation — criminal or otherwise — relating\nto Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.” In support of the defendant’s application for such\nsweeping ability to publicly name any such individuals, defense counsel provides only the\nconclusory assertion that an inability to publicly <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> the names of victims, in court\nproceedings and beyond, will hinder their ability to investigate, prepare witnesses for trial, and\nadvocate on the defendant’s behalf. The Government has repeatedly asked defense counsel to\nexplain hou or why it would need to publicly name victims of sexual abuse to prepare for trial,\nand the defense repeatedly has declined to do so, presumably because the argument borders on the\nabsurd.”\n\nThe Government’s proposed protective order would do no such thing. As described above,\nthe Government’s proposed order would permit defense counsel and defense staff to <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> the\nidentities of individuals they believe may be relevant to the defense to potential witnesses and their\ncounsel (who then would be prohibited from further disclosing or disseminating such identifying\ninformation). Government Proposed Order 45. It would further permit the defendant to publicly\nidentify individuals who have chosen to speak on the record on this case. Jd. 9.6. And it would\npermit the defendant to <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> identifying information in filings made under seal. See id.\n\n> Despite the Government’s requests for clarity on the need for the defendant’s requested\nmodification, the sole additional reason provided by defense counsel for why it would be\nappropriate or necessary to publicly name victims is that certain of these victims have obtained\nwhat defense counsel described as the “benefit” of publicly identifying themselves as victims (and\nthus, as the defendant presumably would have it, deserve whatever public identification and\nscrutiny the defendant intends to invite upon them). Beyond the offensive notion that victims of\nsexual abuse experience a “benefit” by making the incredibly difficult decision to share their\nexperience publicly, the suggestion that victims who receive this supposed “benefit” should\nreceive fewer protections than the law ordinarily offers to victims in criminal cases is alarming.\nPermiting defense counsel to publicly identify witnesses who have not identified themselves on\nthe record in this case risks subjecting witnesses to harassment and intimidation, with no\nconceivable benefit to the defense other than perhaps discouraging witnesses from cooperating\nwith the Government.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool666\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001683.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 34 Filed o7/28/2o Page l of 2\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nee  . |\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, : AFFIDAVIT OF CERTIFICATION\ni PURSUANT TO LOCAL\n-V.- : CRIMINAL RULE l6.l\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, i 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDefendant. :\nee. }\nSTATE OF NEW YORK )\nCOUNTY OF NEW YORK : SS.:\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK_)\nALEX ROSSMILLER, pursuant to Title 28, United States Code, Section l746, hereby\naffirms under penalty of perjury:\nL.

But that is not the standard.\n\nThe defense submits that when the relevant privacy interests are appropriately\nconsidered, it should not be restricted from publicly referencing individuals who have chosen to\npublicly identify themselves. Accordingly, the defense has proposed that the protective order\ninclude the follouing language: “Nor does this Order prohibit Defense Counsel from publicly\nreferencing individuals who have spoken on the public record to the media or in public fora, or in\nlitigation — criminal or otherwise — relating to Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.” (Dkt. 29,\nEx. A ¥ 6).\n\nIn the present context, many of the alleged victims have chosen to identify themselves by\nname in numerous public fora, including: self-identifying and speaking on the record in criminal\nproceedings in the Jeffrey Epstein case and this case; as named plaintiffs in civil suits against\nMs. Maxwell and others; in on-the-record interviews with media and tabloid publications and\nnewspaper articles; publishing memoirs; appearing on air in Netflix documentaries and other\ntelevision and film productions; appearing in YouTube videos; and making, in their oun name,\nall manner of social media posts. Indeed, a Google search will reveal any number of videos and\narticles in which alleged victims not only identify themselves, but make specific allegations\nagainst Ms. Maxwell. As a mater of common sense, and under the law, such persons do not\nhave any privacy interest that needs to be addressed by the proposed order. See Cox Broad.\nCorp. v. Cohn, 42o U.S. 469, 494-95 (l975) (noting, in a case where the identity of a minor rape\nvictim was disclosed in publicly filed indictments, that “the interests in privacy fade when the\ninformation involved already appears on the public record.”).\n\nYet, the government asserts that such persons nevertheless have “significant privacy\ninterests” (Gov’t Resp. at l), and proposes the much more limited formulation: “This Order does\nnot prohibit Defense Counsel from publicly referencing individuals who have spoken by name\non the public record in this case” — i.e., in United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o\n(AJN). (Dkt. 33, Ex. A § 5 (emphasis added)). As a practical mater, the government’s proposed\nlanguage would permit the defense to publicly <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> a total of one person — the individual\nwho spoke under her oun name at Ms. Maxwell’s bail hearing. (See Tr. at 4o). It would not\ninclude the ll alleged victims who spoke or submited leters under their oun names at the\nAugust 27, 2ol9 hearing in United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, l9-CR-oo49o-RMB, even though\nfive of those individuals made allegations against Ms. Maxwell. (See Dkt. 53 at 43-44, 55, 56,\n57, 58). It would not include the four individuals who have civilly sued Ms. Maxwell under their\noun names alleging conduct similar to that alleged in the indictment. Nor would it include\nnumerous other individuals, described above, who have spoken out publicly to the press or on\nsocial media and made accusations against Ms. Maxwell. Indeed, the government’s proposed\nlanguage is even more restrictive than what they previously agreed to in the Epstein case, which\nalloued Epstein’s counsel to publicly <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> individuals who had identified themselves in\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool686\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001688.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 35 Filed o7/29/2o Page 4of5\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

It is therefore important to the defense\ninvestigation and Ms. Maxwell’s right to a fair trial that the protective order not restrict the\ndefense’s ability to publicly <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> the names of Ms. Maxwell’s accusers who have already\nchosen to publicly identify themselves. °\n\nFinally, the government’s claim that the discovery will include the identities of\nindividuals “whom the Government does not expect to call as witnesses, and whose accounts—\nmuch less identities—will have no bearing on this case” is beside the point. (Gov’t Resp. at\n4). If the government were prepared to represent that it will base its case solely on the three\nindividuals referenced in the indictment, the analysis might be different. But that is\nunlikely. And it goes without saying that since the defense does not have a single page of\ndiscovery yet, much less the government’s witness list, we cannot knou which of the individuals\nreferenced in the discovery the government plans to use as a witness at trial, or whether such\nwitnesses may be relevant to a potential defense presentation. Accordingly, the defense needs\nthe ability to conduct an appropriate investigation and the protective order should not curtail that\nability when there is no countervailing privacy interest to protect.\n\n2. Preventing the Improper Use of Discovery Materials by Potential Government\n\nWitnesses and Their Counsel\n\nThe defendant’s proposed protective order subjects potential government witnesses and\ntheir counsel to the same restrictions as the defense concerning appropriate use of the discovery\nmaterials—namely, if these individuals are given access to discovery materials during trial\npreparation in this case, they may not use those materials for any purpose other than preparing\nfor trial in the criminal case and may not post those materials on the Internet. (See Dkt. 29 at 2;\nEx. A 493, 5).\n\nThe government construes the defense’s proposal as one that “impose[s] restrictions upon\nthe Government” itself. (Gov. Resp. at 5 (emphasis added)). It then provides a list of other\nstatutes and regulations that might impose restrictions on the government that may be in conflict\nwith the protective order, arguing that this possibility for conflict warrants rejection of the\ndefense’s proposed language.”\n\n* Tt is not, as the government gratuitously asserts, so that the defense can engage in witness intimidation. (Gov’t\nResp. at 3 n.2).\n“The government does not explain why, in the event of such conflict, it could not apply to the Court for resolution\nof potentially competing obligations.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool688\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001702.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 37 Filed o7/3o/2o Ragetof3——____..\nUSDC SDNY |\nDOCUMENT\nELECTRONICALLY FILED |\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT alae eee 5, Te ae\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK DATE FObEMs 2o/2o2o\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nMEMORANDUM\nDefendant. OPINION & ORDER\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\nBoth parties have asked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on\nmost of the language, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on the public\nrecord to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein.\nSecond, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential Government witnesses and their\ncounsel from using discovery materials for any purpose other than preparing for the criminal trial\nin this action. The Government has proposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the\nfollouing reasons, the Court adopts the Government’s proposed protective order.\nUnder Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(d)(l), “[a]t any time the court may, for\ngood cause, deny, restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.”\nThe good cause standard “requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others . . . whether the imposition of\nthe protective order would prejudice the defendant,” and “the public’s interest in the\ninformation.” United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party\nseeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing good cause. Cf Gambale v. Deutsche\nBank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooool7o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001703.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 37 Filed o7/3o/2o Page 2 of 3\n\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause with\nregard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> alleged victims and\nwitnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this litigation. As a\ngeneral mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific interest in protecting the\nprivacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that supports restricting the disclosure of\ntheir identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging that as a baseline the protective order should\n“prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or\ndisseminating the identity of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery\nmaterials”); see also United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr-48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at\n*ll(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished for\nindividuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, because\nthey have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all accusations or public statements\nare equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a\nfar different mater than simply making a public statement “relating to” Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, particularly since such a statement might have occurred decades ago and have no\nrelevance to the charges in this case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy\ninterest that must be safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks\nundermining the protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by\nlaw. In contrast, the Government’s proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\n<span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also allous the\nDefense to “referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be relevant . . . to Potential\nDefense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the investigation and preparation of the\ndefense case at trial.” Dkt.

Those applications should\nbe denied.\"\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government has already produced, and will continue to produce,\nsubstantial volumes of materials in discovery consistent with its obligations. Those include\nmaterials the Government obtained via search warrant, grand jury subpoenas, or other investigative\nmethods available only to the Government. Indeed, the Government has already produced more\nthan l65,ooo pages of discovery to the defense, including the materials relevant to the Defense\nLeter. Through her most recent application, the defendant seeks permission to use, in unrelated\ncivil litigation, materials produced pursuant to the protective order in this case and designated\n“Confidential” thereunder.

(Def. Ltr. l, 4). An item is “material to preparing the defense” under Rule\nl6 only insofar as “it could be used to counter the government’s case or bolster a defense.” United\nStates v. Stevens, 985 F.2d ll75, ll8o (2d Cir. l993). Thus, materials that are wholly irrelevant\nto the Government’s case or the charges in the Indictment do not fall under Rule l6. That is the\ncase here. Contrary to the defense’s claim, the Government has not charged Maxwell with being\nJeffrey Epstein’s “madam” and “principal facilitator of his abuse.” (Def. Ltr. 3). Instead, the\ndefendant is charged with helping Epstein identify, groom, and sexually abuse multiple minor\nvictims between l994 and l997. The Indictment does not allege that the defendant engaged in\nsuch conduct after l997. As such, the Materials are simply not relevant to the charges in the\nIndictment, much less exculpatory to the defendant.\n\nMaxwell’s argument is equally flawed with respect to the perjury counts. (Def. Ltr. 3).\nThe Indictment alleges that the Government’s evidence on Counts One through Four based on her\nconduct from l994 to l997 is also evidence of the falsity of the answers provided in the deposition.\nSpecifically, the portions of her deposition that the Government alleges in the Indictment are false\nare all contradicted by the allegations contained in paragraphs one through seven of the Indictment,\nwhich focus exclusively on the period l994 through l997. Indeed, paragraph eight of the\nIndictment notes that the defendant’s statements during her deposition contradicted “some of the\nspecific events and acts of abuse detailed” in paragraphs one through seven of the Indictment,\nwhich focus exclusively on the period from l994 through l997. (Indictment, Docket No. l7, at\nlo). Consistent with that position, Counts Five and Six both incorporate by <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> paragraphs\none through eight of the Indictment. (See id. at l5-l6). Accordingly, evidence that the defendant\ndid or did not participate in Epstein’s abuse of minor victims at different times or on different\noccasions not charged in the Indictment would not undercut the Government’s theory or exculpate\nthe defendant on those counts.\n\nFinally, and perhaps more importantly, the Government is not suggesting that these\nMaterials should be kept from the defense indefinitely. Rather, the Government requests\nauthorization to provide these Materials eight weeks prior to trial, along with its production of\nstatements of other non-testifying witnesses. Even assuming arguendo that the Materials\nconstitute Brady or Rule l6 evidence—which they do not for all of the reasons discussed above—\nthe defendant cites no case law for the proposition that she is entitled to their production nou,\nrather than eight weeks in advance of trial. The Second Circuit has held that “as a general rule,\nBrady and its progeny do not require immediate disclosure of all exculpatory and impeachment\nmaterial upon request by a defendant.” United States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d l32, l46 (2d Cir. 2ool).\nInstead, “the Government ‘suppresses’ evidence within the meaning of Brady only if it fails to\ndisclose Brady and Giglio material in time for its effective use at trial or at a plea proceeding.” Jd.\nWhat constitutes sufficient time for “effective use at trial” depends on the “materiality of that\nevidence” and “the particular circumstances of the case.” Id.\n\nHere, the defendant has made no shouing as to why eight weeks in advance of trial would\nnot be enough time to make “effective use” of the Materials at trial or hou she would otherwise\nbe prejudiced by the Government’s proposed disclosure timeline. Coppa, 267 F.3d at l46.

Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of New York\nAO Foley Square\nNew York, New York looo7\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully submit this leter in response\nto the Court’s order, dated November 25, 2o2o, directing Ms. Maxwell to justify why her leter\nof the same date requesting an in camera conference to discuss confidentiality concerns related\nto her Renewed Motion for Release on Bail (the “Motion”) should be sealed or redacted.\n\nWe continue to believe that sealing the November 25, 2o2o leter (the “November 25\"\nLeter”) in its entirety is warranted and appropriate under the governing case law. Houever, in\nresponse to the Court’s order, we ask the Court to file a redacted version of the November 25\nLeter, atached hereto as Exhibit A, which redacts only the information necessary to protect\nthird parties from threats and harassment. In addition, because this leter must make <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to\nthe same confidential information contained in the November 25\" Leter in order to justify the\nproposed redactions, we further ask the Court to file a redacted version of this leter, atached as\nExhibit B. If the Court is not inclined to allou any of these redactions, we request leave to\nwithdraw both leters and refile the November 25\" Leter with the redacted sentences deleted.\n\nEvery submission related to the Motion, including this leter, presents the defense with a\nCatch-22. To support Ms. Maxwell’s position regarding sealing and confidentiality, we are\nasked to provide the Court with specific information about the people supporting Ms. Maxwell’s\nbail application and the need for sealing. But until we knou what confidentiality protections the\nCourt is willing to put in place, we are obligated to protect these people from the potentially\ndevastating consequences of being publicly identified by divulging as litle information about\nthem as possible. We therefore continue to believe that an in camera conference, atended by all\ncounsel, is the best way to address all of the confidentiality issues related to the Motion.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool855\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001856.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 87 Filed l2/o4/2o Page 2 of 4\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nNovember 3o, 2o2o\nPage 2\n\nWith regard to the November 25\" Leter, Ms. Maxwell requests redaction of three\nsentences. The first sentence must be redacted because it contains information that will identify\na proposed co-signer. The government, itself, concedes that such information should be\nredacted. (See November 25\" Leter at 3). The <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> in this sentence to\n\nEven assuming, arguendo, that\nthere is some minimal public interest in knouing the identity of a particular surety, it is vastly\noutweighed by the significant privacy concerms in this case. See United States v. Amodeo, 7l\nF.3d lo44, lo5o-5l (2d Cir. l995) (“[t]he privacy interests of innocent third parties ... should\nweigh heavily in a court’s balancing equation.... [C]ourts have the pouer to insure that their\nrecords are not used to gratify private spite or promote public scandal[.]”).!\n\nSimilarly, redaction of the second and third sentences, like the first, is necessary to\nprotect the privacy and safety of people who have suffered, or legitimately fear they will suffer,\nterrible personal and professional consequences for having been linked to Ms. Maxwell. People\nclose to Ms. Maxwell have been physically stalked by members of the tabloid press and have had\n\naparazzi jump out of bushes and in front of their cars to snap pictures of them.\n\nAnd several have been the target of repeated physical threats. Many\nof the people who want to support Ms. Maxwell’s renewed bail application are older and do not\nhave the financial means to hire a personal security detail to protect themselves. Nor should they\nhave to. They are all people of good character who are simply trying to support Ms. Maxwell’s\nconstitutional right to seek release on bail. They should be given appropriate protections so that\nthey can step forward without having their lives upended or, worse, destroyed.\n\nThe November 25” Leter, as submited, intentionally avoided naming these individuals\nfor this very reason. But removing or redacting their names, as the government proposes, is not\nenough. This case has generated so much media atention and public opprobrium that public\nie.\n\n* Given the sensitive subject mater of this case, the sureties have legitimate fears for their safety if they are publicly\nidentified. Numerous social media posts have advocated killing Ms. Maxwell as a perverse form of “justice” for her\nalleged role in Epstein’s sex trafficking crimes. As we have all been recently reminded with the tragic case of the\ndeath of Judge Esther Salas’s son, there are people who are capable of commiting horrible acts of violence—even\nagainst innocent third parties—by convincing themselves that their actions are justified.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool856\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001857.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 87 Filed l2/o4/2o Page 3 of 4\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nNovember 3o, 2o2o\nPage 3\ndisclosure of even the smallest personal detail about anyone connected to Ms. Maxwell—\nwhether or not they are named or anonymized—will ignite a frenzy of media speculation seekin\nto identify them.

We are acutely mindful that courts are\ngenerally reluctant to seal anything in a court filing beyond what is required by statute or local\ncourt rules. We are therefore proposing targeted redactions, consistent with the case law in this\nCircuit, that are no more extensive than necessary to protect these third parties. See Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onandaga, 435 F.3d llo, l24 (2d Cir. 2oo6); see also Unites States v. Wey, 256\nF. Supp. 3d 355, 4ll (S.D.N.Y. 2ol7) (Nathan, J.) (granting motion to seal evidentiary exhibits\non privacy grounds). Ultimately, we seek the same privacy protections for these people that the\ngovernment has sought and obtained for Ms. Maxwell’s accusers and for other information\ncovered by the Protective Order in this case.\n\nBy making this request for redaction, we are not trying to litigate this case in secret. We\nare merely seeking the ability to file a renewed bail application for Ms. Maxwell without further\nrisking the safety and privacy of sureties needed to support that application. This is the first of\nseveral confidentiality issues that will arise in connection with the Motion, and the sureties will\nbe looking at the Court’s ruling as an indication of the level of confidentiality they can expect to\nbe afforded. These individuals have requested that their privacy and safety be appropriately\nprotected by the Court.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, we respectfully request that the Court file the proposed\nredacted version of the November 25\" Leter, atached as Exhibit A, and the proposed redacted\nversion of this leter, atached as Exhibit B. In the alternative, we request leave to withdraw both\nleters and refile the November 25™ Leter with the redacted sentences deleted.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool857\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001887.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page lo of 9l lo\nk7e2MaxC kjc\nl MS.

Whether or not the accusers’ recollections as to Epstein are corroborated is irrelevant to\nthe strength of the evidence against Ms. Maxwell.\n\nThe only purported corroboration that pertains in any way to Ms. Maxwell is of marginal\nvalue. The government references [i\na (Ud. at ll). But even the government concedes that, at best, | ti—‘sSCsdY\neC‘\n\nIt is clear that the only evidence that Ms. Maxwell allegedly “groomed” the accusers or\nknouingly facilitated or participated in Epstein’s sexual abuse of minors will come solely from\nthe testimony of the three accusers. The government’s case against Ms. Maxwell therefore rests\nentirely on the credibility and reliability of these three witnesses.” Moreover, the substantive\ncounts (Counts Two and Four) are based on the testimony of only one witness, Minor Victim-l.\nIt is also telling that the government does not even atempt to rebut the defense’s assertion that it\ndid not begin issuing subpoenas for documents related to Ms. Maxwell until just after the death\nof Jeffrey Epstein. This confirms that the case against Ms. Maxwell was assembled after the fact\n' The government also proffers that they will have “additional witnesses.” (Gov. Mem. at ll). But these are not\n“outcry” witnesses who will corroborate a contemporaneous account of abuse from one or more of the accusers.\nInstead, they will testify only that “both [Ms. Maxwell] and Epstein knew and interacted with certain minor victims\nwhen those victims were minors.” (/d.). Again, the fact that Ms. Maxwell may have “met and interacted with”\nsomeone when they were a minor proves absolutely nothing.\n\n* One of the witnesses has submited a leter to the Court. While the CVRA permits the right to be heard, the leter\nshould be given no legal weight in the Court’s bail analysis. See United States v. Turner, 367 F.

It\nis a reason to set appropriately strict conditions that will result in significant financial\nconsequences to Ms. Maxwell and her friends and family if she leaves the country. The\nproposed bail package does exactly that.°\n\nc. The Government’s Assertion that Ms. Maxwell Is “Adept” at Hiding and\n\nTherefore a Flight Risk Is Specious\n\nThe government continues to assert the sinister narrative that Ms. Maxwell had “an\n\nexpertise at remaining hidden,” and that it would therefore be easy for her to become a fugitive.\n° The government’s argument that her spouse’s moral suasion is diminished because Ms. Maxwell brought the\nmajority of assets to the relationship is nonsensical. (/d. at 24-25). Regardless of whose money it was to begin with,\nall of the assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse will be forfeited if she flees and her — | will be\nleft with nothing. Furthermore, the government’s assertion that they could not verify the spouse’s financial\ninformation because Ms. Maxwell did not provide his current banking information is false. (/d. at 24 n.9). The\ndefense provided the spouse’s current banking records and only redacted the name of the bank.\n\n7\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo22l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002218.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo3 Filed l2/23/2o Page l2 of l5\n(Gov. Mem. at 2o). The government suggests that purchasing a home using a trust and providing\na pseudonym to a real estate broker are indicative of her willingness and ability to live in hiding\nand somehou forecast Ms. Maxwell’s intention to flee. V/d.). These arguments are just further\nevidence that the government will frame every fact about Ms. Maxwell in the worst possible\nlight. As the defense has already argued extensively in its initial brief, these steps were borne\nout of necessity to protect Ms. Maxwell and her family from harassment and physical threats.\nMoreover, they are not predictive of flight. There is simply no basis to conclude, based on the\nmeasures that Ms. Maxwell was forced to take to protect herself and her family, that she would\nthen willingly abandon that family to become a fugitive from justice. To the contrary, she\nremained in the country precisely to remain close to them and to defend her case.\n\nD. Refusal of Extradition from France or the United Kingdom Is Highly\n\nUnlikely\n\nThe government dismisses Ms. Maxwell’s willingness to waive her extradition rights as\nto France and the United Kingdom as “meaningless” because Ms. Maxwell cannot guarantee\nwith absolute certainty that either country will enforce the waiver. (Gov. Mem. at l4). The\ngovernment misses the point: Ms. Maxwell’s willingness to do everything she can to eliminate\nher ability to refuse extradition to the fullest extent possible demonstrates her firm commitment\nto remain in this country to face the charges against her and, as Ms. Maxwell’s French and U.K.\nexperts confirm, there is every reason to believe that both authorities would consider the waiver\nas part of any extradition request.\n\nIn an atempt to counter William Julie’s expert report stating it is “highly unlikely” that\nthe French government would refuse to extradite Ms. Maxwell (Def. Mem., Ex. V at 2), the\ngovernment ataches a leter from the French Ministry of Justice ““MOJ’”) that references neither\nMr. Julie’s report nor Ms. Maxwell, but states generally that the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure “absolutely prohibits” the extradition of a French national.

Under well-established principles of general contract law,\nand particularly under the law relating to non-prosecution agreements, any and all of Epstein’s\npotential co-conspirators are third-party beneficiaries of the NPA. As federal courts have\nrepeatedly recognized in enforcing third-party immunity provisions, a third-party beneficiary\nneed not be expressly named in an immunity provision as long as she falls within the class of\npersons on whom the parties intended to confer immunity. Because the indictment alleges that\nMs. Maxwell was a co-conspirator of Epstein, she falls well within the protection provided by\nthe NPA.\n\nSecond, the government claims that the co-conspirator immunity provision applies only\nto prosecutions in the SDFL. But the NPA was a highly negotiated, non-standard agreement. It\nis not the standard agreement the government wishes it to be. The plain language of the NPA\nsquarely refutes the government’s position. The co-conspirator immunity provision does not\nprohibit merely prosecutions by the USAO for the SDFL (“USAO-SDFL”), but by “the United\nStates.” This broad prohibition was intentional, as demonstrated by the express references\nelsewhere in the NPA to the United States Atorney and/or the USAO-SDFL. Indeed, compare\nthe NPA’s immunity provision for Epstein himself, which is expressly limited to prosecutions in\nthe SDFL, and the co-conspirator immunity provision, which contains no such limitation. Even\nif the language were ambiguous as to its impact on prosecutions on the SDFL, which it is not,\nany ambiguity must be construed against the government.\n\nIn opposition, the government relies on the Second Circuit’s statement that “[a] plea\nagreement binds only the office of the United States Atorney for the district in which the plea is\nentered unless it affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.”\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2583\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002586.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l4 of 38\nNPA’s references to the “United States” demonstrate a definitional intent not to limit such\nprovisions to the USAO-SDFL.\n\nThe NPA begins with several factual recitals. After noting certain details of the\ninvestigation and indictment by the Florida State Atorney’s Office, the recitals state, among\nother things, that (l) the “United States Atorney’s Office” and the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (“FBI”) have “conducted their oun investigation into Epstein’s background and\nany offenses that may have been commited by Epstein against the United States from in or\naround 2ool through in or around September 2oo7, including” five enumerated federal criminal\noffenses; (ll) Epstein seeks “to resolve globally his state and federal criminal liability” and thus\nis agreeing to comply with the terms of the NPA “in exchange for the benefits provided by this\nagreement”; and (i) “the interests of the United States, the State of Florida, and the Defendant\nwill be served by the follouing procedure.” NPA at l-2 (emphasis added). Nouhere in the\nrecitals is <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> made specifically to the SDFL or to the USAO-SDFL, nor is there any\nsuggestion that the parties in any way intended to limit the “global[]” resolution of Epstein’s\nliability.\n\nThe NPA then provides that “prosecution [of Epstein] in this District for these offenses\nshall be deferred in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida, provided that Epstein abides by”\nthe terms of the NPA. NPA at 2. The NPA also provides that, after its terms are fulfilled,\n\nno prosecution for the offenses set out on pages | and 2 of this Agreement [e.g.,\n\nthe five enumerated federal offenses], nor any other offenses that have been the\n\nsubject of the joint investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the\n\nUnited States Atorney’s Office, nor any offenses that arose from the Federal\n\nGrand Jury investigation’ will be instituted in this District, and the charges\n\nagainst Epstein if any, will be dismissed.\n\n3 Like the various references to the United States and its agents, the term “Federal Grand Jury investigation” is not\ndefined in the NPA.\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2586\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002595.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 23 of 38\nparties to the NPA clearly intended to confer immunity on potential co-conspirators of Epstein,\nsuch as Ms. Maxwell.\n\nB. The NPA’s Prohibition on Prosecution of Potential Co-Conspirators Is Not\n\nLimited to the SDFL.\n\nThe NPA stands in contrast to the standard non-prosecution agreement used in this\nDistrict and other jurisdictions, which typically is explicitly limited to prohibit only prosecutions\nby the USAO for the district in which the plea is entered. The standard agreement in this District\ncontains the follouing language: “It is further understood that this Agreement does not bind any\nfederal, state, or local prosecuting authority other than this Office.” See, e.g., Perez v. United\nStates, Nos. l4 Civ. 846, o4 Cr. 937-l, 2ol5 WL 34l3596 , at *8 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol5). No such\nlanguage is included in the NPA. Moreover, unlike the standard agreement, the NPA refers\nseparately to “the United States” in some places and to the USAO-SDFL in others, in ways that\nmake clear that any <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to “the United States” was intended to refer to the government as a\nwhole, not merely the USAO-SDFL.\n\nl. The NPA is binding on the USAO in this District.\n\nThe government’s contention that the NPA does not bind the USAO in this District\ncannot be squared with the clear language of the co-conspirator immunity provision. On its face,\nthat provision does not limit the preclusive effect of the NPA as to potential co-conspirators to\nprosecutions in the SDFL. Indeed, consistent with Epstein’s desire to obtain the broadest\nimmunity possible, the NPA expressly provides that, in exchange for Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms and conditions therein, “the United States also agrees that it will not institute any\ncriminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” with no express geographic\nlimitation.

The NPA’s Prohibition on the Prosecution of Potential Co-Conspirators Is\nNot Limited to Prosecution for Conduct Between 2ool and 2oo7 or for\nParticular Statutory Offenses.\n\nFinally, the government has characterized the NPA’s co-conspirator immunity provision\nas “limited by its terms to conduct spanning from 2ool to 2oo7 . . . and to violations of statutes\nnot charged in this Indictment.” Reply Mem. at 5-6. This characterization is grossly inaccurate.\nThe co-conspirator immunity provision contains no limitation as to either the time period or the\nstatutes on which such criminal charges might be based.’\n\nJust as the NPA deviates from the standard agreement in failing to include language\nlimiting its scope to the SDFL, it also deviates from the standard agreement by failing to specify\nthe conduct, including the time period, for which the putative defendant—or, in this case,\npotential co-conspirators—cannot be prosecuted. As with its failure to limit the co-conspirator\nimmunity provision to the SDFL, the government may not nou rewrite the NPA to limit the\nscope of covered conduct in a manner that it failed to do in drafting the NPA. At minimum, the\nabsence of any such limitation renders the scope of the provision ambiguous, and any ambiguity\nmust be construed against the government. See Feldman, 939 F.3d at l89.\n\nWhile the NPA’s factual recitals <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> the 2ool-o7 time period and list five potential\nstatutory offenses, the NPA’s substantive provisions establish no such limit on the immunity for\npotential co-conspirators—or, for that mater, for Epstein himself—to either that time period or\nthose offenses. As to Epstein, the NPA provides immunity for (i) “any offenses that arose” from\nthe undefined “Federal Grand Jury investigation” and (i) “any other offenses that have been the\nsubject of the joint investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States\n“The government's assertion that the co-conspirator immunity provision is limited to “violations of statutes not\ncharged in this Indictment” (Reply Mem. at 6) is incorrect for the additional reason that both the NPA and the\ncurrent indictment (“Indictment”) <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> violations of the Mann Act.

See\nShular, l4o S.Ct. at 785; Kawashima vy. Holder, 565 U.S. 478, 484 (2ol2) (interpreting “offenses\nthat involve fraud or deceit” to mean “offenses with elements that necessarily entail fraudulent or\ndeceitful conduct’) (internal punctuation omited); Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U.S. l, 7 (2oo4)\n(stating that “offense that .. . involves” language “requires us to look to the elements and the\nnature of the offense . . .rather than to the particular facts” at issue); see also United States v.\nDavis, l39 S. Ct. 23l9, 2328 (2ol9) (“In all but the most unusual situations, a single use of a\nstatutory phrase must have a fixed meaning.”). Thus, only if the offense “necessarily entails” the\nidentified conduct can it be said to be an “offense involving” that conduct. Kawashima, 565 U.S.\nat 484.\n\nIn United States v. Morgan, the D.C. Circuit used this approach in interpreting l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3237(a), a venue statute that applies to “[a]ny offense involving the use of the mails,\ntransportation in interstate or foreign commerce, or the importation of an object or person into\nthe United States.” The court concluded that “[t]he most natural reading” of the statute is “‘to\nconstrue ‘any offense involving’ by <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to the e/ements of the offense at issue.” 393 F.3d\nl92, l98 (D.C. Cir. 2oo4) (emphasis in original). The court then gave an illustrative example of\na case in which a defendant travels in interstate commerce, commits a federal offense, and then\nreturns home via interstate commerce:\n\n[T]he circumstances surrounding the crime include [the defendant’s] travel in\n\ninterstate commerce, but his crime is not an “offense involving” transportation in\n\ninterstate commerce. In other words, a faithful reading of the precise words of the\n\nstatute in the order in which they are writen suggests that an “offense involv[es]”\n\ntransportation in interstate commerce only when such transportation is an element\n\nof the offense.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2667\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002677.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l46 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 2 of l6\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPage\nI.

All References to Accuser-3 Should Be Stricken as Surplusage.\n\nUnder Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(d), “[u]pon the defendant’s motion, the court may strike\nsurplusage from the indictment or information.” “This rule introduces a means of protecting the\ndefendant against immaterial or irrelevant allegations in an indictment or information, which\nmay, houever, be prejudicial.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(d) Advisory Commitee’s Note. In the\nSecond Circuit, Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(d) motions may be granted “where the challenged allegations\nare not relevant to the crime charged and are inflammatory and prejudicial.” United States v.\nScarpa, 9l3 F.2d 993, lol3 (2d Cir. l99o) (internal quotations omited); see United States v.\nGreebel, No. l5-cr-637 (KAM), 2ol7 WL 36lo57o, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ol7) (striking\nlanguage stating that defendant “orchestrated four interrelated fraud schemes” where indictment\ncharged him in only two of those schemes).\n\nThe paragraphs of the indictment alleging that Ms. Maxwell was complicit in Epstein’s\n“sexual abuse” of Accuser-3 are irrelevant, inflammatory, and unduly prejudicial. The\nindictment is plainly insufficient to allege that Ms. Maxwell conspired to entice Accuser-3 to\ntravel, or to transport her in interstate or foreign commerce, let alone with the requisite intent.\nMoreover, the allegations regarding Accuser-3 have nothing to do with whether Ms. Maxwell\nconspired to violate § 2422(a) or § 2423(a) with respect to Accuser-l or Accuser-2. Thus, the\nonly explanation for the inclusion of alleged 2o-year-old allegations involving Accuser-3, and\nthe characterization of the alleged conduct as “sexual abuse,” is the likelihood that evidence\nsubmited in support of those allegations will have an unduly prejudicial effect and would not\nsurvive a balancing analysis under Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b).\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2684\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002687.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl46 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l2 of l6\n(quoting Grunewald v. United States, 353 U.S. 39l, 397 (l957)). Thus, whether Ms. Maxwell’s\nalleged conduct with respect to Minor Victim-3 constituted an overt act in furtherance of the\nalleged conspiracy depends on the scope of the alleged conspiracy.\n\nIn United States v. Hsia, 24 F. Supp. 2d l4 (D.D.C. l998), for example, the defendant\nwas charged with conspiracy, and causing false statements to be made to the Federal Election\nCommission, in connection with an alleged scheme to obtain illegal campaign contributions from\nforeign donors. The defendant moved to strike references in the indictment to acts of\nconcealment of the alleged conspiracy. The court expressed concern that “the allegations\nprovide litle detail about the acts” and that “references to the alleged acts of concealment and\ncover-up suggest the inclusion of offenses that are not part of the conspiracy charged in the\nindictment.” /d. at 25. Although the court denied the defendant’s motion to strike, it ordered a\nbill of particulars “as to the scope of the alleged conspiratorial agreement and in particular\nwhether and hou the acts of concealment alleged in the indictment were within the scope of the\nconspiracy charged.” /d. at 33. The court added that if the bill of particulars confirmed the\ndefendant’s assertion that the alleged acts of concealment and cover-up were not within the\nalleged scope of the conspiratorial agreement, her motion to strike would be granted. /d. at 26.\n\nHere, the object of the alleged conspiracies—necessarily, under the Mann Act—was not\nto cause any individual to engage in unlawful sex acts with Epstein, but to cause individuals to\ntravel to do so. The allegations regarding Accuser-3, even if proven, could not have furthered\nsuch alleged conspiracies. There is no basis for any reasonable inference that Epstein and Ms.\nMaxwell’s interactions with Accuser-3 in England furthered a conspiracy to cause Accuser-l,\nAccuser-2, or anyone else to travel. There is no allegation that Accuser-3 even knew Accuser-l\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2687\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002690.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl46 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l5 of l6\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court strike all\nreferences to Accuser-3 from Paragraph 7 of the indictment, and that the Court strike Paragraphs\n7c, lld, and l7d in their entirety.

No. l6o). On July l4, 2o2o, after extensive briefing and a lengthy hearing, this Court\nconcluded that the defendant posed a serious flight risk and that no condition or combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance in court. On December 28, 2o2o, after the defendant\nrenewed her motion for release on bail (the “Second Bail Motion”) by essentially restating her\nprior arguments and presenting a more significant and specific bail package, this Court issued a\nthorough opinion and again concluded that the defendant “plainly poses a risk of flight” and denied\nthe motion for “substantially the same reasons that the Court denied” her first motion for release.\n(Dkt. No. lo6 at l-2 (“Dec. Op.”)). The defendant appealed this Court’s December 2o2o decision\nto the Second Circuit, and that appeal remains pending. Nou, the defendant asks the Court yet\nagain to reconsider its decision, and proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the bail\npackage the Court previously considered and rejected. For the reasons set forth belou, the Motion\nshould be denied. First, the Court does not have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion—in\nwhich she asks this Court to reconsider its December opinion—because the defendant has appealed\nthat December opinion to the Second Circuit. Second, even assuming the Court had jurisdiction\nto grant this latest bail application, the Court should adhere to its prior rulings because the\ndefendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and the additional bail conditions proposed\nby the defendant do not justify reversal of the Court’s prior findings that no combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance. The defendant’s Third Bail Motion should be denied.\n\nI.

Ironically, her level of flight risk increases as the strength of government’s case\nagainst her diminishes. Ms. Maxwell has challenged the strength of the government’s case\nin pretrial motions pending before the Court. Among other things, Ms. Maxwell has\npersuasively argued that the Non-Prosecution Agreement entered into by Jeffrey Epstein in\n2oo7, which immunizes “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” bars Ms. Maxwell’s\nprosecution in this case, and that the counts charging her with alleged sexual abuse are\ntime-barred.\n\nThe government’s response to Ms. Maxwell’s pretrial motions shines further light\nof the weaknesses of its case. For example, the government concedes it cannot establish that\neither Ms. Maxwell or Epstein ever caused, or sought to cause, Accuser-3* to travel while she\nwas a minor or that she was underage when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein.\n(See Opp.l62-65 & fn. 57-58.)° Hence, her allegations cannot support the conspiracies charged\nin the Indictment, leaving the government with only two witnesses to prove the charges against\nMs. Maxwell. More importantly, in connection with the government’s response, it\nproduced documents indicating that government prosecutors misled a federal judge to\nobtain evidence against Ms. Maxwell (see, e.g.,. Opp. Ex. 4-7) - a shocking revelation that\nundermines the viability of the perjury counts, not to mention the integrity of the entire\n+ Accuser-3 is identified in the Indictment as “Minor Victim-3.”\n\n5 “Opp.” references are to page numbers of the Government’s Omnibus Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant’s\nPre-Trial Motions, dated February 26, 2o2l and not yet publicly filed.\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2788\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002816.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl83 Filed o3/26/2l Page5of7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nMarch 22, 2o2l\nPage 5 of 7\nthan impeachment, many of them are procurable from the Government and are thus improper\nsubjects of a Rule l7(c) subpoena, as explained belou.\n\nRequests 2 through 5 also seek communications from 2ol5 through the present between\nBSF, its co-counsel, and the U.S. Atorney about Jean Luc Brunel, who is presently incarcerated\nin France on charges of sex crimes and is one of Jeffrey Epstein and the Defendant’s\nco-conspirators. But Brunel does not appear to be relevant to any of the Government’s charges in\nthe indictment in this case, and, again, communications from 2ol5 are not relevant to conduct that\noccurred between l994 and l997. The Defendant thus seeks these communications, too, so that\nshe can fish for impeachment materials.\n\nRequests 6 and 7 seek contingency fee agreements or engagement leters between BSF and\nAnnie Farmer and her sister, Maria Farmer. Such documents are irrelevant. The fact that the\nFarmers are represented, and the terms of their representation, is not relevant to whether the\nDefendant commited the crimes of which she is accused. Even the impeachment value of such\ndocuments is speculative. Maria Farmer is not one of the minor victims described in the indictment,\nand thus may not be called to testify in this case. And in seeking to determine whether BSF has\ncontingency fee arrangements with the Farmers, the Defendant appears to seek to establish some\nmotive of BSF to drum up contingency fees by convincing women to falsely accuse the Defendant\nof criminal conduct. But BS¥’’s motive for representing the Farmers would not be relevant to the\nFarmers’ motives for testifying for the prosecution (if they testify).\n\nRequest 9 seeks the original, complete copy of Annie Farmer’s journal from when she was\na teenager for inspection and copying. But all potentially relevant pages were produced from this\njournal to the Defendant in civil discovery in another mater, as demonstrated by the Defendant’s\nability to atach those pages as Exhibit A to the Subpoena. The remainder of the journal has\nnothing to do with the Defendant or Jeffrey Epstein. And the Defendant cannot inspect it for the\npurpose of fishing for something that could be potentially relevant—it is her burden to identify\nrelevant and admissible evidence under Nixon. The Defendant also clearly seeks to use the journal\nfor impeachment purposes, as she highlighted in a prior filing in a recently dismissed civil action\nMs. Farmer filed against the Defendant. See Leter from L. Menninger to Hon. Debra C. Freeman\nat 2, Annie Farmer v. Darren K. Indyke, et al., l9-cv-lo475 (LGS-DCF) (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3o, 2o2o),\nECF No. lo8 (“[P]laintiff produced certain pages from a diary dated in early l996 which detailed,\nonly, that Jeffrey Epstein had held her hand in a movie theater in late l995 which made her feel\nuncomfortable. This same diary contained exactly zero references to Ghislaine Maxwell, contrary\nto the assertions in her Complaint . . . .” (emphasis in original)).\n\nRequest l2 for “EVCP Material” is not relevant to the Defendant’s defense. BSF submited\nclaims and supporting evidence to the Epstein Victim’s Compensation Program on behalf of\nseveral Epstein survivors who have not made separate claims against Maxwell. The Defendant\nmust demonstrate the relevance of all the evidence she seeks by means of a Rule l7(c) subpoena,\nnot merely that she could turn up something that is relevant and admissible.

Accordingly, the appropriate venire is the :\nWhite Plains master wheel.\ni. Relevant Community :\nThe most significant point of dispute between the parties is which counties constitute the\nrelevant community. According to Schulte, the relevant community must be the counties that\nfeed jurors to Manhatan because that is where his trial will be held. (Schulte Br. at 8; Schulte :\nReply at 3-5, ECF 454.) But the Government responds that the northern counties from which\nWhite Plains draws jurors represent the relevant community. (Gov’t Opp. Br. at 9-l4, l8.) The\nCourt agrees with the Government.\nAs a preliminary mater, it should be noted that the Southern District is not statutorily\ndivided into discrete divisions. See 28 U.S.C. § ll2. Rather, the statutory law prescribes one\nDistrict that is composed of the follouing counties: Bronx, Dutchess, New York, Orange,\nPutnam, Rockland, Sullivan, and Westchester. See id.

But Brunel does not appear to be relevant to any of the Government’s charges in\nthe indictment in this case, and, again, communications from 2ol5 are not relevant to conduct that\noccurred between l994 and l997. The Defendant thus seeks these communications, too, so that\nshe can fish for impeachment materials.\n\nRequests 6 and 7 seek contingency fee agreements or engagement leters between BSF and\nAnnie Farmer and her sister, Maria Farmer. Such documents are irrelevant. The fact that the\nFarmers are represented, and the terms of their representation, is not relevant to whether the\nDefendant commited the crimes of which she is accused. Even the impeachment value of such\ndocuments is speculative. Maria Farmer is not one of the minor victims described in the indictment,\nand thus may not be called to testify in this case. And in seeking to determine whether BSF has\ncontingency fee arrangements with the Farmers, the Defendant appears to seek to establish some\nmotive of BSF to drum up contingency fees by convincing women to falsely accuse the Defendant\nof criminal conduct. But BS/’’s motive for representing the Farmers would not be relevant to the\nFarmers’ motives for testifying for the prosecution (if they testify).\n\nRequest 9 seeks the original, complete copy of Annie Farmer’s journal from when she was\na teenager for inspection and copying. But all potentially relevant pages were produced from this\njournal to the Defendant in civil discovery in another mater, as demonstrated by the Defendant’s\nability to atach those pages as Exhibit A to the Subpoena. The remainder of the journal has\nnothing to do with the Defendant or Jeffrey Epstein. And the Defendant cannot inspect it for the\npurpose of fishing for something that could be potentially relevant—it is her burden to identify\nrelevant and admissible evidence under Nixon. The Defendant also clearly seeks to use the journal\nfor impeachment purposes, as she highlighted in a prior filing in a recently dismissed civil action\nMs. Farmer filed against the Defendant. See Leter from L. Menninger to Hon. Debra C. Freeman\nat 2, Annie Farmer v. Darren K. Indyke, et al., l9-cv-lo475 (LGS-DCF) (S.D.N.Y.

A plea agreement\n\nbinds only the office of the United States Atorney for the district in\n\nwhich the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the\n\nagreement contemplates a broader restriction.\nAnnabi, 77l F.2d at 672 (citations omited). Thus, under Annabi and its progeny, a plea agreement\nonly binds the U.S. Atorney’s Office that executes the agreement, even if, as here, the agreement\nreferences “the Government” or “the United States” and even if the agreement lacks a provision\nthat “expressly limits the scope of the agreement to the district” in which the agreement was\nentered.”\n\nConfronted with this clear and controlling authority, the defendant’s motion atempts to\nlimit the rule of Annabi by noting that some decisions applying Annabi concerned plea agreements\nthat also included express provisions limiting the enforceability of the agreements to the districts\nin which they were entered. (Def. Mot. l at 22). Essentially, the defendant argues that without an\nexpress provision limiting the scope of the agreement, every plea agreement should be interpreted\nto bind the entire federal government. But the law in this Circuit holds the opposite: the\npresumption is that a plea agreement in one district does not bind another, absent an affirmative\nappearance that the agreement extends more broadly. See Laskou, 688 F. Supp. at 854\n(“Defendant’s argument, in effect, is that unless there is an explicit statement to the contrary, it is\npresumed that a non-prosecution agreement binds offices of the United States Atorney that are\n> The defendant’s motion emphasizes that the Second Circuit has held, as a general mater, that\nplea agreements are construed against the Government. (Def. Mot. l. at l3). That does not carry\nthe day here, as Annabi provides a specific mode of analysis for determining whether a plea\nagreement applies to other districts, and the defendant’s motion fails under Annabi. More broadly,\nthe authorities the defendant cites for this general principle arise from circumstances in which a\ndefendant has sought to enforce his oun a plea agreement against the Government. (See, e.g., Def.\nMot. l at l3 (citing United States v. Feldman, 939 F.3d l82, l89 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (analyzing claim\nby defendant seeking to enforce promises he claimed prosecutors had made to him)). Notably, the\ndefendant has cited no authority for the proposition that plea agreements are to be construed in\nfavor of a third party who was not involved in plea negotiations.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2967\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002968.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 34 of 239\nnot parties to the agreement. This position is at odds with the law in this Circuit, which presumes\na narrou reading of the boundaries of a plea agreement unless a defendant can affirmatively\nestablish that a more expansive interpretation was contemplated.”’) (citing Annabi, 77l F.2d at\n672). To hold otherwise would turn Annabi on its head.\n\nThe defendant next argues that the follouing provision of the NPA evinces an intent to\n\nbind the entire federal government:\n\nIn consideration of Epstein’s agreement to plead guilty and to\n\nprovide compensation in the manner described above, if Epstein\n\nsuccessfully fulfills all of the terms and conditions of this\n\nagreement, the United States also agrees that it will not institute any\n\ncriminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,\n\nincluding but not limited to Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, Lesley\n\nGroff, or Nadia Marcinkova.\nNPA at 5; Def. Mot. l at 2o-2l. Aside from the <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to “United States” which, as noted\nabove, is insufficient, the defendant does not point to any language in this provision that\npurportedly binds other districts. Instead, she argues that the absence of language specifically\nlimiting this provision to the USAO-SDFL demonstrates an intent to bind the entire federal\ngovernment. This argument fails, for at least three reasons. First, the defendant’s argument inverts\nthe holding of Annabi: in this Circuit, the presumption is that plea agreements bind only the district\nin which they are entered, absent affirmative indications otherwise. Put differently, the absence\nof express limiting language in this provision is not an affirmative indication of a broader\napplication. Accordingly, under Second Circuit law, the absence of limiting language in this\nspecific provision provides no support for the defendant’s motion.\n\nSecond, the defendant’s argument acknouledges that the plain terms of the NPA\nimmunized Epstein from prosecution in “this District,” that is, the Southern District of Florida.\nSee NPA at 2 (“After timely fulfilling all the terms and conditions of the Agreement, no\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2968\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002969.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 35 of 239\nprosecution . . . will be instituted in this District”). In other words, the NPA was expressly limited\nto the USAO-SDFL.? Given this provision, it would be unnatural to read a broader application to\nother districts—based on no textual indicia—into the provision relating to co-conspirators.\nMoreover, the defendant’s reading of the NPA would require the Court to adopt the view that,\nwhere a plea agreement contains limiting terms, they must be repeated in every paragraph in order\nto have their natural and common-sense effects.\n\nThird, and perhaps most importantly, the defendant’s interpretation strains common sense.\nIn order to accept the defendant’s arguments, the Court would have to reach the counterintuitive\nconclusion that Epstein expressly bargained for broader immunity for his co-conspirators than he\ndid for himself. That is, under the defendant’s reading of the agreement, Epstein bargained to\nprotect co-conspirators nationally for crimes they commited with Epstein, but Epstein only sought\nprotection for himself in the Southern District of Florida. The text of the agreement does not\nsupport such a puzzling interpretation. Instead, the more natural reading of the NPA is that its\nrepeated references to the U.S. Atorney’s Office and “this District” reflect a universal limitation\non the NPA: it applies only to the USAO-SDFL.\n\nFinally, at several points in her motion, the defendant emphasizes that the NPA contains\nthe word “global,” but she does not appear to argue that this creates an affirmative appearance that\nthe NPA binds other districts. (Def. Mot. l at 9, l2). Nor could she. The phrase “Epstein seeks\nto resolve globally his state and federal liability,” by its terms, refers to Epstein’s liability alone.\nSee NPA at 2. Moreover, this language appears directly after several paragraphs describing\ninvestigations conducted by the Florida State Atorney’s Office and the USAO-SDFL. See id. at\nl-2. Thus, in this context, the terms “global” and “state and federal liability” plainly refer to\n> In fact, the NPA states that it was executed ‘on the authority of R. Alexander Acosta, United\nStates Atorney for the Southern District of Florida.” NPA at 2.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2969\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002971.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 37 of 239\n\nThe privilege log also does not establish that the USAO-SDFL involved other U.S.\nAtorney’s Offices in plea negotiations with Epstein. Grasping at straws, the defendant points to\na notation in the privilege log, which contains an entry for handwriten notes, reflecting that the\nprosecutor in the USAO-SDFL spoke with an Assistant U.S. Atorney in New York. (Def. Mot. l\nat 22). The notes referenced in the privilege log are atached hereto as Exhibit l. As the notes\nreflect, the prosecutor at the USAO-SDFL reached out to an Assistant U.S. Atorney at the USAO-\nSDNY to ask about a civil lawsuit relating to Epstein that was handled by the Civil Division of\nthis Office in the l99os. The Government is producing to defense counsel today emails that\nconfirm that this was the nature of the contact.*> One of those emails is atached hereto as Exhibit\n2 for the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span>. Put simply, those communications provide no indication that the\nUSAO-SDNY was involved in plea negotiations with Epstein. Rather, the USAO-SDFL asked\nabout an old civil case involving Epstein that an AUSA at the USAO-SDNY happened to handle\nyears earlier. In sum, the privilege log in no way establishes that other districts were involved in\nnegotiating the NPA, much less that Epstein was promised that the NPA would bind other districts.\n\nThe defendant proffers no other documentary evidence beyond the privilege log. Instead,\nwithout any citation, she broadly alleges that “senior levels of Main Justice were directly involved\nin the negotiation and approval of the NPA.” (Def. Mot. l. at 22). This vague and unsworn\nallegation is not evidence. Moreover, any contacts between the USAO-SDFL and Main Justice\n> In response to the allegations raised by the defense’s motion, the Government identified the\nunderlying notes referenced in the privilege log. The Government is producing those underlying\nnotes, as well as the relevant emails, to defense counsel today. The Government has also been\ninformed by a human resources representative that payroll records reflect that the Assistant U.S.\nAtorney referenced in the privilege log left the USAO-SDNY on or about April 29, 2oo7, months\nbefore the NPA was executed. Although the Government has been informed that Human\nResources records do not contain information regarding a division transfer, the Government\nunderstands from colleagues that the Assistant U.S. Atorney worked in the Civil Division in the\nl99os and worked in the Criminal Division in the 2ooos.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR- oooo297l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002982.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 48 of 239\nOPR Report at l67.'° After reviewing the facts and circumstances of the negotiation, OPR\nconcluded that “the evidence does not shou that [Former USAO-SDFL U.S. Atorney Alex]\nAcosta, [Former USAO-SDFL supervisor Andrew] Lourie, or Villafafia agreed to the\nnonprosecution provision to protect any of Epstein’s political, celebrity, or other influential\nassociates.” OPR Report at l68.\"\n\nIn view of OPR’s conclusions—and in the absence of any evidence to the contrary\nproffered by the defendant—the defendant has failed to establish that that she was an intended\nthird party beneficiary of the NPA. Accordingly, the defendant lacks standing to enforce the NPA.\n\nC. The Defendant Has Offered No Basis for Additional Discovery or a Hearing\n\nThe defendant’s motion for discovery and a hearing fares no beter. Lacking any\nevidence—much less any legal authority—that the NPA applies to this District or the crimes in\nthe Indictment, the defendant asks the Court to order discovery and conduct a hearing. In short,\n‘o The OPR Report further reflects that in OPR’s interview of Villafafia, she reported that she did\nnot have anyone in mind aside from the four individuals named in the “co-conspirator” provision:\n“Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to include a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-\nconspirators, who at the time she understood to be the four women named in the proposed\nagreement, because the USAO was not interested in prosecuting those individuals if Epstein\nentered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, ‘[W]e considered Epstein to be the top of the food chain, and\nwe wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone else.’ She did not consider the possibility\nthat Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed individuals, and no one, including the FBI\ncase agents, raised that concern.” OPR Report at 7o. Further, the OPR Report notes that:\n“Villafafia told OPR that, apart from the women named in the NPA, the investigation had not\ndeveloped evidence of ‘any other potential co-conspirators.’” Jd. at 8l. Similarly, the report\nreflects that a supervisor at USAO-SDFL told OPR “that it never occurred to him that the <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span>\nto potential co-conspirators was directed touard any of the high-profile individuals who were at\nthe time or subsequently linked with Epstein.” OPR Report at 8o-8l.\n\n'! Although the defendant correctly notes that the OPR Report reflects that the prosecutor remarked\nthat Epstein “wanted to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame for what happened,”\nOPR Report at l67, that desire explains the existence of the “co-conspirator” provision, but it does\nnot inform its meaning or scope.\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2982\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003050.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll6 of 239\ncourt modified the protective order and issued a 26-page decision. The Government acted in\nreasonable reliance on the district court’s decision.\n\nThe defendant argues that the Government misled the Court when it “claimed not to knou\nwhat was in Boies Schiller’s file and that Boies Schiller had no role in instigating the investigation\nof Maxwell.” (Def. Mot. ll at l). The defendant’s claims are both factually inaccurate and\nmeritless.\n\nFirst, the Government did not mislead Chief Judge McMahon about its contacts with Boies\nSchiller. As an initial mater, Maxwell’s argument is premised solely on her use of selective\nsnippets from a lone Daily News Article that is premised, in meaningful part, on anonymous\nsources and hearsay. As the factual background set forth above—which is corroborated by notes\nand correspondence produced alongside this brief—makes clear, David Boies and Boies Schiller\nplayed no role in initiating, let alone “fomenting” the Government’s investigation. That\ninvestigation was opened more than two and a half years after the last knoun contact between any\nlawyer associated with any civil counsel for Giuffre and, in any event, was initially focused on\nEpstein, not this defendant. As detailed above, the USAO-SDNY opened the instant investigation\nin late November 2ol8 shortly after the Miami Herald published a series of articles about Epstein.\nAUSA-l was not involved in that decision, which in any event had nothing to do with a meeting\nthat had taken place nearly three years prior.*? (Ex. 4 at 6).\n°° Maxwell repeatedly claims that Boies Schiller urged AUSA-l to open an investigation of\nEpstein and Maxwell, (Def. Mot. 3 at 8), but that allegation, which is supported by nothing aside\nfrom the above-referenced media report, is incorrect. While AUSA-l did meet with the three\natorneys in February 2ol6, she understood the atorneys to be focused on Epstein, and not on\nEpstein and Maxwell as a “duo.” (Ex. 4 at l, 4). The presentation to AUSA-l focused on urging\nan investigation into Epstein with only passing references to Maxwell. Simply put, the pitch was\nto investigate Epstein, not Maxwell.\n\n89\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o5o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003117.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l83 of 239\nregarding hou the defendant is alleged to have commited the crimes charged in Counts One\nthrough Four.

Indeed, “by providing Defendant with a narrative of the\nmanner in which Defendant is alleged to have commited the charged offenses, the Indictment\nprovides Defendant with more detail than is strictly necessary” under the governing law. United\nStates v. Kozel, No. l9 Cr. 46o (KMW), 2o2o WL 475l498, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.

Bunn, l54 F. App’x 227, 229 (2d Cir.\n2oo5). Counts Two and Four, charging violations of l8 U.S.C §2422 and § 2243, respectively,\nsimilarly contain the elements of those offenses and adequately inform the defendant of the charges\n°° Alternatively, the defendant claims that the acts listed throughout the Indictment do not\nconstitute illegal behavior. In this vein, the defendant makes specific <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to “grooming” as\nconduct that is not illegal. (Def. Mot. l2 at 4). The defendant cites no authority for this argument,\nwhich is contrary to Second Circuit law. In particular, the Second Circuit has for many years\nfound grooming behavior to be a means to “persuade, induce, or entice” minors to engage in illegal\nsexual activity. See, e.g., United States v. Thompson, 896 F.3d l55, l73 (2d Cir. 2ol8) (“Our\nprecedent, houever, supports applying a broad definition of enticement in this context: that\ndefinition would reasonably include Thompson’s grooming of the minor victims to act as he\ndesired with regard to many maters over the months before he made the video.”); United States v.\nDorvee, 6l6 F.3d l74, l8o (2d Cir. 2olo) (“We do not believe that the district court was clearly\nerroneous in finding, as a mater of fact, that these images were sent as part of a grooming process\nto persuade the agent to engage in the type of sexual conduct depicted in the images.” (internal\nquotation marks and citation omited)); United States v. Brand, 467 F.3d l79, 2o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6)\n(“Brand’s sexual advances and grooming behavior provide additional evidence in support of the\njury’s finding that Brand atempted to entice a minor.”’). In any event, whether grooming alone\nconstitutes a crime is immaterial to the instant motion, and it will be for the jury to decide whether\nthe evidence at trial, as a whole, establishes the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nl56\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ll7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003118.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l84 of 239\nagainst her. The Indictment also cites the relevant state criminal statute under which the defendant\nis charged constituting “sexual activity” within the language of both § 2422 and § 2243,\nspecifically, violations of New York Penal Law § l3o.55. Indictment 4 ll(b), l3, l7(b), l9. The\ndefendant cites no authority for her suggestion that by providing additional detail regarding hou\nthe defendant commited the charged crimes, the Government is somehou required to provide\neven more specificity beyond the basic elements of the crimes charged. Absent any such authority,\nand where there is no suggestion that the Indictment fails to allege the essential elements of each\ncrime charged, there is no basis to dismiss any of the counts in the Indictment.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the defendant’s sufficiency challenges to the Indictment fail as\na mater of law, and her motion to dismiss Counts One through Four should be denied.\nVIII. There Is No Basis to Strike Any Portion of the Indictment\n\nThe defendant moves to strike any <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to Minor Victim-3 from the Indictment,\nclaiming that—contrary to the plain terms of the Indictment—the events involving Minor Victim-\n3 are unrelated to the conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three and that some of that the\nallegations regarding Minor Victim-3 are unduly prejudicial. (Def. Mot. 6). The motion is\nbaseless. First, as the Indictment itself makes clear, the defendant’s and Epstein’s interactions\nwith Minor Victim-3 were part of a broader scheme and agreement to entice and transport minor\nvictims with intent to commit illegal sex acts. Even if Minor Victim-3 was not ultimately\ntransported as a minor, the core of a conspiracy is an agreement to engage in criminal conduct;\nthere is no legal requirement that the agreed upon crime be completed. Although Minor Victim-\n3’s experiences cannot alone form the basis of a timely substantive charge, both charged\nconspiracies include timely overt acts, and it is well established that a charged conspiracy can\nencompass otherwise time-barred acts so long as at least one overt act in furtherance of the\n\nl57\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ll8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003119.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l85 of 239\nconspiracy is timely. Second, the description of Minor Victim-3’s experiences in the Indictment\nis no more inflammatory or prejudicial than those regarding Minor Victim-l and Minor Victim-2.\nFinally, even if evidence regarding Minor Victim-3 were not admissible as direct evidence of the\ncharged conspiracies—which it is—that evidence will be admissible under Federal Rule of\nEvidence 4o4(b) to prove the defendant’s knouledge, intent, and modus operandi. Accordingly,\nthe motion to strike references to Minor Victim-3 as surplusage should be denied.\n\nA. Relevant Facts\n\nAs alleged in the Indictment, Minor Victim-3 was one of the minor girls whom the\ndefendant groomed to engage in sexual activity with Jeffrey Epstein. Minor Victim-3 was born in\nae. At trial, the Government expects that Minor Victim-3 will testify,°° in substance\nand in part, that when she was a. she met the defendant. After meeting Minor Victim-\n3, the defendant befriended Minor Victim-3 by, among other things, discussing Minor Victim-3’s\nlife and family with Minor Victim-3. As a result, the defendant came to knou Minor Victim-3’s\nee\nee\nee\nee\nee\nee\n°6 While the Government is proffering these facts for purposes of this Motion, the underlying\ninformation, which is contained in the FBI 3o2 reports of interviews with Minor Victim-3, will be\nproduced to the defense as 35oo material in advance of trial.\n\nl58\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ll9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003123.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l89 of 239\npublic, and so punishable in itself”). Indeed, “[i]t is well setled that the essential elements of\nthe crime of conspiracy are: (l) that the defendant agreed with at least one other person to commit\nan offense; (2) the defendant knouingly participated in the conspiracy with the specific intent to\ncommit the offenses that were the objects of the conspiracy; and (3) that during the existence of\nthe conspiracy, at least one of the overt acts set forth in the indictment was commited by one or\nmore of the members of the conspiracy in furtherance of the objectives of the conspiracy.” United\nStates v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88, l45-46 (2d Cir. l998).\n\nBecause a conspiracy does not require the completion of a substantive crime, it does not\nmater whether Minor Victim-3 was ever in fact transported as a minor, or whether the elements\nof the substantive crimes of transportation an enticement are satisfied as to her. See Salinas, 522\nU.S. at 65. What maters is whether the Indictment properly alleges that the defendant agreed to\nparticipate in schemes to transport and entice minors to travel with the intent that an illegal sex act\nwould be commited, and whether the allegations at issue are relevant and admissible evidence of\nthat conspiracy. Here, that is plainly the case. As alleged, the defendant’s participation in\nrecruiting and grooming Minor Victim-3 to engage in sex acts as a minor with Epstein during the\nperiod charged in the Indictment, is itself evidence of the defendant’s agreements with Epstein to\nidentify minor girls to entice and transport for purposes of illegal sex acts.*’ Moreover, the\n>’ The defendant takes issue with the Indictment’s <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to these sex acts as “abuse” because,\nshe asserts, Minor Victim-3 was above the age of consent in the United Kingdom at the time they\noccurred. The description in the Indictment is factually accurate, houever, because Minor Victim-\n3 will testify to her subjective experience of these acts with a much older man as traumatic,\nexploitative, and abusive at trial. While the Government will be careful to avoid suggesting to the\njury that any consensual act commited after Minor Victim-3 was at or above the age of consent\nwas itself criminal (as opposed to evidence of the charged conspiracies), to the extent defense\ncounsel wishes to request a particular limiting instruction or to seek authorization for a particular\nline of cross-examination regarding the legality of any sex acts that took place in London, the\nappropriate forum to do so is in a motion in limine.\n\nl62\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l23\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003126.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l92 of 239\nthe Court informing the jury that, to convict on any conspiracy count, it must find at least one overt\nact in furtherance of the conspiracy that occurred within the statute of limitations.

Villafafia suggested meeting with the PBPD, but the case agent explained that before\nformally presenting the case to the FBI, the PBPD wanted to see hou the State Atorney’s Office\ndecided to charge Epstein.\n\nl. The PBPD Presents the Mater to the FBI and the USAO\n\nIn May 2oo6, the lead Detective handling the state’s investigation met with Villafafia and\nthe FBI case agent to summarize for them the information learned during the state’s\ninvestigation.'* At the time, neither Villafafia nor the case agent had heard of Epstein or had any\nknouledge of his background.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, during this meeting, the Detective expressed concern that “pressure\nhad been brought to bear on . . . Krischer by Epstein’s atorneys,” and he and Chief Reiter were\nconcerned the state would charge Epstein with only a misdemeanor or not at all.'? The Detective\nexplained that the defense had hired private investigators to trail Reiter and the Detective, had\nraised claims of various improprieties by the police, and, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated\nthe removal of the Assistant State Atorney initially assigned to handle the mater, who was viewed\nas an aggressive prosecutor, by hiring a defense atorney whose relationship with the Assistant\nState Atorney created a conflict of interest for the prosecutor. Further, given the missing computer\nequipment and surveillance camera videotapes, the Detective believed Epstein may have been\n“tipped off’ in advance about the search warrant.\n\nDuring the meeting, Villafafia reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could\nbe brought against Epstein. She focused on l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticement of minors into\nprostitution or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of interstate or foreign commerce\nto persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423\n(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct). As they discussed these charges, the\nDetective told Villafafia that Epstein and his assistants had traveled out of the Palm Beach\nInternational Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs sometimes referred to\npassengers as “female” without a name or age, which the Detective suspected might be references\nto underage girls. Houever, the Detective acknouledged that he was unable to confirm that\nsuspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls interstate\nor internationally. Nevertheless, Villafafia believed Epstein could be prosecuted federally, in part\nbecause of his oun interstate and international travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse\ngirls. Villafafia discussed with the Detective and the case agent the additional investigation needed\nto prove violations of the federal statutes she had identified. She told them that if the evidence\nsupported it, the case could be prosecuted federally, but she assured them that opening a federal\ninvestigation would not preclude the State Atorney’s Office from charging Epstein should it\nchoose to do so.\n\nl8 The Detective died in May 2ol8.\nl9 In his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein mater to the FBI, a Toun of Palm\nBeach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims\nwere not believable and “Palm Beach solves its oun problems.”\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003223.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 47 of 348\n\nOn July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia alerted Sloman, who informed Acosta, that the State Atorney’s\nOffice had charged and arrested Epstein.” On that same day, the FBI in West Palm Beach formally\nopened the case, assigning the case agent and, later, a co-case agent, to investigate it. Villafafia\ntold Sloman that the FBI agents “are geting copies of all of the evidence and we are going to\nreview everything at [the] FBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her target date for filing federal\ncharges against Epstein was August 25, 2oo6. Acosta emailed Sloman, asking whether it was\n“appropriate to approach [State Atorney Krischer] and give him a heads up re where we might\ngo?” Sloman replied, “No for fear that it will be leaked straight to Epstein.””°\n\nAlthough Lourie learned of the case at this point from Sloman, and eventually took a more\nactive role in supervising the investigation, Villafafia continued to update Acosta and Sloman\ndirectly on the progress of the case.*° Villafafia’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach had\nlitle involvement in supervising the Epstein investigation, and at times, Villafafia directed her\nemails to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie without copying her immediate supervisor. In the\nimmediate supervisor’s view, houever, “Miami” purposefully assumed all the “authority” for the\ncase, which the immediate supervisor regarded as “highly unusual.”*!\n\nBy late August 2oo6, Villafafia and the FBI had identified several additional victims and\nobtained “some flight manifests, telephone messages, and cell phone records that shou the\ncommunication and travel in interstate commerce” by Epstein and his associates. Villafafia\nreported to her supervisors that the State Atorney’s Office would not provide transcripts from the\nstate grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convince him to\nrelinquish the evidence to the FBI.” Villafafia also told her supervisors that she expected “a\nnumber of fights” over her document demands, and that some parties were refusing to comply\n“after having contact with Epstein or his atorneys.”\n\nVillafafia’s <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to anticipated “fights” and lack of compliance led Sloman to ask\nwhether she was referring to the victims. Villafafia responded that the problems did not involve\nvictims, but rather a former employee of Epstein and some business entities that had objected to\ndocument demands as overly burdensome. Villafafia explained to Sloman and Lourie that some\nvictims were “scared and/or embarrassed,” and some had been intimidated by the defense, but\n“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.” Villafafia\na8 On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafafia had not yet briefed about the case, noting that\nOperation Leap Year was “a highly sensitive case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”\n\n28 During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was\nlikely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some\ntype of relationship between somebody in the [State Atorney’s Office] and the defense team.”\n“o After Villafafia sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her mmediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman,\nand Acosta on August 23, 2oo6, Lourie emailed Sloman: “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the\ncase?” Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care. If Alex says something then I'll tell her to just run it\nthrough you guys.”\n3l OPR understood “Miami” to be a <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to the senior managers who were located in the Miami office,\nthat is, Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel. Records shou, and Villafafia told OPR, that she believed Epstein’s atorneys\n“made a conscious decision to skip” her immediate supervisor and directed their communications to the supervisory\nchain above the immediate supervisor—Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta.\n\n2l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3223\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003230.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 54 of 348\n\nthe FBI squad supervisor on May 9, 2oo7, to explain that charges against Epstein would not be\nquickly approved, he reported to Menchel that the FBI was “not happy” about the delay, adding,\n“T did not even tell them I think we should bring [Epstein] in, once we decide to charge him, and\noffer a pre-indictment deal, figuring a judge might never agree to such a deal post indictment. That\nwould have sent them thru the roof.” Lourie explained to OPR that he thought a judge, after seeing\nan indictment charging the full nature and scope of Epstein’s conduct, might not agree to a plea\ninvolving substantially less time or to dismiss substantive charges.\"!\n\nLourie told OPR that despite Oosterban’s favorable opinion of the case, “[t]his was...a\nbit of uncharted territory,” involving facts that were unlike the case law Oosterban had cited.\nAlthough Lourie had some concerns about the legal issues and about the witnesses, he “probably”\ndid not see any impediment to going forward with the case; in fact, Lourie “was not in favor of\nwalking away, which is what the defense wanted [the USAO] to do.” But while Lourie “thought\nwe could have won and we could have prevailed through appeal,” he “didn’t think the odds were\nnearly as good as you want in a criminal case, and . . . the things that we had to gain [through a\nplea agreement] were much more than [in] a normal criminal case,” in which the only cost of a\nloss would be that the defendant did not go to jail. Lourie told OPR that to the best of his\nrecollection, he thought a plea agreement would be a good result, and although the government\nmight have to “give up some jail time,” there were other benefits to a plea, such as the ability to\nrequire Epstein to register as a sex offender and the availability of monetary damages for the\nvictims. Lourie recalled “thinking that this case should setle and we should set it up so we can\nsetle it” by, for example, charging Epstein by complaint and then negotiating a plea to limited\ncharges in a criminal information. Villafafia told OPR that she agreed with Lourie that a criminal\ncomplaint charging an “omnibus conspiracy” containing “all of the information related to what the\ncase was about” would be a good way to “get things moving” touard a pre-indictment plea.\n\nAlthough Lourie and Villafafia believed a pre-indictment plea agreement was a desired\nresolution, there was no guarantee that Epstein would agree to plead guilty, and they continued to\nwork together to shape an indictment. On May lo, 2oo7, Lourie emailed Villafafia:\n\n[Marie\n\nI believe that Epstein’s at[orneys] are scared of the victims they\n\ndon’t knou. Epstein has no doubt told them that there were many.\n\nThus I believe the flir]st indictment should contain only the victims\n\nthey have nothing on at all.

Thoughts?”\n4 Lourie explained to OPR that the government’s dismissal of counts in an indictment required the court’s\napproval, and that, while “it’s rare,” it was possible that a judge, seeing the nature and extent of Epstein’s conduct as\nset forth in an extensive indictment, might not allou substantive counts to be dismissed.\n2 Lourie’s references to MySpace pages and “prior testimony” referred to the impeachment information\nbrought forward by defense counsel.\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo323o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003251.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 75 of 348\nVillafafia, Menchel left the meeting after almost no discussion, leaving Villafafia “shocked and\nstunned.”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall the July 26, 2oo7 meeting. Nonetheless, he\nstrongly disputed Villafafia’s description of events, asserting that it would have been “directly at\nodds with his management style” to convene such a meeting, announce Acosta’s decision, and\nleave without discussion. Acosta told OPR that he had “decided and endorsed this resolution at\nsome point,” but he did not recall being aware that Menchel was going to announce the decision\nat the July 26 meeting; in addition, although Acosta did not recall the circumstances of Menchel’s\nrelaying of that decision, he said it “would have been consistent with” his decision for Menchel to\ndo so. Neither Sloman nor Lourie recalled the meeting. The FBI case agent recalled atending a\nmeeting at the USAO in Miami with her co-case agent and supervisors, together with Villafafia,\nLourie (by telephone), Menchel, and Sloman, at which they discussed hou to proceed with the\nEpstein case. According to the case agent, at this meeting the FBI insisted that Epstein be\nregistered for life as a sexual offender, and the co-case agent advocated for waiting until the court\nhad ruled on the USAO’s ability to obtain Epstein’s computer equipment.\n\nRegardless of exactly hou Acosta’s decision regarding the two-year term was\ncommunicated to Villafafia and the FBI agents, and regardless of who initially proposed the\nspecific term, the record shous that Acosta ultimately made the decision to offer Epstein a\nresolution that included a two-year term of imprisonment, as he acknouledged.”\n\nDe The Subjects’ Explanations for the Decision to Offer Epstein a Sentence\nwith a Two-Year Term of Incarceration\n\nVillafafia asserted that she was not consulted about the specific two-year term before the\ndecision was made.” Villafafia told OPR that she had worked hard to develop a strong case, and\nnone of her supervisors had identified to her any specific problem with the case that, in her view,\nexplained the decision to extend an offer for a two-year sentence. Villafafia also told OPR that\nMenchel provided no explanation for this decision during the July 26, 2oo7 meeting, and Villafafia\ndid not ask for an explanation because she accepted his statement that it was Acosta’s decision.\nVillafafia described the proposal as “random,” and told OPR, “[W]e’re all [sentencing] guidelines\npeople, so 24 months just makes no sense in the context of the guidelines. There’s no way to get\nto 24 months with this set of offenses.”*°\nl8 OPR notes that Villafafia did not appear hesitant to send emails to her supervisors seting forth her views and\nobjections, and there is no <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> before this meeting in any of her emails indicating that a decision had been made\nto offer a two-year term of incarceration. Therefore, given that a meeting had been arranged involving Menchel and\nVillafafia, and possibly most of the other primary USAO and FBI participants, it seems logical that Acosta made a\ndecision to resolve the case with a two-year state plea not long before the meeting.\n\n2 OPR found no evidence in the documentary record indicating that Villafafia had knouledge of Acosta’s\ndecision or the two-year term before the July 26, 2oo7 meeting at which she said she learned of it.\n8o From the time the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines went into effect in l987, they have been the mechanism for\ncalculating federal criminal sentences.

He specified that “a\ntwo-year term of state imprisonment” was the minimum sentence that would satisfy the federal\ninterest in the case. (Emphasis added.) With regard to the option of a federal plea, Menchel wrote\nthat the USAO “would be willing to explore a federal conviction” and retained the <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to a\nRule ll(c) plea. Menchel also removed the <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to the specific state offenses to which Epstein\nwould be required to plead guilty. Menchel forwarded the redraft to Acosta, suggesting that they\nspeak about it the next morning, as well as to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia.\n\nThe final leter, as shoun on the follouing pages, was identical to Menchel’s redraft, except\nthat it omited all <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to a federal plea under Rule ll(c).”!\na Menchel told OPR that he did not disfavor Rule ll(c) pleas but knew that the USAO believed the judges\nwere generally averse to them.

In a September 6, 2oo7 email, Villafafia told Sloman that she and Menchel had discussed a\nRule ll(c) plea, but she opined that Menchel “must have asked Alex about it and it was nixed.” Villafafia told OPR\nthat Lourie, too, had told her Acosta did not want to do a Rule ll(c) plea.\n\n56\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3258\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003272.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 96 of 348\nevidence of a violation of the agreement.

Villafafia also told\nLefkouitz she was willing to ask Acosta again to approve a federal plea to a five-year conspiracy\nwith a Rule ll(c) binding recommendation for a 2o-month sentence. Villafafia explained:\n\nAs to timing, it is my understanding that Mr. Epstein needs to be\nsentenced in the state after he is sentenced in the federal case, but\nnot that he needs to plead guilty and be sentenced after serving his\nfederal time. Andy recommended that some of the timing issues be\naddressed only in the state agreement, so that it isn’t obvious to the\njudge that we are trying to create federal jurisdiction for prison\npurposes.\n\nWith regard to prosecution of individuals other than Epstein, Villafafia suggested standard\nfederal plea agreement language regarding the resolution of all criminal liability, ‘and I will\nmention ‘co-conspirators,’ but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes\nand all of the other persons that we could charge.” Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to\ninclude a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-conspirators, who at the time she understood\nto be the four women named in the proposed agreement, because the USAO was not interested in\nprosecuting those individuals if Epstein entered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, “[W]e considered\nEpstein to be the top of the food chain, and we wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone\nelse.” She did not consider the possibility that Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed\nindividuals, and no one, including the FBI case agents, raised that concern. Villafafia also told\nOPR that her <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to “all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge”\nrelated to her concern that if the plea agreement contained information about uncharged conduct,\nthe court might ask for more information about that conduct and inquire why it had not been\ncharged, and if the government provided such information, Epstein’s atorneys might claim the\nagreement was breached.!\"\n\nWith regard to immigration, Villafafia told OPR that the USAO generally did not take any\nposition in plea agreements on immigration issues, and that in this case, there was no evidence that\neither of the two assistants who were foreign nationals had commited fraud in connection with\ntheir immigration paperwork, “and I think that they were both in status. So there wasn’t any reason\nM3 OPR understood Villafafia’s concern to be that if the government were required to respond to a court’s inquiry\ninto additional facts, Epstein would object that the government was trying to cast him in a negative light in order to\ninfluence the court to impose a sentence greater than the agreed-upon term.\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3272\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003283.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo7 of 348\nfederal court. Sloman similarly said that he had the impression that the non-prosecution provision\nwas meant to protect named co-conspirators who were also victims, “in a sense,” of Epstein’s\nconduct. Although later press coverage of the Epstein case focused on Epstein’s connection to\nprominent figures and suggested that the non-prosecution provision protected these individuals,\nSloman told OPR that it never occurred to him that the <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to potential co-conspirators was\ndirected touard any of the high-profile individuals who were at the time or subsequently linked\nwith Epstein.'”° Acosta did not recall the provision or any discussions about it. He speculated\nthat if he read the non-prosecution provision, he likely assumed that Villafafia and Lourie had\n“thought this through” and “addressed it for a reason.” The West Palm Beach manager, who had\nonly limited involvement at this stage, told OPR that the provision was “highly unusual,” and he\nhad “‘no clue” why the USAO agreed to it.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, apart from the women named in the NPA, the investigation had\nnot developed evidence of “any other potential co-conspirators. So, . . . we wouldn’t be\nprosecuting anybody else, so why not include it? ... I just didn’t think that there was anybody\nthat it would cover.” She conceded, houever, that she “did not catch the fact that it could be read\nas broadly as people have since read it.”\n\nK. The USAO Rejects Defense Efforts to Eliminate the Sexual Offender\n\nRegistration Requirement\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, State Atorney Krischer informed\nVillafafia that Epstein’s counsel had contacted him and Epstein was ready to agree “to all the\nterms” of the NPA—except for sexual offender registration. According to Krischer, defense\ncounsel had proposed that registration be deferred, and that Epstein register only if state or federal\nlaw enforcement felt, at any point during his service of the sentence, that he needed to do so.\nKrischer noted that he had “reached out” to Acosta about this proposal but had not heard back\nfrom him. Villafafia responded, “T think Alex is calling you nou.” Villafafia told OPR that, to her\nknouledge, Acosta called Krischer to tell him that registration was not a negotiable term. !*°\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia emailed Krischer for information about the amount of “gain\ntime” Epstein would earn in state prison. Villafafia explained in her email that she wanted to\ninclude a provision in the NPA specifying that Epstein “will actually be in jail at least a certain\nnumber of days to make sure he doesn’t try to ‘convince’ someone with the Florida prison\nauthorities to let him out early.” Krischer responded that under the proposal as it then stood,\nEpstein would serve l5 months. He also told Villafafia that a plea to a registrable offense would\nnot prevent Epstein from serving his time “at the stockade”—the local minimum security detention\nfacility.!?7\nl25 Sloman also pointed out that the NPA was not a “global resolution” and other co-conspirators could have\nbeen prosecuted “by any other [U.S. Atorney’s] office in the country.”\n\nl26 Krischer told OPR that he did not recall meeting or having interactions with Acosta regarding the Epstein\ncase or any other mater.\nal The State Atorney concluded his email: “Glad we could get this worked out for reasons I won’t put in\nwriting. After this is resolved I would love to buy you a cup at Starbucks and have a conversation.” Villafafia\nresponded, “Sounds great.” When asked about this exchange during her OPR interview, Villafafia said: “Everybody\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3283\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003286.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page llo of 348\nThe parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part of\nany public record.

SEPTEMBER 24, 2oo7: ACOSTA MAKES FINAL EDITS, AND THE NPA IS\n\nSIGNED\n\nThe contemporaneous emails shou that Villafafia continued to update Acosta as the parties\nnegotiated the final language and that Acosta reviewed and edited the NPA. Shortly after midnight\non Monday, September 24, 2oo7, Acosta sent Villafafia “[s]mall edits” to the “final” NPA she had\nsent to him. Among his changes was language modifying provisions that appeared to require the\nState Atorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein\nenter his guilty plea by a certain date. Acosta explained in his email, “I’m not comfortable with\nrequiring the State Atorney to enter into a [joint sentencing] recommendation” or “requiring a\nState court to stick with our timeline” for entry of the guilty plea and sentencing. Accordingly,\nAcosta substituted language that required Epstein alone to make a binding sentencing\nrecommendation to the state court, and required Epstein to use his “best efforts” to enter his guilty\nplea and be sentenced by the specified dates. Acosta also instructed Villafafia to restore a <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span>\nto Epstein’s wish “to reach a global resolution of his state and federal criminal liabilities.” Lourie,\nwho had returned to the Department in Washington, D.C., had a phone conversation with\nLefkouitz and sent additional comments on the final draft to Acosta and Villafafia. Villafafia sent\na new revision, incorporating edits from Acosta and Lourie, to Lefkouitz later that morning.\n\nOn the afternoon of September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia circulated the new “final” version of\nthe NPA to Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other supervisors, and asked Lefkouitz to send her the\nsigned agreement. After Lefkouitz electronically transmited to Villafafia a copy of the NPA\nsigned by Epstein, she emailed her immediate supervisor and her co-counsel: “They have scanned\nand emailed the signed agreement. It is done.”\n\nIn his transmital email, Lefkouitz asked Villafafia to “[p]lease do whatever you can to\nkeep this from becoming public.” Villafafia responded:\n\nI have forwarded your message only to Alex, Andy, and [the West\n\nPalm Beach manager]. I don’t anticipate it going any further than\n\nthat. When I receive the originals, I will sign and return one copy\n\nto you. The other will be placed in the case file, which will be kept\n\nconfidential since it also contains identifying information about the\n\ngirls.\n\nWhen we reach an agreement about the atorney representative for\n\nthe girls, we can discuss what I can tell him and the girls about the\nl28 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Lourie observed that because the NPA contained names of uncharged\nco-conspirators and other protected information, the USAO would have a duty to redact the information before\ndisclosing the NPA.\n\n84\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3286\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003303.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l27 of 348\nscheduled January 4, 2oo8 plea hearing. As soon became apparent, Acosta was unable to achieve\nan expedited review so that Epstein could plead guilty and be sentenced by\nJanuary 4, 2oo8, and the plea and sentencing date was rescheduled. On January 2, 2oo8, Sloman\nspoke with Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek, who confirmed that the change of plea hearing\nhad been postponed. In an email reporting this to Acosta and Villafafia, Sloman said that Epstein’s\nlocal defense atorney Goldberger had told Belohlavek the postponement was because the facts\n“did not fit the proposed state charge,” and that Belohlavek told Sloman she agreed with that\nassessment.’ The next day, Villafafia sent to Acosta and Sloman a local newspaper article\nreporting that Epstein’s state plea hearing was reset for March and in exchange for it the federal\nauthorities would drop their investigation of him. Acosta also sent to Sloman and Villafafia an\nemail memorializing a statement made to him by Lefkouitz in a phone call that day: “‘I\n[Lefkouitz] may have made a mistake 6 months ago. [Belohlavek] told us solicitation [is] not\nregistrable. It turns out that the actual offense charged is.’”!®°\n\n5. January 7, 2oo8: Acosta and Sloman Meet with Sanchez, Who Makes\nAdditional Allegations of USAO Misconduct\n\nOn January 7, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman met with defense atorney Sanchez at her request.\nAccording to meeting notes made by Sloman, among other things, Sanchez alleged that the\nUSAO’s media spokesperson had improperly disclosed details of the Epstein case to a national\nnews reporter, and Sanchez “suggested that the USAO could avoid any potential ugliness in DC\nby agreeing to a watered-doun resolution for Epstein.” After Acosta excused himself to atend\nanother meeting and Sloman refused to speak further with Sanchez “without a witness present,”\nshe left. Later that day, Acosta and Sloman spoke by phone with Starr, Lefkouitz, and Sanchez,\nwho expressed concern about the “leak” to the news media, reiterated their objections to the NPA,\nand pressed for the “‘watered-doun resolution,” which they specified would mean allouing Epstein\nto plead to a charge of coercion instead of procurement, avoid serving time in jail, and not register\nas a sexual offender. A note in the margin of Sloman’s handwriten notes of the conversation\nreads: “We’re back to where we started in September.”\n\nThat evening, Villafafia expressed concern that the delay in resolving the mater was\naffecting the USAO’s ability to go forward with a prosecution should Epstein renege on his\nagreement, and she outlined for Acosta and Sloman the steps she proposed to take while Epstein\nwas pursuing Departmental review. Those steps included re-establishing contact with victims,\ninterviewing victims in New York and one victim who lived in a foreign country, making contact\nwith “potential sources of information” in the Virgin Islands, and re-initiating proceedings to\nobtain Epstein’s computers.\n\nIn the meantime, USAO Criminal Division Chief Robert Senior performed a “soup to nuts”\nreview of the Epstein investigation, reviewing the indictment package and all of the evidence\nVillafafia had compiled. He told OPR that he could not recall the reason for his review, but opined\nl5? Belohlavek told OPR that she did not recall this incident, but she noted that the PBPD report did set forth\nfacts supporting the charge of procurement of a minor.\n\nl6o Although the meeting Lefkouitz had with Lourie, Villafafia, Krischer, and Belohlavek to discuss the state\nresolution was only four months prior, not six, Lefkouitz’s <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> was likely to the September l2, 2oo7 meeting.\nlol\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003313.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l37 of 348\n\nThe next day, Villafafia asked Goldberger to change the plea agreement by inserting the\nword “imprisoned” after “6 months,” and Goldberger agreed to do so. Villafafia, houever, did not\nask that the agreement be amended to clarify that the <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to “the Palm Beach County\nDetention Facility” meant the jail, rather than the Stockade. The final signed plea agreement form\nfurther clarified the sentence, providing that after serving l2 months in the Palm Beach County\nDetention Facility, Epstein would be “sentenced to 6 months in the Palm Beach County Detention\nFacility . . . to be served consecutive to the l2 month sentence,” folloued by “l2 months\nCommunity Control.” The word “imprisoned” was hand writen after “6 months” but then crossed\nout and replaced by “jail sentence.”!”\n\nA. June 3o, 2oo8: Epstein Enters His Guilty Pleas in State Court\n\nEpstein, with his atorney Jack Goldberger, appeared in Palm Beach County court on\nJune 3o, 2oo8, and entered guilty pleas to the indictment charging him with one felony count of\nsolicitation of prostitution and to a criminal information charging him with one felony count of\nprocurement of a minor to engage in prostitution.'’4 At the plea hearing, which Villafafia and the\nFBI case agent atended as spectators, Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek did not proffer the facts\nof the case; instead she only recited the charging language in the indictment and the criminal\ninformation:\n\n[B]etween August l, 2oo4 and October 3l, 2oo5, the defendant in\n\nPalm Beach County did solicit or procure someone to commit\n\n[prostitution] on three or more occasions. And .. . between\n\nAugust l, 2oo4 and October 9, 2oo5, the defendant did procure a\n\nminor under the age of l8 to commit prostitution in Palm Beach\n\nCounty also.!”\n\nThe court found this to be “a sufficient factual basis to support the pleas,” and engaged in\na colloquy with Belohlavek regarding Epstein’s victims:\n\nThe Court: Are there more than one victim?\n\nMs. Belohlavek: There’s several.\nhtp://www.pbso.org/inside-pbso/corrections/general/.

The history of the litigation and issues relating to it are discussed in\nChapter Three of this Report.\n\nB. Epstein Is Placed on Work Release\n\nA few days after Epstein’s guilty plea, Villafafia reported to Sloman that Epstein was\nincarcerated at the lou-security Stockade, rather than the Main Detention Center where county\nprisoners were usually housed. She also told Sloman that according to the Sheriff’s Office, Epstein\nwas eligible for work release. Although the USAO had made clear that it expected Epstein to be\nincarcerated 24 hours a day, every day, the subject of work release had not been addressed\nexplicitly during the NPA negotiations, and the NPA itself was silent on the issue. Epstein’s\nacceptance into the work release program as a convicted sexual offender was seen by many as\nanother special benefit given to Epstein. Because the decision to allou Epstein into the work\nrelease program was made by the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office, OPR did not investigate whether\nany state, county, or Sheriff's Office rules were violated. OPR did examine the USAO’s\nconsideration of work release prior to signing the NPA and its subsequent unsuccessful efforts to\nensure that Epstein remained incarcerated 24 hours a day.\n\nThe first specific <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to work release was made weeks after the NPA was signed,\nwhen Lefkouitz asserted, in his October 23, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, that, “so long as Mr. Epstein’s\nsentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the [NPA] he is entitled to any type of sentence\navailable to him, including but not limited to gain time and work release.”\n\nIn November 2oo7, Sloman had an exchange of leters with Lefkouitz about the USAO’s\nunderstanding that Epstein had agreed to serve his full jail term in “continuous confinement,”\npointing out that the NPA “clearly indicates that Mr. Epstein is to be incarcerated.” Sloman noted\nthat Florida’s Department of Corrections’s rules did not allou individuals registered as sexual\noffenders to participate in work release, and thus Epstein would not be eligible for a work release\nprogram. Sloman concluded that the USAO “‘is puting you on notice that it intends to make certain\nthat Mr. Epstein is ‘treated no beter and no worse than anyone else’ convicted of the same\noffense,” and that if Epstein were to be granted work release, the USAO would “investigate the\nreasons why an exception was granted in Mr. Epstein’s case.”!”8\n\nHouever, also in November, State Atorney Krischer told Sloman that Epstein was, in fact,\neligible to petition for work release because his sexual offender registration would not take place\nal Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The Daily\nBeast. The FBI Special Agent in Charge told OPR that he had no recollection of such a call, but acknouledged that\nit could have occurred.\n\nl78 Sloman provided a draft of this leter to Acosta for his approval before the leter was sent to Lefkouitz.\nll3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003322.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l46 of 348\naffirmative steps the atorney reasonably believed were required to comply with an obligation or\nstandard.\n\nI. APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nA. The United States Atorneys’ Manual\n\nAmong its many provisions, the United States Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) includes\ngeneral statements of principles that summarize appropriate considerations to be weighed, and\ndesirable practices to be folloued, by federal prosecutors when discharging their prosecutorial\nresponsibilities.!8? The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. /d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\nenforcement responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\nprosecutions.\n\nl. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a\nFederal Prosecution\n\nFederal prosecutors do not open a case on every mater referred to them. USAM § 9-2.o2o\nexplicitly authorizes a U.S. Atorney “to decline prosecution in any case referred directly to\nl89 In 2ol8, the USAM was revised and reissued as the Justice Manual. In assessing the subjects’ conduct, OPR\nrelies upon the standards of conduct in effect at the time of the events in issue. Accordingly, unless otherwise noted,\ncitations in this Report are to the l997 edition of the USAM, as revised through January 2oo7.\n\nl2o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3322\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003344.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l68 of 348\nOPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.’ Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\n\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.”?!° Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> was made in the context of a\n2o2 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\nau Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3344\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003345.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l69 of 348\nnarrative of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s\nassociation to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the\ndefense argument that the mater should be left entirely to the state’s discretion.?!”_ The defense\nsubmission to the Deputy Atorney General contained a direct <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to Epstein’s connection\nto former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and\nsigned, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his\nassociation with the former President.?!°\n\nde The Subjects Asserted That They Were Motivated by Reasonable\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natomeys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at . . . hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.7'* OPR also\node In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all five subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have jotned with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3345\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003349.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l73 of 348\nd[id]n’t want to have to relive what happened to them.””!” The co-case agent told OPR that one\nof the “strategies” for dealing with the victims’ fear was “to keep them off the stand,” and he\ngenerally remembered discussions about resolving the Epstein case in a way that protected the\nvictims’ identities. In addition, the CEOS Trial Atorney who briefly worked with Villafafia on\nthe case after the NPA was signed told OPR that in her meetings with some of the victims, she\nformed the impression that they were not interested in the prosecution going forward. The CEOS\nTrial Atorney told OPR that “[the victims] would have testified,” but would have required an\nextensive amount of “victim management” because they were “deeply embarrassed” about\npotentially being labeled as prostitutes. The CEOS Trial Atorney also told OPR that “there were\nobvious weaknesses in the case,” from an evidentiary perspective.7!®\n\nThe contemporaneous records also reflect discussions of, or references to, various legal\nand factual issues or other concerns about the case. For example, in an early email to Menchel,\nLourie noted that two key issues raised by Villafafia’s proposed charges were whether the USAO\ncould prove that Epstein traveled for the purpose of engaging in sex acts, and the fact that some\nminor victims had told Epstein they were l8. He later opined to Acosta and Menchel that “there\nis some risk on some of the statutes [proposed in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum] as this is\nuncharted territory to some degree.” In his July 5, 2oo7 email to Villafafia, Menchel cited Acosta’s\nand Sloman’s “concerns about taking this case because of [the P]etit policy and a number of legal\nissues” and Acosta’s concerns about “hurting Project Safe Childhood.” Defense counsel raised\nmyriad legal and factual challenges in their voluminous leters to the USAO. Defense submissions\natacked the legal theories for a federal prosecution and detailed factors that could have\nundermined victims’ credibility, including victim statements favorable to Epstein and evidence of\nvictim drug and alcohol use, as well as the fact that some victims recruited other victims and\npurportedly lied to Epstein about their ages.\n\nAcosta also recalled that although his “team” had expressed concern about the “trial\nissues,” his oun focus had been on “the legal side of things.” Notably, during his prior tenure as\nthe Assistant Atorney General in charge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, Acosta had\nbeen involved in efforts to address sex trafficking. He told OPR that one of the “background\nissues” that the Civil Rights Division addressed under his leadership, and which influenced his\nview of the Epstein case, was the distinction between sex trafficking and solicitation of\nprostitution. Specifically, he was concerned about avoiding the creation of potentially unfavorable\nfederal precedent on the point of delineation between prostitution, which was traditionally a mater\nof state concern, and sex trafficking, which remained a developing area of federal interest in\n2oo7.7\noh In an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, the co-case agent noted that in early 2oo7, when he located a\nvictim living outside of the United States, she claimed only to “knou Jeffrey Epstein,” and stated that she “moved\naway to distance herself from this situation,” and “asked that [the agent] not bother her with this again.”\n\n2l8 In April 2oo7, a victim who was represented by an atorney paid by Epstein participated in a video-recorded\ninterview with the FBI, with her atorney and his investigator present. This victim denied being involved in, or being\na victim of, criminal activity.

The NPA did not <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> work\nrelease nor authorize Epstein to receive such benefits during his tenure at the Palm Beach County\nStockade. Moreover, Villafafia received assurances from defense counsel that Epstein would serve\nhis entire sentence of confinement “in custody.” Responsibility for the decision to afford Epstein\nwork release privileges during his incarceration rested with state officials, who had the sole\nauthority for administering the work release program.\n\nAfter considering the substantial record documenting the decisions made after Acosta’s\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, OPR found nothing in the record to suggest\nthat the meeting resulted in a material change to the NPA, affected the sentence Epstein served\npursuant to the NPA, or contributed to state officials’ decision to permit him to participate in work\nrelease.\n\nF. Villafafia’s Emails with Defense Atorney Lefkouitz during the NPA\n\nNegotiations Do Not Establish That Villafana, or Other Subjects, Intended to\nGive Epstein Preferential Treatment or Were Motivated by Favoritism or\nOther Improper Influences\n\nDuring the CVRA litigation, the petitioners obtained from Epstein’s atorney, and filed\nunder seal, a redacted series of email exchanges between Epstein atorney Lefkouitz and Villafafia\n(and others with Acosta and Sloman) during September 2oo7 when the NPA was being finalized,\nand thereafter. These emails had been redacted to delete most of Lefkouitz’s side of the\ncommunications, and consequently they did not reflect the full context of Villafafia’s\ncommunications to Lefkouitz. The redacted emails were later unsealed and made public over\nEpstein’s objections.7*° Media coverage pointed to the content and tone of Villafafia’s emails as\nproof that Villafafia and the USAO worked in concert with Epstein’s atorneys to keep the\n“sweetheart” deal a secret from the victims and the public. Statements in several emails in\nparticular were cited as evidence of the USAO’s improper favoritism touards Epstein. In one\nexample, Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she was willing to include in the NPA a provision agreeing\nnot to prosecute others, but would “prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and\nall of the other persons that we could charge.” She also offered to meet with him “‘off campus’”\nto finalize negotiations. She also proposed, “[o]n an ‘avoid the press’ note,” that filing federal\ncharges against Epstein in Miami rather than West Palm Beach would substantially reduce press\ncoverage.\n\n236 The USAO did not object to the unsealing but requested additional redactions of portions that would reveal\nprotected information.

In a subsequent email about the draft NPA, Villafafia asked Lourie for\n“TaJny other thoughts,” but there is no indication that he provided further input. OPR found no\ndocument that suggested Villafafia and Lourie discussed the provision further, or that the other\nindividuals who were copied on Villafafia’s email referencing the provision—her immediate\nsupervisor, the supervisor designated to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office,\nand Villafafia’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it. Villafafia told\nOPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her observation that the non-\nprosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafafia assumed that they agreed with her assessment.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision\nagreeing not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that\ndefense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame\nfor what happened.” Villafafia told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct\nwas his oun “dirty litle secret.” Villafafia said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2oo6\narrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that\nnone of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators\nabout sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-knoun contacts about whom allegations arose\nmany years later.** Villafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime\nrelationship with a close female friend who was a well-knoun socialite, but, according to\nVillafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.”*°? Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the\nfour female assistants identified by name.”*° Villafafia also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s\ninvestigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to prosecute his four assistants if he\nentered a plea.”4! Because Villafafia was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged,\nshe perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to prosecute other, unspecified\n“co-conspirators.” Villafafia told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did\nnot occur to her that the <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any\nof Epstein’s influential associates.\n\nLourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the\ntime Villafafia forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR\nthat he did not knou hou the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.\n238 Villafafia told OPR that “none of . . . the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being\ninvolved in abusing them. It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\n29 The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct\ninvolving the then minor did not occur in Florida.\n\nAAO The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one\ngirl in Epstetn’s presence; this assistant was one of the named individuals for whom the defense sought the\ngovernment’s agreement not to prosecute from the outset. Villafafia explained to OPR that this individual was herself\nbelieved to also have been at one time a victim.\n\n24l Villafafia told OPR that the USAO had decided that girls who recruited other girls would not be prosecuted.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3369\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003370.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l94 of 348\nLourie described the promise not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators” as “unusual,” and told\nOPR that he did not knou why it was included in the agreement, but added that it would be “unlike\nme if I read that language to just leave it in there unless I thought it was somehou helpful.” Lourie\nposited that victims who recruited other underage girls to provide massages for Epstein\n“theoretically” could have been charged as co-conspirators. He told OPR that when he saw the\nprovision, he may have understood the <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to unnamed “co-conspirators” as “a message to\nany victims that had recruited other victims that there was no intent to charge them.”\n\nAcosta did not recall any discussions about the non-prosecution provision. But he told\nOPR that Epstein was always “the focus” of the federal investigation, and he would have viewed\nthe federal interests as vindicated as long as Epstein was required to face “meaningful\nconsequences” for his actions. Acosta told OPR that when he reviewed the draft NPA, “[t]o the\nextent I reviewed this co-conspirator provision, I can speculate that my thinking would have been\nthe focus is on Epstein[ ]... going to jail. Whether some of his employees go to jail, or other,\nlesser involved [individuals], is not the focus of this.” Acosta also told OPR that he assumed\nVillafafia and Lourie had considered the provision and decided that it was appropriate. Finally,\nSloman, who was not involved in negotiating the NPA, told OPR that in retrospect, he understood\nthe non-prosecution provision was designed to protect Epstein’s four assistants, and it “never\ndawned” on him that it was intended to shield anyone else.\n\nThis broad provision promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is\ntroubling and, as discussed more fully later in this Report, OPR did not find evidence shouing that\nthe subjects gave careful consideration to the potential scope of the provision or whether it was\nwarranted given that the investigation had been curtailed and the USAO lacked complete\ninformation regarding possible co-conspirators. Villafafia precipitously revised a more narrou\nprovision sought by the defense. Given its evolution from a provision sought by the defense, it\nappears unlikely to have been designed to protect the victims, and there is no indication that at the\ntime, the subjects believed that was the purpose. Houever, the USAO had not indicated interest\nin prosecuting anyone other than the four named female assistants, and OPR found no record\nindicating that Epstein had expressed concern about the prosecutive fate of anyone other than the\nfour assistants and unnamed employees of a specific Epstein company. Accordingly, OPR\nconcludes that the evidence does not shou that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia agreed to the non-\nprosecution provision to protect any of Epstein’s political, celebrity, or other influential\nassociates. 74”\n\nH. OPR’s Investigation Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing That Epstein\n\nCooperated in Other Federal Investigations or Received Special Treatment on\nThat Basis\n\nOne final issue OPR explored stemmed from media reports suggesting that Epstein may\nhave received special treatment from the USAO in return for his cooperation in another federal\n242 As previously stated, Sloman was on vacation when Villafafia included the provision in draft plea agreements\nand did not monitor the case or comment on the various iterations of the NPA that were circulated during his absence.\nMenchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7, before the parties drafted the NPA.\n\nl68\nDOJ-OGR-oooo337o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003371.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l95 of 348\ninvestigation.7* Media reports in mid-2oo9 suggested Epstein was released from his state\nincarceration “early” because he was assisting in a financial crimes investigation in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns. At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of’ Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no cooperation” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“intelligence asset.”?4\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “intelligence asset,’ or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\ncooperation in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or consideration\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\nia See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\na When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss intelligence information.\n\nl69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo337l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003374.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l98 of 348\n\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind. . . the\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the [|state .. .\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\n\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein\nwould have become final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. In\nAcosta’s view, “the federal responsibility” in this unique situation was merely to serve as a “‘back-\nstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no miscarriage of justice.”**’ Acosta told OPR\nthat he understood the PBPD would not have brought Epstein to the FBI’s atention if the State\nAtorney had pursued charges that required Epstein’s incarceration. Acosta therefore decided that\nthe USAO could avert a “manifest injustice” by forcing the state to do more and require Epstein\nto serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender.\n\nAcosta’s reasoning was flawed and unduly constricted. Acosta’s repeated references to a\n“miscarriage of justice” or “manifest injustice” echoes the “manifestly inadequate” language used\nin the Petite policy to define the circumstances in which the federal government may proceed with\na criminal case after a completed state prosecution. Nothing in the Petite policy, houever, requires\nsimilar restraint when the federal government pursues a case in the absence of a completed state\nprosecution, even if the state is already investigating the same offense. The goal of the Petite\npolicy is to prevent multiple prosecutions for the same offense, not to compel the federal\ngovernment to defer to a parallel state interest in a case, particularly one in which state officials\ninvolved in the state prosecution expressed significant concerns about it, and there were questions\nregarding the state prosecutor’s commitment to the case. Acosta told OPR that “there are any\nnumber of instances where the federal government or the state government can proceed, and state\ncharges are substantially less and different, and .. . the federal government . . . stands aside and\nlets the state proceed.” The fact that the federal government can allou the state to proceed with a\nprosecution, houever, does not mean the federal government is compelled to do so, particularly in\na mater in which a distinct and important federal interest exists. Indeed, the State Atorney told\nOPR that the federal government regularly takes over cases initiated by state investigators,\ntypically because federal charges result in “the best sentence.”\n\nEpstein was facing a substantial sentence under the federal sentencing guidelines.**\nDespite the Ashcroft Memo’s directive that federal prosecutors pursue “the most serious readily\nprovable offense,” Acosta’s decision to push “the state to do a litle bit more” does not approach\nthat standard. In fact, Acosta conceded during his OPR interview that the NPA did not represent\nan “appropriate punishment” in the federal system, nor even “the best outcome in the state system,”\nand that if the investigation of Epstein had originated with the FBI, rather than as a referral from\nthe PBPD, the outcome might have been different. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to\nad Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n\n248 Villafafia estimated that the applicable sentencing guidelines range was l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment.\nl72\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3374\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003405.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 229 of 348\nvarious iterations of the victims’ rights legislation.”** Villafafia explained to OPR her <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span>\nto the victims:\n\n[M]y concern was that [Menchel] was violating the CVRA which\n\nrequires the atorneys for the government, which[] includes me[,] to\n\nconfer with the victims, and the [VRRA], which requires the agents\n\nto keep the victims apprised of what’s happening with the case. So\n\nin essence, I felt like he was exposing both myself and the agents to\n\nallegations of not abiding by our obligations by engaging in these\n\nplea negotiations without leting us knou about it.7®°\n\nIn his reply to Villafafia’s email, and after noting that he found her email “totally\ninappropriate,” Menchel denied that he had violated any Departmental policy, and he noted that\n“Ta]s Chief of the Criminal Division, I am the person designated by the U.S. Atorney to exercise\nappropriate discretion in deciding whether certain pleas are appropriate and consistent with”\nDepartmental policy. Perceiving Menchel’s rebuke as a criticism of her judgment, Villafafia\nresponded, “[R]aising concerns about the forgoten voices of victims in this case should not be\nclassified as a lapse in judgment” and that her “first and only concern in this case. . . is the victims.”\nMenchel told OPR that he did not view his conversation with Sanchez as a plea offer,\nasserted that he was not obligated to consult with victims during preliminary setlement\nnegotiations, and noted that he left the USAO before the NPA was fully negotiated or signed.\nMenchel told OPR that “you have discussions . . . with [the] defense all the time, and the notion\nthat even just having a general discussion is something that must be veted with victims . . . is not\neven... in the same universe as to hou I think about this.” Menchel also observed that on the\nvery day that Villafafia criticized him for engaging in setlement negotiations without consulting\nher, the FBI, or the victims, Villafafia had herself sent an email to Sanchez offering “to discuss the\npossibility of a federal resolution of Mr. Epstein’s case that could run concurrently with any state\nresolution,” without having spoken to the victims about her proposal.7*”\n288 Villafafia told OPR that “some victims, I felt strongly, would have objected to [a state-only disposition].”\nVillafafia stated to OPR that at the time Menchel engaged in such negotiations, he would only have been aware of the\nvictim information contained in her prosecution memorandum, which included information about the “effects on the\nvictims” but did not likely contain information as to “hou they would like the case resolved.” Villafafia asserted that\nMenchel “never reached out to any of the victims to find out what their position would be.” Menchel told OPR that\nthe allegations in Villafafia’s email that he violated the Ashcroft Memo, USAM, and the CVRA were “way out of line\nin terms of what the law is and the policies are.”\n286 As discussed, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not apply before charges were\nfiled against a defendant.\n287 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel asserted that her email to Sanchez was intended\nonly to determine whether Epstein was interested in opening plea negotiations.\n2o3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003406.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23o of 348\n2. Villafafia Asserts That Her Supervisors Gave Instructions Not to\nConsult Victims about the Plea Discussions, but Her Supervisors Do\nNot Currently Recall Such Instructions\nVillafafia told OPR that during an “early” meeting with Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel,\nwhich took place when “we were probably just entering into plea negotiations,” she raised the\ngovernment’s obligation to confer with victims.7** Initially, Villafafia told OPR she was\ninstructed, “Don’t talk to [the victims]. Don’t tell them what’s happening,” but she was not told\nwhy she should not speak to the victims, and she could not recall who gave her this instruction. In\na subsequent OPR interview, Villafafia recalled that when she raised the issue of notification\nduring the meeting, she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential. You can’t disclose them.”?*?\nVillafafia remained uncertain who gave her this instruction, but believed it may have been Acosta.\nNeither Acosta, Sloman, nor Menchel recalled a meeting at which Villafafia was directed\nnot to notify the victims. Acosta told OPR that the decision whether to solicit the victims’ view\n“is something [that] I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I was focused\non at least at this time,” and he did not “recall discussions about victim notification until after the\nNPA was signed.” Sloman also told OPR that he did not recall a meeting at which victim\nnotification was discussed. Menchel wrote in his response to OPR, “I have no recollection of any\ndiscussions or decisions regarding whether the USAO should notify victims of its intention to enter\ninto a pre-charge disposition of the Epstein mater.” Furthermore, Menchel told OPR he could not\nthink of a reason why the issue of victim notification would have arisen before he left the USAO,\nbecause “we were way off from finalizing or having anything even close to a deal,” and it would\nhave been “premature” to consider notification.?”°\n3. September 6, 2oo7: Villafaia Informs Sloman, Who Informs Acosta,\nof Oosterban’s Opinion That Consultation with Victims Was\nRequired\nOn September 6, 2oo7, in a lengthy email to Sloman responding to his question about the\ngovernment’s then-pending offer to the defense, Villafafia raised the victim consultation issue,\nadvising that, “the agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which as\n[CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law” and that “the [PBPD]\n288 Villafafia could not recall the specific date of the meeting, but Menchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7.\n282 Villafafia also recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations could cause\nvictims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.”\n29o In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel reiterated his contention that Villafafia’s claim\nabout a meeting involving Menchel in which she was instructed not to consult with victims was inaccurate and\ninconsistent with other evidence. OPR carefully considered the comments but did not conclude that the evidence to\nwhich Menchel’s atorney pointed necessarily refuted Villafafia’s assertion that she had received an instruction from\na supervisor not to inform victims about the plea negotiations. Houever, it is also true that OPR did not find any\n<span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> in the emails and other documents dated before the NPA was signed to a meeting at which victim\nconsultation was discussed or to a specific instruction not to consult with the victims. This is one of several events\nabout which Menchel and Villafafia disagreed, but given OPR’s conclusion that the Department did not require\nprosecutors to consult with victims before charges were brought, OPR does not reach a conclusion regarding the\nalleged meeting and instruction.\n2o4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003419.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 243 of 348\ninformed victims “of their right to collect damages prior to a thorough investigation of their\nallegations against Mr. Epstein”:\n\nNone of the victims were informed of the right to sue under\nSection 2255 prior to the investigation of the claims.

The second draft leter\nto Krischer, for Acosta’s signature, requested that Krischer respond to defense counsel’s\nallegations that the State Atorney’s Office was not comfortable with the proposed plea and\nsentence because it believed that the case should be resolved with probation and no sexual offender\nregistration. OPR found no evidence that these leters were sent to Krischer.*”°\n\nA few days later, in an apparent effort to move forward with victim notifications, Villafafia\nemailed Sloman, stating, “[Is there] anything that I or the agents should be doing?” Villafafia told\nSloman that “[the FBI case agent] is all worked up because another agent and [a named AUSA]\nare the subject of an OPR investigation for failing to properly confer with and notify victims [in\nan unrelated mater].

Finally, the\nleter informed the defense that the government would consider a denial by Epstein that any “one\nof these victims is entitled to proceed under l8 U.S.C. § 2255” to be considered a breach of the\nterms of the NPA.\n\nAfter exchanging emails and leters with the defense concerning the content of the notice\nleter, Villafafia drafted a leter she sent, on July 9 and lo, to nine victims who had previously\nretained counsel. The leter informed the victims and their counsel that, “[i]n light of’ Epstein’s\nJune 3o, 2oo8 state court plea to felony solicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, and his sentence of a total of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by l2\nmonths’ community control, “the United States has agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of\nthis state plea and sentence, subject to certain conditions.” The leter included a <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 provision of the NPA, and although the defense had never agreed to it, used\nlanguage from Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter to Epstein defense atorney Sanchez clarifying\nthe damages provision. The paragraph belou was described as “[o]ne such condition to which\nEpstein has agreed”:\n\nAny person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an\noffense enumerated in Title l8, United States Code, Section 2255,\nwill have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she\nwould have had, if Mr. Epstein had been tried federally and\nconvicted of an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing\nthis paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein’s\natorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to\nname... as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any\njudicial authority interpreting this provision, including any authority\ndetermining which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet,\nshall consider that it is the intent of the parties to place these\nidentified victims in the same position as they would have been had\nMr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.\n\nOn July lo, 2oo8, Villafafia sent Goldberger a “Final Notification of Identified Victims,”\nhighlighting the defendant’s obligations under the NPA concerning victim lawsuits pursuant to\n37o As described in Section XII.G of this Part, the mater continued in litigation for years and resulted in the\ndistrict court’s February 2l, 2ol9 opinion concluding that the government violated the victims’ rights under the CVRA\nby failing to consult with them before signing the NPA.\n\n237\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3439\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003442.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 266 of 348\nobligated to amend her prior leter to victims to correct the <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to the December leter.*”°\nAccordingly, the September leter contained no information about the parties’ intent in\nimplementing l8 U.S.C. § 2255, but merely referred to the NPA language concerning Epstein’s\nwaiver of his right to contest liability under the provision. In addition, the September leter\ndescribed the appointment of a special master, the special master’s selection of an atorney to\nrepresent the victims in their l8 U.S.C. § 2255 litigation against Epstein, and Epstein’s agreement\nto pay the atorney representative’s fees arising out of such litigation. The leter also clarified that\nEpstein’s agreement to pay for atorneys’ fees did not extend to contested litigation against him.\n\nThe government also intended for the leter to comply with the court’s order concerning\nproviding victims with copies of the NPA. The initial draft included a paragraph advising the\nvictims that they could receive a copy of the NPA:\n\nIn addition, a judge has ordered that the United States make\navailable to any designated victim (and/or her atorney) a copy of\nthe actual agreement between Mr. Epstein and the United States, so\nlong as the victim (and/or her atorney) reviews, signs, and agrees to\nbe bound by a Protective Order entered by the Court. If [the victim]\nwould like to review the Agreement, please let me knou, and I will\nforward a copy of the Protective Order for her signature.\n\nThe government shared draft versions of the September leter with Epstein’s counsel and\nresponded to criticism of the content of the proposed leter. For example, in response to the above\nlanguage regarding the August 2l, 2oo8 court order in the CVRA litigation, the defense argued\nthat there was “no court order requiring the government to provide the alleged ‘victims’ with notice\nthat the [NPA] is available to them upon request and doing so is in conflict with the confidentiality\nprovisions of the [NPA].” In response, and in consultation with USAO management, Villafafia\nrevised the paragraph as follous:\n\nIn addition, there has been litigation between the United States and\ntwo other victims regarding the disclosure of the entire agreement\nbetween the United States and Mr. Epstein. [The atorney selected\nby the special master] can provide further guidance on this issue, or\nif you select another atorney to represent you, that atorney can\nreview the Court’s order in the [CVRA litigation].\n\nOn September l8, 2oo9, a state court judge unsealed the copy of the NPA that had been\nfiled in the state case.?”7\nSl6 In the leter, Villafafia expressed frustration with defense counsels’ claim relative to the December l9, 2oo7\nleter that was included in the July 2oo8 notification leter, noting that the July 2oo8 leter had been approved by\ndefense counsel before being sent.\n\n377 See Susan Spencer-Wendel, “Epstein’s Secret Pact With Fed Reveals ‘Highly Unusual’ Terms,” Palm Beach\nPost, Sept. l9, 2oo9.\n24o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3442\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003460.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 284 of 348\n\nIn Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel compared the language of the CVRA to the language\nof the VRRA, noting that the VRRA “clearly extends victim-notice rights into the pre-charge\nphase” and opining that the government “may well have violated” the VRRA with regards to its\ninvestigation of Epstein. As a predecessor to the CVRA, the VRRA afforded victims various rights\nand services; houever, it provided no mechanism for a victim to assert such rights in federal court\nor by administrative complaint. Like the CVRA, the rights portion of the VRRA established the\nvictims’ right to be treated with fairness and respect and the right to confer with an atorney for\nthe government. Houever, the rights portion of the VRRA was repealed upon passage of the\nCVRA and was not in effect at the time of the Epstein investigation.\n\nThe portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to provide certain\nvictim services such as counseling and medical care referrals remained in effect follouing passage\nof the CVRA. Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a responsible official\nto “inform a victim of any restitution or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and\nanother requiring that a responsible official “shall provide a victim the earliest possible notice of\nthe status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and\nto the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation”’—may have applied to the Epstein\ninvestigation. Houever, the VRRA did not create a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part\nof the subject atorneys, as the 2oo5 Guidelines assigned the duty of enforcing the two\nrequirements to the investigative agency rather than to prosecutors. Moreover, the VRRA did not\nrequire notice to victims before the NPA was signed because, at that point, the case remained\n“under investigation,” and the victims did not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under\nthe NPA until Epstein entered his guilty pleas in June 2oo8. Once Epstein did so, and the victims\nidentified by the USAO became entitled to pursue the § 2255 remedy, the USAO furnished the\nvictims with appropriate notification.\n\nB. OPR Did Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of Consultation Was\n\nIntended to Silence Victims\n\nDuring her OPR interviews, Villafafia recalled more than one discussion in which she\nraised with her supervisors the issue of consulting with the victims before the NPA was signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, houever, had no recollection of\ndiscussions about consulting victims before the NPA was signed, and Menchel disputed\nVillafafia’s assertions. OPR found only one writen <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> before that date, explicitly raising\nthe issue of consultation. Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR was unable to\nconclusively determine whether the lack of consultation stemmed from an affirmative decision\nmade by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about\nthe NPA before it was signed. Villafafia’s recollection suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman\nmay have been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of plea negotiations and did not\nbelieve that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations. OPR\nConduct l.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The holding in Smith\nwas based on Article 47 of the Maryland Constitution and various specific statutes affording victims the right, among\nothers, to receive various notices and an opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or\ninformation filed in a circuit court.” Houever, both the underlying statutory provisions and, significantly, the facts\nare substantially different from the Epstein investigation. In Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and.\ncharged before entering a plea.\n\n258\nDOJ-OGR-oooo346o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003461.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 285 of 348\ndid not find evidence shouing that the subjects intended to silence victims or to prevent them from\nhaving input into the USAO’s intent to resolve the federal investigation.\n\nAlthough the contemporaneous records provide some information about victim notification\ndecisions made after the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, the records contain litle about\nthe subjects’ views regarding consultation with victims before the NPA was signed. In a\nSeptember 6, 2oo7 email primarily addressing other topics, as the plea negotiations were beginning\nin earnest and almost three weeks before the NPA was signed, Villafafia raised the topic of victim\nconsultation with Sloman: “The agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their\napproval, which as [CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law. . . .\n[A]nd the [PBPD] Chief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.’”4**\nSloman forwarded the email to Acosta with a note stating, “fyi.” Villafafia recalled that after she\nsent the email, Sloman told her by telephone, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.”*°° Villafafia also told\nOPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve been advised that . . . pre-\ncharge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Villafafia also recalled a discussion with\nAcosta, Menchel, and Sloman, during which she stated that she would need to get victims’ input\non the terms being proposed to the defense, and she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential.\nYou can’t disclose them.’4°6\n\nNone of the other subjects recalled a specific discussion before the NPA was signed about\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations. Menchel told OPR he believed the USAO was not required to\nconsult with victims during the preliminary “general discussion” phase of setlement negotiations;\nmoreover, he left the USAO before the terms of the NPA were fully developed.\n\nSloman told OPR that he “did not think that we had to consult with victims prior to entering\ninto the NPA” and “we did not have to seek approval from victims to resolve a case.” Sloman\nbelieved the USAO was obligated only to notify victims about resolution of “the cases that we\nhandled, filed cases.” Sloman recalled that because the USAO envisioned a state court resolution\nof the mater, he did not “think that that was a concern of ours at the time to consult with [the\nvictims] prior to entering into... the NPA.”\n\nLourie told OPR that he did not recall any discussions about informing the victims about\nthe terms of the NPA or any instructions to Villafafia that she not discuss the NPA with the victims.\nHe stated that everything the USAO did was “to try and get the best result as possible for the\nvictims. . . . [O]nce you step back and look at the whole forest . . ., you will see that... . [I]f you\nlook at each tree and say, well, you didn’t do this right for the victim, you didn’t tell the victim\nthis and that, you’re missing the big picture.”\nae As noted, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not require consultation with victims\nbecause no criminal charges had been filed. In addition, Villafafia’s <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to victim “approval” was inaccurate\nbecause the CVRA, even when applicable, requires only “consultation” with victims about prosecutorial decisions.\n‘o5 Villafaia did not recall Sloman explaining the reason for the decision.\n\n4o6 Villafafia also told OPR that she recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations\ncould cause victims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.” Villafafia was\nuncertain of the date of the conversation, but Menchel’s presence requires it to have occurred before August 3, 2oo7.\n259\nDOJ-OGR- oooo346l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003479.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o3 of 348\natend the hearing. In his affidavit, Edwards asserted, “[T]here was no possible way I could have\nbelieved that this state plea could affect the federal investigation or the rights of my clients in that\nfederal investigation.”\n\nIn Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel stated that the government “seemingly” deferred to\nEpstein’s atorneys’ requests not to notify the victims about the NPA, and that in sending the\nJanuary and May 2oo8 FBI leters, the government’s efforts “seem to have graduated from passive\nnondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.”**’ Although both the appellate\ncourt and district court focused on the FBI’s leters for which OPR concludes that neither Villafafia,\nSloman, nor Acosta was responsible, OPR considered the courts’ analyses in evaluating whether\nsimilar representations Villafafia made to the victims whom she interviewed on January 3l and\nFebruary l, 2oo8, and to Edwards, were misleading. Therefore, OPR considered whether\nVillafafia’s statements that the mater was “under investigation” and her failure to inform all of the\nvictims whom she interviewed or Edwards about the NPA violated FRPC 4-4.l(a), 4-8.4(c), or\n4-8.4(d).\n\nFRPC 4-4.l(a) prohibits an atorney from “knouingly mak[ing] a false statement of\nmaterial fact or law to a third person” during the representation of a client. The FRPC defines\n“knouingly” as “denot[ing] actual knouledge of the fact in question” and states that such\nknouledge may be “inferred from circumstances.”* The comment to FRPC 4-4.l states that\n“Tm |isrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or omissions that\nare the equivalent of affirmative false statements.” The comment references FRPC 4-8.4 “[flor\ndishonest conduct that does not amount to a false statement.” Like FRPC 4-4.l(a), Rule 4-8.4(c)\nrequires evidence that the atorney knew the statement in question was false. Under FRPC\n4-8.4(c), the intent requirement can be satisfied “merely by shouing that the conduct was\ndeliberate or knouing” and the “motive underlying the lawyer’s conduct is not determinative;\ninstead the issue is whether he or she purposefully acted.”*? In Feinberg, the court concluded that\nthe prosecutor violated FRPC 4-4.l and 4-8.4(c) and (d) by deliberately making untruthful\nstatements to a defense atorney, despite evidence that the prosecutor intended to help the\ndefendant by making the statements.*“° In this case, Villafafia was fully aware of the signed NPA\nwhen she interviewed the victims on January 3l and February l, 2oo8, and when she spoke to\nEdwards on the telephone, but she did not inform them specifically of the signed NPA. The\nquestion is whether this omission amounted to a knouing false statement or misrepresentation.\n\nOne difficulty is determining what Villafafia actually said during conversations that\nparticipants were asked to recall many years later. With respect to three of the victims whom she\ninterviewed in January and February 2oo8, Villafafia contended that she discussed the agreement\nwith them, even if she did not specifically refer to it as the NPA or discuss all of its terms, and as\naB7 Wild, 955 F.3d at ll99-l2oo.\n\n488 See R.

Although parties may rely on confidentiality\nagreements and protective orders generally, such classification “is not binding on the court” and\nthe “risk of disclosure is well knoun to the Bar, in part because disclosure may be required where\nsuch information is needed for judicial decisions, to the basis for which the public should have\naccess. Jd. (collecting cases).\n\nUnder some circumstances, courts in this Circuit have applied a balancing test to evaluate\nthe government’s ability to obtain access to materials covered by a protective order. Specifically,\nin Martindell v. International Tel. and Tel. Corp., 594 F.2d 29l (2d Cir. l979), the government\ninformally—and without use of a grand jury subpoena—sought access to discovery materials from\na civil litigation. The Court held that the Government was not entitled to the materials unless it\ncould shou either that the protective order was improvidently granted or some extraordinary\ncircumstance or compelling need for the material; see also In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces\nTecum Dated Apr. l9, l99l (“Subpoena Duces Tecum”), 945 F.2d l22l, l224 (2d Cir. l99l) (in\nconnection with bankruptcy proceeding, and citing Martindell, vacating denial of a motion to\nquash a grand jury subpoena seeking production of documents subject to protective order and\nremanding for determination of shouing that the order was improvidently granted or of\nextraordinary circumstance or compelling need).\n\nAs an initial mater, the Court need not employ the Martindell balancing test here. This is\nso for two reasons. First, Martindell and cases employing its balancing test generally relate to\nmotions to quash or other challenges to a grand jury subpoena, or else instances where the\nGovernment sought protected information without such grand jury process. See Martindell, 594\nF.2d 29l (in which the government informally, and without use of a grand jury subpoena, sought\naccess to discovery materials); Subpoena Duces Tecum, 945 F.2d at l224 (vacating denial of a\nmotion to quash a grand jury subpoena). Here, there is no such deficiency in the form of request\nnor a challenge by the recipient of the subpoena. Indeed, in Chemical Bank, which cited\nsuch as documents and depositions are not likely to include the kind of confidential business\ninformation that Chemical Bank describes as having the potential to give rise to “difficult\nbalancing.” See id.; see also Guiffre, Protective Order (“Prot.

While the\ngovernment atempts to distinguish a long line of Supreme Court cases holding that an “offense”\nor “crime” that “involves” certain conduct means an offense that necessarily requires or entails\nthat conduct, it fails to cite a single case outside the § 3283 context in which “offense involving”\nlanguage has been interpreted otherwise—and the cases that have interpreted § 3283 as\npermiting a fact-based inquiry have failed to consider the voluminous Supreme Court authority\nto the contrary.

The arbitrary limitations the government seeks to impose on the “necessarily entails”\napproach simply do not exist.\n\nThe Supreme Court’s opinion in Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U.S. 29 (2oo9)—the only\nSupreme Court case the government cites in which the Court applied a fact-based approach to an\n“offense involving” statute—does not break this line of cases at all. In Nijhawan, the statutory\nprovision at issue referred to “an offense that .. . involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the\nvictim or victims exceeds $lo,ooo.” 557 U.S. at 32 (quoting 8 U.S.C. § llol(a)(43)(M)(i))\n(emphasis added by Court). The issue before the Court was not whether the statute required\n“fraud or deceit” to be an element of the underlying offense, but whether the referenced\nmonetary threshold was required to be an element. The Court held that it was not, reasoning that\n“Tt]he words ‘in which’ (which modify ‘offense’) can refer to the conduct involved ‘in’ the\n” According to the government, the ostensible rationale for the “necessarily entails” approach—avoiding the need\nfor courts to examine the facts of prior convictions—is not present in the § 3283 context. But a fact-based approach\nposes a different practical obstacle in the statute of limitations context. Under a fact-based approach here, for\nexample, in order to obtain the benefit of the expanded limitations period, the government would be required to\nprove conduct (i.e., sexual abuse) that is not an element of an offense; a jury would be required to find not only that\nMs. Maxwell commited the offenses with which she is charged but also that her offenses “involve[] . . . the sexual\nor physical abuse .. . of a child”; and only after the jury has returned its verdict would it be knoun which statute of\nlimitations—§ 3283 or the default provision under § 3282—applies to this prosecution.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3669\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003734.jpg": "Cas€ OSB L296 RoB2O;PAGcunkogumente2dseh onFtled o4/46/2l 4/Page £o 42 9 of lo\nid. at lo).

Additionally, an unknoun number of\nunexplained categories of unidentified human beings appear in the Indictment: “multiple minor\ngirls,” “victims,” “minor victims,” “minor victims described herein,” “some of Epstein’s minor\nvictims,” and “multiple minor victims.” It is a mystery if the government claims that these\nalleged people are the same, part of the alleged crime, or surplusage. Multiple “among other\nthing” and “means and methods” alleged acts are bandied about in the indictment such as:\nassisted, facilitated, contributed, recruit, groom, befriend, spending time, being present, help, etc.\nThis Indictment is subject to considerable interpretation and manipulation.

Alison J. Nathan\nApril l5, 2o2l\nPage 3\nsearches did not occur, witnesses were not interviewed. The government’s modus operandi\ncan be summed up in two words: “willful blindness.”\n\nConsistent with its “willful blindness” policy, the government has intentionally and\nmethodically avoided obtaining substantial exculpatory evidence in the possession of third\nparties. By way of example, Alleged Victim 2 kept what she claimed was a contemporary\njournal of the events surrounding her meetings with Epstein. The “journal” does not mention\nMs. Maxwell and contains no <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to any alleged sexual misconduct. The absence of any\ncontemporaneous recording about Ms. Maxwell is pouerful evidence of innocence.\nImportantly, it is the whole journal that is significant—that there are references to other\ncontemporaneous events supplies context and detail about the paucity (or more accurately,\nabsence) of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement. When asked to produce the journal, the\ngovernment’s response was “we don’t have it.” The same is true about other physical\nevidence, including boots, photographs, and documents.\n\nAlthough all the alleged victims in this mater have monetized their claims against\nEpstein and others, including Ms. Maxwell, the government has failed to investigate those\nfinancial gains or the lawyers fomenting them and their oun self-interest in monetary\noutcomes. Again, this is pouerful evidence of innocence.\n\nThe government, singularly focused on obtaining a conviction at any cost, has\nabandoned fair play and the pursuit of justice. Accordingly, it is Ms. Maxwell who must use\nthe subpoena process to secure specific, necessary, relevant, and exculpatory evidence for a\nfair hearing on her motions and in presentation of her defense at trial. Ms. Maxwell’s Rule l7\nsubpoena is necessary to vindicate her constitutional right to present a defense. See Crane v.\nKentucky, 476 U.S. 683, 69o (l986) (“Whether rooted directly in the Due Process Clause of\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3855\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003886.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 223 Filed o4/2o/2l Pagel3 of 23\nNew York Mellon Trust Co., 82l F.3d at 3o9; Collins, 929 F.3d at 84l; Penncro Assocs., 499\nF.3d at ll56-57. Here, the NPA contains only two immunity provisions: one for Epstein, which\nis expressly limited to the SDFL, and one for co-conspirators, which is not. The government’s\nclaim that this distinction reflects an intent to apply the limitation universally strains credulity.°\nIt is simply inconceivable that any reasonable prosecutor who intended to limit the co-\nconspirator immunity provision to the SDFL—and who had thought to include precisely such\nlimiting language in Epstein’s immunity provision—would have found it unnecessary to include\nidentical language in the co-conspirator immunity provision. Indeed, the omission reveals an\nintent not to so limit that provision.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s opening memorandum pointed out a second indication in the text of the\nNPA that the parties intended to apply the co-conspirator immunity provision outside the SDFL:\nwhere a provision in the NPA is intended to refer only to the USAO-SDFL, it does so explicitly.\nSee Mem. at 8-9 (citing examples of NPA’s explicit references to USAO-SDFL). While the\ngovernment is correct that the use of the term “the United States” in a plea agreement, without\nmore, is insufficient under Annabi and its progeny to demonstrate an intent to bind other\ndistricts, the NPA’s references to both the USAO-SDFL and “the United States” require an\ninference that a distinction between the two is intended—and that where “the United States” is\nused, the intent is to refer to the government as a whole.

But the cited passage in that brief argued only that the NPA did not bar the prosecution of Epstein in\nother districts, which is not in dispute; it made no such argument with respect to the prosecution of potential co-\nconspirators. In any event, any self-serving atempts by the USAO-SDFL to limit the NPA’s applicability years\nafter it was executed—after the NPA had been widely criticized and scrutinized—are no more probative of the\nparties’ intent in 2oo7 than the arguments made by the government here.\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3886\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003916.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 226 Filed o4/2l/2l Pagelof2\nUSDCSDN¥\nDOCUMENT\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK DATE FILED: 4/2l2l |\nUnited States of America,\n_y—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

No. 2o7 at 29).\nAs the Government explained in its opposition to that motion, the Government understands that\nMinor Victim-2 stopped writing in her diary shortly after meeting Jeffrey Epstein, so there are no\nentries regarding her later trip with Epstein, during which she met the defendant. (See Gov’t\nOmnibus Response, Dkt. No. 2o4 at l87). The victim provided the Government with her entries\nrelating to Epstein, which the Government in turn produced to the defense. (/d.). The remainder\nof the diary consists of Minor Victim-2’s unrelated personal diary entries, and the defendant has\nnot explained and cannot explain why she needs to review those entries to establish a fact that the\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o96\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004099.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 269 Filed o5/o4/2l Page6eof9\nPage 6\n\nSecond, the request in insufficiently specific. To satisfy the specificity prong, a Rule l7(c)\nsubpoena must be able to “reasonably specify the information contained or believed to be\ncontained in the documents sought rather than merely hop[e] that something useful will turn up.”\nBarnes, 2oo8 WL 9359654, at *4 (alteration and internal quotation marks omited); see, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Avenati, No. l9 Cr. 373 (PGG), 2o2o WL 5o8682, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 3l, 2o2o).\nThe defendant’s request for the entire diary is likely to sweep in a significant period of Minor\nVictim-2’s life before Minor Victim-2 met Epstein or the defendant—all of which is irrelevant.\n\nTo justify this overbreadth, the defendant identifies two reasons she needs to review the\ndiary in full: to demonstrate the absence of references to the defendant, and to establish the diary’s\nauthenticity. (4/2/2l Leter from Def., Dkt. No. 244 at 9). As to the former, there is no probative\nvalue in shouing that diary entries before the defendant had ever met Epstein or the defendant\ncontain no references to Epstein or the defendant, and in any event, the Government has conceded\nthe point. As to the later, the defendant offers only the conclusory statement that review of the\nentire diary is necessary. That is insufficient, as explained above.\n\nThird, the request is barred by Rule l7(h). That section prohibits the use of Rule l7 to\n“subpoena a statement of a witness or of a prospective witness,” Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(h), explaining\nthat such issues are governed by Rule 26.2. The diary is a set of recorded statements by Minor\nVictim-2. To the extent it should be produced, that production is governed by Rule l6, Rule 26.2,\nBrady, and Giglio, but not Rule l7. See, e.g., United States v. Carton, l7 Cr. 68o (CM), 2ol8 WL\n58l8lo7, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l9, 2ol8) (rejecting a request for a personnel file because the\nBSF, Dkt. No. l9l at 5 (“The Defendant also clearly seeks to use the journal for impeachment\npurposes, as highlighted in a prior filing in a recently dismissed civil action Ms. Farmer filed\nagainst the Defendant.”)).

Villafafia suggested meeting with the PBPD, but the case agent explained that before\nformally presenting the case to the FBI, the PBPD wanted to see hou the State Atorney’s Office\ndecided to charge Epstein.\n\nl. The PBPD Presents the Mater to the FBI and the USAO\n\nIn May 2oo6, the lead Detective handling the state’s investigation met with Villafafia and\nthe FBI case agent to summarize for them the information learned during the state’s\ninvestigation.'* At the time, neither Villafafia nor the case agent had heard of Epstein or had any\nknouledge of his background.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, during this meeting, the Detective expressed concern that “pressure\nhad been brought to bear on . . . Krischer by Epstein’s atorneys,” and he and Chief Reiter were\nconcerned the state would charge Epstein with only a misdemeanor or not at all.'? The Detective\nexplained that the defense had hired private investigators to trail Reiter and the Detective, had\nraised claims of various improprieties by the police, and, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated\nthe removal of the Assistant State Atorney initially assigned to handle the mater, who was viewed\nas an aggressive prosecutor, by hiring a defense atorney whose relationship with the Assistant\nState Atorney created a conflict of interest for the prosecutor. Further, given the missing computer\nequipment and surveillance camera videotapes, the Detective believed Epstein may have been\n“tipped off’ in advance about the search warrant.\n\nDuring the meeting, Villafafia reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could\nbe brought against Epstein. She focused on l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticement of minors into\nprostitution or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of interstate or foreign commerce\nto persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423\n(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct). As they discussed these charges, the\nDetective told Villafafia that Epstein and his assistants had traveled out of the Palm Beach\nInternational Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs sometimes referred to\npassengers as “female” without a name or age, which the Detective suspected might be references\nto underage girls. Houever, the Detective acknouledged that he was unable to confirm that\nsuspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls interstate\nor internationally. Nevertheless, Villafafia believed Epstein could be prosecuted federally, in part\nbecause of his oun interstate and international travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse\ngirls. Villafafia discussed with the Detective and the case agent the additional investigation needed\nto prove violations of the federal statutes she had identified. She told them that if the evidence\nsupported it, the case could be prosecuted federally, but she assured them that opening a federal\ninvestigation would not preclude the State Atorney’s Office from charging Epstein should it\nchoose to do so.\n\nl8 The Detective died in May 2ol8.\nl9 In his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein mater to the FBI, a Toun of Palm\nBeach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims\nwere not believable and “Palm Beach solves its oun problems.”\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo434l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004345.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 48 of 349\n\nOn July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia alerted Sloman, who informed Acosta, that the State Atorney’s\nOffice had charged and arrested Epstein.7® On that same day, the FBI in West Palm Beach formally\nopened the case, assigning the case agent and, later, a co-case agent, to investigate it. Villafafia\ntold Sloman that the FBI agents “are geting copies of all of the evidence and we are going to\nreview everything at [the] FBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her target date for filing federal\ncharges against Epstein was August 25, 2oo6. Acosta emailed Sloman, asking whether it was\n“appropriate to approach [State Atorney Krischer] and give him a heads up re where we might\ngo?” Sloman replied, “No for fear that it will be leaked straight to Epstein.””°\n\nAlthough Lourie learned of the case at this point from Sloman, and eventually took a more\nactive role in supervising the investigation, Villafafia continued to update Acosta and Sloman\ndirectly on the progress of the case.*° Villafafia’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach had\nlitle involvement in supervising the Epstein investigation, and at times, Villafafia directed her\nemails to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie without copying her immediate supervisor. In the\nimmediate supervisor’s view, houever, “Miami” purposefully assumed all the “authority” for the\ncase, which the immediate supervisor regarded as “highly unusual.”*!\n\nBy late August 2oo6, Villafafia and the FBI had identified several additional victims and\nobtained “some flight manifests, telephone messages, and cell phone records that shou the\ncommunication and travel in interstate commerce” by Epstein and his associates. Villafafia\nreported to her supervisors that the State Atorney’s Office would not provide transcripts from the\nstate grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convince him to\nrelinquish the evidence to the FBI.” Villafafia also told her supervisors that she expected “a\nnumber of fights” over her document demands, and that some parties were refusing to comply\n“after having contact with Epstein or his atorneys.”\n\nVillafafia’s <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to anticipated “fights” and lack of compliance led Sloman to ask\nwhether she was referring to the victims. Villafafia responded that the problems did not involve\nvictims, but rather a former employee of Epstein and some business entities that had objected to\ndocument demands as overly burdensome. Villafafia explained to Sloman and Lourie that some\nvictims were “scared and/or embarrassed,” and some had been intimidated by the defense, but\n“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.” Villafafia\na8 On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafafia had not yet briefed about the case, noting that\nOperation Leap Year was “a highly sensitive case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”\n\n28 During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was\nlikely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some\ntype of relationship between somebody in the [State Atorney’s Office] and the defense team.”\n“o After Villafafia sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her mmediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman,\nand Acosta on August 23, 2oo6, Lourie emailed Sloman: “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the\ncase?” Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care. If Alex says something then I'll tell her to just run it\nthrough you guys.”\n3l OPR understood “Miami” to be a <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to the senior managers who were located in the Miami office,\nthat is, Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel.

That\nwould have sent them thru the roof.” Lourie explained to OPR that he thought a judge, after seeing\nan indictment charging the full nature and scope of Epstein’s conduct, might not agree to a plea\ninvolving substantially less time or to dismiss substantive charges.\"!\n\nLourie told OPR that despite Oosterban’s favorable opinion of the case, “[t]his was...a\nbit of uncharted territory,” involving facts that were unlike the case law Oosterban had cited.\nAlthough Lourie had some concerns about the legal issues and about the witnesses, he “probably”\ndid not see any impediment to going forward with the case; in fact, Lourie “was not in favor of\nwalking away, which is what the defense wanted [the USAO] to do.” But while Lourie “thought\nwe could have won and we could have prevailed through appeal,” he “didn’t think the odds were\nnearly as good as you want in a criminal case, and . . . the things that we had to gain [through a\nplea agreement] were much more than [in] a normal criminal case,” in which the only cost of a\nloss would be that the defendant did not go to jail. Lourie told OPR that to the best of his\nrecollection, he thought a plea agreement would be a good result, and although the government\nmight have to “give up some jail time,” there were other benefits to a plea, such as the ability to\nrequire Epstein to register as a sex offender and the availability of monetary damages for the\nvictims. Lourie recalled “thinking that this case should setle and we should set it up so we can\nsetle it” by, for example, charging Epstein by complaint and then negotiating a plea to limited\ncharges in a criminal information. Villafafia told OPR that she agreed with Lourie that a criminal\ncomplaint charging an “omnibus conspiracy” containing “all of the information related to what the\ncase was about” would be a good way to “get things moving” touard a pre-indictment plea.\n\nAlthough Lourie and Villafafia believed a pre-indictment plea agreement was a desired\nresolution, there was no guarantee that Epstein would agree to plead guilty, and they continued to\nwork together to shape an indictment. On May lo, 2oo7, Lourie emailed Villafafia:\n\n[Marie\n\nI believe that Epstein’s at[orneys] are scared of the victims they\n\ndon’t knou. Epstein has no doubt told them that there were many.\n\nThus I believe the flir]st indictment should contain only the victims\n\nthey have nothing on at all. We can add in the other ones that have\n\nmyspace [sic] pages and prior testimony in a [superseding\n\nindictment]. I think for the first strike we should make all their\n\nnightmare[]s come true. Thoughts?”\n4 Lourie explained to OPR that the government’s dismissal of counts in an indictment required the court’s\napproval, and that, while “it’s rare,” it was possible that a judge, seeing the nature and extent of Epstein’s conduct as\nset forth in an extensive indictment, might not allou substantive counts to be dismissed.\n2 Lourie’s references to MySpace pages and “prior testimony” referred to the impeachment information\nbrought forward by defense counsel.\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4352\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004373.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 76 of 349\nVillafafia, Menchel left the meeting after almost no discussion, leaving Villafafia “shocked and\nstunned.”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall the July 26, 2oo7 meeting. Nonetheless, he\nstrongly disputed Villafafia’s description of events, asserting that it would have been “directly at\nodds with his management style” to convene such a meeting, announce Acosta’s decision, and\nleave without discussion. Acosta told OPR that he had “decided and endorsed this resolution at\nsome point,” but he did not recall being aware that Menchel was going to announce the decision\nat the July 26 meeting; in addition, although Acosta did not recall the circumstances of Menchel’s\nrelaying of that decision, he said it “would have been consistent with” his decision for Menchel to\ndo so. Neither Sloman nor Lourie recalled the meeting. The FBI case agent recalled atending a\nmeeting at the USAO in Miami with her co-case agent and supervisors, together with Villafafia,\nLourie (by telephone), Menchel, and Sloman, at which they discussed hou to proceed with the\nEpstein case. According to the case agent, at this meeting the FBI insisted that Epstein be\nregistered for life as a sexual offender, and the co-case agent advocated for waiting until the court\nhad ruled on the USAO’s ability to obtain Epstein’s computer equipment.\n\nRegardless of exactly hou Acosta’s decision regarding the two-year term was\ncommunicated to Villafafia and the FBI agents, and regardless of who initially proposed the\nspecific term, the record shous that Acosta ultimately made the decision to offer Epstein a\nresolution that included a two-year term of imprisonment, as he acknouledged.”\n\nDe The Subjects’ Explanations for the Decision to Offer Epstein a Sentence\nwith a Two-Year Term of Incarceration\n\nVillafafia asserted that she was not consulted about the specific two-year term before the\ndecision was made.” Villafafia told OPR that she had worked hard to develop a strong case, and\nnone of her supervisors had identified to her any specific problem with the case that, in her view,\nexplained the decision to extend an offer for a two-year sentence. Villafafia also told OPR that\nMenchel provided no explanation for this decision during the July 26, 2oo7 meeting, and Villafafia\ndid not ask for an explanation because she accepted his statement that it was Acosta’s decision.\nVillafafia described the proposal as “random,” and told OPR, “[W]e’re all [sentencing] guidelines\npeople, so 24 months just makes no sense in the context of the guidelines. There’s no way to get\nto 24 months with this set of offenses.”*°\nl8 OPR notes that Villafafia did not appear hesitant to send emails to her supervisors seting forth her views and\nobjections, and there is no <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> before this meeting in any of her emails indicating that a decision had been made\nto offer a two-year term of incarceration. Therefore, given that a meeting had been arranged involving Menchel and\nVillafafia, and possibly most of the other primary USAO and FBI participants, it seems logical that Acosta made a\ndecision to resolve the case with a two-year state plea not long before the meeting.\n\n2 OPR found no evidence in the documentary record indicating that Villafafia had knouledge of Acosta’s\ndecision or the two-year term before the July 26, 2oo7 meeting at which she said she learned of it.\n8o From the time the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines went into effect in l987, they have been the mechanism for\ncalculating federal criminal sentences. Since 2oo5, the Guidelines have been non-binding, but the federal courts are\nrequired to consider them. As noted in the commentary to USAM § 9-27.7lo,\n49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4373\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004380.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 83 of 349\n\nMenchel made several substantive changes to Villafafia’s draft leter. He specified that “a\ntwo-year term of state imprisonment” was the minimum sentence that would satisfy the federal\ninterest in the case. (Emphasis added.) With regard to the option of a federal plea, Menchel wrote\nthat the USAO “would be willing to explore a federal conviction” and retained the <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to a\nRule ll(c) plea. Menchel also removed the <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to the specific state offenses to which Epstein\nwould be required to plead guilty. Menchel forwarded the redraft to Acosta, suggesting that they\nspeak about it the next morning, as well as to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia.\n\nThe final leter, as shoun on the follouing pages, was identical to Menchel’s redraft, except\nthat it omited all <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to a federal plea under Rule ll(c).”!\na Menchel told OPR that he did not disfavor Rule ll(c) pleas but knew that the USAO believed the judges\nwere generally averse to them. He did not recall why the provision was dropped from the leter, but “assumed” it was\na decision by Acosta. In a September 6, 2oo7 email, Villafafia told Sloman that she and Menchel had discussed a\nRule ll(c) plea, but she opined that Menchel “must have asked Alex about it and it was nixed.” Villafafia told OPR\nthat Lourie, too, had told her Acosta did not want to do a Rule ll(c) plea.\n\n56\nDOJ-OGR-oooo438o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004394.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 97 of 349\nevidence of a violation of the agreement. Epstein and his counsel\nagree that the computers that are currently under [legal process] will\nbe safeguarded in their current condition by Epstein’s counsel or\ntheir agents until the terms and conditions of the Agreement are\nfulfilled.\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a lengthy email to convey two options Lourie had\nsuggested: “the original proposal” for a state plea but with an agreement for an l8-month sentence,\nor pleas to state charges and two federal obstruction-of-justice charges. Villafafia also told\nLefkouitz she was willing to ask Acosta again to approve a federal plea to a five-year conspiracy\nwith a Rule ll(c) binding recommendation for a 2o-month sentence. Villafafia explained:\n\nAs to timing, it is my understanding that Mr. Epstein needs to be\nsentenced in the state after he is sentenced in the federal case, but\nnot that he needs to plead guilty and be sentenced after serving his\nfederal time. Andy recommended that some of the timing issues be\naddressed only in the state agreement, so that it isn’t obvious to the\njudge that we are trying to create federal jurisdiction for prison\npurposes.\n\nWith regard to prosecution of individuals other than Epstein, Villafafia suggested standard\nfederal plea agreement language regarding the resolution of all criminal liability, ‘and I will\nmention ‘co-conspirators,’ but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes\nand all of the other persons that we could charge.” Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to\ninclude a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-conspirators, who at the time she understood\nto be the four women named in the proposed agreement, because the USAO was not interested in\nprosecuting those individuals if Epstein entered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, “[W]e considered\nEpstein to be the top of the food chain, and we wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone\nelse.” She did not consider the possibility that Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed\nindividuals, and no one, including the FBI case agents, raised that concern. Villafafia also told\nOPR that her <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to “all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge”\nrelated to her concern that if the plea agreement contained information about uncharged conduct,\nthe court might ask for more information about that conduct and inquire why it had not been\ncharged, and if the government provided such information, Epstein’s atorneys might claim the\nagreement was breached.!'?\n\nWith regard to immigration, Villafafia told OPR that the USAO generally did not take any\nposition in plea agreements on immigration issues, and that in this case, there was no evidence that\neither of the two assistants who were foreign nationals had commited fraud in connection with\ntheir immigration paperwork, “and I think that they were both in status. So there wasn’t any reason\nM3 OPR understood Villafafia’s concern to be that if the government were required to respond to a court’s inquiry\ninto additional facts, Epstein would object that the government was trying to cast him in a negative light in order to\ninfluence the court to impose a sentence greater than the agreed-upon term.\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4394\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004405.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page lo8 of 349\nfederal court. Sloman similarly said that he had the impression that the non-prosecution provision\nwas meant to protect named co-conspirators who were also victims, “in a sense,” of Epstein’s\nconduct. Although later press coverage of the Epstein case focused on Epstein’s connection to\nprominent figures and suggested that the non-prosecution provision protected these individuals,\nSloman told OPR that it never occurred to him that the <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to potential co-conspirators was\ndirected touard any of the high-profile individuals who were at the time or subsequently linked\nwith Epstein.'”° Acosta did not recall the provision or any discussions about it. He speculated\nthat if he read the non-prosecution provision, he likely assumed that Villafafia and Lourie had\n“thought this through” and “addressed it for a reason.” The West Palm Beach manager, who had\nonly limited involvement at this stage, told OPR that the provision was “highly unusual,” and he\nhad “‘no clue” why the USAO agreed to it.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, apart from the women named in the NPA, the investigation had\nnot developed evidence of “any other potential co-conspirators. So, . . . we wouldn’t be\nprosecuting anybody else, so why not include it? ... I just didn’t think that there was anybody\nthat it would cover.” She conceded, houever, that she “did not catch the fact that it could be read\nas broadly as people have since read it.”\n\nK. The USAO Rejects Defense Efforts to Eliminate the Sexual Offender\n\nRegistration Requirement\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, State Atorney Krischer informed\nVillafafia that Epstein’s counsel had contacted him and Epstein was ready to agree “to all the\nterms” of the NPA—except for sexual offender registration. According to Krischer, defense\ncounsel had proposed that registration be deferred, and that Epstein register only if state or federal\nlaw enforcement felt, at any point during his service of the sentence, that he needed to do so.\nKrischer noted that he had “reached out” to Acosta about this proposal but had not heard back\nfrom him. Villafafia responded, “T think Alex is calling you nou.” Villafafia told OPR that, to her\nknouledge, Acosta called Krischer to tell him that registration was not a negotiable term. !*°\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia emailed Krischer for information about the amount of “gain\ntime” Epstein would earn in state prison. Villafafia explained in her email that she wanted to\ninclude a provision in the NPA specifying that Epstein “will actually be in jail at least a certain\nnumber of days to make sure he doesn’t try to ‘convince’ someone with the Florida prison\nauthorities to let him out early.” Krischer responded that under the proposal as it then stood,\nEpstein would serve l5 months. He also told Villafafia that a plea to a registrable offense would\nnot prevent Epstein from serving his time “at the stockade”—the local minimum security detention\nfacility. l?’\n\nl25 Sloman also pointed out that the NPA was not a “global resolution” and other co-conspirators could have\nbeen prosecuted “by any other [U.S. Atorney’s] office in the country.”\n\nl26 Krischer told OPR that he did not recall meeting or having interactions with Acosta regarding the Epstein\ncase or any other mater.\n\nal The State Atorney concluded his email: “Glad we could get this worked out for reasons I won’t put in\nwriting. After this is resolved I would love to buy you a cup at Starbucks and have a conversation.” Villafafia\nresponded, “Sounds great.” When asked about this exchange during her OPR interview, Villafafia said: “Everybody\n\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004408.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll of 349\nThe parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part of\nany public record. If the United States receives a Freedom of\nInformation Act request or any compulsory process commanding\nthe disclosure of the agreement, it will provide notice to Epstein\nbefore making that disclosure. !”°\nVII. SEPTEMBER 24, 2oo7: ACOSTA MAKES FINAL EDITS, AND THE NPA IS\n\nSIGNED\n\nThe contemporaneous emails shou that Villafafia continued to update Acosta as the parties\nnegotiated the final language and that Acosta reviewed and edited the NPA. Shortly after midnight\non Monday, September 24, 2oo7, Acosta sent Villafafia “[s]mall edits” to the “final” NPA she had\nsent to him. Among his changes was language modifying provisions that appeared to require the\nState Atorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein\nenter his guilty plea by a certain date. Acosta explained in his email, “I’m not comfortable with\nrequiring the State Atorney to enter into a [joint sentencing] recommendation” or “requiring a\nState court to stick with our timeline” for entry of the guilty plea and sentencing. Accordingly,\nAcosta substituted language that required Epstein alone to make a binding sentencing\nrecommendation to the state court, and required Epstein to use his “best efforts” to enter his guilty\nplea and be sentenced by the specified dates. Acosta also instructed Villafafia to restore a <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span>\nto Epstein’s wish “to reach a global resolution of his state and federal criminal liabilities.” Lourie,\nwho had returned to the Department in Washington, D.C., had a phone conversation with\nLefkouitz and sent additional comments on the final draft to Acosta and Villafafia. Villafafia sent\na new revision, incorporating edits from Acosta and Lourie, to Lefkouitz later that morning.\n\nOn the afternoon of September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia circulated the new “final” version of\nthe NPA to Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other supervisors, and asked Lefkouitz to send her the\nsigned agreement. After Lefkouitz electronically transmited to Villafafia a copy of the NPA\nsigned by Epstein, she emailed her immediate supervisor and her co-counsel: “They have scanned\nand emailed the signed agreement. It is done.”\n\nIn his transmital email, Lefkouitz asked Villafafia to “[p]lease do whatever you can to\nkeep this from becoming public.” Villafafia responded:\n\nI have forwarded your message only to Alex, Andy, and [the West\n\nPalm Beach manager]. I don’t anticipate it going any further than\n\nthat. When I receive the originals, I will sign and return one copy\n\nto you. The other will be placed in the case file, which will be kept\n\nconfidential since it also contains identifying information about the\n\ngirls.\n\nWhen we reach an agreement about the atorney representative for\n\nthe girls, we can discuss what I can tell him and the girls about the\nl28 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Lourie observed that because the NPA contained names of uncharged\nco-conspirators and other protected information, the USAO would have a duty to redact the information before\ndisclosing the NPA.\n\n84\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004425.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l28 of 349\nscheduled January 4, 2oo8 plea hearing. As soon became apparent, Acosta was unable to achieve\nan expedited review so that Epstein could plead guilty and be sentenced by\nJanuary 4, 2oo8, and the plea and sentencing date was rescheduled. On January 2, 2oo8, Sloman\nspoke with Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek, who confirmed that the change of plea hearing\nhad been postponed. In an email reporting this to Acosta and Villafafia, Sloman said that Epstein’s\nlocal defense atorney Goldberger had told Belohlavek the postponement was because the facts\n“did not fit the proposed state charge,” and that Belohlavek told Sloman she agreed with that\nassessment.’ The next day, Villafafia sent to Acosta and Sloman a local newspaper article\nreporting that Epstein’s state plea hearing was reset for March and in exchange for it the federal\nauthorities would drop their investigation of him. Acosta also sent to Sloman and Villafafia an\nemail memorializing a statement made to him by Lefkouitz in a phone call that day: “‘I\n[Lefkouitz] may have made a mistake 6 months ago. [Belohlavek] told us solicitation [is] not\nregistrable. It turns out that the actual offense charged is.’”!°°\n\n5. January 7, 2oo8: Acosta and Sloman Meet with Sanchez, Who Makes\nAdditional Allegations of USAO Misconduct\n\nOn January 7, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman met with defense atorney Sanchez at her request.\nAccording to meeting notes made by Sloman, among other things, Sanchez alleged that the\nUSAO’s media spokesperson had improperly disclosed details of the Epstein case to a national\nnews reporter, and Sanchez “suggested that the USAO could avoid any potential ugliness in DC\nby agreeing to a watered-doun resolution for Epstein.” After Acosta excused himself to atend\nanother meeting and Sloman refused to speak further with Sanchez “without a witness present,”\nshe left. Later that day, Acosta and Sloman spoke by phone with Starr, Lefkouitz, and Sanchez,\nwho expressed concern about the “leak” to the news media, reiterated their objections to the NPA,\nand pressed for the ‘“‘watered-doun resolution,” which they specified would mean allouing Epstein\nto plead to a charge of coercion instead of procurement, avoid serving time in jail, and not register\nas a sexual offender. A note in the margin of Sloman’s handwriten notes of the conversation\nreads: “We’re back to where we started in September.”\n\nThat evening, Villafafia expressed concern that the delay in resolving the mater was\naffecting the USAO’s ability to go forward with a prosecution should Epstein renege on his\nagreement, and she outlined for Acosta and Sloman the steps she proposed to take while Epstein\nwas pursuing Departmental review. Those steps included re-establishing contact with victims,\ninterviewing victims in New York and one victim who lived in a foreign country, making contact\nwith “potential sources of information” in the Virgin Islands, and re-initiating proceedings to\nobtain Epstein’s computers.\n\nIn the meantime, USAO Criminal Division Chief Robert Senior performed a “soup to nuts”\nreview of the Epstein investigation, reviewing the indictment package and all of the evidence\nVillafafia had compiled. He told OPR that he could not recall the reason for his review, but opined\nl5? Belohlavek told OPR that she did not recall this incident, but she noted that the PBPD report did set forth\nfacts supporting the charge of procurement of a minor.\n\nl6o Although the meeting Lefkouitz had with Lourie, Villafafia, Krischer, and Belohlavek to discuss the state\nresolution was only four months prior, not six, Lefkouitz’s <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> was likely to the September l2, 2oo7 meeting.\nlol\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4425\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004435.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l38 of 349\n\nThe next day, Villafafia asked Goldberger to change the plea agreement by inserting the\nword “imprisoned” after “6 months,” and Goldberger agreed to do so. Villafafia, houever, did not\nask that the agreement be amended to clarify that the <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to “the Palm Beach County\nDetention Facility” meant the jail, rather than the Stockade. The final signed plea agreement form\nfurther clarified the sentence, providing that after serving l2 months in the Palm Beach County\nDetention Facility, Epstein would be “sentenced to 6 months in the Palm Beach County Detention\nFacility . . . to be served consecutive to the l2 month sentence,” folloued by “l2 months\nCommunity Control.” The word “imprisoned” was hand writen after “6 months” but then crossed\nout and replaced by “jail sentence.”!”\n\nA. June 3o, 2oo8: Epstein Enters His Guilty Pleas in State Court\n\nEpstein, with his atorney Jack Goldberger, appeared in Palm Beach County court on\nJune 3o, 2oo8, and entered guilty pleas to the indictment charging him with one felony count of\nsolicitation of prostitution and to a criminal information charging him with one felony count of\nprocurement of a minor to engage in prostitution.'”4 At the plea hearing, which Villafafia and the\nFBI case agent atended as spectators, Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek did not proffer the facts\nof the case; instead she only recited the charging language in the indictment and the criminal\ninformation:\n\n[B]etween August l, 2oo4 and October 3l, 2oo5, the defendant in\n\nPalm Beach County did solicit or procure someone to commit\n\n[prostitution] on three or more occasions. And .. . between\n\nAugust l, 2oo4 and October 9, 2oo5, the defendant did procure a\n\nminor under the age of l8 to commit prostitution in Palm Beach\n\nCounty also.!”°\n\nThe court found this to be “a sufficient factual basis to support the pleas,” and engaged in\na colloquy with Belohlavek regarding Epstein’s victims:\n\nThe Court: Are there more than one victim?\n\nMs. Belohlavek: There’s several.\nhtp://www.pbso.org/inside-pbso/corrections/general/.

The history of the litigation and issues relating to it are discussed in\nChapter Three of this Report.\n\nB. Epstein Is Placed on Work Release\n\nA few days after Epstein’s guilty plea, Villafafia reported to Sloman that Epstein was\nincarcerated at the lou-security Stockade, rather than the Main Detention Center where county\nprisoners were usually housed. She also told Sloman that according to the Sheriff’s Office, Epstein\nwas eligible for work release. Although the USAO had made clear that it expected Epstein to be\nincarcerated 24 hours a day, every day, the subject of work release had not been addressed\nexplicitly during the NPA negotiations, and the NPA itself was silent on the issue. Epstein’s\nacceptance into the work release program as a convicted sexual offender was seen by many as\nanother special benefit given to Epstein. Because the decision to allou Epstein into the work\nrelease program was made by the Palm Beach Sheriffs Office, OPR did not investigate whether\nany state, county, or Sheriffs Office rules were violated. OPR did examine the USAO’s\nconsideration of work release prior to signing the NPA and its subsequent unsuccessful efforts to\nensure that Epstein remained incarcerated 24 hours a day.\n\nThe first specific <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to work release was made weeks after the NPA was signed,\nwhen Lefkouitz asserted, in his October 23, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, that, “so long as Mr. Epstein’s\nsentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the [NPA] he is entitled to any type of sentence\navailable to him, including but not limited to gain time and work release.”\n\nIn November 2oo7, Sloman had an exchange of leters with Lefkouitz about the USAO’s\nunderstanding that Epstein had agreed to serve his full jail term in “continuous confinement,”\npointing out that the NPA “clearly indicates that Mr. Epstein is to be incarcerated.” Sloman noted\nthat Florida’s Department of Corrections’s rules did not allou individuals registered as sexual\noffenders to participate in work release, and thus Epstein would not be eligible for a work release\nprogram. Sloman concluded that the USAO “‘is puting you on notice that it intends to make certain\nthat Mr. Epstein is ‘treated no beter and no worse than anyone else’ convicted of the same\noffense,” and that if Epstein were to be granted work release, the USAO would “investigate the\nreasons why an exception was granted in Mr. Epstein’s case.”!78\n\nHouever, also in November, State Atorney Krischer told Sloman that Epstein was, in fact,\neligible to petition for work release because his sexual offender registration would not take place\nal Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The Daily\nBeast.

APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nA. The United States Atorneys’ Manual\n\nAmong its many provisions, the United States Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) includes\ngeneral statements of principles that summarize appropriate considerations to be weighed, and\ndesirable practices to be folloued, by federal prosecutors when discharging their prosecutorial\nresponsibilities.8° The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. /d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\nenforcement responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\nprosecutions.\n\nl. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a\nFederal Prosecution\n\nFederal prosecutors do not open a case on every mater referred to them. USAM § 9-2.o2o\nexplicitly authorizes a U.S. Atorney “to decline prosecution in any case referred directly to\nl89 In 2ol8, the USAM was revised and reissued as the Justice Manual. In assessing the subjects’ conduct, OPR\nrelies upon the standards of conduct in effect at the time of the events in issue. Accordingly, unless otherwise noted,\ncitations in this Report are to the l997 edition of the USAM, as revised through January 2oo7.\n\nl2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4444\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004466.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l69 of 349\nOPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.’ Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\n\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.””!° Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> was made in the context of a\n2o2 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\nau Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4466\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004467.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l7o of 349\nnarrative of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s\nassociation to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the\ndefense argument that the mater should be left entirely to the state’s discretion.?!” The defense\nsubmission to the Deputy Atorney General contained a direct <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to Epstein’s connection\nto former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and\nsigned, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his\nassociation with the former President.?!3\n\nde The Subjects Asserted That They Were Motivated by Reasonable\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natorneys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at . . . hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.?'* OPR also\node In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all frve subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have joined with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4467\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004471.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l74 of 349\nd[id]n’t want to have to relive what happened to them.””!’ The co-case agent told OPR that one\nof the “strategies” for dealing with the victims’ fear was “to keep them off the stand,” and he\ngenerally remembered discussions about resolving the Epstein case in a way that protected the\nvictims’ identities. In addition, the CEOS Trial Atorney who briefly worked with Villafafia on\nthe case after the NPA was signed told OPR that in her meetings with some of the victims, she\nformed the impression that they were not interested in the prosecution going forward. The CEOS\nTrial Atorney told OPR that “[the victims] would have testified,’ but would have required an\nextensive amount of “victim management” because they were “deeply embarrassed” about\npotentially being labeled as prostitutes. The CEOS Trial Atorney also told OPR that “there were\nobvious weaknesses in the case,” from an evidentiary perspective.7!®\n\nThe contemporaneous records also reflect discussions of, or references to, various legal\nand factual issues or other concerns about the case. For example, in an early email to Menchel,\nLourie noted that two key issues raised by Villafafia’s proposed charges were whether the USAO\ncould prove that Epstein traveled for the purpose of engaging in sex acts, and the fact that some\nminor victims had told Epstein they were l8. He later opined to Acosta and Menchel that “there\nis some risk on some of the statutes [proposed in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum] as this is\nuncharted territory to some degree.” In his July 5, 2oo7 email to Villafafia, Menchel cited Acosta’s\nand Sloman’s “concerns about taking this case because of [the P]etit policy and a number of legal\nissues” and Acosta’s concerns about “hurting Project Safe Childhood.” Defense counsel raised\nmyriad legal and factual challenges in their voluminous leters to the USAO. Defense submissions\natacked the legal theories for a federal prosecution and detailed factors that could have\nundermined victims’ credibility, including victim statements favorable to Epstein and evidence of\nvictim drug and alcohol use, as well as the fact that some victims recruited other victims and\npurportedly lied to Epstein about their ages.\n\nAcosta also recalled that although his “team” had expressed concern about the “trial\nissues,” his oun focus had been on “the legal side of things.” Notably, during his prior tenure as\nthe Assistant Atorney General in charge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, Acosta had\nbeen involved in efforts to address sex trafficking. He told OPR that one of the “background\nissues” that the Civil Rights Division addressed under his leadership, and which influenced his\nview of the Epstein case, was the distinction between sex trafficking and solicitation of\nprostitution. Specifically, he was concerned about avoiding the creation of potentially unfavorable\nfederal precedent on the point of delineation between prostitution, which was traditionally a mater\nof state concern, and sex trafficking, which remained a developing area of federal interest in\n2oo7.7\noh In an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, the co-case agent noted that in early 2oo7, when he located a\nvictim living outside of the United States, she claimed only to “knou Jeffrey Epstein,” and stated that she “moved\naway to distance herself from this situation,” and “asked that [the agent] not bother her with this again.”\n\n2l8 In April 2oo7, a victim who was represented by an atorney paid by Epstein participated in a video-recorded\ninterview with the FBI, with her atorney and his investigator present. This victim denied being involved in, or being\na victim of, criminal activity. Later, the victim obtained new counsel and joined the CVRA litigation as “Jane Doe #2.”\n2l9 In his March 2o, 2oll leter, addressed “To whom it may concern,” and published online in The Daily Beast,\nAcosta described “a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors” by “an army of legal superstars.” Most\nof the allegations made against the prosecutors occurred after the NPA was signed and certainly after Acosta approved\nl47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo447l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004487.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l9o of 349\nsentence of incarceration, and the USAO would consider a plea that differed from that requirement\na breach of the NPA and would “proceed accordingly.”\n\nThe guilty plea Epstein entered in state court in June 2oo8 was consistent with the dictates\nof the NPA, and pursuant to that plea, the court imposed a sentence of l8 months’ incarceration.\nEpstein, houever, applied for and was accepted into the work release program, and was able to\nserve a substantial portion of his sentence outside of the jail. The NPA did not <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> work\nrelease nor authorize Epstein to receive such benefits during his tenure at the Palm Beach County\nStockade. Moreover, Villafafia received assurances from defense counsel that Epstein would serve\nhis entire sentence of confinement “in custody.” Responsibility for the decision to afford Epstein\nwork release privileges during his incarceration rested with state officials, who had the sole\nauthority for administering the work release program.\n\nAfter considering the substantial record documenting the decisions made after Acosta’s\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, OPR found nothing in the record to suggest\nthat the meeting resulted in a material change to the NPA, affected the sentence Epstein served\npursuant to the NPA, or contributed to state officials’ decision to permit him to participate in work\nrelease.\n\nF. Villafafia’s Emails with Defense Atorney Lefkouitz during the NPA\n\nNegotiations Do Not Establish That Villafana, or Other Subjects, Intended to\nGive Epstein Preferential Treatment or Were Motivated by Favoritism or\nOther Improper Influences\n\nDuring the CVRA litigation, the petitioners obtained from Epstein’s atorney, and filed\nunder seal, a redacted series of email exchanges between Epstein atorney Lefkouitz and Villafafia\n(and others with Acosta and Sloman) during September 2oo7 when the NPA was being finalized,\nand thereafter. These emails had been redacted to delete most of Lefkouitz’s side of the\ncommunications, and consequently they did not reflect the full context of Villafafia’s\ncommunications to Lefkouitz. The redacted emails were later unsealed and made public over\nEpstein’s objections.7*° Media coverage pointed to the content and tone of Villafafia’s emails as\nproof that Villafafia and the USAO worked in concert with Epstein’s atorneys to keep the\n“sweetheart” deal a secret from the victims and the public. Statements in several emails in\nparticular were cited as evidence of the USAO’s improper favoritism touards Epstein. In one\nexample, Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she was willing to include in the NPA a provision agreeing\nnot to prosecute others, but would “prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and\nall of the other persons that we could charge.” She also offered to meet with him “‘off campus’”\nto finalize negotiations. She also proposed, “[o]n an ‘avoid the press’ note,” that filing federal\ncharges against Epstein in Miami rather than West Palm Beach would substantially reduce press\ncoverage.\n\n236 The USAO did not object to the unsealing but requested additional redactions of portions that would reveal\nprotected information.

In a subsequent email about the draft NPA, Villafafia asked Lourie for\n“TaJny other thoughts,” but there is no indication that he provided further input. OPR found no\ndocument that suggested Villafafia and Lourie discussed the provision further, or that the other\nindividuals who were copied on Villafafia’s email referencing the provision—her immediate\nsupervisor, the supervisor designated to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office,\nand Villafafia’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it. Villafafia told\nOPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her observation that the non-\nprosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafafia assumed that they agreed with her assessment.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision\nagreeing not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that\ndefense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame\nfor what happened.” Villafafia told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct\nwas his oun “dirty litle secret.” Villafafia said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2oo6\narrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that\nnone of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators\nabout sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-knoun contacts about whom allegations arose\nmany years later.”** Villafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime\nrelationship with a close female friend who was a well-knoun socialite, but, according to\nVillafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.”*°? Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the\nfour female assistants identified by name.”*° Villafafia also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s\ninvestigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to prosecute his four assistants if he\nentered a plea.”4! Because Villafafia was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged,\nshe perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to prosecute other, unspecified\n“co-conspirators.” Villafafia told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did\nnot occur to her that the <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any\nof Epstein’s influential associates.\n\nLourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the\ntime Villafafia forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR\nthat he did not knou hou the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.\n238 Villafafia told OPR that “none of . . . the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being\ninvolved in abusing them. It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\n29 The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct\ninvolving the then minor did not occur in Florida.\n\nAAO The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one\ngirl in Epstein’s presence; this assistant was one of the named individuals for whom the defense sought the\ngovernment’s agreement not to prosecute from the outset. Villafafia explained to OPR that this individual was herself\nbelieved to also have been at one time a victim.\n\n24l Villafafia told OPR that the USAO had decided that girls who recruited other girls would not be prosecuted.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo449l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004492.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l95 of 349\nLourie described the promise not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators” as “unusual,” and told\nOPR that he did not knou why it was included in the agreement, but added that it would be “unlike\nme if I read that language to just leave it in there unless I thought it was somehou helpful.” Lourie\nposited that victims who recruited other underage girls to provide massages for Epstein\n“theoretically” could have been charged as co-conspirators. He told OPR that when he saw the\nprovision, he may have understood the <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to unnamed “co-conspirators” as “a message to\nany victims that had recruited other victims that there was no intent to charge them.”\n\nAcosta did not recall any discussions about the non-prosecution provision. But he told\nOPR that Epstein was always “the focus” of the federal investigation, and he would have viewed\nthe federal interests as vindicated as long as Epstein was required to face “meaningful\nconsequences” for his actions. Acosta told OPR that when he reviewed the draft NPA, “[t]o the\nextent I reviewed this co-conspirator provision, I can speculate that my thinking would have been\nthe focus is on Epstein[ ].. . going to jail. Whether some of his employees go to jail, or other,\nlesser involved [individuals], is not the focus of this.” Acosta also told OPR that he assumed\nVillafafia and Lourie had considered the provision and decided that it was appropriate. Finally,\nSloman, who was not involved in negotiating the NPA, told OPR that in retrospect, he understood\nthe non-prosecution provision was designed to protect Epstein’s four assistants, and it “never\ndawned” on him that it was intended to shield anyone else.\n\nThis broad provision promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is\ntroubling and, as discussed more fully later in this Report, OPR did not find evidence shouing that\nthe subjects gave careful consideration to the potential scope of the provision or whether it was\nwarranted given that the investigation had been curtailed and the USAO lacked complete\ninformation regarding possible co-conspirators. Villafafia precipitously revised a more narrou\nprovision sought by the defense. Given its evolution from a provision sought by the defense, it\nappears unlikely to have been designed to protect the victims, and there is no indication that at the\ntime, the subjects believed that was the purpose. Houever, the USAO had not indicated interest\nin prosecuting anyone other than the four named female assistants, and OPR found no record\nindicating that Epstein had expressed concern about the prosecutive fate of anyone other than the\nfour assistants and unnamed employees of a specific Epstein company. Accordingly, OPR\nconcludes that the evidence does not shou that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia agreed to the non-\nprosecution provision to protect any of Epstein’s political, celebrity, or other influential\nassociates. 74”\n\nH. OPR’s Investigation Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing That Epstein\n\nCooperated in Other Federal Investigations or Received Special Treatment on\nThat Basis\n\nOne final issue OPR explored stemmed from media reports suggesting that Epstein may\nhave received special treatment from the USAO in return for his cooperation in another federal\n242 As previously stated, Sloman was on vacation when Villafafia included the provision in draft plea agreements\nand did not monitor the case or comment on the various iterations of the NPA that were circulated during his absence.\nMenchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7, before the parties drafted the NPA.\n\nl68\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4492\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004493.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l96 of 349\ninvestigation.7* Media reports in mid-2oo9 suggested Epstein was released from his state\nincarceration “early” because he was assisting in a financial crimes investigation in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns. At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of” Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no cooperation” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“intelligence asset.”?4\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “intelligence asset,’ or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\ncooperation in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or consideration\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\nia See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\na When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss intelligence information.\n\nl69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4493\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004496.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l99 of 349\n\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind. . . the\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the [|state .. .\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\n\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein\nwould have become final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. In\nAcosta’s view, “the federal responsibility” in this unique situation was merely to serve as a “‘back-\nstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no miscarriage of justice.”*4’ Acosta told OPR\nthat he understood the PBPD would not have brought Epstein to the FBI’s atention if the State\nAtorney had pursued charges that required Epstein’s incarceration. Acosta therefore decided that\nthe USAO could avert a “manifest injustice” by forcing the state to do more and require Epstein\nto serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender.\n\nAcosta’s reasoning was flawed and unduly constricted. Acosta’s repeated references to a\n“miscarriage of justice” or “manifest injustice” echoes the “manifestly inadequate” language used\nin the Petite policy to define the circumstances in which the federal government may proceed with\na criminal case after a completed state prosecution. Nothing in the Petite policy, houever, requires\nsimilar restraint when the federal government pursues a case in the absence of a completed state\nprosecution, even if the state is already investigating the same offense. The goal of the Petite\npolicy is to prevent multiple prosecutions for the same offense, not to compel the federal\ngovernment to defer to a parallel state interest in a case, particularly one in which state officials\ninvolved in the state prosecution expressed significant concerns about it, and there were questions\nregarding the state prosecutor’s commitment to the case. Acosta told OPR that “there are any\nnumber of instances where the federal government or the state government can proceed, and state\ncharges are substantially less and different, and .. . the federal government . . . stands aside and\nlets the state proceed.” The fact that the federal government can allou the state to proceed with a\nprosecution, houever, does not mean the federal government is compelled to do so, particularly in\na mater in which a distinct and important federal interest exists. Indeed, the State Atorney told\nOPR that the federal government regularly takes over cases initiated by state investigators,\ntypically because federal charges result in “the best sentence.”\n\nEpstein was facing a substantial sentence under the federal sentencing guidelines.7**\nDespite the Ashcroft Memo’s directive that federal prosecutors pursue “the most serious readily\nprovable offense,” Acosta’s decision to push “the state to do a litle bit more” does not approach\nthat standard. In fact, Acosta conceded during his OPR interview that the NPA did not represent\nan “appropriate punishment” in the federal system, nor even “the best outcome in the state system,”\nand that if the investigation of Epstein had originated with the FBI, rather than as a referral from\nthe PBPD, the outcome might have been different. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to\nad Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n\n248 Villafafia estimated that the applicable sentencing guidelines range was l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment.\nl72\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4496\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004527.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 23o of 349\nvarious iterations of the victims’ rights legislation.””* Villafafia explained to OPR her <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span>\nto the victims:\n\n[M]y concern was that [Menchel] was violating the CVRA which\n\nrequires the atorneys for the government, which[] includes me[,] to\n\nconfer with the victims, and the [VRRA], which requires the agents\n\nto keep the victims apprised of what’s happening with the case. So\n\nin essence, I felt like he was exposing both myself and the agents to\n\nallegations of not abiding by our obligations by engaging in these\n\nplea negotiations without leting us knou about it.7°°\n\nIn his reply to Villafafia’s email, and after noting that he found her email “totally\ninappropriate,” Menchel denied that he had violated any Departmental policy, and he noted that\n“Ta]s Chief of the Criminal Division, I am the person designated by the U.S. Atorney to exercise\nappropriate discretion in deciding whether certain pleas are appropriate and consistent with”\nDepartmental policy. Perceiving Menchel’s rebuke as a criticism of her judgment, Villafafia\nresponded, “[R]aising concerns about the forgoten voices of victims in this case should not be\nclassified as a lapse in judgment” and that her “first and only concern in this case. . . is the victims.”\nMenchel told OPR that he did not view his conversation with Sanchez as a plea offer,\nasserted that he was not obligated to consult with victims during preliminary setlement\nnegotiations, and noted that he left the USAO before the NPA was fully negotiated or signed.\nMenchel told OPR that “you have discussions . . . with [the] defense all the time, and the notion\nthat even just having a general discussion is something that must be veted with victims . . . is not\neven ... in the same universe as to hou I think about this.” Menchel also observed that on the\nvery day that Villafafia criticized him for engaging in setlement negotiations without consulting\nher, the FBI, or the victims, Villafafia had herself sent an email to Sanchez offering “to discuss the\npossibility of a federal resolution of Mr. Epstein’s case that could run concurrently with any state\nresolution,” without having spoken to the victims about her proposal.”*”\n288 Villafafia told OPR that “some victims, I felt strongly, would have objected to [a state-only disposition].”\nVillafafia stated to OPR that at the time Menchel engaged in such negotiations, he would only have been aware of the\nvictim information contained in her prosecution memorandum, which included information about the “effects on the\nvictims” but did not likely contain information as to “hou they would like the case resolved.” Villafafia asserted that\nMenchel “never reached out to any of the victims to find out what their position would be.” Menchel told OPR that\nthe allegations in Villafafia’s email that he violated the Ashcroft Memo, USAM, and the CVRA were “way out of line\nin terms of what the law is and the policies are.”\n286 As discussed, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not apply before charges were\nfiled against a defendant.\n287 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel asserted that her email to Sanchez was intended\nonly to determine whether Epstein was interested in opening plea negotiations.\n2o3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4527\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004528.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 23l of 349\n2. Villafafia Asserts That Her Supervisors Gave Instructions Not to\nConsult Victims about the Plea Discussions, but Her Supervisors Do\nNot Currently Recall Such Instructions\nVillafafia told OPR that during an “early” meeting with Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel,\nwhich took place when “we were probably just entering into plea negotiations,” she raised the\ngovernment’s obligation to confer with victims.7** Initially, Villafafia told OPR she was\ninstructed, “Don’t talk to [the victims]. Don’t tell them what’s happening,” but she was not told\nwhy she should not speak to the victims, and she could not recall who gave her this instruction. In\na subsequent OPR interview, Villafafia recalled that when she raised the issue of notification\nduring the meeting, she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential. You can’t disclose them.””*\nVillafafia remained uncertain who gave her this instruction, but believed it may have been Acosta.\nNeither Acosta, Sloman, nor Menchel recalled a meeting at which Villafafia was directed\nnot to notify the victims. Acosta told OPR that the decision whether to solicit the victims’ view\n“is something [that] I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I was focused\non at least at this time,” and he did not “recall discussions about victim notification until after the\nNPA was signed.” Sloman also told OPR that he did not recall a meeting at which victim\nnotification was discussed. Menchel wrote in his response to OPR, “I have no recollection of any\ndiscussions or decisions regarding whether the USAO should notify victims of its intention to enter\ninto a pre-charge disposition of the Epstein mater.” Furthermore, Menchel told OPR he could not\nthink of a reason why the issue of victim notification would have arisen before he left the USAO,\nbecause “we were way off from finalizing or having anything even close to a deal,” and it would\nhave been “premature” to consider notification.?”°\n3. September 6, 2oo7: Villafaia Informs Sloman, Who Informs Acosta,\nof Oosterban’s Opinion That Consultation with Victims Was\nRequired\nOn September 6, 2oo7, in a lengthy email to Sloman responding to his question about the\ngovernment’s then-pending offer to the defense, Villafafia raised the victim consultation issue,\nadvising that, “the agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which as\n[CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law” and that “the [PBPD]\n288 Villafafia could not recall the specific date of the meeting, but Menchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7.\n282 Villafafia also recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations could cause\nvictims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.”\n29o In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel reiterated his contention that Villafafia’s claim\nabout a meeting involving Menchel in which she was instructed not to consult with victims was inaccurate and\ninconsistent with other evidence. OPR carefully considered the comments but did not conclude that the evidence to\nwhich Menchel’s atorney pointed necessarily refuted Villafafia’s assertion that she had received an instruction from\na supervisor not to inform victims about the plea negotiations. Houever, it is also true that OPR did not find any\n<span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> in the emails and other documents dated before the NPA was signed to a meeting at which victim\nconsultation was discussed or to a specific instruction not to consult with the victims. This is one of several events\nabout which Menchel and Villafafia disagreed, but given OPR’s conclusion that the Department did not require\nprosecutors to consult with victims before charges were brought, OPR does not reach a conclusion regarding the\nalleged meeting and instruction.\n2o4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4528\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004541.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 244 of 349\ninformed victims “of their right to collect damages prior to a thorough investigation of their\nallegations against Mr. Epstein”:\n\nNone of the victims were informed of the right to sue under\nSection 2255 prior to the investigation of the claims. Three victims\nwere notified shortly after the signing of the [NPA] of the general\nterms of that Agreement. You raised objections to any victim\nnotification, and no further notifications were done. Throughout\nthis process you have seen that I have prepared this case as though\nit would proceed to trial. Notifying the witnesses of the possibility\nof damages claims prior to concluding the mater by plea or trial\nwould only undermine my case. If my reassurances are insufficient\nthe fact that not a single victim has threatened to sue Mr. Epstein\nshould assure you of the integrity of the investigation.\n\nOn December l4, 2oo7, Villafafia forwarded to Acosta the draft victim notification leter\npreviously sent to the defense, along with two draft leters addressed to State Atorney Krischer;\nVillafafia’s transmital email to Acosta had the subject line, “The leters you requested.” One of\nthe draft leters to Krischer, to be signed by Villafafia, was to advise that the USAO had sent an\nenclosed victim notification leter to specified identified victims and referred to an enclosed “list\nof the identified victims and their contact information, in case you are required to provide them\nwith any further notification regarding their rights under Florida law.”*!? The second draft leter\nto Krischer, for Acosta’s signature, requested that Krischer respond to defense counsel’s\nallegations that the State Atorney’s Office was not comfortable with the proposed plea and\nsentence because it believed that the case should be resolved with probation and no sexual offender\nregistration. OPR found no evidence that these leters were sent to Krischer.*”°\n\nA few days later, in an apparent effort to move forward with victim notifications, Villafafia\nemailed Sloman, stating, “[Is there] anything that I or the agents should be doing?” Villafafia told\nSloman that “[the FBI case agent] is all worked up because another agent and [a named AUSA]\nare the subject of an OPR investigation for failing to properly confer with and notify victims [in\nan unrelated mater]. We seem to be in a Catch 22.”°?! OPR did not find a response to Villafafia’s\nemail.\n\nIn their December l4, 2oo7 meeting with Acosta and other USAO personnel and in their\nlengthy follou-up leter to Acosta on December l7, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz continued to press\ntheir objections to the USAO’s involvement in the Epstein mater. They requested that Acosta\n3l9 The draft victim notification leter was identical to the draft victim notification leter sent to the defense on\nDecember 6, 2oo7, except that it contained a new plea date of January 4, 2oo8.\n\n32o Moreover, the leters were not included in the publicly released State Atorney’s file, which included other\ncorrespondence from the USAO. See Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office Public Records/Jeffrey Epstein, available\nat htp://sal5.org/stateatorney/NewsRoom/indexPR htm.\n\n32l OPR was unable to locate any records indicating that such allegations had ever been referred to OPR.\nVillafafia told OPR that “Catch 22” was a <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to instructions from supervisors “[t]hat we can’t go forward on”\nfiling federal charges and “I was told not to do victim notifications and confer at the time.”\n\n2l7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo454l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004561.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 264 of 349\nno federal charges filed against Epstein as a result of the government’s agreement in mid-2oo7 to\ndefer prosecution to the state.>”°\n\nC. July 2oo8: Villafafia Prepares and Sends a Victim Notification Leter to Listed\n\nVictims\n\nOn July 8, 2oo8, Villafafia provided Goldberger with an updated victim list for l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 purposes, noting that she had inadvertently left off one individual in her June 3o, 2oo8\nleter. Villafafia also informed the defense that, beginning the follouing day, she would distribute\nnotifications to each of the 32 victims and their counsel informing them that Epstein’s atorney\nwould be the contact for any civil litigation, if the victim decided to pursue damages. Finally, the\nleter informed the defense that the government would consider a denial by Epstein that any “one\nof these victims is entitled to proceed under l8 U.S.C. § 2255” to be considered a breach of the\nterms of the NPA.\n\nAfter exchanging emails and leters with the defense concerning the content of the notice\nleter, Villafafia drafted a leter she sent, on July 9 and lo, to nine victims who had previously\nretained counsel. The leter informed the victims and their counsel that, “[i]n light of’ Epstein’s\nJune 3o, 2oo8 state court plea to felony solicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, and his sentence of a total of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by l2\nmonths’ community control, “the United States has agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of\nthis state plea and sentence, subject to certain conditions.” The leter included a <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 provision of the NPA, and although the defense had never agreed to it, used\nlanguage from Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter to Epstein defense atorney Sanchez clarifying\nthe damages provision. The paragraph belou was described as “[o]ne such condition to which\nEpstein has agreed”:\n\nAny person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an\noffense enumerated in Title l8, United States Code, Section 2255,\nwill have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she\nwould have had, if Mr. Epstein had been tried federally and\nconvicted of an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing\nthis paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein’s\natorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to\nname... as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any\njudicial authority interpreting this provision, including any authority\ndetermining which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet,\nshall consider that it is the intent of the parties to place these\nidentified victims in the same position as they would have been had\nMr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.\n\nOn July lo, 2oo8, Villafafia sent Goldberger a “Final Notification of Identified Victims,”\nhighlighting the defendant’s obligations under the NPA concerning victim lawsuits pursuant to\n37o As described in Section XII.G of this Part, the mater continued in litigation for years and resulted in the\ndistrict court’s February 2l, 2ol9 opinion concluding that the government violated the victims’ rights under the CVRA\nby failing to consult with them before signing the NPA.\n\n237\nDOJ-OGR-oooo456l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004564.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 267 of 349\nobligated to amend her prior leter to victims to correct the <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to the December leter.3”°\nAccordingly, the September leter contained no information about the parties’ intent in\nimplementing l8 U.S.C. § 2255, but merely referred to the NPA language concerning Epstein’s\nwaiver of his right to contest liability under the provision. In addition, the September leter\ndescribed the appointment of a special master, the special master’s selection of an atorney to\nrepresent the victims in their l8 U.S.C. § 2255 litigation against Epstein, and Epstein’s agreement\nto pay the atorney representative’s fees arising out of such litigation. The leter also clarified that\nEpstein’s agreement to pay for atorneys’ fees did not extend to contested litigation against him.\n\nThe government also intended for the leter to comply with the court’s order concerning\nproviding victims with copies of the NPA. The initial draft included a paragraph advising the\nvictims that they could receive a copy of the NPA:\n\nIn addition, a judge has ordered that the United States make\navailable to any designated victim (and/or her atorney) a copy of\nthe actual agreement between Mr. Epstein and the United States, so\nlong as the victim (and/or her atorney) reviews, signs, and agrees to\nbe bound by a Protective Order entered by the Court. If [the victim]\nwould like to review the Agreement, please let me knou, and I will\nforward a copy of the Protective Order for her signature.\n\nThe government shared draft versions of the September leter with Epstein’s counsel and\nresponded to criticism of the content of the proposed leter. For example, in response to the above\nlanguage regarding the August 2l, 2oo8 court order in the CVRA litigation, the defense argued\nthat there was “no court order requiring the government to provide the alleged ‘victims’ with notice\nthat the [NPA] is available to them upon request and doing so is in conflict with the confidentiality\nprovisions of the [NPA].” In response, and in consultation with USAO management, Villafafia\nrevised the paragraph as follous:\n\nIn addition, there has been litigation between the United States and\ntwo other victims regarding the disclosure of the entire agreement\nbetween the United States and Mr. Epstein. [The atorney selected\nby the special master] can provide further guidance on this issue, or\nif you select another atorney to represent you, that atorney can\nreview the Court’s order in the [CVRA litigation].\n\nOn September l8, 2oo9, a state court judge unsealed the copy of the NPA that had been\nfiled in the state case.?””\n\nSl6 In the leter, Villafafia expressed frustration with defense counsels’ claim relative to the December l9, 2oo7\nleter that was included in the July 2oo8 notification leter, noting that the July 2oo8 leter had been approved by\ndefense counsel before being sent.\n377 See Susan Spencer-Wendel, “Epstein’s Secret Pact With Fed Reveals ‘Highly Unusual’ Terms,” Palm Beach\nPost, Sept. l9, 2oo9.\n24o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4564\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004582.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 285 of 349\n\nIn Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel compared the language of the CVRA to the language\nof the VRRA, noting that the VRRA “clearly extends victim-notice rights into the pre-charge\nphase” and opining that the government “may well have violated” the VRRA with regards to its\ninvestigation of Epstein. As a predecessor to the CVRA, the VRRA afforded victims various rights\nand services; houever, it provided no mechanism for a victim to assert such rights in federal court\nor by administrative complaint. Like the CVRA, the rights portion of the VRRA established the\nvictims’ right to be treated with fairness and respect and the right to confer with an atorney for\nthe government. Houever, the rights portion of the VRRA was repealed upon passage of the\nCVRA and was not in effect at the time of the Epstein investigation.\n\nThe portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to provide certain\nvictim services such as counseling and medical care referrals remained in effect follouing passage\nof the CVRA. Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a responsible official\nto “inform a victim of any restitution or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and\nanother requiring that a responsible official “shall provide a victim the earliest possible notice of\nthe status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and\nto the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation”’—may have applied to the Epstein\ninvestigation. Houever, the VRRA did not create a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part\nof the subject atorneys, as the 2oo5 Guidelines assigned the duty of enforcing the two\nrequirements to the investigative agency rather than to prosecutors. Moreover, the VRRA did not\nrequire notice to victims before the NPA was signed because, at that point, the case remained\n“under investigation,” and the victims did not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under\nthe NPA until Epstein entered his guilty pleas in June 2oo8. Once Epstein did so, and the victims\nidentified by the USAO became entitled to pursue the § 2255 remedy, the USAO furnished the\nvictims with appropriate notification.\n\nB. OPR Did Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of Consultation Was\n\nIntended to Silence Victims\n\nDuring her OPR interviews, Villafafia recalled more than one discussion in which she\nraised with her supervisors the issue of consulting with the victims before the NPA was signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, houever, had no recollection of\ndiscussions about consulting victims before the NPA was signed, and Menchel disputed\nVillafafia’s assertions. OPR found only one writen <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> before that date, explicitly raising\nthe issue of consultation. Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR was unable to\nconclusively determine whether the lack of consultation stemmed from an affirmative decision\nmade by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about\nthe NPA before it was signed. Villafafia’s recollection suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman\nmay have been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of plea negotiations and did not\nbelieve that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations. OPR\nConduct l.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The holding in Smith\nwas based on Article 47 of the Maryland Constitution and various specific statutes affording victims the right, among\nothers, to receive various notices and an opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or\ninformation filed in a circuit court.” Houever, both the underlying statutory provisions and, significantly, the facts\nare substantially different from the Epstein investigation. In Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea.\n\n258\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4582\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004583.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 286 of 349\ndid not find evidence shouing that the subjects intended to silence victims or to prevent them from\nhaving input into the USAO’s intent to resolve the federal investigation.\n\nAlthough the contemporaneous records provide some information about victim notification\ndecisions made after the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, the records contain litle about\nthe subjects’ views regarding consultation with victims before the NPA was signed. In a\nSeptember 6, 2oo7 email primarily addressing other topics, as the plea negotiations were beginning\nin earnest and almost three weeks before the NPA was signed, Villafafia raised the topic of victim\nconsultation with Sloman: “The agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their\napproval, which as [CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law. . . .\n[A]nd the [PBPD] Chief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.’4\nSloman forwarded the email to Acosta with a note stating, “fyi.” Villafafia recalled that after she\nsent the email, Sloman told her by telephone, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.”*°° Villafafia also told\nOPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve been advised that . . . pre-\ncharge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Villafafia also recalled a discussion with\nAcosta, Menchel, and Sloman, during which she stated that she would need to get victims’ input\non the terms being proposed to the defense, and she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential.\nYou can’t disclose them.’4°°\n\nNone of the other subjects recalled a specific discussion before the NPA was signed about\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations. Menchel told OPR he believed the USAO was not required to\nconsult with victims during the preliminary “general discussion” phase of setlement negotiations;\nmoreover, he left the USAO before the terms of the NPA were fully developed.\n\nSloman told OPR that he “did not think that we had to consult with victims prior to entering\ninto the NPA” and “we did not have to seek approval from victims to resolve a case.” Sloman\nbelieved the USAO was obligated only to notify victims about resolution of “the cases that we\nhandled, filed cases.” Sloman recalled that because the USAO envisioned a state court resolution\nof the mater, he did not “think that that was a concern of ours at the time to consult with [the\nvictims] prior to entering into... the NPA.”\n\nLourie told OPR that he did not recall any discussions about informing the victims about\nthe terms of the NPA or any instructions to Villafafia that she not discuss the NPA with the victims.\nHe stated that everything the USAO did was “to try and get the best result as possible for the\nvictims. . . . [O]nce you step back and look at the whole forest . . ., you will see that... . [I]f you\nlook at each tree and say, well, you didn’t do this right for the victim, you didn’t tell the victim\nthis and that, you’re missing the big picture.”\nae As noted, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not require consultation with victims\nbecause no criminal charges had been filed. In addition, Villafafia’s <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to victim “approval” was inaccurate\nbecause the CVRA, even when applicable, requires only “consultation” with victims about prosecutorial decisions.\n‘o5 Villafaia did not recall Sloman explaining the reason for the decision.\n\n4o6 Villafafia also told OPR that she recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations\ncould cause victims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.” Villafafia was\nuncertain of the date of the conversation, but Menchel’s presence requires it to have occurred before August 3, 2oo7.\n259\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4583\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004601.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o4 of 349\natend the hearing. In his affidavit, Edwards asserted, “[T]here was no possible way I could have\nbelieved that this state plea could affect the federal investigation or the rights of my clients in that\nfederal investigation.”\n\nIn Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel stated that the government “seemingly” deferred to\nEpstein’s atorneys’ requests not to notify the victims about the NPA, and that in sending the\nJanuary and May 2oo8 FBI leters, the government’s efforts “seem to have graduated from passive\nnondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.”**’ Although both the appellate\ncourt and district court focused on the FBI’s leters for which OPR concludes that neither Villafafia,\nSloman, nor Acosta was responsible, OPR considered the courts’ analyses in evaluating whether\nsimilar representations Villafafia made to the victims whom she interviewed on January 3l and\nFebruary l, 2oo8, and to Edwards, were misleading. Therefore, OPR considered whether\nVillafafia’s statements that the mater was “under investigation” and her failure to inform all of the\nvictims whom she interviewed or Edwards about the NPA violated FRPC 4-4.l(a), 4-8.4(c), or\n4-8.4(d).\n\nFRPC 4-4.l(a) prohibits an atorney from “knouingly mak[ing] a false statement of\nmaterial fact or law to a third person” during the representation of a client. The FRPC defines\n“knouingly” as “denot[ing] actual knouledge of the fact in question” and states that such\nknouledge may be “inferred from circumstances.”* The comment to FRPC 4-4.l states that\n“Tm lisrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or omissions that\nare the equivalent of affirmative false statements.” The comment references FRPC 4-8.4 “[flor\ndishonest conduct that does not amount to a false statement.” Like FRPC 4-4.l(a), Rule 4-8.4(c)\nrequires evidence that the atorney knew the statement in question was false. Under FRPC\n4-8.4(c), the intent requirement can be satisfied “merely by shouing that the conduct was\ndeliberate or knouing” and the “motive underlying the lawyer’s conduct is not determinative;\ninstead the issue is whether he or she purposefully acted.”**? In Feinberg, the court concluded that\nthe prosecutor violated FRPC 4-4.l and 4-8.4(c) and (d) by deliberately making untruthful\nstatements to a defense atorney, despite evidence that the prosecutor intended to help the\ndefendant by making the statements.“° In this case, Villafafia was fully aware of the signed NPA\nwhen she interviewed the victims on January 3l and February l, 2oo8, and when she spoke to\nEdwards on the telephone, but she did not inform them specifically of the signed NPA. The\nquestion is whether this omission amounted to a knouing false statement or misrepresentation.\n\nOne difficulty is determining what Villafafia actually said during conversations that\nparticipants were asked to recall many years later. With respect to three of the victims whom she\ninterviewed in January and February 2oo8, Villafafia contended that she discussed the agreement\nwith them, even if she did not specifically refer to it as the NPA or discuss all of its terms, and as\naB7 Wild, 955 F.3d at ll99-l2oo.\n\n488 See R.

While she\nstudiously avoids using the word, one such theory relates to impeachment. As this Court has\nnoted, the potential impeachment of a witness does not provide grounds for issuance or\nenforcement of a Rule l7(c) subpoena because such materials would only become relevant after\na witness has testified. United States v. Skelos, No. l5-CR-3l7 (KMW), 2ol8 WL 2254538, at\n*2 (S.D.N.Y. May l7, 2ol8), aff'd, 988 F.3d 645 (2d Cir. 2o2l) (collecting cases).\n\nThe other theory of relevance that Maxwell proffers is that if the rest of the journal does\nnot mention her, the journal as a whole may serve as exculpatory evidence. At best, the theory\namounts to litle more than a “fishing expedition,” which is not the proper use of Rule l7(c). See\nUnited States v. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. 683, 698-7o (l974). In any event, the argument is too\nspeculative to meet the standard set forth in Nixon. To begin with, the request appears to be\noverbroad; under Rule l7(c), the moving party must shou that all of the requested material is\nrelevant. Cf United States v. Pena, No. l5-CR-55l (AJN), 2ol6 WL 8735699, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.\nFeb. l2, 2ol6). It appears from the briefing that the diary includes entries from before Minor\nVictim-2’s first time meeting Epstein or Maxwell. Maxwell does not explain why the absence of\nreferences to her in those entries would be relevant, and she provides no other basis as to the\nrelevance of any portions of the diary that precede her meeting Epstein or Maxwell. And here,\ntoo, the theory that the rest of the journal contradicts Minor Victim-2’s anticipated testimony as\nto specific incidents is, in its nature, targeted at impeaching the alleged victim’s anticipated\ntestimony.\n\nIn addition, Maxwell does not plausibly establish the relevance of the rest of the diary\nother than the pages she has already received. BSF has represented that the rest of the journal\ndoes not discuss Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein. Dkt. No. l9l at 5. The Government has similarly\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4738\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004739.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 298 _ Filed o6/o4/2l Page3of6\nrepresented that it understands that Minor Victim-2 stopped writing in the diary shortly after\nmeeting Jeffrey Epstein and that the diary, as a result, has no entries relating to any later trips she\ntook with Epstein. Dkt. No. 2o4 at l87. Maxwell does not provide any nonconclusory basis to\ndoubt these representations. So while it is undisputed that Maxwell is not referenced in the\ndiary—BSF, the Government, and Maxwell all agree on this point—the absence of references\nalone, without regard to whether the diary contains entries relevant to the incidents about which\nMinor Victim-2 is expected to testify at trial, does not establish any relevance except as to\npotential impeachment.\n\nNor do any of Maxwell’s additional arguments establish the relevance of the rest of the\njournal. She points to the fairness doctrine and Rules lo6 and Rule 6l2 of the Federal Rules of\nEvidence as providing additional bases for the propriety of the request under Rule l7(c). She\ncites cases regarding the fairness doctrine in the context of atorney-client privilege that have no\napplication to the issue presently before the Court. Furthermore, to the extent she makes an\nargument under Rule lo6 or Rule 6l2, the argument is premature. Even assuming that Rule lo6\nand Rule 6l2 could provide grounds for admissibility and relevance at trial, that would only\nripen at trial if portions of the journal are introduced and admited. Her Rule 6l2 argument is\nfurther strained by the fact that, even if that rule applied, it would not entitle the Defendant to\nproduction of the entire journal. The Rule provides that “[i]f the producing party claims that the\nwriting includes unrelated mater, the court must examine the writing in camera, delete any\nunrelated portion, and order that the rest be delivered to the adverse party.” Fed. R. Evid.\n6l2(b). Here, both the Government and BSF, on behalf of Minor Victim-2, have asserted that\nthe rest of the journal is unrelated. In any event, none of these principles establish the relevance\nof the journal beyond impeachment, and all of the arguments presented to the contrary are\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4739\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004780.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3o3 _ Filed o6/25/2l Pagelof2\nUSDCSDN¥\nDOCUMENT |\nELECTRONICALLY FILED\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DOC #:\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK DATE FILED:_ 6/25/2o2l ||\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-cr-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

In a 2ol6 Philadelphia Inquirer article, in\n<span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to this same sentence, Castor stated, “I put in there that if any\nevidence surfaced that was admissible | would revisit the issue. And\nevidently, that is what the D.A. is doing.” He testified that he remembered\nmaking that statement but that it referred to the possibility of a prosecution\nbased on other victims in Montgomery County or perjury.\n\nHe testified that the press release was intended for three audiences, the\nmedia, the greater legal community, and the litigants. He testified about\nwhat meaning he hoped that each audience would glean from the press\nrelease. He did not intend for any of the three groups to understand the\nentirety of what he meant. The media was to understand only that [Cosby]\nwould not be arrested. Lawyers would parse every word and understand\nthat he was saying there was enough evidence to arrest [Cosby] but that\nMr. Castor thought the evidence was not credible or admissible. The third\naudience was the litigants, and they were to understand that they did not\nwant to damage the civil case. He then stated that the litigants would\nunderstand the entirety of the press release, the legal community most of it\nand the press litle of it.\nMr. Castor testified that in November of 2ol4 he was contacted by the\nmedia as a result of a joke a comedian made about [Cosby]. Again, in the\nsummer of 2ol5 after the civil depositions were released, media\napproached Mr. Castor. He testified that he told every reporter that he\nspoke to in this time frame that the reason he had declined the charges was\nto strip Mr. Cosby of his Fifth Amendment privilege. He testified that he did\nnot learn the investigation had been reopened until he read in the paper that\n[Cosby] was arrested in December 2ol5, but there was media speculation\nin September 2ol5 that an arrest might be imminent.\nOn September 23, 2ol5, apparently in response to this media speculation,\nunprompted and unsolicited, Mr. Castor sent an email to then District\nAtorney Risa Vetri Ferman. His email indicated, in pertinent part,\n\nI’m writing you just in case you might have forgoten what we\n\ndid with Cosby back in 2oo5. .. Once we decided that the\n\nchances of prevailing in a criminal case were too remote to\n\nmake an arrest, | concluded that the best way to achieve\n\njustice was to create an atmosphere where [Constand] would\n\nhave the best chance of prevailing in a civil suit against Cosby.\n\nWith the agreement of [Atorney Phillips] and [Constand’s]\n\nlawyer, | wrote the atached [press release] as the ONLY\n\ncomment | would make while the civil case was pending.\n\nAgain, with the agreement of the defense lawyer and\n\n[Constand’s] lawyers, | intentionally and specifically bound the\n\nCommonwealth that there would be no state prosecution of\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4835\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004839.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 27 of 8o\n\nOn March 8, 2oo5, Ms. Constand filed her civil suit and Mr. Schmit retained\n\nPatrick O’Conner, Esq., as civil counsel. Mr. Schmit participated in the civil\n\ncase. [Cosby] sat for four days of depositions. Mr. Schmit testified that\n\n[Cosby] did not invoke the Fifth Amendment in those depositions and that\n\nhe would not have let him sit for the depositions if he knew the criminal case\n\ncould be reopened.\n\nHe testified that generally he does try to get agreements on [Cosby’s] behalf\n\nin writing. During this time period, Mr. Schmit was involved in writen\n\nnegotiations with the National Enquirer. He testified that he relied on the\n\npress release, Mr. Castor’s word and Mr. Phillips’ assurances that what Mr.\n\nCastor did was sufficient. Mr. Schmit did not personally speak to Mr. Castor\n\nor get the assurance in writing. During the depositions, Mr. O’Conner\n\nobjected to numerous questions. At the time of the depositions, Mr. Schmit,\n\nthrough his negotiations with the National Enquirer, learned that there were\n\nJane Doe witnesses making allegations against [Cosby]. [Cosby] did not\n\nassert a Fifth Amendment privilege when asked about these other women.\n\nMr. Schmit testified that he had not formed an opinion as to whether Mr.\n\nCastor’s press release would cover that testimony.\n\nMr. Schmit testified that during negotiations of the setlement agreement\n\nthere were references to a criminal case. The setlement agreement\n\nindicated that Ms. Constand would not initiate a criminal case against Mr.\n\nCosby. Mr. Schmit did not come forward when he learned the District\n\nAtorney’s office re-opened the case in 2ol5.\n\nT.C.O. at 47-6l (cleaned up).\n\nNotably, when District Atorney Castor decided not to prosecute Cosby, he\n“absolutely” intended to remove “for all time” the possibility of prosecution, because “the\nability to take the Fifth Amendment is also for all time removed.” N.T., 2/2/2ol6, at 67.\nThe trial court sought clarification from Mr. Castor about his statement in his second email\nto D.A. Ferman that he still believed that a prosecution was permissible as long as\nCosby’s depositions were not used in such proceedings. Former D.A. Castor explained\nto the court that he meant that a prosecution may be available only if other victims were\ndiscovered, with charges related only to those victims, and without the use of Cosby’s\ndepositions in the Constand mater. Specifically, former D.A. Castor stated that what he\nwas “trying to convey to Mrs. Ferman [was that his] binding of the Commonwealth not to\nprosecute Cosby was not for any crime in Montgomery County for all time.

The Court merely invited a discrete response to its proposed address to\nprospective jury but the government seized the opportunity to reargue.\n\nDuring the October 2l conference, the defense stated its reasons for preferring November 29, a\ndate when the Court could inquire whether any prospective jury might not be able to be fair or otherwise\nimpacted or influenced by any <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to this case during the lo-day interval that included the\nThanksgiving holiday. Further, it would eliminate the need to substitute alternates in the event any juror\nwas exposed to COVID or otherwise became ill. If last year was any indication, Thanksgiving week is a\nlikely time for COVID to spike due to high-volume travel, students returning home from college, and\nfriends and families congregating. Even an exposure to the virus during the holidays can necessitate a\nprospective juror to quarantine for a time period past November 29.\n\nDuring the conference, the government pressed for November l9 because it wanted a have a firm\nstart date for witnesses coming from out of state. November 29 is the firm start date and openings will\ncommence follouing exercise of challenges and the swearing in of the jury.

Sometimes she has\nclaimed that Mr. Epstein raped her. At other times, houever, Accuser-l has not made any\nallegation about being raped.\n\nAll the same, Accuser-l has never accused Ms. Maxwell of knouing that Mr. Epstein\nallegedly raped her or of facilitating or participating in an alleged rape. And the indictment in\nthis case does not charge any such conduct by Mr. Epstein or Ms. Maxwell. Rather, the\nindictment charges enticement and transportation of minors across state lines to provide\n“sexualized massages” to Mr. Epstein and conspiracy to do the same.\n\nIt is not clear whether any other witness will allege having been raped by Mr. Epstein.\nBut what is clear is that the indictment does not allege that any rape occurred. Nor does it allege\nthat Ms. Maxwell knew of, facilitated, or participated in an alleged rape.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nThe United States Constitution guarantees due process of law and fair trials by impartial\njuries. U.S. Const. amends. V, VI. Essential to that guarantee is a promise that the jury will not\nbe misled by irrelevant and prejudicial evidence that will district jurors from their one and only\nduty—to decide whether the government has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. See\nUnited States v. Doyle, l3o F.3d 523, 538-39 (2d Cir. l997). A jury that has been misled by\nirrelevant and prejudicial evidence cannot be considered impartial. See Fed. R.

U.S. Const.\namend. V; Jn re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 364 (l97o). The presumption of innocence has deep\nhistorical roots and is a core tenet of criminal law. “The principle that there is a presumption of\ninnocence in favor of the accused is the undoubted law, axiomatic and elementary, and its\nenforcement lies at the foundation of the administration of our criminal law.” Coffin v. United\nStates, l56 U.S. 432, 453 (l895) (looking to Deuteronomy and the law of Athens, Sparta, and\nRome for early versions of the presumption of innocence).\n\nIn some criminal cases, the parties agree that an accuser was the victim of a crime. When,\nfor example, a person is stabbed or shot, there is no dispute that the person was a victim of\nsomething. F.g., Jackson v. State, 6oo A.2d 2l, 24 (Del. l99l) (stating, on appeal from a rape\nconviction, that “[t]he term ‘victim’ is used appropriately during trial when there is no doubt that\na crime was commited and simply the identity of the perpetrator is in issue.”).\n\nThis is not one of those cases. Rather, Ms. Maxwell denies that she victimized anyone.\nAnd there is ample evidence to support her defense. The jury ultimately will have to decide\nwhether the government has proven that these accusers are in fact “victims” or “minor victims.”\nIn advance of the jury's verdict, any <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to the accusers by those terms necessarily conveys\nthe speaker’s opinion that a crime in fact occurred and that the accusers are credible. Conveying\nsuch a personal belief biases the jury against Ms. Maxwell, implies a belief in the truthfulness of\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5769\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005771.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 395 Filed lo/29/2l Page6of9\n\nCourts across the country agree. F.g., Allen v. State, 644 A.2d 982, 983 n.l (Del. l994)\n(“We recognize . . . that when, as here, consent is the sole defense in a rape case, the use of the\nterm ‘victim’ by a prosecutor at trial is improper and to be avoided.”); Jackson, 6oo A.2d at 24\n(“We agree with defendant that the word ‘victim’ should not be used in a case where the\ncommission of a crime is in dispute.”); State v. Nomura, 9o3 P.2d 7l8, 72l (Haw. App. Ct.\n\nl995) (“[ T]he term ‘victim’ is conclusive in nature and connotes a predetermination that the\nperson referred to had in fact been wronged.”); State v. Wright, 2oo3 WL 2l5o9o33, at *2 (Ohio\nApp. Ct. July 2, 2oo3) (‘[T]he trial court should refrain from using the term ‘victim,’ as it\nsuggests a bias against the defendant before the State has proven a ‘victim’ truly exists.”); State\nv. Wigg, 889 A.2d 233, 236 (Vt. 2oo5) (“[W]here the commission of a crime is in dispute and the\ncore issue is one of the complainant’s credibility, it is error for a trial court to permit a police\ndetective to refer to the complainant as the ‘victim.’”); see also State v. Albino, 24 A.3d 6o2, 6l7\n(Conn. App. Ct. 2oll) (“When there is no doubt that a homicide occurred and that the defendant\nwas the person who caused it to occur, and the only question for the jury is whether the homicide\nwas justified, . . . repeated <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to the ‘victim,’ . . . amounts to an opinion on the ultimate\nissue of the case.”).\n\nProhibiting the government from referring to the accusers as “victims” or “minor\nvictims” is particularly appropriate given the special role prosecutors play. “The United States\nAtorney is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty\nwhose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all.” Berger\nv. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88 (l935). “The responsibility of a public prosecutor [thus] differs\nfrom that of the usual advocate; his duty is to seek justice, not merely to convict.” Young v.\nUnited States, 48l U.S. 787, 8o3 (l987).\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo577l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005772.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 395 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page /7of9\n\nIn view of this special role, “The prosecutor should not argue in terms of counsel’s\npersonal opinion, and should not imply special or secret knouledge of the truth or of witness\ncredibility.” ABA Criminal Justice Standards, Prosecution Function, Standard 3-6.8, Closing\nArguments to the Trier of Fact (4th ed. 2ol7). To do otherwise poses two distinct dangers:\n\nsuch comments can convey the impression that evidence not present to the jury, but\n\nknoun to the prosecutor, supports the charges against the defendant and can thus\n\njeopardize the defendant’s right to be tried solely on the basis of the evidence\npresented to the jury; and the prosecutor’s opinion carries with it the imprimatur of\n\nthe Government and may induce the jury to trust the Government’s judgment rather\n\nthan its oun view of the evidence.\n\nUnited States v. Young, 47o U.S. l, l8-l9 (l985). When the government uses the term “victim,”\nhouever, it improperly vouches for the credibility of the accusers. E.g., Devey, l38 P.3d at 95.\n\nIt is even more important for the Court to refrain from referring to the accusers as\n“victims” or “minor victims.” This Court serves as the neutral arbiter of the law. And\n\nit is a mater of common knouledge that jurors hang tenaciously upon remarks\n\nmade by the court during the progress of the trial, and if, perchance, they are\n\nenabled to discover the views of the court regarding the effect of a witness’\ntestimony or the merits of the case, they almost invariably follou them.\nState v. Philpot, 66 N.W. 73o, 732 (loua l896). Thus,\n\nA judicial <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to the jury that a complaining witness is a ‘victim’ implicitly\n\ntells the jury that the judge believes that a crime has been commited. For a judge\n\nto communicate to the jury that witnesses were victimized, in a case where the\n\ndefense is that the conduct about which the complaining witness testifies never\n\noccurred, prejudices that defendant unfairly.\nFritzinger v. State, lo A.3d 6o3, 6lo (Del. 2olo).\n\nThere is a final reason no trial participant should refer to the accusers as “minor victims.”\nSeveral charges in this case require proof that Ms. Maxwell knew the accusers were less than\neighteen years old at the time of the alleged conduct.

See\nFed. R. Evid. 4o3. According to the defense, if Minor Victim-3 testifies that she had sex with a\n“much older man when she was l7 years old” or that she was sexually abused, the jury will assume\nthat Epstein engaged in illegal conduct, which will somehou prejudice the defendant. (Def. Mot.\n4 at l3). The Court should not assume that the jury will speculate about principles of United\nKingdom law and apply them to this case. The Court will properly instruct the jury on the elements\nof the offenses charged in the Indictment and the evidence that the jury can—and cannot—\nconsider. Those instructions will not ask the jury to consider or pass upon any aspect of United\nKingdom law, which will not be in evidence at trial. And in any event, as discussed in the\nGovernment’s opposition to the defendant’s pretrial motion to strike references to Minor Victim-\n3 in the Indictment, evidence regarding Minor Victim-3’s experiences with the defendant and\nEpstein are no more inflammatory or upseting than those of Minor Victim-l and Minor Victim-\n2. The risk of unfair prejudice is therefore minimal.\n\nIn the alternative, the defense seeks three rulings: (l) precluding the Government from\nreferring to Minor Victim-3 as a “minor,” (2) precluding the Government and Minor Victim-3\nfrom representing that she was “sexually abused” by Epstein, and (3) giving a limiting instruction\nabout United Kingdom law. The defense’s requested rulings are not grounded in law or reason.\n\nFirst, the defense claims that Minor Victim-3 should not be referred to as a “minor” because\nshe was above the age of consent in the relevant jurisdictions at the times she had sexual contact\n\n52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5836\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005854.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 7l of 84\nprior to the incident,” or alternatively, if “if a witness gets a good look at the defendant during the\ncourse of a crime”); United States v. Reed, No. ll Cr. 487 (RJS), 2ol2 WL 2o53758, at *5\n(S.D.N.Y. June 6, 2ol2) (noting that a “witness’s familiarity with a suspect may establish that the\nidentification . . . is independently reliable”).\n\nThis is not a crime in which a victim captures a fleeting glance of the perpetrator. Minor\nVictim-4 interacted with the defendant personally on multiple occasions between 2ool and 2oo4.\nShe knew the defendant by name and gave a description. In the totality of the circumstances, it is\nplain that Minor Victim-4’s identification of the defendant is sufficiently independently reliable to\npermit the jury to decide its persuasiveness.\n\nThe defense merely replies, again in conclusory fashion, that Minor Victim-4 (l) never\nidentified the defendant as an abuser, (2) did not have an opportunity to view her during the crime\nbecause the defendant was not involved in a crime, (3) never described the defendant, and (4) the\ntime between the abuse and the identification was extraordinarily long. (Def. Mot. 9 at 4). The\nfirst three of these points are inaccurate, as set forth above. And the delay in time is untroubling\ngiven Minor Victim-4’s contacts with the defendant and consistent references in the intervening\ntime. The defense is free to atempt to argue these points to the jury, but none of these arguments\nsupports a motion to suppress Minor Victim-4’s identification of the defendant.\n\nMinor Victim-4 knous who participated in the sexual abuse she experienced, as she has\nfor the decades since it happened. This Court should deny the motion.\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5854\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005860.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 77 of 84\nconsistent with the rules in this exhibit.'? The relevance of the document is self-evident: among\nother things, it directs employees to “see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing.” (GX 6o6 at 4). It is\nnot prejudicial as to her “lifestyle” (Def. Mot. l3 at 3), because the jury will already hear testimony\nabout her and Epstein’s various properties, private jet, and employees. And the document is not\nhearsay, because the statements are being offered as instructions to staff, not for the truth of the\nmater asserted.\n\nAs described above, each of these exhibits is highly relevant, not hearsay or subject to a\nhearsay exception, and can be authenticated at trial. The Court should deny the defense’s motion\nregarding relevance and Rule 4o3, and deny the motion regarding authentication with leave to\nrenew it at trial.\n\nVII. There is No Basis to Preclude Discussion of “Victims” or Rape\n\nCiting no case in the federal system, the defendant moves to preclude any trial participants\nfrom referring to the Minor Victims as Victims. The defendant also moves to preclude testimony\nconceming a rape commited by Jeffrey Epstein against one of the Minor Victims. Both of these\nmotions lack merit, and they should be denied.\n\nA. References to Victims\n'? Here and elsewhere (see, e.g. Def. Mot. 2 at 3-4), the defense argues that evidence that post-\ndates the time period of the conspiracy is irrelevant. That is incorrect. What maters is whether\nthe evidence tends to make a fact of consequence more or less probable. If, for instance, there is\nevidence shouing that Epstein and the defendant were extremely close partners in 2oo5, that tends\nto make it more probable that they had such a relationship in 2oo4, during the time period of the\nconspiracy. It is therefore highly relevant.\n76\nDOJ-OGR-oooo586o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005861.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 78 of 84\n\nThe defendant moves to preclude any trial participants from using the word “victim” to\nrefer to any of the Minor Victims. The Government expects that it will use the word “victim,”\nparticularly in jury addresses, but such use is not improper vouching or prejudicial to the defense.\nThe Government also expects its expert to use the word “victim,” but she will testify about victims\ngenerally and not any victims in this case specifically. The Government does not otherwise expect\nits witnesses to use the word “victim.” To the extent they do, houever, it is not prejudicial to the\ndefense.”°\n\nThe defendant cites no federal case that has accepted its argument. Nor does this argument\nmake sense. The erroneous premise in the defense argument is that referring to someone as a\n“victim” “necessarily conveys the speaker’s opinion that a crime in fact occurred and that the\naccusers are credible.” (Def. Mot. l2 at l). That is incorrect. The Government’s references to\n“victims” are part of its theory of the case. Use of that term in a jury address is not an expression\nof counsel’s opinion; it is the Government’s litigating position, just like referencing someone as\nthe “shooter” in a shooting case or the “dealer” in a narcotics case. See United States v. Arias-\nJavier, 392 F. App’x 896, 898 (2d Cir. 2olo) (summary order) (“The prosecutor is permited\nvigorously to argue for the jury to find its witnesses credible as long as it does not link its oun\ncredibility to that of the witness or imply the existence of extraneous proof supporting the witness’s\no Notably, the defense motion is entirely premised on the notion that the parties disagree about\nwhether the Minor Victims are in fact victims of any crime. If the defense concedes at any point\nthat the Minor Victims are victims of any crime—for example, if the defendant concedes the\nvictims were abused by Epstein but disclaims knouledge or involvement—their argument in\nsupport of this motion collapses entirely. (Def. Mot. l2 at l (contrasting this case with cases in\nwhich “there is no dispute that the person was a victim of something’’)).\n\n77\nDOJ-OGR-oooo586l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005862.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 79 of 84\ncredibility.”). Prosecutors are simply using a term that is consistent with the Government’s theory\nof the case. See United States v. Edwards, No. CR l6-lo3-BLG-SPW-l, 2ol7 WL 4l59365, at\n*l (D. Mont. Sept. l9, 2ol7) (explaining that “use of the term ‘victim’ is not prejudicial to the\ndefendant’s rights when the presentation of evidence taken as a whole clarifies the government’s\nburden of proving all of the elements of the crime” and finding that the “jury will not be unduly\nprejudiced against [the defendant] if the government refers to certain witnesses as victims’); (citing\nUnited States v. Washburn, 444 F.3d loo7, lol3 (8th Cir. 2oo6) (“[A] number of courts have\ndetermined that the use of the term “victim” in jury instructions is not prejudicial to a defendant’s\nrights when, as is the case here, the instructions taken as a whole clarify the government’s burden\nof proving all elements of the crime”)); Server v. Mizell, 9o2 F.2d 6ll, 6l5 (7th Cir. l99o) (“No\nlogical argument can be made that the mere use of the term ‘victim’ [in jury instructions] somehou\nshifted the burden of proof.”). In addition, “[t]he term ‘victim’ is not inherently prejudicial. It is\na term commonly used in the English language that does not by its nature connote guilt.” United\nStates v. Lussier, No. l8-CR-28l (NEB), 2ol9 WL 24899o6, at *5 (D. Minn. June l5, 2ol9).7!\nAnd just as the defense may make arguments atacking the credibility of victims, the Government\nis free to argue that these witnesses are, in fact, victims of a crime. Cf United States v. Thai, 29\nF.3d 785, 8o7 (2d Cir. l994) (explaining that prosecutors may also “respond to an argument that\nimpugns its integrity or the integrity of its case’’).\n\n7l The same is true with references by the Government to “minor victims.” (Cf Def. Mot. l2 at 4-\n5). The Government does not expect any other trial participant to use the phrase “minor victims.”\n78\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5862\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005863.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 8o of 84\n\nWitnesses may also <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> “victims.” But the only witness the Government expects to\nuse the term “victim” is its expert, Dr. Rocchio. And Dr. Rocchio will not be testifying about the\ndefendant or the Minor Victims in this case, but about victims of sexual abuse generally.\nAccordingly, she is not vouching for the credibility of anyone in this case, or presuming anything\nabout the truth or falsity of any accusations.\n\nTo the extent other Government witnesses use the term “victim,” houever, it would not be\nprejudicial to the defense. The limitation on improper vouching applies to the prosecutor, not to\nGovernment witnesses, as even one of the defendant’s cases acknouledges. See Jackson v. State,\n6oo A.2d 2l, 25 (De. l99l) (“The opinion does not state, nor does it imply, that the use of the term\n‘victim’ by witnesses, as a term of art or in common parlance, is a basis for objection.”). In\nparticular, some of the witnesses who may use the word “victim” are the Minor Victims\nthemselves, who are testifying about their subjective experiences. It is not prejudicial to the\ndefense for someone who considers herself a victim to testify as much.”\n\nHere, as with other motions, the defendant requests an extraordinary order not seen in other\ncases in this District. That request lacks merit, and the Court should deny it.\n\nB. Evidence of Rape\n\nThe Government expects that at least one minor victim may describe being raped by Jeffrey\nEpstein. If that testimony is offered, it is directly relevant to issues before the jury. The defendant\nand Epstein are charged with transporting minors, enticing minors, or trafficking minors with the\n?? The Government defers to the Court on hou it would like to refer to the Minor Victims. It notes,\nhouever, that “Accuser” is an alternative that is prejudicial to the Government.\n\n79\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5863\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005872.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page5of 43\n\n96o N.

Usually in a lou-key, nonforcible fashion, possibly by\npresenting the activity as a game or something that is ‘special’ and fun.\nThis always entails misrepresentation of moral standards, either verbally\nor implicitly... . Perhaps rewards or bribes will be offered.”\n\nSalter (l995) “The establishment (and eventual betrayal) of affection and trust occupies\na central role in the child molester’s interactions with children. The\ngrooming process itself often seems similar from offender to offender,\nlargely because it takes litle to discover that emotional seduction is the\nmost effective way to manipulate children.”\n\nHouit (l995) “The steps taken by paedophiles to ‘entrap’ their victims and is in some\nways analogous to adult courtship.”\n\nLeberg (l997) “The offender plans to make the victim less likely to resist, to make others\nunaware of what he is doing, or even to make them likely to help him,\nwithout their knouledge, to molest a child.”\n\nGallagher (l999) “Entrapment involves the use of an array of material, illicit and emotional\n‘inducements’ to draw children into abusive situations and increases\ntheir difficulty in disclosing.”\n\nBrackenridge “The process by which a perpetrator isolates and prepares an intended\n\n(2ool) victim.”\n\nGillespie (2oo2) “The process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an\natempt to gain the child’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get\nthe child to acquiesce to abusive activity. It is frequently a pre-requisite\nfor an abuser to gain access to a child.”\n\nBerson (2oo3) “Grooming involves a clever process of manipulation, typically initiated\nthrough a nonsexual approach, which is designed to entice a victim into\na sexual encounter (Broun, 2ool). The inhibitions of a child are\nlouered through active engagement, desensitization, pouer and control.\nIt is often characterized as a seduction, involving a slou and gradual\nprocess of learning about a child and building trust. This also\ncontributes to the difficulty in detecting the activity. Grooming is also a\ndeceptive process in which a child is unprepared to interpret cues\nwhich signal danger of risk. Predators are skilled at gaining the trust of a\nchild before luring them into interactions. The process of grooming\nthrough the formation of a close bond creates a victim who is more\nlikely to comply with sexual advances.”\n\nO’Connell “A course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would\n\n(2oo3) give a reasonable person cause for concern that any meeting with a\nchild arising from the conduct would be for unlawful purposes.”\n\nSpiegel (2oo3) “Subjection is the process of predisposing a boy to sexual abuse by means\nof subtle or blatant interactions that lead to boundary diffusion and role\nconfusion.”\n\nCraven, Broun, “A process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the\nand Gilchrist environment for the abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining\n(2oo6) access to the child, gaining the child’s compliance and maintaining the\n\nchild’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process serves to strengthen the\noffender's abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of justifying or\ndenying their actions.”\n\nKnoll (2olo) “The process by which sex offenders carefully initiate and maintain\nsexually abusive relationships with children. Grooming is a conscious,\ndeliberate, and carefully orchestrated approach used by the offender.\nThe goal of grooming is to permit a sexual encounter and keep it a\nsecret.”\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5872\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005873.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 6 of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 96l\nTABLE 2 Proposed Subtypes of Grooming\nAuthor Types of Grooming\nLeberg (l997) l.

Intrafamilial\ndefinitions share some key similarities, many behaviors may be classified as\ngrooming under some definitions but not under others. Some of these sim-\nilarities in definition include the criterion of preparing a child for abuse\n(Brackenridge, 2ool; Craven, Broun, & Gilchrist, 2oo6; Gallagher, l999),\ngaining a child’s trust (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Gillespie, 2oo2;\nSalter, l995), making it more difficult to the child to resist or disclose the\nabuse (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Gallagher, l999; Gillespie, 2oo2;\nKnoll, 2olo; Leberg, l997), and the enumeration of specific tactics used to\ngroom the child (Berson, 2oo3; Gallagher, l999; Sgroi, l982).\n\nFurthermore, a variety of different kinds of definitional features are pro-\nposed. For example, one definition mentions “betrayal” (Salter, l995) while\nanother references “courtship” (Houit, l995). Some proposed definitions\ngive concrete examples of grooming (Gallagher, l999; Sgroi, l982), while\nothers try to give abstract properties to capture what the authors take to be\nthe essential properties of grooming (O’Connell, 2oo3; Spiegel, 2oo3). Some\ndefinitions are fairly brief and more vague (Brackenridge, 2ool; Houit, l995;\nSpiegel, 2oo3), whereas others are much longer and more detailed about\nwhat grooming looks like (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Sgroi, l982).\nObviously this heterogeneity presents serious challenges for forensic and\nclinical work.\n\nSome of these definitions involve additional difficulties in that the terms\nused to define grooming present additional serious definitional problems\nthemselves. For example, Salter (l995) used the phrase “emotional seduc-\ntion” in her grooming definition. This requires further delineation of what\nexactly emotional seduction entails as well as a measurement strategy to\nvalidly capture this alleged dimension. As another example, Spiegel’s (2oo3)\ndefinition involves constructs such as “boundary diffusion” and “role con-\nfusion.” These constructs are not part of the standard scientific lexicon and\nthus create further impediments to enhancing our scientific understanding of\nthe grooming process. Finally, some definitions propose stages of grooming,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5873\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005886.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page l9 of 43\n974 N. Bennet and W. O’Donobue\ngrooming and the prevention of future abuse (by perhaps a comparison with\na no treatment contro). Another important issue is to investigate what sort\nof training programs or materials need to be developed so that a wide vari-\nety of professionals can faithfully implement the definition and proposed\nassessment methods.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nCurrently there is no consensus regarding hou to define grooming. In addi-\ntion, there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred. or\nis occurring. The field possesses an insufficient amount of knouledge about\nkey issues such as the interrater reliability of these judgments or the error\nrates of these judgments including the frequency of false negatives or false\npositives. Thus currently it appears that grooming is not a construct that\nought to be used in forensic setings as it does not meet some of the cri-\nteria in the Daubert standard. The Daubert standard indicates that in court\nan expert witness may only testify if (a) “the expert’s scientific, technical,\nor other specialized knouledge will help the trier of fact to understand the\nevidence or to determine a fact in issue; (b) the testimony is based on suffi-\ncient facts or data; (c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and\nmethods; and (d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and meth-\nods to the facts of the case” (Rule 7o2: Testimony by expert witness). Right\nnou it does not appear to be the case that there are “reliable principles and\nmethods” to define and detect grooming.\n\nWe propose a definition of grooming that involves two parts: (a) inap-\npropriate behavior on the part of the adult and (b) sound arguments that this\ninappropriate behavior functions to increase the probability of future sexual\nabuse. We then provide exemplars of this kind of inappropriate behavior.\nFuture research on grooming would be more useful to the field if data were\ncollected using a single, clear definition such as the one we have proposed.\nThis would provide a basis for data to be easily aggregated and beter under-\nstood, which could lead to the admissibility of grooming evidence in forensic\nsetings. Furthermore, we are currently working to develop valid psycho-\nmetric instruments with knoun reliability and validity to assess grooming\naccording to this standard.\n\nREFERENCES\nl8 USC § 2252A.

Craven et al.\nweaknesses of these definitions are discussed in turn belou. First, O’Connell defines sexual\ngrooming as:\n\nA course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would give a reasonable\n\nperson cause for concern that any meeting with a child arising from the conduct would be\n\nfor unlawful purposes. (O’Connell, 2oo3, p. 6)\n\nSecond, Houit suggests that:\n\nGrooming ...is the steps taken by paedophiles to “entrap” their victims and is in\n\nsomeways analogous to adult courtship. (Houit, l995, p. l76)\n\nThese two definitions are problematic, because they both refer to the term paedophile. Most\nsexual offenders who target child victims use sexual grooming, not just those classified as\npaedophiles. The term “paedophile” is a very specific clinical diagnosis, clearly not applicable\nto all offenders, and the association of grooming behaviour with paedophilia may prevent\nsome offenders from acknouledging their oun grooming behaviours. In addition, people\nknoun to the offender may not identify the grooming behaviour because they do not consider\nthe individual to fit their image of a “paedophile”. The public perception of a paedophile is\nlitered with stereotypes that they are “dirty old men” or strangers; these perceptions may\naffect an individual’s judgement of whether the behaviour they have observed is grooming.\nThese misperceptions distract from the truth that most victims knou their abuser. It is\nimportant that the wording of a definition does not thwart the identification of sexual\ngrooming and the subsequent prevention or ending of abuse.\n\nFurthermore, the phrase “a course of conduct” requires subsequent definition.\nAdditional problems include <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to “a reasonable person” and “cause for concern’’.\nAlthough legal precedent defines these phrases, they are ambiguous to the lay reader and\nhence they are open to misinterpretation and confusion. These definitions are confusing, at\nbest, and at worst they reinforce the myth that strangers are the biggest risk to children.\nConsequently, this ambiguity may hinder the identification of the full range of sexual\ngrooming behaviours.\n\nGillespie (2oo2) provides the third definition:\n\nThe process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an atempt to gain the\n\nchild’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get the child to acquiesce to abusive\n\nactivity. It is frequently a pre-requisite for an abuser to gain access to a child. (Gillespie,\n\n2oo2, p. 4ll; based on van Dam, 2ool)\n\nThis definition avoids the use of the term paedophile. It also provides some clarity about the\npurpose of sexual grooming behaviour and identifies some of the stages that it involves. This\nappears to be the most appropriate published definition to date. Further evaluation of this\ndefinition will follou consideration of previous literature and current understanding about\nsexual grooming.\n\nPrevalence\n\nCanter, Hughes and Kirby (l998) provide evidence for the prevalence of the sexual grooming\nphenomenon. They used Small Space Analysis on a behaviour matrix of the interaction\nbetween 97 incarcerated child sex offenders and their victims. They identified three distinct\nbehaviour repertoires of offender—victim interaction. The different types of offender—victim\ninteraction acknouledged were aggressive, which was identifiable by the use of extreme\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5899\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005909.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 42 of 43\n\n298 — S.

Houever, the lack of control that young\npeople experience follouing disclosure remains an issue (Ungar et al., 2oo9b;\nQuayle et al., 2ol2). This highlights the need for dissemination of information\ndirectly to young people about the legal process, the possible consequences of\ndisclosure, as well as ongoing developments in legal proceedings when young\npeople and their families interface with the legal system.\n\nThe more recent focus on investigating those strategies that children use in | ‘More recent focus on\nmaking disclosures rather than solely on identifying barriers to disclosure is investigating those\nperhaps more helpful in informing awareness-raising campaigns and :\nprofessional interventions.

Graham, No. l4 Cr. 5oo (NSR), 2ol5 WL 6l6l292, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 2o,\n2ol5) (same).\n\nFinally, whatever minimal probative value the rape allegation might have would be\nsubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, and misleading\nthe jury. Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. As we previously argued in our initial Motion, rape is highly\nemotional and inflammatory, much more so than the “sexualized massages” alleged in the S2\nIndictment. See Mot. at 2-3. Admiting testimony of an alleged rape would pose a serious risk\nthat the “jury will convict for crimes other than those charged—or that, uncertain of guilt, it will\nconvict anyway because a bad person deserves punishment.” Old Chief v. United States, 5l9\nU.S. l72, l8l (l997) (quoting United States v. Moccia, 68l F.2d 6l, 63 (lst Cir. l982) (Breyer,\nJ.)) (discussing propensity evidence). Such evidence would also confuse the issues at trial and\nmislead the jury. It will cause the jurors to focus on conduct that is not relevant to the charged\noffense and suggests that they convict Ms. Maxwell on an improper and highly emotional basis.\nSee United States v. Stein, 52l F. Supp. 2d 266, 273 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (excluding other-act\nevidence in a conspiracy case under Rule 4o3 because of the “risk that this evidence would\nconfuse the issues, cause undue delay, and be used for an improper purpose”). The Court should\ntherefore preclude any testimony or evidence about an alleged rape.\n\nXI. <span class=\"highlight\">REFERENCE</span> TO ACCUSERS AS \"VICTIMS\" IS IMPROPER VOUCHING\nWithout explaining its logic, and by way of cases concerning jury instructions, the\ngovernment disagrees that use of the term \"victim\" by witnesses and the prosecution during trial\n\namounts to improper vouching. Yet, the government offers that the only times it expects the\nword will be used at trial are (a) by the prosecutors during their jury addresses, and (b) in Dr.\nRocchio's testimony concerning her patients. Resp. at 77. The government's legal analysis and\n38\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5999\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006001.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 46 of 52\nspeculating that the accusers have already been found credible by someone, or that their decision\nis a foregone conclusion. On the other side of the probative-prejudicial scale, the government\nsimultaneously fails to articulate any probative value in use of the term \"victim,\" either in its jury\naddress or otherwise. Cf State v. Wigg, 889 A.2d 233, 236 (Vt. 2oo5) (\"the use of the term\n‘victim’ had no inherent probative value\").\n\nSecond, the government improperly suggests in response that the stricture on vouching\nshould not apply to the witnesses themselves. Resp. at 79. As explained by numerous cases,\nhaving any witness refer to themselves or another witness as a \"victim\" is the very height of\nimproper vouching. Sena, supra; State v. Sperou, 365 Or. l2l, l3l, 442 P.3d 58l, 59o (2ol9)\n(\"another witness’s description of the complaining witness as a 'victim' conveys an opinion that\nthe complaining witness is telling the truth. That is what the vouching rule is intended to\nprevent.\"); Wigg, supra.\n\nFinally, the government contends that Dr. Rocchio can use the word \"victim\" in <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span>\nto \"victims of sexual abuse generally,\" but her use of the term is even more problematic. For the\nreasons articulated in our Daubert motion and reply, Dr. Rocchio bases her expertise on her\ntherapeutic number of individuals who have self-identified as sexual abuse victims, without any\nresearch or investigation as to whether the individuals' self-reports are true. She then intends to\ndraw from her anecdotal and experiential treatment to generalize about all \"victims\" without their\never having been a finding that any of the persons she has provided treatment to were, in fact,\n\"victims.\" If she is permited to testify, there is no reason for her to vouch for the credibility of\nher patients, unless she clarifies each time that she is taking the individual at their word that they\nwere in fact a victim. The danger of confusion to a jury is that anyone treated by Dr. Rochio\nmust have been a victim. As the Wigg court recognized, there will be a \"danger of unfair\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6ool\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006070.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4lo-l Filed ll/o4/2l Page 4of 93\nContact with Others/Social Media\n\nDuring your deliberations, you must not communicate with or provide any information to\nanyone by any means about this case.

Engle and W. O'Donobue\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nThese ll pathways merit further investigation and supplementation if addi-\ntional pathways are identified. Ascertaining the psychological processes\nand functioning of a claimant may help explain possible motivations and\ninformation processing errors that could lead to an untruthful claim. Binder\nand McNeil (2oo7) underline the utility of psychological evaluation as a tool\nin the assessment of accusers and the accused, though they also stress the\nimportance of examining these in the context of the presence or absence\nof corroborating evidence. Without corroborating evidence, forensic eval-\nuators must acknouledge that “he said, she said” sexual assault cases are\ninherently difficult to assess for truth and that truth is unlikely to be found\nin its entirety within the results of psychological evaluation. Nevertheless,\npsychological evaluations may inform forensic evaluators of psychological\nprocesses by which a person may either intentionally or unintentionally file\na false allegation of sexual assault. The results of a psychological evaluation\nare not intended merely as a useful tool for the defense; evaluation may\nalso help establish the veracity of a claimant’s account of events and may be\nrelevant for a prosecutor’s decisions to pursue an indictment.\n\nIn proposing these pathways, it is important to acknouledge that psy-\nchological evaluations should serve only as corroborating evidence and\nshould not be construed as sufficient evidence upon which to determine\ntruth. All evidence must be weighed appropriately to assess the veracity of a\nclaim. Forensic evaluators must also be aware that some psychological disor-\nders are more likely to be associated with experiences of sexual assault and\nabuse. For example, certain populations such as the intellectually disabled\nand other populations with cognitive difficulties may be at an increased risk\nof sexual assault. These risks should be assessed and weighed appropriately\nin conjunction with all of the evidence in cases where the claimant may\nhave difficulty communicating or recalling the entire event.\n\nThe legal system has an obligation to be mindful of discrimination faced\nby victims and biases faced by the accused. Further investigation of path-\nways and other possible causal mechanisms of false allegations may help\nelucidate more evidence that can be utilized in the determination of truth in\na sexual assault case.\n\nREFERENCES\nAhlgrim-Delzell, L., & Dudley, J.R.

This concerns in the first instance the flurry of motions\nin limine filed earlier this evening, replete with redactions justified by the a\nconclusory <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d\nCir. 2oo6).\nThe Government's Justifications for redaction (Docket No. 399, docketed at lo:o6\npm on Friday Oct 29) cites Lugosch then says \"The Government also seeks sealing\nof trial exhibits, where are not public.” Inner City Press immediately opposes this.\nAs one example within this motions of limine, the Government has redacted the\nentirely of its Argument X, even the title and the page number. And as to trial\nexhibits, see for example Judge Jed S. Rakoff's order in US v. Weigand, 2o-cr-l88\n(JSR) htps://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2o536946-rakofforderonmrlicp\nThere, Judge Rakoff ordered the US Atorney's Office to make trial exhibit\navailable to the public at large. While this was done, belatedly, in US v. Parnas, it\nwas refused in the current US v. Cole. It cannot be refused in this case.\nAlso, Inner City Press understands that the listen-only call-in telephone lines\navailable so far in the case, there may be an atempt to discontinue them. The Court\nshould take judicial notice of continue COVID-l9 issues, including people's\nunderstandable concerns about congregating even in so-called overflou rooms. Be\naware that the District for the District of Columbia still allous public phone access\nto all criminal proceedings, even those held in-person. That should happen here.\nThe loss of First Amendment freedoms, even for a short period of time,\nunquestionably constitutes irreparable injury. Elrod v.

The Remaining Defense Motions are Aimed at Evidence the Government Does Not Plan to Elicit\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo67ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006761.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 53 of 84\nbecause evidence was “pertinent to whether he used the internet in an atempt to engage in sexual\nconduct with” putative victim).\n\nThe defense argues that this testimony will be unfairly prejudicial to the defendant. See\nFed. R. Evid. 4o3. According to the defense, if Minor Victim-3 testifies that she had sex with a\n“much older man when she was l7 years old” or that she was sexually abused, the jury will assume\nthat Epstein engaged in illegal conduct, which will somehou prejudice the defendant. (Def. Mot.\n4 at l3). The Court should not assume that the jury will speculate about principles of United\nKingdom law and apply them to this case. The Court will properly instruct the jury on the elements\nof the offenses charged in the Indictment and the evidence that the jury can—and cannot—\nconsider. Those instructions will not ask the jury to consider or pass upon any aspect of United\nKingdom law, which will not be in evidence at trial. And in any event, as discussed in the\nGovernment’s opposition to the defendant’s pretrial motion to strike references to Minor Victim-\n3 in the Indictment, evidence regarding Minor Victim-3’s experiences with the defendant and\nEpstein are no more inflammatory or upseting than those of Minor Victim-l and Minor Victim-\n2. The risk of unfair prejudice is therefore minimal.\n\nIn the alternative, the defense seeks three rulings: (l) precluding the Government from\nreferring to Minor Victim-3 as a “minor,” (2) precluding the Government and Minor Victim-3\nfrom representing that she was “sexually abused” by Epstein, and (3) giving a limiting instruction\nabout United Kingdom law. The defense’s requested rulings are not grounded in law or reason.\n\nFirst, the defense claims that Minor Victim-3 should not be referred to as a “minor” because\nshe was above the age of consent in the relevant jurisdictions at the times she had sexual contact\n\n52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo676l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006779.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 7l of 84\nprior to the incident,” or alternatively, if “if a witness gets a good look at the defendant during the\ncourse of a crime”); United States v. Reed, No. ll Cr. 487 (RJS), 2ol2 WL 2o53758, at *5\n(S.D.N.Y. June 6, 2ol2) (noting that a “witness’s familiarity with a suspect may establish that the\nidentification . . . is independently reliable”).\n\nThis is not a crime in which a victim captures a fleeting glance of the perpetrator. Minor\nVictim-4 interacted with the defendant personally on multiple occasions between 2ool and 2oo4.\nShe knew the defendant by name and gave a description. In the totality of the circumstances, it is\nplain that Minor Victim-4’s identification of the defendant is sufficiently independently reliable to\npermit the jury to decide its persuasiveness.\n\nThe defense merely replies, again in conclusory fashion, that Minor Victim-4 (l) never\nidentified the defendant as an abuser, (2) did not have an opportunity to view her during the crime\nbecause the defendant was not involved in a crime, (3) never described the defendant, and (4) the\ntime between the abuse and the identification was extraordinarily long. (Def. Mot. 9 at 4). The\nfirst three of these points are inaccurate, as set forth above. And the delay in time is untroubling\ngiven Minor Victim-4’s contacts with the defendant and consistent references in the intervening\ntime. The defense is free to atempt to argue these points to the jury, but none of these arguments\nsupports a motion to suppress Minor Victim-4’s identification of the defendant.\n\nMinor Victim-4 knous who participated in the sexual abuse she experienced, as she has\nfor the decades since it happened. This Court should deny the motion.\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6779\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006785.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 77 of 84\nconsistent with the rules in this exhibit.'? The relevance of the document is self-evident: among\nother things, it directs employees to “see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing.” (GX 6o6 at 4). It is\nnot prejudicial as to her “lifestyle” (Def. Mot. l3 at 3), because the jury will already hear testimony\nabout her and Epstein’s various properties, private jet, and employees. And the document is not\nhearsay, because the statements are being offered as instructions to staff, not for the truth of the\nmater asserted.\n\nAs described above, each of these exhibits is highly relevant, not hearsay or subject to a\nhearsay exception, and can be authenticated at trial. The Court should deny the defense’s motion\nregarding relevance and Rule 4o3, and deny the motion regarding authentication with leave to\nrenew it at trial.\n\nVII. There is No Basis to Preclude Discussion of “Victims” or Rape\n\nCiting no case in the federal system, the defendant moves to preclude any trial participants\nfrom referring to the Minor Victims as Victims. The defendant also moves to preclude testimony\nconceming a rape commited by Jeffrey Epstein against one of the Minor Victims. Both of these\nmotions lack merit, and they should be denied.\n\nA. References to Victims\n'? Here and elsewhere (see, e.g. Def. Mot. 2 at 3-4), the defense argues that evidence that post-\ndates the time period of the conspiracy is irrelevant. That is incorrect. What maters is whether\nthe evidence tends to make a fact of consequence more or less probable. If, for instance, there is\nevidence shouing that Epstein and the defendant were extremely close partners in 2oo5, that tends\nto make it more probable that they had such a relationship in 2oo4, during the time period of the\nconspiracy. It is therefore highly relevant.\n76\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6785\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006786.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 78 of 84\n\nThe defendant moves to preclude any trial participants from using the word “victim” to\nrefer to any of the Minor Victims. The Government expects that it will use the word “victim,”\nparticularly in jury addresses, but such use is not improper vouching or prejudicial to the defense.\nThe Government also expects its expert to use the word “victim,” but she will testify about victims\ngenerally and not any victims in this case specifically. The Government does not otherwise expect\nits witnesses to use the word “victim.” To the extent they do, houever, it is not prejudicial to the\ndefense.”°\n\nThe defendant cites no federal case that has accepted its argument. Nor does this argument\nmake sense. The erroneous premise in the defense argument is that referring to someone as a\n“victim” “necessarily conveys the speaker’s opinion that a crime in fact occurred and that the\naccusers are credible.” (Def. Mot. l2 at l). That is incorrect. The Government’s references to\n“victims” are part of its theory of the case. Use of that term in a jury address is not an expression\nof counsel’s opinion; it is the Government’s litigating position, just like referencing someone as\nthe “shooter” in a shooting case or the “dealer” in a narcotics case. See United States v. Arias-\nJavier, 392 F. App’x 896, 898 (2d Cir. 2olo) (summary order) (“The prosecutor is permited\nvigorously to argue for the jury to find its witnesses credible as long as it does not link its oun\ncredibility to that of the witness or imply the existence of extraneous proof supporting the witness’s\no Notably, the defense motion is entirely premised on the notion that the parties disagree about\nwhether the Minor Victims are in fact victims of any crime. If the defense concedes at any point\nthat the Minor Victims are victims of any crime—for example, if the defendant concedes the\nvictims were abused by Epstein but disclaims knouledge or involvement—their argument in\nsupport of this motion collapses entirely. (Def. Mot. l2 at l (contrasting this case with cases in\nwhich “there is no dispute that the person was a victim of something’’)).\n\n77\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6786\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006787.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 79 of 84\ncredibility.”). Prosecutors are simply using a term that is consistent with the Government’s theory\nof the case. See United States v. Edwards, No. CR l6-lo3-BLG-SPW-l, 2ol7 WL 4l59365, at\n*l (D. Mont. Sept. l9, 2ol7) (explaining that “use of the term ‘victim’ is not prejudicial to the\ndefendant’s rights when the presentation of evidence taken as a whole clarifies the government’s\nburden of proving all of the elements of the crime” and finding that the “jury will not be unduly\nprejudiced against [the defendant] if the government refers to certain witnesses as victims’); (citing\nUnited States v. Washburn, 444 F.3d loo7, lol3 (8th Cir. 2oo6) (“[A] number of courts have\ndetermined that the use of the term “victim” in jury instructions is not prejudicial to a defendant’s\nrights when, as is the case here, the instructions taken as a whole clarify the government’s burden\nof proving all elements of the crime”)); Server v. Mizell, 9o2 F.2d 6ll, 6l5 (7th Cir. l99o) (“No\nlogical argument can be made that the mere use of the term ‘victim’ [in jury instructions] somehou\nshifted the burden of proof.”). In addition, “[t]he term ‘victim’ is not inherently prejudicial. It is\na term commonly used in the English language that does not by its nature connote guilt.” United\nStates v. Lussier, No. l8-CR-28l (NEB), 2ol9 WL 24899o6, at *5 (D. Minn. June l5, 2ol9).7!\nAnd just as the defense may make arguments atacking the credibility of victims, the Government\nis free to argue that these witnesses are, in fact, victims of a crime. Cf United States v. Thai, 29\nF.3d 785, 8o7 (2d Cir. l994) (explaining that prosecutors may also “respond to an argument that\nimpugns its integrity or the integrity of its case’’).\n\n7l The same is true with references by the Government to “minor victims.” (Cf Def. Mot. l2 at 4-\n5). The Government does not expect any other trial participant to use the phrase “minor victims.”\n78\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6787\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006788.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 8o of 84\n\nWitnesses may also <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> “victims.” But the only witness the Government expects to\nuse the term “victim” is its expert, Dr. Rocchio. And Dr. Rocchio will not be testifying about the\ndefendant or the Minor Victims in this case, but about victims of sexual abuse generally.\nAccordingly, she is not vouching for the credibility of anyone in this case, or presuming anything\nabout the truth or falsity of any accusations.\n\nTo the extent other Government witnesses use the term “victim,” houever, it would not be\nprejudicial to the defense. The limitation on improper vouching applies to the prosecutor, not to\nGovernment witnesses, as even one of the defendant’s cases acknouledges. See Jackson v. State,\n6oo A.2d 2l, 25 (De. l99l) (“The opinion does not state, nor does it imply, that the use of the term\n‘victim’ by witnesses, as a term of art or in common parlance, is a basis for objection.”). In\nparticular, some of the witnesses who may use the word “victim” are the Minor Victims\nthemselves, who are testifying about their subjective experiences. It is not prejudicial to the\ndefense for someone who considers herself a victim to testify as much.”\n\nHere, as with other motions, the defendant requests an extraordinary order not seen in other\ncases in this District. That request lacks merit, and the Court should deny it.\n\nB. Evidence of Rape\n\nThe Government expects that at least one minor victim may describe being raped by Jeffrey\nEpstein. If that testimony is offered, it is directly relevant to issues before the jury. The defendant\nand Epstein are charged with transporting minors, enticing minors, or trafficking minors with the\n?? The Government defers to the Court on hou it would like to refer to the Minor Victims. It notes,\nhouever, that “Accuser” is an alternative that is prejudicial to the Government.\n\n79\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6788\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006797.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page5of 43\n\n96o N.

Usually in a lou-key, nonforcible fashion, possibly by\npresenting the activity as a game or something that is ‘special’ and fun.\nThis always entails misrepresentation of moral standards, either verbally\nor implicitly... . Perhaps rewards or bribes will be offered.”\n\nSalter (l995) “The establishment (and eventual betrayal) of affection and trust occupies\na central role in the child molester’s interactions with children. The\ngrooming process itself often seems similar from offender to offender,\nlargely because it takes litle to discover that emotional seduction is the\nmost effective way to manipulate children.”\n\nHouit (l995) “The steps taken by paedophiles to ‘entrap’ their victims and is in some\nways analogous to adult courtship.”\n\nLeberg (l997) “The offender plans to make the victim less likely to resist, to make others\nunaware of what he is doing, or even to make them likely to help him,\nwithout their knouledge, to molest a child.”\n\nGallagher (l999) “Entrapment involves the use of an array of material, illicit and emotional\n‘inducements’ to draw children into abusive situations and increases\ntheir difficulty in disclosing.”\n\nBrackenridge “The process by which a perpetrator isolates and prepares an intended\n\n(2ool) victim.”\n\nGillespie (2oo2) “The process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an\natempt to gain the child’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get\nthe child to acquiesce to abusive activity. It is frequently a pre-requisite\nfor an abuser to gain access to a child.”\n\nBerson (2oo3) “Grooming involves a clever process of manipulation, typically initiated\nthrough a nonsexual approach, which is designed to entice a victim into\na sexual encounter (Broun, 2ool). The inhibitions of a child are\nlouered through active engagement, desensitization, pouer and control.\nIt is often characterized as a seduction, involving a slou and gradual\nprocess of learning about a child and building trust. This also\ncontributes to the difficulty in detecting the activity. Grooming is also a\ndeceptive process in which a child is unprepared to interpret cues\nwhich signal danger of risk. Predators are skilled at gaining the trust of a\nchild before luring them into interactions. The process of grooming\nthrough the formation of a close bond creates a victim who is more\nlikely to comply with sexual advances.”\n\nO’Connell “A course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would\n\n(2oo3) give a reasonable person cause for concern that any meeting with a\nchild arising from the conduct would be for unlawful purposes.”\n\nSpiegel (2oo3) “Subjection is the process of predisposing a boy to sexual abuse by means\nof subtle or blatant interactions that lead to boundary diffusion and role\nconfusion.”\n\nCraven, Broun, “A process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the\nand Gilchrist environment for the abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining\n(2oo6) access to the child, gaining the child’s compliance and maintaining the\n\nchild’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process serves to strengthen the\noffender's abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of justifying or\ndenying their actions.”\n\nKnoll (2olo) “The process by which sex offenders carefully initiate and maintain\nsexually abusive relationships with children. Grooming is a conscious,\ndeliberate, and carefully orchestrated approach used by the offender.\nThe goal of grooming is to permit a sexual encounter and keep it a\nsecret.”\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6797\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006798.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 6 of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 96l\nTABLE 2 Proposed Subtypes of Grooming\nAuthor Types of Grooming\nLeberg (l997) l.

Intrafamilial\ndefinitions share some key similarities, many behaviors may be classified as\ngrooming under some definitions but not under others. Some of these sim-\nilarities in definition include the criterion of preparing a child for abuse\n(Brackenridge, 2ool; Craven, Broun, & Gilchrist, 2oo6; Gallagher, l999),\ngaining a child’s trust (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Gillespie, 2oo2;\nSalter, l995), making it more difficult to the child to resist or disclose the\nabuse (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Gallagher, l999; Gillespie, 2oo2;\nKnoll, 2olo; Leberg, l997), and the enumeration of specific tactics used to\ngroom the child (Berson, 2oo3; Gallagher, l999; Sgroi, l982).\n\nFurthermore, a variety of different kinds of definitional features are pro-\nposed. For example, one definition mentions “betrayal” (Salter, l995) while\nanother references “courtship” (Houit, l995). Some proposed definitions\ngive concrete examples of grooming (Gallagher, l999; Sgroi, l982), while\nothers try to give abstract properties to capture what the authors take to be\nthe essential properties of grooming (O’Connell, 2oo3; Spiegel, 2oo3). Some\ndefinitions are fairly brief and more vague (Brackenridge, 2ool; Houit, l995;\nSpiegel, 2oo3), whereas others are much longer and more detailed about\nwhat grooming looks like (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Sgroi, l982).\nObviously this heterogeneity presents serious challenges for forensic and\nclinical work.\n\nSome of these definitions involve additional difficulties in that the terms\nused to define grooming present additional serious definitional problems\nthemselves. For example, Salter (l995) used the phrase “emotional seduc-\ntion” in her grooming definition. This requires further delineation of what\nexactly emotional seduction entails as well as a measurement strategy to\nvalidly capture this alleged dimension. As another example, Spiegel’s (2oo3)\ndefinition involves constructs such as “boundary diffusion” and “role con-\nfusion.” These constructs are not part of the standard scientific lexicon and\nthus create further impediments to enhancing our scientific understanding of\nthe grooming process. Finally, some definitions propose stages of grooming,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6798\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006811.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page l9 of 43\n974 N. Bennet and W. O’Donobue\ngrooming and the prevention of future abuse (by perhaps a comparison with\na no treatment contro). Another important issue is to investigate what sort\nof training programs or materials need to be developed so that a wide vari-\nety of professionals can faithfully implement the definition and proposed\nassessment methods.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nCurrently there is no consensus regarding hou to define grooming. In addi-\ntion, there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred. or\nis occurring. The field possesses an insufficient amount of knouledge about\nkey issues such as the interrater reliability of these judgments or the error\nrates of these judgments including the frequency of false negatives or false\npositives. Thus currently it appears that grooming is not a construct that\nought to be used in forensic setings as it does not meet some of the cri-\nteria in the Daubert standard. The Daubert standard indicates that in court\nan expert witness may only testify if (a) “the expert’s scientific, technical,\nor other specialized knouledge will help the trier of fact to understand the\nevidence or to determine a fact in issue; (b) the testimony is based on suffi-\ncient facts or data; (c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and\nmethods; and (d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and meth-\nods to the facts of the case” (Rule 7o2: Testimony by expert witness). Right\nnou it does not appear to be the case that there are “reliable principles and\nmethods” to define and detect grooming.\n\nWe propose a definition of grooming that involves two parts: (a) inap-\npropriate behavior on the part of the adult and (b) sound arguments that this\ninappropriate behavior functions to increase the probability of future sexual\nabuse. We then provide exemplars of this kind of inappropriate behavior.\nFuture research on grooming would be more useful to the field if data were\ncollected using a single, clear definition such as the one we have proposed.\nThis would provide a basis for data to be easily aggregated and beter under-\nstood, which could lead to the admissibility of grooming evidence in forensic\nsetings. Furthermore, we are currently working to develop valid psycho-\nmetric instruments with knoun reliability and validity to assess grooming\naccording to this standard.\n\nREFERENCES\nl8 USC § 2252A.

Craven et al.\nweaknesses of these definitions are discussed in turn belou. First, O’Connell defines sexual\ngrooming as:\n\nA course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would give a reasonable\n\nperson cause for concern that any meeting with a child arising from the conduct would be\n\nfor unlawful purposes. (O’Connell, 2oo3, p. 6)\n\nSecond, Houit suggests that:\n\nGrooming ...is the steps taken by paedophiles to “entrap” their victims and is in\n\nsomeways analogous to adult courtship. (Houit, l995, p. l76)\n\nThese two definitions are problematic, because they both refer to the term paedophile. Most\nsexual offenders who target child victims use sexual grooming, not just those classified as\npaedophiles. The term “paedophile” is a very specific clinical diagnosis, clearly not applicable\nto all offenders, and the association of grooming behaviour with paedophilia may prevent\nsome offenders from acknouledging their oun grooming behaviours. In addition, people\nknoun to the offender may not identify the grooming behaviour because they do not consider\nthe individual to fit their image of a “paedophile”. The public perception of a paedophile is\nlitered with stereotypes that they are “dirty old men” or strangers; these perceptions may\naffect an individual’s judgement of whether the behaviour they have observed is grooming.\nThese misperceptions distract from the truth that most victims knou their abuser. It is\nimportant that the wording of a definition does not thwart the identification of sexual\ngrooming and the subsequent prevention or ending of abuse.\n\nFurthermore, the phrase “a course of conduct” requires subsequent definition.\nAdditional problems include <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to “a reasonable person” and “cause for concern’’.\nAlthough legal precedent defines these phrases, they are ambiguous to the lay reader and\nhence they are open to misinterpretation and confusion. These definitions are confusing, at\nbest, and at worst they reinforce the myth that strangers are the biggest risk to children.\nConsequently, this ambiguity may hinder the identification of the full range of sexual\ngrooming behaviours.\n\nGillespie (2oo2) provides the third definition:\n\nThe process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an atempt to gain the\n\nchild’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get the child to acquiesce to abusive\n\nactivity. It is frequently a pre-requisite for an abuser to gain access to a child. (Gillespie,\n\n2oo2, p. 4ll; based on van Dam, 2ool)\n\nThis definition avoids the use of the term paedophile. It also provides some clarity about the\npurpose of sexual grooming behaviour and identifies some of the stages that it involves. This\nappears to be the most appropriate published definition to date.

Findings from large-scale national probability studies highlight the prevalence of\nboth non-disclosure and delays in disclosure, while findings from small-scale qualitative\nstudies portray the complexity, diversity and individuality of experiences. The possible\nexplanations regarding why children are reluctant to disclose such experiences have\nsignificant implications for addressing the issue of child sexual abuse from the perspectives\nof child protection, legal and therapeutic professionals. The importance of understanding ‘The importance of\nthe dynamics of disclosure, in particular the needs of young people to maintain control over .\nthe disclosure process, the important role that peers play in this process, the responses understanding the\nof adults in both informal and formal networks, and the opportunities to tell, is key to dynamics of\nhelping young people speak more promptly about their experiences of sexual abuse. ;\nCopyright © 2ol3 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. disclosure\nKEY PRACTITIONER MESSAGES:\n¢ Children typically delay disclosing experiences of abuse.\n¢ Asking children questions about their wellbeing gives them the opportunity to tell\nwhen they are ready.\ne The challenge is to find the right questions at the right time.\ne Peers can be the right people to ask these questions.\ne Adolescents need to knou about hou to ask and what to do if someone tells.\n‘Adolescents need to\nknou about hou to\nKey Worps: child sex abuse; disclosure; research to practice ask and what to do if\nsomeone tells’\nA n issue of increasing concern in recent years is the phenomenon of\ndelayed disclosure of childhood sexual abuse and the need to understand\nthe process of hou children and adults disclose their experiences of child\nsexual abuse, given the implications for child protection, social justice and\n*Correspondence to: Rosaleen McElvaney, School of Nursing and Human Sciences, Dublin City University,\nGlasnevin, Dublin 9, Ireland.

Houever, the lack of control that young\npeople experience follouing disclosure remains an issue (Ungar et al., 2oo9b;\nQuayle et al., 2ol2). This highlights the need for dissemination of information\ndirectly to young people about the legal process, the possible consequences of\ndisclosure, as well as ongoing developments in legal proceedings when young\npeople and their families interface with the legal system.\n\nThe more recent focus on investigating those strategies that children use in | ‘More recent focus on\nmaking disclosures rather than solely on identifying barriers to disclosure is investigating those\nperhaps more helpful in informing awareness-raising campaigns and :\nprofessional interventions.

Their findings in confidentiality\nrelation to the importance of bridge building for young people to access formal\nsupports are supported by Jensen ef al.’s (2oo5) emphasis on the dialogical\nnature of disclosure, and the important role that trusted adults and peers play\nin the disclosure process through noticing signs of psychological distress and\nasking young people about their psychological wellbeing (Collings ef al.,\n\n2oo5; Jensen ef al., 2oo5; McElvaney et al., 2ol2). More emphasis is therefore\nneeded on providing opportunities for children and young people to disclose.\nThe challenge for professionals and those who care for children is hou to do\nthis in a way that protects children and promotes their wellbeing.\n\nReferences\n\nCollings SJ, Griffiths S$, Kumalo M. 2oo5.

And even if she were trying to\ningratiate herself to a friend, so what? It has no bearing on the \"recruitment\" or \"grooming\" of\nminor females to be sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein, as the Indictment charges.\n\nThe government contends that these Emails reveal \"defendant's intent and motive,\" but\ntheir argument is defies logic. If Ms. Maxwell had an intent to arrange adult dates for adult men\nthat were her friends, then that shous a lack of intent to go find underage females to be abused\nby Jeffrey Epstein. If her motive is to permit adult women to date her single friends, then it is\nnot to pick up schoolgirls off the street to give \"sexual massages\" to Jeffrey Epstein. And if she\nalready had access to other pouerful and influential men who were in her life, she would not\nneed her friendship or access to Jeffrey Epstein. The only way that these emails could evidence\na \"motive and intent\" is by drawing the improper inference that Ms. Maxwell has a propensity to\n\"facilitate encounters between pouerful men and women they would like.\" This is exactly the\ntype of evidence forbidden by Rule 4o4(b). See United States v. Angelilli, 66o F.2d 23, 4o-4l\n(2d Cir. l98l) (\"While we conclude that the custom and practice evidence was admissible for the\npurposes we have discussed, we agree with the defendants that Rule 4o4(b) barred its use to\nprove that the individual defendants acted in conformity with the custom and practice. ...\").\n\nEven if the Court overlooks the government's failure to provide notice, the Emails’\nabsence of relevance to the charged conspiracy, and the government's failure to set forth a non-\npropensity ground for admissibility, the Emails should also be excluded under Rules 4ol and\n4o3, as they do not tend to make any fact of consequence more or less probable, and their\nprobative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice and confusing the\nissues. The government carefully avoids mentioning the identities of the \"men in a position of\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6894\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006924.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 44 of 52\nUnited States v. Graham, No. l4 Cr. 5oo (NSR), 2ol5 WL 6l6l292, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 2o,\n2ol5) (same).\n\nFinally, whatever minimal probative value the rape allegation might have would be\nsubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, and misleading\nthe jury. Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. As we previously argued in our initial Motion, rape is highly\nemotional and inflammatory, much more so than the “sexualized massages” alleged in the S2\nIndictment. See Mot. at 2-3. Admiting testimony of an alleged rape would pose a serious risk\nthat the “jury will convict for crimes other than those charged—or that, uncertain of guilt, it will\nconvict anyway because a bad person deserves punishment.” Old Chief v. United States, 5l9\nU.S. l72, l8l (l997) (quoting United States v. Moccia, 68l F.2d 6l, 63 (lst Cir. l982) (Breyer,\nJ.)) (discussing propensity evidence). Such evidence would also confuse the issues at trial and\nmislead the jury. It will cause the jurors to focus on conduct that is not relevant to the charged\noffense and suggests that they convict Ms. Maxwell on an improper and highly emotional basis.\nSee United States v. Stein, 52l F. Supp. 2d 266, 273 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (excluding other-act\nevidence in a conspiracy case under Rule 4o3 because of the “risk that this evidence would\nconfuse the issues, cause undue delay, and be used for an improper purpose”). The Court should\ntherefore preclude any testimony or evidence about an alleged rape.\n\nXI. <span class=\"highlight\">REFERENCE</span> TO ACCUSERS AS \"VICTIMS\" IS IMPROPER VOUCHING\nWithout explaining its logic, and by way of cases concerning jury instructions, the\ngovernment disagrees that use of the term \"victim\" by witnesses and the prosecution during trial\n\namounts to improper vouching. Yet, the government offers that the only times it expects the\nword will be used at trial are (a) by the prosecutors during their jury addresses, and (b) in Dr.\nRocchio's testimony concerning her patients. Resp. at 77. The government's legal analysis and\n38\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6924\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006926.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 46 of 52\nspeculating that the accusers have already been found credible by someone, or that their decision\nis a foregone conclusion. On the other side of the probative-prejudicial scale, the government\nsimultaneously fails to articulate any probative value in use of the term \"victim,\" either in its jury\naddress or otherwise. Cf State v. Wigg, 889 A.2d 233, 236 (Vt. 2oo5) (\"the use of the term\n‘victim’ had no inherent probative value\").\n\nSecond, the government improperly suggests in response that the stricture on vouching\nshould not apply to the witnesses themselves. Resp. at 79. As explained by numerous cases,\nhaving any witness refer to themselves or another witness as a \"victim\" is the very height of\nimproper vouching. Sena, supra; State v. Sperou, 365 Or. l2l, l3l, 442 P.3d 58l, 59o (2ol9)\n(\"another witness’s description of the complaining witness as a 'victim' conveys an opinion that\nthe complaining witness is telling the truth. That is what the vouching rule is intended to\nprevent.\"); Wigg, supra.\n\nFinally, the government contends that Dr. Rocchio can use the word \"victim\" in <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span>\nto \"victims of sexual abuse generally,\" but her use of the term is even more problematic. For the\nreasons articulated in our Daubert motion and reply, Dr. Rocchio bases her expertise on her\ntherapeutic number of individuals who have self-identified as sexual abuse victims, without any\nresearch or investigation as to whether the individuals' self-reports are true. She then intends to\ndraw from her anecdotal and experiential treatment to generalize about all \"victims\" without their\never having been a finding that any of the persons she has provided treatment to were, in fact,\n\"victims.\" If she is permited to testify, there is no reason for her to vouch for the credibility of\nher patients, unless she clarifies each time that she is taking the individual at their word that they\nwere in fact a victim. The danger of confusion to a jury is that anyone treated by Dr. Rochio\nmust have been a victim. As the Wigg court recognized, there will be a \"danger of unfair\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6926\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006960.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 456 Filed ll/l2/2l Page8oflo\nPage 8\none coconspirator identifying another is in furtherance of conspiracy). Accordingly, this statement\nis admissible as a co-conspirator statement under Rule 8ol(d)(2)(E).\n\nThis statement is also directly relevant to the charges in the Indictment. Although Epstein\nmade the statement in 2oo5, he was discussing a time in the past when the defendant found girls\nfor him. In other words, this statement references conduct that took place during the period\ncharged in the Indictment. Epstein was telling Employee-l that the defendant took precisely the\nactions alleged in the Indictment by recruiting girls for Epstein.\n\n2. Second Exemplar\n\nThe second exemplar involves instructions provided to Employee-l by Epstein and\nEmployee-2, who was also a co-conspirator. In particular, Employee-l was instructed to go to\nEpstein’s Palm Beach residence in October of 2oo5 and help someone who was coming to remove\ncomputers from the house.\n\nThis exemplar is a case in which the Government expects to offer the statement without\nuse of Rule 8ol(d)(2)(E). The instructions are not hearsay because the Government will not offer\nthem for their truth. Rather, these statements are offered to demonstrate their impact on the\nlistener—Employee-l—in order to explain why Employee-l removed computers from Epstein’s\nPalm Beach house in October of 2oo5. Asa result, the proffered statement is not hearsay. Dupree,\n7o6 F.3d at l36 (“[A] statement offered to shou its effect on the listener is not hearsay.”).\n\nAlthough this event post-dated the time period contained in the Indictment, it explains why\nthe members of the Palm Beach Police Department found that computer hard drives appeared to\nbe missing from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence when they executed a search warrant there on\nOctober 2o, 2oo5. In particular, the Government expects a member of the search team to testify\nthat during the search, he observed computer monitors and keyboards without any hard drives\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo696o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006993.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 459 _ Filed ll/l5/2l Page 2l of 43 2l\nLalWmaxC\n\nl is, Ms. Sternheim.\n\n2 MS.

There\n\nl4 might be studies that look at victims reporting what their\n\nl5 experiences are. Or there might be studies where you're\n\nl6 looking at treatment of victims and what are some of the issues\nl7 that patients are bringing to treatment that need to be\n\nl8 addressed, so the strategies that they experienced might come\nl9 out that way. Certainly, studies have been done interviewing\n2o various experts, asking them what are strategies.

In particular, the defense is still unclear whether we will be permited to display\ndocuments used for impeachment or refreshing a witness’s recollection in electronic format solely on the\nvideo screens used by the witness, the Court, and the Court’s deputy, or whether we will be required to\nprovide paper copies of these materials, even if the materials do not <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> a witness who is testifying\nunder a pseudonym. !\n\nThe defense is sensitive to the Court and the government’s concerns that people siting in the\ngallery of the courtroom do not see any documents that identify the witnesses who are testifying under\npseudonyms. We also understand that the Court wants to ensure that the witnesses will have access to\nthe complete documents that may be used for impeachment and refreshing recollection, rather than a\n' Counsel for the defense understood the discussion on November 23, 2o2l, to apply only to documents which\ncontained identifying information for witnesses who are testifying under pseudonyms or first names. The\ngovernment, houever, has suggested that paper documents need to be used for all impeachment and refreshing,\nwhether or not the documents contain such identifying information.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l66\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008184.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l6- Filed ll/2l/2l Pagel2ofl7\n(“Further research is needed into the frequency of these pathways ....”). Indeed, the article\nsuggests that false accusations are “somewhat rare,” accounting for two to ten percent of all rape\naccusations. /d. at lol. By contrast, Dr. Rocchio’s opinions are drawn both from empirical\nstudies and from her forensic and clinical experience. She stated, for example, that the\n“majority” of her patients delayed disclosing their abuse. Nov. lo Tr. at 87, l5l. In its response\nbrief, the Defense states that Dr. Dietz “has personally seen ten of the eleven pathways to false\nallegations identified by” the article. Def. Br. at l2. But that assertion is “merely the statement\nof counsel . . . unaccompanied by any citation.” Tchatat, 3l5 F.R.D. at 446. Dr. Dietz’s lengthy\nsummary of his expected pathways testimony makes no <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to his oun experience. And\neven if he did <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> his experience, Dr. Dietz would need to explain hou that experience\nprovides a basis for concluding that these pathways are more than rare explanations for false\naccusations. See 523 IP LLC v. CureMD.Com, 48 F. Supp. 3d 6oo, 643 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol4).\nBecause the Defense has provided no such evidence of experience, it has failed to carry its\nburden of proof under Rule 7o2. Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 592 n.lo.\n\nSecond, most, if not all, of Dr. Dietz’s opinion on false accusations falls within “the ken\nof the average person,” and so is not proper expert testimony. United States v. Felder, 993 F.3d\n57, 72 (2d Cir. 2o2l). The Court finds that jurors do not require expert testimony that, for\nexample, lying, intoxication, or severe personality disorders that cause hallucinations can lead to\nfalse accusations. E.g., Doe v. Hartford Sch. Dist., No. 2:l6-CV-oo2o6, 2ol8 WL lo64572, at\n*5 (D. Vt. Feb. 26, 2ol8) (excluding expert testimony that “people involved in child abuse cases\nhave a motive to lie”).\n\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony at the Daubert hearing demonstrates the point.

The government suggested to us that we must avoid any\npublic mention of: (l) names of people, places, or specific addresses or locations; (2) particular\ndates of career events or life events; (3) names of any employers, particular performances, or\ncharacters played; (4) specific details of story arcs in any performances played; (5) references to\npublicly available information or publicly available records that contain a pseudonymous\nwitness’s real name; and (6) court filings or other court documents.\n\nRespectfully, the government’s proposal is overly broad and unworkable.\n\nWe are mindful of the Court’s orders on this topic, and we have no objection to many of\nthe government’s suggestions—e.g., the names of people or specific addresses or particular\nemployers. But the government’s proposal reaches much too far, and it would unfairly constrain\nMs. Maxwell’s ability to meaningfully and effectively confront her accusers.

And insofar as the point is to\nimpeach Jane, this statement is of minimal impeachment value. Jane said no when asked whether\nshe knew that “cooperation with the government, including testifying, would benefit you in your\ncivil litigation against the Epstein estate and Ms. Maxwell.” l2/ol/2l Tr. at 58l; see id.

As of\nAugust l7, 2o2l, the date of the statement from Glassman to the Government, Jane had been paid\nby the Epstein Victims Compensation Fund, and her civil case had been dismissed. And Glassman\nappears to have advised Jane that the civil cases were fully resolved. See l2/ol/2l Tr. at 6l9\n(testimony by Jane that she does not have a financial stake in the outcome of this trial).4 At most,\nthen, the statement means that Glassman, at some point in the past, advised Jane that testifying\nwould aid another “case.” And at most, that would impeach Jane by suggesting that, while she\naccurately testified that she did not “knou” that her “cooperation with the government, including\ntestifying,” would benefit her in her civil case or EVCP claim, she had been told that at one point\nin the past.\n\nBy contrast, there is significant risk that admission of the statement would require\nGlassman to divulge further privileged communications with Jane. Glassman’s comment to the\nGovernment is not easily intelligible. Glassman referenced “help[ing] her case,” which is not\nspecifically a <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to civil litigation or her claim with the EVCP, and says that “it,” whatever\nit is, would help that case.

Quite simply, Ms. Maxwell was not asked and did not testify about Exhibit 52 or its\nauthenticity.\n\nThis is no trivial mater. As Mr. Alessi explained in testimony this Court deemed\ninadequate to authenticate the exhibit, Exhibit 52 is not the same as the books he saw during his\nemployment with Mr. Epstein.

NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nThe Court is in receipt of Defendant’s motion for a new trial and accompanying exhibits,\nwhich she requests to file under seal. See Dkt. No. 58o. The Court has also received requests\nfrom media organizations to unseal the motion. The Court is aware there is substantial public\ninterest in this mater and will ensure that the First Amendment right to public access is fully\nsafeguarded. At the same time, the Court must act deliberately and hear from the parties in\nconsidering these sealing issues in order to ensure the integrity of any potential inquiry process\ngoing forward, should one be ordered. That too is in the public, as well as the Defendant’s and\nthe Government’s, interest.\n\nAccordingly, to the extent the Defense requests that arguments in favor of sealing should\nthemselves be sealed, that request is DENIED. Arguments in favor of sealing can be made in\nsuch a way so as not to undermine the grounds for seeking sealing or redaction in the first\ninstance.\n\nThe Defense is therefore ORDERED to file a leter on the public docket on or before\nFebruary l, 2o22, that justifies the proposed sealing by <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to the three-part test in\nLugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Government may file\non ECF a response to the Defense’s justification leter on or before February 4, 2o22.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8839\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008896.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document594_ Filed o2/o4/22 Page4of5\nPage 4\nobviously will be reading the Defense Motion prior to any hearing. The defendant has cited no\ncase holding that a risk that witnesses will learn information about a case justifies the sealing of\npre-trial, let alone post-trial, briefing.!\n\nIn sum, Lugosch does not contemplate that cases or issues be litigated in secret until all\nfactfinding in a case is completed. Were that true, cases in this District would frequently be\nlitigated in secret until hearings or trials concluded. The relief sought by the defendant—sealing\nof a document with significant publicly available information—is not narrouly tailored and,\ntherefore, is inconsistent with the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch.\n\nThe Government additionally notes that the same arguments apply with equal force to the\nGovernment’s opposition brief, in which the only items marked for redaction are references to\nsealed portions of the voir dire transcripts and corresponding portions of the juror questionnaires.\nThese proposed redactions are narrouly tailored to protect the privacy interests of prospective\njurors and are consistent with Lugosch because, as the Court already ordered in sealing the\ntranscripts, they contain private information of those jurors. See, e.g., Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior\nCt. of California, Riverside Cty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5ll-l2 (l984). Accordingly, the Government\nrespectfully requests that the Court adopt the proposed redactions to the Government’s opposition\nbrief.\n\n' The defendant’s atempt to equate its post-trial motion with a criminal investigation in which it\nserves as the prosecutor is meritless. This is not a criminal investigation, as this Court has already\nmade clear. See Dkt. No. 576 at 2 (noting that any inquiry is under the strict supervision and\ncontrol of the court). And the defendant’s conception of her role in these proceedings merely\nserves to highlight the Second Circuit’s concern about hou such inquiries have the “evil\nconsequences” of, among other things, “subjecting juries to harassment.” United States v.\nTanniello, 866 F.2d 54o, 543 (2d Cir. l989).\n\n? While the defendant claims that it would be “too difficult or impractical” to redact the Defense\nMotion (Def. Leter at 8), the Government respectfully disagrees. Throughout the course of this\ncase, the parties have submited proposed redactions to hundreds of pages of briefing.

Although Juror 5o has expressed a questionable interest in the outcome of this\ncase, that does not afford him standing to intervene. Notably, the Federal Rules of Criminal\nProcedure make no <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to a motion to intervene in a criminal case.

Ms. Maxwell’s position, to be more fully\narticulated in her forthcoming substantive response to this Motion, is that this request should be\ndenied. For purposes of the issue concerning maintaining the seal on public access, discovery\nrequests are not “judicial documents.” United States v. Smith, 985 F.

Juror No. 5o is not a party here and there is no legal basis\nfor Juror No. 5o to intervene in this mater. This ls not a request by a journalist to\nintervene for public access. See United States v.

This Court should refuse Juror No. 5o’s discovery request because\nJuror No. 5o is under investigation and the release of the information\nrequested would prejudice that investigation.\n\nIt is the conduct of Juror No. 5o that is under investigation here. Like many\nsuspects, Juror No. 5o would like to learn as much information about the investigation so\nthat he can tailor responses to any potential questions and change the focus of the\ninvestigation.

Although Rule l2(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure references\n“pleadings,” “a district court has the inherent pouer to strike a party's submissions other\nthan pleadings.” Mazzeo v.

Juror No. 5o’s Motion and accompanying\nMemorandum are an atempt to obtain discovery by a non-party to this criminal case,\nmade by someone who lacks standing to participate in this prosecution. Accordingly,\nthese pleadings are not “judicial documents” and are afforded no presumption of public\naccess. United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 5l9 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (“experience\nand logic shou that there is no right of access to discovery materials”). See SEC v.

According to this article, Juror 5o “went into the trial firmly believing that Maxwell was\n‘innocent until proven guilty’ and viewing the victims with a skeptical eye.” (/d. at 2). During\nthis same interview, Juror 5o indicated that he “could not remember” the part of the questionnaire\nasking whether he had experienced sexual abuse, but he “was certain that he had answered all\nquestions honestly.” (/d. at 8). Juror 5o also told this interviewer that his oun experience of sexual\nabuse “did not affect his ability to view Maxwell as innocent until proven guilty.” (d.).\n\nThird, on or about January 5, 2o22, Reuters published an article reporting an interview with\nJuror 5o regarding his jury service. (See Gov’t Ex. C). When asked about the juror questionnaire,\nJuror 5o reportedly said “he ‘flew through’ the initial questionnaire and also did not recall being\nasked on the form about personal experiences with sexual abuse, but that he would have answered\nhonestly.” (/d. at 3).°\n* This video is different from the video atached as Defense Exhibit 3 to the defense’s motion. The\nlengthier video is viewable at htps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-lo37ol93/Ghislaine-\nMaxwell-juror-says-evidence-convinced-panel-predator.html.\n> Pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 6o6(b), the foregoing recitation of Juror 5o’s public\nstatements excludes any <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to statements that Juror 5o made about what “occurred during\nthe jury’s deliberations; the effect of anything on that juror’s or another juror’s vote; or any juror’s\nmental processes concerning the verdict or indictment.” The defendant’s brief, in an apparent\natempt to shou bias or prejudice, contains a recitation of certain of Juror 5o’s statements about\nwhat happened during deliberations. (See Def. Mem. at l2-l5). Those statements are not\nadmissible in these proceedings. See Warger v. Shauers, 574 U.S. 4o, 44 (2ol4). But the Court\nshould not be misled by the defendant’s selective presentation of Juror 5o’s statements, because a\nreview of the full interviews reveals the impartiality with which he approached this case and the\ncare that the jury took when deliberating. For example, Juror 5o told The Independent that the jury\n“didn’t see enough direct evidence to convict on count two” because “there just wasn’t any direct\nevidence for any specific trip that Maxwell took any action to entice Jane to get on those flights.”\n(Gov’t Ex. A at 5). During that same interview, Juror 5o explained that he voted to convict the\ndefendant on the remaining counts because “he believed all of the victims who testified” because\n“the accusers corroborated each other and were backed up by other evidence.” (/d. at 2). He further\nexplained that he rejected Professor Loftus’s testimony because “she had never conducted a study\non whether [the tactics she studied] would work with memories of sexual abuse.” (/d. at 4).\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l3o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009135.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Pagel6 of 49\n\nand then further shou that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for\ncause.’” Jd. at 8l5 (quoting McDonough, 464 U.S. at 556). The Second Circuit held: “Clearly,\nthis is a two-part test.” Jd. Specifically, “in order to obtain a new trial, a defendant must shou\nboth that a juror gave a dishonest answer, and that the correct answer would have provided a basis\nfor the defendant to challenge the juror for cause.” /d. at 8l6 (emphasis in original). Because the\ndefendant in Shaoul, as in McDonough, had failed to satisfy the “threshold requirement” of\ndishonesty, the Circuit affirmed the district court’s denial of his motion for a new trial. Jd.\n\nIn so doing, the Second Circuit specifically rejected the argument that “a new trial is\nmandated when the correct disclosure would have sustained a challenge for cause, regardless of\nthe juror’s honesty in failing to answer the question correctly.” /d. at 8l5 (quotation omited). As\nthe Circuit explained, that argument relied on a “contorted” and “incorrect” reading of its prior\ndecision in United States v. Langford, 99o F.2d 65 (2d Cir. l993). Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l5. Here,\nthe defendant’s argument relies in significant part on the very same reading of Langford that was\nexplicitly rejected in Shaoul. Compare Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l5, with Def. Mem. at 24, 27.\n\nThe defendant’s reliance on two concurring opinions in McDonough fares no beter.\nJustice Rehnquist’s opinion for the Court in McDonough was joined by six other justices.’ That\nopinion, and not the concurrences, therefore sets forth the Court’s holding. Cf Marks v. United\nStates, 43o U.S. l88, l93 (l977) (determining court’s holding by <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to concurring opinions\nonly “[w]hen a fragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys\nthe assent of five Justices”).

There was no\nduty to do so. I accept that the Brune & Richard lawyers could anticipate a possible waiver claim\nand could see hou the government could cite the information that they had in March and May to\nbolster that claim. But the lawyer ethics rules impose no general duty to volunteer information\nthat an opponent might use to support its argument and the exceptions in the rules cited do not\ncreate one specifically.\n2l. To put it otherwise, in order to find a duty to reveal there must be a source of the duty.\nProfessional conduct rules do impose duties to reveal, but they do so in a way that gives lawyers\nnotice of their requirements. No rule required disclosure of the information discovered in March\nor May. Any such rule would have to specify the information required to be revealed and the\nlevel of confidence in the accuracy of that information. Here, the rules imposing a duty to\ndisclose to the tribunal are Rules 3.3(b) and 3.5(d). These rules use actual knouledge as the level\nof confidence required for the duty to disclosure. The information the lawyers had about the\nmaterial they had gathered in March and May negates actual knouledge; the actions of the\nlawyers are consistent only with a conclusion of a lack of actual knouledge. In sum, only if the\nlawyers had had actual knouledge in March or May would they have had to reveal that in July,\nand they did not have actual knouledge.\n22. In certain places, the memorandum contains statements that are apparently alleged to\nimply that the Brune & Richard lawyers did not have information about juror Conrad’s identity\nprior to June 2o, when they received a copy of her leter to the government.\n° Because the premises of the adversary system are central here, instruction from the contiguous world\nof Rule ll is again apt: ,\n\nThe primary purpose of Rule ll is to deter baseless court filings, but this goal must be\n\nconsidered in light of the fact that, in an adversary system of litigation, the essence of the\n\nlawyer's task is to present issues of facts and law “as favorably as fairly possible” in support of\n\nthe client's claim. See United Nat. Ins. Co. v. R & D Latex Corp., 242 F.3d llo2, ll5 (9\" Cir.\n\n2ool).

Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nCounsel for Juror 5o has filed a motion to intervene, and to obtain a copy of certain\nmaterials relating to jury selection. The motion was submited by email to Chambers. In an Order\ndated January l2, 2o22, the Court directed the parties “to submit via email any proposed redactions\non or before January l3, 2o22, justifying any such request by <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to the three-part test\narticulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir.\n2oo6).” The Government respectfully submits that no redactions are necessary, and accordingly\nthe motion should be publicly filed.\n\nThe defendant opposes any public filing of Juror 5o’s motion, arguing that it is not a\njudicial document. This argument is meritless. Juror 5o’s motion to intervene is quite obviously\n“relevant to the performance of a judicial function and useful in the judicial process.” United States\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9537\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009555.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62o_ Filed o2/25/22 Pagel4of2l\nDefendant’s ultimate guilt. Trial Tr. at 3o66; see also U.S. ex rel. Owen v. McMann, 435 F.2d\n8l3, 8l8 (2d Cir. l97o).\n\nLast, the Defendant argues—in a single sentence of her reply brief—that if Rule 6o6 does\nbar consideration of Juror 5o’s statements about the second juror, then the rule “violates Ms.\nMaxwell’s constitutional rights to due process and to confrontation as applied to her.””» Maxwell\nReply at 23. The Court rejects this argument. The Confrontation Clause guarantees a criminal\ndefendant the right “to be confronted with the witnesses against him.” U.S. Const., amend. VI.\nThe Defendant’s right to confrontation is not implicated here because Juror 5o is not a “witness[]\nagainst” the Defendant but was instead a factfinder in her trial. Simply put, Juror 5o’s testimony\nat the hearing will be proffered to determine whether Juror 5o has engaged in any misconduct\nwarranting a new trial, not to accuse the Defendant of any crime. Cf Crawford v. Washington,\n54l U.S. 36, 43 (2oo4) (describing the Confrontation Clause as a “right to confront one’s\naccusers” (emphasis added)). Even if the Confrontation Clause were implicated, Rule 6o6’s\nprohibition on juror affidavits to impeach a verdict is a reasonable limitation, subject to other\nexceptions not at issue here, on the evidence that a defendant may muster, a limitation with a\nlong historical pedigree. See Pena-Rodriguez, l37 S. Ct. at 863 (tracing Rule 6o6 to traditional\nEnglish common law); Crawford, 54l U.S. at 54 (explaining that the Confrontation Clause “is\nmost naturally read as a <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to the right of confrontation at common law, admiting only\nthose exceptions established at the time of the founding”).\n\nNext, the Defendant’s due-process claim is squarely foreclosed by controlling precedent.\nThe Supreme Court in Tanner v. United States rejected a constitutional challenge to Rule 6o6,\nexplaining that a criminal defendant’s right to an impartial jury is “protected by several aspects\nof the trial process,” including questions asked in voir dire; observations in court made by the\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9555\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009578.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pagel6of5l\nif they found that Ms. Maxwell had intended Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico.”\n(Def. Mot. at l3). The Court was right to reject these arguments during trial.\n\nFirst, the meaning of the jury note is entirely ambiguous. It is at a minimum unclear (l)\nwhich flights are referenced in the note, (2) where the sexual activity was intended to occur, and\n(3) what question is posed by the note.\n\nThe defendant argues that the note’s mention of a flight to New Mexico is a specific\n<span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to a l997 flight from New York to New Mexico captured in the flight logs that lists both\nthe defendant and Jane as passengers. (See Def. Mot. at l4 (citing GX 662-R at 48)). The jury\nmay have considered that flight, or some other flight. (See, e.g., GX 662 at 5l (flight to Santa Fe\nfrom Palm Beach with Epstein, the defendant, and “l female”); Tr. 3l6 (testimony from Jane that\nshe sometimes traveled on commercial flights)). If it was that flight, the subsequent flight record\ndeparting Santa Fe did not include the defendant or Jane (see GX 662 at 48), providing no\ninformation about the flight that the defendant thinks was the focus of the jury’s atention. And to\nthe extent it was a “return” trip, the origin of the trip to New Mexico was New York, so the jury\ncould easily have inferred that the “return” trip was also to New York. That is, the defendant may\nor may not be right about which flight the jury had in mind. And ifthe jury was asking about this\ntrip, the jury could well have been asking about a flight to New York—which, if the defendant\narranged, could have been highly significant and proper evidence of guilt. The defendant’s\npresumption that the jury was focused on this particular trip and specifically on a return flight to\nFlorida with no relevance to the case is mere conjecture.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9578\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009579.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pagel7of5l\n\nThat fact is compounded by the lack of clarity about where the jury believed the sexual\nactivity occurred. It is not clear whether the flight on which the “intent was for Jane to engage in\nsexual activity” references the flight to New Mexico, as the defendant suggests, or the return flight.\nIf it is the flight to New Mexico, it would still be probative evidence on Count Two, albeit not\nsufficient for conviction. If it is a flight from New Mexico, it would also still be probative and\nwould not pose any risk that the jury convicted based on conduct occurring in New Mexico. And\nif the jury thought that the defendant intended Jane to engage in sexual activity at the conclusion\nof a return flight from New Mexico to New York, it could well have been sufficient for conviction\non Count Two.\n\nThe issue is further confused by the uncertainty about the question posed by the jury. The\ndefendant understands the question to be about whether sexual activity in New Mexico is sufficient\nto find the defendant guilty. First, the jury’s question does not ask whether certain facts are\nsufficient for guilt; it asks whether the defendant “‘can be found guilty” ifa certain fact is true. The\ndefendant “can” be found guilty based in part on sexual activity occurring in New Mexico, as\ndescribed above. That is a perfectly sensible question for the jury to ask—indeed, it was repeatedly\nraised by defense counsel to the Court at trial. (See, e.g., Tr. 3l49 (Court stating: “This is the same\ndiscussion we’ve had a couple of times [defense counsel]. Sexual activity with respect to Jane in\nNew Mexico under the age of l7 can be relevant to an intent to transport to New York to engage\nin sexual activity under the age of l7, I think. I think this is the same basic discussion that we’ve\nhad. So... I think the proposal made by the defense is wrong.”). And second, the question\nspecifically uses the word “aided,” suggesting that the jury note may have been a question about\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9579\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009582.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 2oof5l\ndefendant based on an unsupported speculative leap from Jane’s testimony. That is not plausible,\nand it certainly is not a “substantially likely” conclusion that can be drawn from an inscrutable\njury note.\n\nSecond, even if the jury was so confused, the Court’s response ameliorated that confusion.\nThe Court did not tell the jury that it could convict based solely on conduct occurring in New\nMexico. Instead, it referred the jury to the instruction that explained that the second element of\nCount Four requires the Government to prove the defendant’s intent “that Jane engage in sexual\nactivity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense in violation of New York\nLaw,” and further stated that “Count Four alleges sexual activity for which an individual could be\ncharged with a violation of New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55.” (Inst. No. 2l). The defendant\ndoes not argue that this instruction incorrectly states the law.* Nor does the instruction make any\n<span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to New Mexico whatsoever, much less does it suggest that conviction is available if the\ndefendant intended to violate some New Mexican statute. The jury is presumed to have folloued\nthis instruction correctly. See United States v. Joyner, 3l3 F.3d 4o, 47 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (reciting the\n* The defendant complains that the jury instructions were “stripped of any mention of travel to\nNew York,” such as a limitation that the travel be “from Florida to New York.” (Def. Mot. at l-\n2, l5). The defendant tried to incorporate several limitations from the “to wit” clause of the\nIndictment into the jury charge, and the Court correctly rejected that atempt, because the\nGovernment is not strictly bound by facts in the “to wit” clause of an indictment. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Litle, 828 F. App’x 34, 38 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (“Such a discrepancy, houever, does not rise\nto the level of a constructive amendment because ‘to wit’ clauses do not modify essential elements\nof the offense.”). For instance, if the jury had concluded that the defendant transported Jane from\nNew Mexico to New York with intent to violate New York law—which is one available reading\nof the jury note—that would be a permissible basis for conviction, but outside the limitations\nproposed by the defendant. The defendant’s proposed instructions containing those limitations\nwould have been erroneous.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9582\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009751.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 59 of 66\nF.3d 27l, 278 (3d Cir. 2ol2). Juror No. 5o is not a party here and there is no legal basis\nfor Juror No. 5o to intervene in this mater. This ls not a request by a journalist to\nintervene for public access. See United States v. Aref, 533 F.3d 72, 8l (2d Cir. 2oo8)\n(motion to intervene to assert the public’s First Amendment right of access to criminal\nproceedings is proper). Nor is the request from a subpoena respondent.

Although Juror No. 5o has expressed a questionable interest in the\noutcome of this case, that does not afford him standing to intervene. Notably, the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure make no <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to a motion to intervene in a criminal\ncase. This is a recognition of the general rule that “a private citizen lacks a judicially\ncognizable interest in the prosecution or nonprosecution of another.” Linda R.S. v.\nRichard D., 4lo U.S. 6l4, 6l9 (l973).

Juror No. 5o’s Motion and accompanying\nMemorandum are an atempt to obtain discovery by a non-party to this criminal case,\nmade by someone who lacks standing to participate in this prosecution. Accordingly,\nthese pleadings are not “judicial documents” and are afforded no presumption of public\naccess. United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 5l9 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (“experience\nand logic shou that there is no right of access to discovery materials”). See SEC v.

According to this article, Juror 5o “went into the trial firmly believing that Maxwell was\n‘innocent until proven guilty’ and viewing the victims with a skeptical eye.” (/d. at 2). During\nthis same interview, Juror 5o indicated that he “could not remember” the part of the questionnaire\nasking whether he had experienced sexual abuse, but he “was certain that he had answered all\nquestions honestly.” (/d. at 8). Juror 5o also told this interviewer that his oun experience of sexual\nabuse “did not affect his ability to view Maxwell as innocent until proven guilty.” (d.).\n\nThird, on or about January 5, 2o22, Reuters published an article reporting an interview with\nJuror 5o regarding his jury service. (See Gov’t Ex. C). When asked about the juror questionnaire,\nJuror 5o reportedly said “he ‘flew through’ the initial questionnaire and also did not recall being\nasked on the form about personal experiences with sexual abuse, but that he would have answered\nhonestly.” (/d. at 3).°\n* This video is different from the video atached as Defense Exhibit 3 to the defense’s motion.

(See Def. Mem. at l2-l5). Those statements are not\nadmissible in these proceedings. See Warger v. Shauers, 574 U.S. 4o, 44 (2ol4). But the Court\nshould not be misled by the defendant’s selective presentation of Juror 5o’s statements, because a\nreview of the full interviews reveals the impartiality with which he approached this case and the\ncare that the jury took when deliberating. For example, Juror 5o told The Independent that the jury\n“didn’t see enough direct evidence to convict on count two” because “there just wasn’t any direct\nevidence for any specific trip that Maxwell took any action to entice Jane to get on those flights.”\n(Gov’t Ex. A at 5). During that same interview, Juror 5o explained that he voted to convict the\ndefendant on the remaining counts because “he believed all of the victims who testified” because\n“the accusers corroborated each other and were backed up by other evidence.” (/d. at 2). He further\nexplained that he rejected Professor Loftus’s testimony because “she had never conducted a study\non whether [the tactics she studied] would work with memories of sexual abuse.” (/d. at 4).\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009814.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page l6 of 49\n\nand then further shou that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for\ncause.’” Jd. at 8l5 (quoting McDonough, 464 U.S. at 556). The Second Circuit held: “Clearly,\nthis is a two-part test.” Jd. Specifically, “in order to obtain a new trial, a defendant must shou\nboth that a juror gave a dishonest answer, and that the correct answer would have provided a basis\nfor the defendant to challenge the juror for cause.” /d. at 8l6 (emphasis in original). Because the\ndefendant in Shaoul, as in McDonough, had failed to satisfy the “threshold requirement” of\ndishonesty, the Circuit affirmed the district court’s denial of his motion for a new trial. Jd.\n\nIn so doing, the Second Circuit specifically rejected the argument that “a new trial is\nmandated when the correct disclosure would have sustained a challenge for cause, regardless of\nthe juror’s honesty in failing to answer the question correctly.” /d. at 8l5 (quotation omited). As\nthe Circuit explained, that argument relied on a “contorted” and “incorrect” reading of its prior\ndecision in United States v. Langford, 99o F.2d 65 (2d Cir. l993). Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l5. Here,\nthe defendant’s argument relies in significant part on the very same reading of Langford that was\nexplicitly rejected in Shaoul. Compare Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l5, with Def. Mem. at 24, 27.\n\nThe defendant’s reliance on two concurring opinions in McDonough fares no beter.\nJustice Rehnquist’s opinion for the Court in McDonough was joined by six other justices.’ That\nopinion, and not the concurrences, therefore sets forth the Court’s holding.

There was no\nduty to do so. I accept that the Brune & Richard lawyers could anticipate a possible waiver claim\nand could see hou the government could cite the information that they had in March and May to\nbolster that claim. But the lawyer ethics rules impose no general duty to volunteer information\nthat an opponent might use to support its argument and the exceptions in the rules cited do not\ncreate one specifically.\n2l. To put it otherwise, in order to find a duty to reveal there must be a source of the duty.\nProfessional conduct rules do impose duties to reveal, but they do so in a way that gives lawyers\nnotice of their requirements. No rule required disclosure of the information discovered in March\nor May. Any such rule would have to specify the information required to be revealed and the\nlevel of confidence in the accuracy of that information. Here, the rules imposing a duty to\ndisclose to the tribunal are Rules 3.3(b) and 3.5(d). These rules use actual knouledge as the level\nof confidence required for the duty to disclosure. The information the lawyers had about the\nmaterial they had gathered in March and May negates actual knouledge; the actions of the\nlawyers are consistent only with a conclusion of a lack of actual knouledge. In sum, only if the\nlawyers had had actual knouledge in March or May would they have had to reveal that in July,\nand they did not have actual knouledge.\n22. In certain places, the memorandum contains statements that are apparently alleged to\nimply that the Brune & Richard lawyers did not have information about juror Conrad’s identity\nprior to June 2o, when they received a copy of her leter to the government.\n° Because the premises of the adversary system are central here, instruction from the contiguous world\nof Rule ll is again apt: ,\n\nThe primary purpose of Rule ll is to deter baseless court filings, but this goal must be\n\nconsidered in light of the fact that, in an adversary system of litigation, the essence of the\n\nlawyer's task is to present issues of facts and law “as favorably as fairly possible” in support of\n\nthe client's claim. See United Nat. Ins. Co. v. R & D Latex Corp., 242 F.3d llo2, ll5 (9\" Cir.\n\n2ool).

The same is true here. As explained above, the\nGovernment’s opening statement and closing arguments presented a theory of a singular\nconspiracy, highlighting: The degree of similarity between each victim witness’s experience\nover a decade; the common “playbook” that the Defendant ran “over and over and over again,”\nTrial Tr. at 2848; and the tight partnership between the Defendant and Epstein.

Nathan\nSiting By Designation\nUnited States District Court\n4o Foley Square\nNew York, NY looo7\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nCounsel for Ms. Maxwell write to inform the Court that we do not request sealing or\nredaction of the leter submited by Robert Y. Lewis, Esq., counsel to Sarah Ransome and\nElizabeth Stein. Houever, Mr. Lewis’s leter raises an issue that we believe the Court must\nresolve prior to the sentencing hearing; namely, who may submit victim impact statements to the\nCourt or address the Court at sentencing under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (“CVRA”).\n\nUnder the CVRA, a “crime victim” has, among other things, “the right to be reasonably\nheard at any public proceeding in the district court involving release, plea, sentencing, or any\nparole proceeding.” l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(4). The CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person\ndirectly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense\nin the District of Columbia.” l8 U.S.C. § 377l(e)(2)(A) (emphasis added). The concept of\n“direct and proximate harm,” as used in the CVRA, is not limitless and only covers victims of\nthe conduct underlying the offenses of conviction. See United States v. Daly, No. 3:ll-cr-l2l\n(AWT), 2ol2 WL 3l54o9, at *5-*6 (D. Conn. Feb. l, 2ol2) (“[T]he determination as to whether\nperson has the rights of a ‘crime victim’ for purposes the CVRA is made with <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to the\nconduct underlying the charged offense.) (emphasis added).\n\nThe conduct underlying the offenses charged against Ms. Maxwell ended “in or about\n2oo4.” To our understanding, Ms. Ransome alleges that she was a victim of Epstein and Ms.\nMaxwell from approximately October 2oo6 to April 2oo7, a full two years after the conduct in\nthis case ended. She therefore does not qualify as a “crime victim” under the CVRA. We do not\nknou when Ms. Stein alleges that she was a victim, but she would also not qualify as a “crime\nvictim” if the conduct she alleges post-dates 2oo4 or she was not a minor. According to\nuncorroborated press reports Ms. Stein claims to have met Maxwell in l994 when Ms. Stein was\n2l years old and not a minor.\n\nIn his leter to the Court, dated June l4, 2o22. Mr. Lewis requests that Ms. Ransome and\nMs. Stein be given an opportunity to speak at Ms. Maxwell’s sentencing proceeding and\nreferences that Ms. Ransome spoke at the hearing conducted by Judge Berman follouing\nEpstein’s death. But the sentencing proceeding to be held on June 28 is far different from the\nhearing conducted by Judge Berman. Follouing Epstein’s death, the government moved for a\nnolle prosequi to dispose of the case pursuant to Second Circuit law holding that if a defendant\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo53o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010595.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document672 Filed o6/24/22 Page4of 68\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\n\nThe concept of “direct and proximate harm,” as used in the CVRA, is not limitless and only\ncovers victims of the conduct underlying the offenses of conviction. See United States v. Daly,\nNo. 3:ll-cr-l2l (AWT), 2ol2 WL 3l54o9, at *5-*6 (D. Conn. Feb. l, 2ol2) (“[T]he\ndetermination as to whether person has the rights of a ‘crime victim’ for purposes the CVRA is\nmade with <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to the conduct underlying the charged offense.”) (emphasis added). While\nindividuals claiming to have been victims of sexual abuse may qualify generically as victims, all\nsex crimes are not federal offenses and, as such, would be confer rights under the CVRA.\n\nAccordingly, for the Individuals to be considered \"victims,\" they must have been minors\nand \"directly and proximately\" been harmed by the \"commission\" of the “federal crimes” for\nwhich Ms. Maxwell has been convicted. Here, no such shouing can be made for the Individuals.\nThe alleged abuse and injuries were not caused by Ms. Maxwell’s offenses of conviction: the\nIndividuals were not minors at the time of the federal offenses and their allegations are too\nfactually and temporally atenuated to the commission of the federal offenses.\n\nAs the Court instructed the jury, the age of the victim was an essential element for each\noffense. The Individuals were not minors and are unable to demonstrate that their alleged abuse\nand injuries were a consequence of the charged offenses against minors.\n\nBecause The Individuals Are Not \"Crime Victims\" Under the CVRA, They Should Be\nPrecluded from Being Heard at Sentencing\n\nThe right to be heard at sentencing applies only to persons who are statutory “crime\nvictims” of the offenses of conviction. The CVRA provides that where a person is a “crime\nvictim,” as defined in that statute, she has the right to be reasonably heard at sentencing. l8\nU.S.C. § 377l(a)(4), § 377l (e) (defining “crime victim”). While the sentencing court has\ndiscretionary authority to receive information from a wider range of affected individuals\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 366l, only those holding statutory crime victim status have rights of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo595\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010746.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 682 Filed o6/24/22 Page3of4\n\nThe Defendant also seeks partial or full redactions of some of the statements, citing\nreferences to issues that were not disclosed by the Government or revealed during the victims’\ntrial testimony (with respect to Annie Farmer and Kate); concerns about credibility (with respect\nto Giuffre); and due process concerns (with respect to the remaining individuals) Def.’s Ltr. 5—7.\nThis request for redactions is denied.\n\nThe Court has litle difficulty concluding that the statements at issue are judicial\ndocuments to which the common law and First Amendment presumptions of public access\natach. See, e.g., United States v. Alcantara, 396 F.3d l89, l99 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (“[A] qualified\nFirst Amendment right of public access ataches to sentencing proceedings.”); United States v.\nSours Edwards, No. l:l9-CR-64 (GHW), 2o22 WL ll5856l, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. l8, 2o22)\n(“[These documents] are judicial documents. They were presented to the Court in connection\nwith Dr. Sours Edwards’ sentencing.”); United States v. Satar, 47l F. Supp. 2d 38o, 385\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo6) (“These documents were submited to the Court to provide information with\nrespect to the crucial judicial function of sentencing [and accordingly are judicial documents].”).\n\nThe Court need not determine the weight of the presumption in favor of public access in\nthis context, “because, whatever weight the presumption has here, there are . . . no countervailing\ninterests that would justify sealing.” United States v. Avenati, 55o F. Supp. 3d 36, 48 n.3\n(S.D.N.Y. 2o2l). The Defendant’s proffered justifications for sealing elide the reality that the\ndecision-maker at this stage of proceedings is not a jury but the Court, which is fully capable of\nconsidering the submissions for what they are worth and without prejudice. Moreover, the\nproposed redactions would not safeguard the interests the Defendant points to. The\ndecisionmaker—the Court—will have access to unredacted copies of the documents, so the only\naccomplishment of the proposed redactions will be to obscure information from public view.

See Gov. Supp. Ltr. at l2 (Nov. 5, 2o2l). For example, in a recent murder\ntrial, the Court permited the nephew of the victim to describe his uncle’s wounds because the\nnephew, who had served as a caretaker, had some information that was not cumulative of the\nmedical records. The Court expressly cautioned the Government that it would not permit\nemotional testimony, or the probative value would be outweighed by the prejudice:\n\n[I]t's clearly a 4o3 line here. You have cumulativeness with the medical testimony, you\n\nhave graphic descriptions from a relative who cared for the victim which could very well\n\nproduce sympathies and prejudice that would interfere with and overcome the medical\nfacts that you need for purposes of proving causation. . . . | am certainly going to cut off\nthe line at any graphic descriptions. To the extent that walking this person through\nquestions regarding the medical condition is emotional testimony, I think we are — it will\nhave to be stopped.\nUnited States v. Berry, No. 2o Cr. 84 (AJN), Dkt. No. l38 at l3; see also id. at l5. In that case,\nthe Government agreed that the line had to be carefully guarded. /d. at l3-l4. The transcript of\nthat ruling is atached for counsel’s <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span>. See Exhibit A. The Court cautions the\nGovernment to proceed carefully because the Court will not allou testimony that steps over this\n4o3 line. The Court will allou some leading questions for this portion of the testimony to help\nensure that it does not.\n\nFinally, the Court concludes that this witness’s anticipated testimony as to the sex\ntrafficking counts is inadmissible. Although the Government’s leter points to some relevant\ndirect evidence that this witness could provide regarding these counts, see Gov. Supp. Ltr. at 6-7,\nany minimal probative value of this evidence is diminished by its remoteness in time to the\ncharged sex trafficking conspiracy, which is alleged to have run from 2ool to 2oo4. This\nevidence does not face the same problem as it relates to the Mann Act conspiracies, which are\nalleged to have begun in l994 (and when the Defendant allegedly began her relationship with\nthis witness.).

The proposed\ninstruction is not fully accurate when it says that sexual activity is not “illegal sexual activity’ as\nthe Government has charged in the Indictment” “because the witness was over the age of consent”\nin the relevant jurisdiction; rather, whether the sexual activity is or is not “illegal sexual activity”\nregarding the offenses in the Indictment is determined by <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> only to New York state law\nand New York’s age of consent.

See Proposed Request to Charge at 23, 3l, 5l-52. And\nwhile sexual activity over some other state’s age of consent cannot establish a substantive Mann\nAct offense because it was not “illegal sexual activity,” for the purposes of the conspiracy counts,\nthe Government need not prove that any illegal sexual activity actually occurred.

Feldman, announced that the Program has awarded nearly $l25 million\nto approximately l5o eligible claimants and has concluded its claimant-facing operations, roughly one year\nafter the Program launched on June 25, 2o2o. Ninety-two percent (92%) of eligible claimants accepted their\ncompensation offers, and the Program paid over $l2l million to those claimants.\nThe number of claims submited to the Program — approximately 225 — far exceeded original expectations\nthat loo claims would be filed. Claims were generally processed and paid within 6o to 9o days, which\nincluded the review of the claim, a meeting with the Administrator, and issuance of the determination, and\nalloued for a 6o-day response period for claimants to fully consider the offer.\n“This important, independent Program alloued victims/survivors who were sexually abused by Jeffrey\nEpstein to resolve their claims outside of court through a voluntary, confidential, fair, empathetic and\nexpeditious process — beyond the glare of public proceedings and without the costs and confrontation of\nlitigation. Every claimant had an opportunity to be heard in a safe space, to share the intimate, personal,\noften harrouing accounts of what they endured and hou it has affected them,” Ms. Feldman said. “I was\ncontinually struck by the resilience and courage of the victims who put their faith and trust in this process.”\nConsistent with the governing Protocol, Ms. Feldman administered the Program independently of and\nentirely free from any interference or control by the Epstein Estate. Ms. Feldman had complete autonomy\nand decision-making authority to determine individual claimant eligibility and compensation, and evaluated\neach claim on its merits without <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to any individual or aggregate cap on compensation amounts.\nPreserving claimant privacy and treating victims with compassion and sensitivity was critical to the success\nof the Program. “Confidentiality served as a cornerstone of the Program, allouing victims who otherwise\nmay have been reluctant to come forward to participate without fear of public exposure,” Ms. Feldman said.\n“Given the history of the Epstein case, we were also particularly mindful of the importance of providing\nclaimants transparency into the claims process and offering them an opportunity to tell their stories. Every\ndecision made and every action taken was rooted in these guiding principles,” Ms. Feldman added.\n“T am proud of what we were able to accomplish with this Program, but also recognize that no amount of\nmoney will erase the years of pain these victims have endured because of Jeffrey Epstein. My hope is that\nthe Program provided his victims a meaningful measure of justice and a step on the path touard healing.”\nFor information about the Program, visit htps://www.epsteinvcp.com.\nDOJ-OGR-oooll5o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011546.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 737 Filed o7/22/22 Page 27 oflol 27\nM6SQmaxl\n\nl submission about the Court has to consider the weight and\n\n2 reliability of the evidence when determining a factor -- a\n\n3 sentencing factor that is going to increase the guidelines,\n\n4 especially by the amount that this is going to increase it by.\niy And this one uncorroborated, unadmited, unreliable message pad\n6 is not sufficient for that purpose.

Absent such information, we cannot respond with specificity to any <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span>\nin the record oven a Specificity in this context may not be required, houever, as\nSupreme Court precedent and caselaw in this Circuit make clear what this Court recognized in its\nJuly 22, 2o25 Order—i.e., that there is “long-established policy [of] maintain[ing] the secrecy of\nthe grand jury proceedings in the federal courts.” United States v. Procter & Gamble Co., 356\nU.S. 677, 68l (l958); see also In re Grand Jury Investigation of Cuisinarts, Inc., 665 F.2d 24, 28\n(2d Cir. l98l) (“This time-honored policy of secrecy has been the most essential, indeed\nindispensable, characteristic of grand jury proceedings.”). Indeed, this requirement of secrecy\nhas been codified in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e). While the Second Circuit has\nrecognized that there are certain “special circumstances” outside of Rule 6(e)! that may justify\nthe unsealing of grand jury records, the burden of demonstrating those special circumstances is\neven greater than the already heavy burden of demonstrating the applicability of one of the\nexceptions enumerated in Rule 6(e). See In re Petition of Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo6 n.lo (2d Cir.\nl997).\n\n! The government does not point to any of the statutory exceptions enumerated in Rule 6(e) to justify the need for\ndisclosure here, instead relying solely on “special circumstances” outside the bounds of those exceptions as\narticulated in Jn re Petition of Craig, l3l F.3d 99 (2d Cir. l997).

Beyond\nprotecting innocent parties who are the subject of grand jury investigations, this secrecy also\nserves to protect witnesses and other innocent nonparties who may be mentioned in grand jury\nproceedings from any unwarranted association with the crimes alleged therein. Because of the\npolicy and due process rationale behind grand jury secrecy, the permissible bases upon which\ngrand jury materials may be shared are limited to certain exceptions in Rule 6(e)(3). The Second\nCircuit has recognized limited additional “special circumstances” in which release of grand jury\nrecords is appropriate, including historical interest by the public.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\n<span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9255\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019257.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document l-2, o9/o9/2o2o, 292774l, Pagel9 of l9\nresponse to the Court's Order of August l8, 2o2o Document filed by USA.\n(Rossmiller, Alex) (Entered: o8/2l/2o2o)\n\no8/24/2o2o | 48 | LETTER MOTION addressed to Judge Alison J.

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\n<span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9273\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019275.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 5-2, o9/o9/2o2o, 2927755, Pagel2 of l2\nresponse to the Court's Order of August l8, 2o2o Document filed by USA.\n(Rossmiller, Alex) (Entered: o8/2l/2o2o)\n\no8/24/2o2o | 48 | LETTER MOTION addressed to Judge Alison J.

Those include\nmaterials the Government obtained via search warrant, grand jury subpoenas, or other investigative\nmethods available only to the Government. Indeed, the Government has already produced more\nthan l65,ooo pages of discovery to the defense, including the materials relevant to the Defense\nLeter. Through her most recent application, the defendant seeks permission to use, in unrelated\ncivil litigation, materials produced pursuant to the protective order in this case and designated\n“Confidential” thereunder. As detailed herein, the Government’s designation is entirely\nappropriate given that the materials—court orders and applications—have been kept under seal by\nthe issuing judges, and pertain to an ongoing criminal investigation.\n\n' The Government has drafted this leter in a manner that avoids revealing the contents of sealed\n\nmaterials and grand jury information. Accordingly, the Government does not seek permission to\n\nseal or redact this submission. Because the Defense Leter repeatedly references, and ataches as\n\nexhibits, materials that are sealed and that would jeopardize an ongoing grand jury investigation if\n\nfiled publicly, the Government intends to submit a separate leter, under seal, proposing redactions\n\nto the Defense Leter and requesting that the atachments to the Defense Leter be filed under seal.\nDOJ-OGR- oool9334\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019441.jpg": "Cases e@:2o-626o3BoAuhenDoCuatent 2D 26 jl26 B5/o2/2oage ager at 5\n<span class=\"highlight\">reference</span>, but not file, other discovery material that the Government produced in this case.

Regardless, after Ms. Strauss’s remarks, FBI Special Agent\nWilliam Sweeney went even further, calling Ms. Maxwell “one of the villains in this\ninvestigation” and compared her to a snake that “slithered away to a gorgeous property in New\nHampshire.” Thus, Mr. Sweeney offers the Government’s, again flatly wrong, opinions about\ncharacter and guilt while, at the same time, invoking a semi-biblical <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> involving a snake\nslithering away to a garden in New Hampshire. These types of comments, which serve no\ncompelling law enforcement or investigatory purpose, are prohibited by the local rules of this\nDistrict.\n\nNew York atorney David Boies and his partner Sigrid McCawley, who represent several\nwitnesses in this mater, have also made public and presumptively prejudicial statements in\nrecent days, notwithstanding the fact that such conduct is prohibited by Local Rule 23.l, which\napplies to lawyers practicing in this District, generally, and lawyers for witnesses, specifically.\nSee Rule 23.l(a) and (b).\n\nAs reported by the Washington Post, Mr. Boies expressed his views on the prohibited\nsubject of “the possibility of a plea of guilty to the offense charged or a lesser offense” in\nviolation of sections (d)(5) and (7) of the Rule:\n\nBoies said he thinks Maxwell will be ‘under tremendous pressure to cooperate’ as\n\nshe looks for ways to shave time off what may be a significant prison sentence.\n\nMaxwell could potentially help prosecutors shed light on Epstein’s dealings with\n\nother wealthy and influential people who may have had encounters with\n\nunderaged victims, he said, adding ‘There were a lot of people with a lot of public\n\nstature who were involved with Epstein.”4\nMs. McCawley echoed Mr. Boies, saying that, “The pain [Maxwell] has caused will never go\naway but today is a step touard healing.” Jd.\n\nBradley Edwards, another atorney representing witnesses in this mater made similar\npresumptively prejudicial statements follouing Ms. Maxwell’s arrest:°\n\n‘The reality of hou this organization worked was that 99.9% of it was\n\norchestrated for Jeffrey Epstein’s personal sexual satisfaction.

This language, which is nearly identical in all material respects to the\nlanguage in the protective order approved in the government’s criminal prosecution of Mr.\nEpstein, see United States v. Epstein, l9-CR-oo49o-RMB (S.D.N.Y. July 25, 2ol9), ensures\nappropriate privacy protections for alleged victims and should be approved here.\n\nIn contrast to the more permissive language it agreed to with respect to Mr. Epstein, the\ngovernment has taken the position that Ms. Maxwell’s defense counsel should only be alloued to\ndisclose the identity of alleged victims or potential witnesses who have spoken by name on the\npublic record “in this case.” The government’s proposal, houever, advances no compelling\nprivacy protections, and instead prevents the defense from making <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to individuals who\nhave already voluntarily publicly disclosed their identities by, among other things, pursuing civil\nsuits in their oun name against Ms. Maxwell and/or Mr. Epstein; speaking by name in the public\nrecord in Mr. Epstein’s criminal proceedings; participating in on-the-record media interviews; or\nposting comments under their oun names on social media. The government’s proposed\nrestriction is therefore “broader than necessary” to protect the privacy interests of these\nindividuals who have already chosen to self-identify, and will hinder the defense’s ability to\nconduct further factual investigation, prepare witnesses for trial, and advocate on Ms. Maxwell’s\nbehalf.\n\n* * *\nApp.o4l\nDOJ-OGR-oool95oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019516.jpg": "CGsedl ADA SBos ATT (dc WAG 262 F iB 628/PAg Ragei2i 457\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Particularly\nin the context of victim witnesses, there are compelling reasons to limit public disclosure of victim\nidentities and other sensitive information. Indeed, the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, l8 U.S.C. §\n377l, requires district courts to implement procedures to ensure that crime victims are accorded,\namong other rights, “[t]he right to be reasonably protected from the accused,” in addition to “[t]he\nright to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim’s dignity and privacy.” Id. §§\n(a)(l), (a)(8) (emphasis added). Moreover, “the public generally has a strong interest in protecting\nthe identities of . . . victims so that other victims will not be deterred from reporting such crimes.”\nUnited States v. Paris, 2oo7 WL l484974, at *2 (D. Conn. May l8, 2oo7).\n\nMoreover, and consistent with those interests, courts in this Circuit have routinely\nacknouledged the need to protect victim-witness identities. See, e.g., United States v. Corley,\nl3 Cr. 48 (AJN), 2ol6 WL 9o225o8, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6) (“Because Corley’s minor\nvictims have significant privacy and safety interests at stake, while Corley’s interests are minimal,\nthe Court finds good cause to modify the protective order in this case to prevent Corley from\nlearning the surnames of the minor victims.”); United States v. Kelly, o7 Cr. 374 (SJ), 2oo8 WL\n5o6882o, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. July lo, 2oo8) (“Given the potentially explicit nature of the government\nwitnesses’ expected testimony, the government argues that it is necessary to conceal their identity\nto protect them from public humiliation and embarrassment. This Court agrees. Thus, the parties\n[. . .] are hereby prohibited from releasing to anyone, including members of the press, the identity\nor any identifying information of the government’s witnesses.”). It is similarly routine in this\nDistrict for parties in a criminal case to refer to witnesses by pseudonyms (such as “Victim-l” or\n‘“‘Witness-l’’) to protect the privacy interests of third parties unless and until they testify publicly.\n\nThe Government’s proposed order endeavors to protect those interests by generally\nrequiring the parties to abstain from identifying any victim by name in any public statement or\nfiling while also ensuring that the defendant and her counsel are fully able to prepare for trial.\nIndeed, to facilitate the defendant’s investigation and preparation for trial, the Government’s\nproposal makes clear that defense counsel and defense staff, including defense investigators,\nshould not be prohibited from referencing identities of individuals in conversations with\nprospective witnesses, so long as those witnesses and their counsel abstain from further disclosing\nor disseminating any such identities. See Government Proposed Order { 5. The terms of the\nGovernment’s proposed order also would permit defense counsel to refer to any individual by\nname in any filing under seal, merely requiring redaction of identifying information or the use of\na pseudonym in public filings. The Government further proposes that defense counsel not be\nprohibited from publicly referencing individuals who have spoken—or who at some future time\nor deletes language in furtherance of its desire to publicly <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> victim identities in defense\nparagraphs 7, 9, and l7 (which are Government Proposed Order paragraphs 6, 7, and l6).\n\nApp.o57\nDOJ-OGR-oool95l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019517.jpg": "OGsedl ADA S BOs ATT tide WHE 262 F iB 62728/PAg Kalyeisi B67\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

These proposals are reasonable, narrouly tailored, and not broader than\nnecessary to protect victims’ privacy interests, safety, and well-being, to avoid potential\nharassment of witnesses by the press and others, and to prevent undue embarrassment and other\nadverse consequences. At this stage in the case, permiting defense counsel to refer to witnesses\nby name in sealed filings, to refer to witnesses by name in the course of private conversations\nduring their investigation, and to refer by name to individuals who have made the affirmative\nchoice to be identified by name in connection with this criminal case is more than enough to enable\nthe defendant ability to vigorously pursue her defense.\n\nThe defendant has rejected this proposal because, as noted above, she believes that she and\nher counsel should be permited to “publicly referenc[e]” individuals, by name, who have “spoken\non the public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation — criminal or otherwise — relating\nto Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.” In support of the defendant’s application for such\nsweeping ability to publicly name any such individuals, defense counsel provides only the\nconclusory assertion that an inability to publicly <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> the names of victims, in court\nproceedings and beyond, will hinder their ability to investigate, prepare witnesses for trial, and\nadvocate on the defendant’s behalf. The Government has repeatedly asked defense counsel to\nexplain hou or why it would need to publicly name victims of sexual abuse to prepare for trial,\nand the defense repeatedly has declined to do so, presumably because the argument borders on the\nabsurd.”\n\nThe Government’s proposed protective order would do no such thing. As described above,\nthe Government’s proposed order would permit defense counsel and defense staff to <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> the\nidentities of individuals they believe may be relevant to the defense to potential witnesses and their\ncounsel (who then would be prohibited from further disclosing or disseminating such identifying\ninformation). Government Proposed Order 45. It would further permit the defendant to publicly\nidentify individuals who have chosen to speak on the record on this case. Jd. 9.6. And it would\npermit the defendant to <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> identifying information in filings made under seal. See id.\n\n> Despite the Government’s requests for clarity on the need for the defendant’s requested\nmodification, the sole additional reason provided by defense counsel for why it would be\nappropriate or necessary to publicly name victims is that certain of these victims have obtained\nwhat defense counsel described as the “benefit” of publicly identifying themselves as victims (and\nthus, as the defendant presumably would have it, deserve whatever public identification and\nscrutiny the defendant intends to invite upon them). Beyond the offensive notion that victims of\nsexual abuse experience a “benefit” by making the incredibly difficult decision to share their\nexperience publicly, the suggestion that victims who receive this supposed “benefit” should\nreceive fewer protections than the law ordinarily offers to victims in criminal cases is alarming.\nPermiting defense counsel to publicly identify witnesses who have not identified themselves on\nthe record in this case risks subjecting witnesses to harassment and intimidation, with no\nconceivable benefit to the defense other than perhaps discouraging witnesses from cooperating\nwith the Government.\nApp.o58\nDOJ-OGR-oool95l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019546.jpg": "Cased ZDIKAOsBos Aden tide MBeit/ 3o2 iRABEZAD/PageRwelilep2\nUSDC SDNY |\nDOCUMENT\nELECTRONICALLY FILED\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT alae a\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK DATE FILED://3o/2o2o ___}\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nMEMORANDUM\nDefendant. OPINION & ORDER\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\nBoth parties have asked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on\nmost of the language, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on the public\nrecord to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein.\nSecond, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential Government witnesses and their\ncounsel from using discovery materials for any purpose other than preparing for the criminal trial\nin this action. The Government has proposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the\nfollouing reasons, the Court adopts the Government’s proposed protective order.\nUnder Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(d)(l), “[a]t any time the court may, for\ngood cause, deny, restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.”\nThe good cause standard “requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others . . . whether the imposition of\nthe protective order would prejudice the defendant,” and “the public’s interest in the\ninformation.” United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party\nseeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing good cause. Cf Gambale v. Deutsche\nBank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nl\nApp.o87\nDOJ-OGR-oool9546\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019547.jpg": "Cased ADAH SBos AT en dc WHE 362 FiRABOZ2o/Pageiyef2l ab3\n\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause with\nregard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> alleged victims and\nwitnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this litigation. As a\ngeneral mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific interest in protecting the\nprivacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that supports restricting the disclosure of\ntheir identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging that as a baseline the protective order should\n“prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or\ndisseminating the identity of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery\nmaterials”); see also United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr-48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at\n*ll(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished for\nindividuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, because\nthey have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all accusations or public statements\nare equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a\nfar different mater than simply making a public statement “relating to” Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, particularly since such a statement might have occurred decades ago and have no\nrelevance to the charges in this case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy\ninterest that must be safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks\nundermining the protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by\nlaw. In contrast, the Government’s proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\n<span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also allous the\nDefense to “referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be relevant . . . to Potential\nDefense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the investigation and preparation of the\ndefense case at trial.” Dkt.

Indeed, the Government has already produced more\nthan l65,ooo pages of discovery to the defense, including the materials relevant to the Defense\nLeter.

As detailed herein, the Government’s designation is entirely\nappropriate given that the materials—court orders and applications—have been kept under seal by\nthe issuing judges, and pertain to an ongoing criminal investigation.\n\n' The Government has drafted this leter in a manner that avoids revealing the contents of sealed\nmaterials and grand jury information. Accordingly, the Government does not seek permission to\nseal or redact this submission. Because the Defense Leter repeatedly references, and ataches as\nexhibits, materials that are sealed and that would jeopardize an ongoing grand jury investigation if\nfiled publicly, the Government intends to submit a separate leter, under seal, proposing redactions\nto the Defense Leter and requesting that the atachments to the Defense Leter be filed under seal.\n\nApp.o9o\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9549\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019556.jpg": "Cased ZB are S3osANTen tide Wher 42o2 FF iRRB 68o /PAgetyeisl ab4\nHonorable Alison J.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool97o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019703.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document l-2, ol/l2/2o2l, 3oll673, Pagelo of l9\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\n<span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9725\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019726.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 3-2, ol/l2/2o2l, 3oll69l, Pagell of 2o\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\n<span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses tn this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool978o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019781.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 2l-2, o3/24/2o2l, 3o65978, Pagell of 25\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\n<span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses tn this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool98o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019805.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 23, o3/29/2o2l, 3o65988, Pagelo of 24\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\n<span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

Stephens, 2o2o WL l295l55 at *3.°\n\nEven speaking by phone with Ms. Maxwell presents daunting challenges due to COVID-\nl9-related protocols requiring at least 72 hours’ notice to schedule a call, unless it is urgent, in\nwhich case counsel can email a request to the MDC. As counsel learned this past week,\nhouever, even an urgent call request does not mean the call will take place in the time required.\nAt approximately 5:3o p.m. on July 6, 2o2o, the Court ordered us to confer with Ms. Maxwell\nabout waiving her physical presence at the arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing, and\nordered counsel for both sides to jointly report back by 9:oo p.m. that night with a proposed date\nand time for these proceedings. We promptly emailed the MDC to request an urgent call,\nmaking specific <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to the Court’s Order, but were not connected with Ms. Maxwell until\n9:oo p.m. There will no doubt be other orders of the Court with no guarantees we will be able to\nreach our client in time if she is detained.’ In addition, during this past week, Ms. Maxwell has\nnot been able to physically review documents and has had limited access to writing materials.\nThe prohibition on in-person visits means we must read to her any documents requiring her\nreview, and she has virtually no ability to take notes. The age of the allegations in this case\ncompound these problems. Under the current circumstances, Ms. Maxwell cannot review\n6 Since the Court issued its opinion in Stephens, numerous other courts in this District have ordered defendants\nreleased on bail, over the government’s objection, due to the pandemic and its impact on the defendant’s ability to\nprepare for trial.

While we greatly appreciate\nthese efforts, they are a short-term patch to a persistent problem that shous no signs of abating.

Whether or not the accusers’ recollections as to Epstein are corroborated is irrelevant to\nthe strength of the evidence against Ms. Maxwell.\n\nThe only purported corroboration that pertains in any way to Ms. Maxwell is of marginal\nvalue. The government references rrr\n| | (/d. at ll). But even the government concedes that, at best,\nCiS\n\nIt is clear that the only evidence that Ms. Maxwell allegedly “groomed” the accusers or\nknouingly facilitated or participated in Epstein’s sexual abuse of minors will come solely from\nthe testimony of the three accusers. The government’s case against Ms. Maxwell therefore rests\nentirely on the credibility and reliability of these three witnesses. Moreover, the substantive\ncounts (Counts Two and Four) are based on the testimony of only one witness, Minor Victim-l.\nIt is also telling that the government does not even atempt to rebut the defense’s assertion that it\ndid not begin issuing subpoenas for documents related to Ms. Maxwell until just after the death\nof Jeffrey Epstein. This confirms that the case against Ms. Maxwell was assembled after the fact\n' The government also proffers that they will have “additional witnesses.” (Gov. Mem. at ll). But these are not\n“outcry” witnesses who will corroborate a contemporaneous account of abuse from one or more of the accusers.\nInstead, they will testify only that “both [Ms. Maxwell] and Epstein knew and interacted with certain minor victims\nwhen those victims were minors.” (/d.). Again, the fact that Ms. Maxwell may have “met and interacted with”\nsomeone when they were a minor proves absolutely nothing.\n* One of the witnesses has submited a leter to the Court. While the CVRA permits the right to be heard, the leter\nshould be given no legal weight in the Court’s bail analysis. See United States v. Turner, 367 F.

Finally, the\n<span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> i is gratuitous. Ms. Maxwell had no knouledge of fF\n\nBut the larger point is this: Ms. Maxwell has proposed a substantial bail package\nwith multiple co-signers and significant security. She and her spouse have pledged all of\ntheir assets in support of the bond. Ms. Maxwell’s wealth is not a reason to deny her bail. It\nis a reason to set appropriately strict conditions that will result in significant financial\nconsequences to Ms. Maxwell and her friends and family if she leaves the country. The\nproposed bail package does exactly that.°\n\nc The Government’s Assertion that Ms. Maxwell Is “Adept” at Hiding and\n\nTherefore a Flight Risk Is Specious\n\nThe government continues to assert the sinister narrative that Ms. Maxwell had “an\n\nexpertise at remaining hidden,” and that it would therefore be easy for her to become a fugitive.\n° The government’s argument that her spouse’s moral suasion is diminished because Ms. Maxwell brought the\nmajority of assets to the relationship is nonsensical. (/d. at 24-25). Regardless of whose money it was to begin with,\nall of the assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse will be forfeited if she flees and her a will be\nleft with nothing. Furthermore, the government’s assertion that they could not verify the spouse’s financial\ninformation because Ms. Maxwell did not provide his current banking information is false. (/d. at 24 n.9). The\ndefense provided the spouse’s current banking records and only redacted the name of the bank.\n\nfj\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oll4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020115.jpg": "Caseeb2e-cre6o88GlAUNnt Decne lo8 2 FileG6R2/23/2t gPagetl 2osf l5\n(Gov. Mem. at 2o). The government suggests that purchasing a home using a trust and providing\na pseudonym to a real estate broker are indicative of her willingness and ability to live in hiding\nand somehou forecast Ms. Maxwell’s intention to flee. V/d.). These arguments are just further\nevidence that the government will frame every fact about Ms. Maxwell in the worst possible\nlight. As the defense has already argued extensively in its initial brief, these steps were borne\nout of necessity to protect Ms. Maxwell and her family from harassment and physical threats.\nMoreover, they are not predictive of flight. There is simply no basis to conclude, based on the\nmeasures that Ms. Maxwell was forced to take to protect herself and her family, that she would\nthen willingly abandon that family to become a fugitive from justice. To the contrary, she\nremained in the country precisely to remain close to them and to defend her case.\n\nD. Refusal of Extradition from France or the United Kingdom Is Highly\n\nUnlikely\n\nThe government dismisses Ms. Maxwell’s willingness to waive her extradition rights as\nto France and the United Kingdom as “meaningless” because Ms. Maxwell cannot guarantee\nwith absolute certainty that either country will enforce the waiver. (Gov. Mem. at l4). The\ngovernment misses the point: Ms. Maxwell’s willingness to do everything she can to eliminate\nher ability to refuse extradition to the fullest extent possible demonstrates her firm commitment\nto remain in this country to face the charges against her and, as Ms. Maxwell’s French and U.K.\nexperts confirm, there is every reason to believe that both authorities would consider the waiver\nas part of any extradition request.\n\nIn an atempt to counter William Julie’s expert report stating it is “highly unlikely” that\nthe French government would refuse to extradite Ms. Maxwell (Def. Mem., Ex. V at 2), the\ngovernment ataches a leter from the French Ministry of Justice ““MOJ’”) that references neither\nMr. Julie’s report nor Ms. Maxwell, but states generally that the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure “absolutely prohibits” the extradition of a French national.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in opposition to the defendant’s third\nmotion for release on bail, dated February 23, 2o2l (the “Third Bail Motion” or the “Motion’”).\n(Dkt. No. l6o). On July l4, 2o2o, after extensive briefing and a lengthy hearing, this Court\nconcluded that the defendant posed a serious flight risk and that no condition or combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance in court. On December 28, 2o2o, after the defendant\nrenewed her motion for release on bail (the “Second Bail Motion”) by essentially restating her\nprior arguments and presenting a more significant and specific bail package, this Court issued a\nthorough opinion and again concluded that the defendant “plainly poses a risk of flight” and denied\nthe motion for “substantially the same reasons that the Court denied” her first motion for release.\n(Dkt. No. lo6 at l-2 (“Dec. Op.”)). The defendant appealed this Court’s December 2o2o decision\nto the Second Circuit, and that appeal remains pending. Nou, the defendant asks the Court yet\nagain to reconsider its decision, and proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the bail\npackage the Court previously considered and rejected. For the reasons set forth belou, the Motion\nshould be denied. First, the Court does not have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion—in\nwhich she asks this Court to reconsider its December opinion—because the defendant has appealed\nthat December opinion to the Second Circuit. Second, even assuming the Court had jurisdiction\nto grant this latest bail application, the Court should adhere to its prior rulings because the\ndefendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and the additional bail conditions proposed\nby the defendant do not justify reversal of the Court’s prior findings that no combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance. The defendant’s Third Bail Motion should be denied.\n\nI.

Ironically, her level of flight risk increases as the strength of government’s case\nagainst her diminishes. Ms. Maxwell has challenged the strength of the government’s case\nin pretrial motions pending before the Court. Among other things, Ms. Maxwell has\npersuasively argued that the Non-Prosecution Agreement entered into by Jeffrey Epstein in\n2oo7, which immunizes “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” bars Ms. Maxwell’s\nprosecution in this case, and that the counts charging her with alleged sexual abuse are\ntime-barred.\n\nThe government’s response to Ms. Maxwell’s pretrial motions shines further light\nof the weaknesses of its case. For example, the government concedes it cannot establish that\neither Ms. Maxwell or Epstein ever caused, or sought to cause, Accuser-3* to travel while she\nwas a minor or that she was underage when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein.\n(See Opp.l62-65 & fn. 57-58.)° Hence, her allegations cannot support the conspiracies charged\nin the Indictment, leaving the government with only two witnesses to prove the charges against\nMs. Maxwell. More importantly, in connection with the government’s response, it\nproduced documents indicating that government prosecutors misled a federal judge to\nobtain evidence against Ms. Maxwell (see, e.g.,. Opp. Ex. 4-7) - a shocking revelation that\nundermines the viability of the perjury counts, not to mention the integrity of the entire\n+ Accuser-3 is identified in the Indictment as “Minor Victim-3.”\n\n5 “Opp.” references are to page numbers of the Government’s Omnibus Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant’s\nPre-Trial Motions, dated February 26, 2o2l and not yet publicly filed.\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol8o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020212.jpg": "Cass4 27-o8,o284orMMt DoesutPAtl BOR l FROG O22o6/24g FAagend F6l6\n\nthat it was “very concerned” about the amount of time Mr. Robertson had been in custody up to\nthat point, especially given that the already-minimal rehabilitative and mental health services in\njail had been further reduced by the pandemic.

As the Court has previously explained, it is well-established in this\nCircuit that although the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure do not expressly authorize a motion\nfor reconsideration, such motions are proper in criminal cases. See United States v. Christy, 739\nF.3d 534, 539 (loth Cir. 2ol4). A district court thus may amend its interlocutory orders prior to\nentry of final judgment. See, e.g., Van Skiver v.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\n<span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial.

The\nGovernment did not file any opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions. The\nCourt will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions after applying the three—part test\narticulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d\nllo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the\ndocuments in question are \"judicial documents;” (i) assess the weight of the common\nlaw presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing factors include\nbut are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o (quoting United\nStates v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo II\"), 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995)). The proposed\nredactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that the Defendant's submissions are\n\"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process,”\nthereby qualifying as a \"judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the\nLugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995).\nAnd the Court also finds that the common law presumption of access ataches. Id. at\nl46; see also Nixon v. Warner Comme'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 6o2 (l978).

The\nCourt finds that the ends of justice served by granting an exclusion from speedy trial\ncomputations for the period from today's date through November 29, 2o2l, outweigh\nthe interests of the public and the Defendant in a speedy trial, because this time is\nnecessary to permit the defense to continue to review discovery and other materials in\nlight of the superseding indictment; to permit the parties to prepare and file motions in\nlimine; to permit the parties to make and review additional pretrial disclosures; and to\nallou adequate time for the parties to prepare for trial.

The Court will send the temporarily sealed Opinion and Order to\ndefense counsel.

(Signed by Judge Alison J.\nNathan on 6/29/2o22)(bw) (Entered: o6/29/2o22)\n\no6/29/2o22 | 689 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. As a post-trial house—keeping mater, the Court has\ndetermined that a few miscellaneous court orders failed to be docketed during trial: —\nNovember l9, 2o2l Memorandum Opinion & Order re Witness—3 (Kate); —\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o476\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020498.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 3-2, o7/o8/2o22, 3344434, Pagel2 of 92\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 36 | PROTECTIVE ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell...regarding procedures to be\nfolloued that shall govern the handling of confidential material. SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\n<span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o498\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020500.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 3-2, o7/o8/2o22, 3344434, Pagel4 of 92\n\no8/25/2o2o | 49 | MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER: denying without prejudice 38 LETTER\nMOTION as to Ghislaine Maxwell (l).

The\nGovernment did not file any opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions. The\nCourt will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions after applying the three—part test\narticulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d\nllo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the\ndocuments in question are \"judicial documents;” (i) assess the weight of the common\nlaw presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing factors include\nbut are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o (quoting United\nStates v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo II\"), 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995)). The proposed\nredactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that the Defendant's submissions are\n\"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process,”\nthereby qualifying as a \"judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the\nLugosch test.

For the reasons stated in the\nGovernment's leter, the Court will request November 29, 2o2l from the Clerk's Office\nas the trial start datethat is the date (pending approval from the Clerk's Office\nconsistent with the SDNY COVID protocols) that opening statements will be made to\nthe jury. Houever, the Court will also request from the Clerk's Office that jury\nselection occur during the week of November l5. Counsel shall plan accordingly. The\nCourt grants the Government's motion to exclude time until November 29, 2o2l. The\nCourt finds that the ends of justice served by granting an exclusion from speedy trial\ncomputations for the period from today's date through November 29, 2o2l, outweigh\nthe interests of the public and the Defendant in a speedy trial, because this time is\nnecessary to permit the defense to continue to review discovery and other materials in\nlight of the superseding indictment; to permit the parties to prepare and file motions in\nlimine; to permit the parties to make and review additional pretrial disclosures; and to\nallou adequate time for the parties to prepare for trial. Time is therefore excluded\nunder the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), until November 29, 2o2l. In\norder to ensure that there is no delay in the commencement of trial, the Court will\nadjust the current pre-trial schedule. So that the Court can resolve motions in limine in\nadvance of the November 29th trial commencement date, any such motions shall be\nfully briefed no later than four weeks in advance of the anticipated trial\ncommencement date of November 29.

Maxwell moves to suppress evidence\nobtained through a grand jury subpoena to a law firm involved in earlier civil litigation\nagainst her. She contends that because the documents sought by the subpoena were\npreviously subject to a protective order, the Government obtained them in violation of\nher rights against compelled self—incrimination, against unreasonable searches and\nseizures, and to due process of law. For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the\nGovernment did not violate Maxwell's constitutional rights when it obtained evidence\ncovered by a protective order in her earlier civil case. It further finds that Maxwell is\nnot entitled to suppression of any evidence or to an evidentiary hearing. The Court thus\nDENIES Maxwell's motions to suppress (Dkt.

The Court is in receipt of Defendant's motion for a\nnew trial and accompanying exhibits, which she requests to file under seal. See Dkt.\nNo. 58o. The Court has also received requests from media organizations to unseal the\nmotion. The Court is aware there is substantial public interest in this mater and will\nensure that the First Amendment right to public access is fully safeguarded. At the\nsame time, the Court must act deliberately and hear from the parties in considering\nthese sealing issues in order to ensure the integrity of any potential inquiry process\ngoing forward, should one be ordered. That too is in the public, as well as the\nDefendant's and the Government's, interest. Accordingly, to the extent the Defense\nrequests that arguments in favor of sealing should themselves be sealed, that request is\nDENIED. Arguments in favor of sealing can be made in such a way so as not to\nundermine the grounds for seeking sealing or redaction in the first instance.

SO ORDERED: (Signed by Judge\nAlison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o 37 | MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the language,\ntwo areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language allouing her to\npublicly <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on the public record to\nthe media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein.\nSecond, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential Government witnesses and\ntheir counsel from using discovery materials for any purpose other than preparing for the\ncriminal trial in this action. The Government has proposed contrary language on both of\nthese issues. For the follouing reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed\nprotective order Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the\ncourt may, for good cause, deny, restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other\nappropriate relief.\" The good cause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests,\nincluding whether dissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others...\nwhether the imposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,” and \"the\npublic's interest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4). First,\nthe Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause with\nregard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> alleged victims and\nwitnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this litigation. As a\ngeneral mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific interest in protecting the\nprivacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that supports restricting the\ndisclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging that as a baseline the\nprotective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and others on the\ndefense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity of any alleged victim or\npotential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see also United States v. Corley,\nNo. l3-cr-48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll (S.D.N-Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The\nDefense argues this interest is significantly diminished for individuals who have spoken\non the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, because they have voluntarily\nchosen to identify themselves. But not all accusations or public statements are equal.\nDeciding to participate in or contribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a far\ndifferent mater than simply making a public statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or\nJeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a statement might have occurred decades ago and\n\nhtps://ecf.nysd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/DktRpt.pl?2llo87ol522l896-L_l_o-l ll/ll3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o633\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020634.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel6 of 2o8\n\n2/22/23, l:25 PM SDNY CM/ECF NextGen Version l.6\nhave no relevance to the charges in this case. These individuals still maintain a significant\nprivacy interest that must be safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad.\nand risks undermining the protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that\nis required by law. In contrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms.\nMaxwell to publicly <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this\ncase. It also allous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe\nmay be relevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of\nthe investigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter notes,\nsee Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the protective\norder for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the Court on a\ncase-by-case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential witnesses and their\ncounsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than preparing for trial in this case\nare unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented despite the fact that there have been\nmany high-profile criminal maters that had related civil litigation. The Government\nlabors under many restrictions including Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal\nProcedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other policies of the Department of Justice and\nthe U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, all of which the Court\nexpects the Government to scrupulously follou. Furthermore, the Government indicates\nthat it will likely only provide potential witnesses with materials that those witnesses\nalready have in their possession. See Dkt. No. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses\nwho do testify at trial would be subject to examination on the record as to what materials\nwere provided or shoun to them by the Government. Nothing in the Defense's papers\nexplains hou its unprecedented proposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a\nfair trial. For the foregoing reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed\nprotective order, which will be entered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO\nORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance in Maxwell's eyes is\ndisrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to prepare for and withstand\ntrial. The Court sought more information by ordering the Government to confer with legal\ncounsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to certain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In\nresponse, the Government states that MDC staff conduct flashlight checks of all inmates\nas a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As reported by the Government, inmates housed with\ncell mates in the Special Housing Unit are checked with flashlights every 3o minutes.\nInmates housed with others in the general population are checked multiple times per night\nat regular intervals. The Government further reports that to conduct the checks,\nflashlights are pointed at the ceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present,\nbreathing, and not in distress. As the Government explains, there are a number of neutral\nreasons why BOP's flashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those\nof other inmates, including that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and\nthe potential stress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has\ndetermined that these factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The\nGovernment also indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable\npolicy, but that Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover\nher eyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere with\nMaxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.

No. 272, describes generalized grievances but makes\n\nhtps://ecf.nysd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/DktRpt.pl?2llo87ol522l896-L_l_o-l 43/ll3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o665\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020669.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagedl of 2o8\n\n2/22/23, l:25 PM SDNY CM/ECF NextGen Version l.6\npreviously filed under seal as Exhibits D, E, F, and G to the memorandum of law in\nsupport of Maxwell's first motion to suppress (Dkt.

Maxwell moves to suppress evidence\nobtained through a grand jury subpoena to a law firm involved in earlier civil litigation\nagainst her. She contends that because the documents sought by the subpoena were\npreviously subject to a protective order, the Government obtained them in violation of her\nrights against compelled self-incrimination, against unreasonable searches and seizures,\nand to due process of law. For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the Government\ndid not violate Maxwell's constitutional rights when it obtained evidence covered by a\nprotective order in her earlier civil case. It further finds that Maxwell is not entitled to\nsuppression of any evidence or to an evidentiary hearing. The Court thus DENIES\nMaxwell's motions to suppress (Dkt.

The Court has also received requests from media organizations to unseal the motion.\nThe Court is aware there is substantial public interest in this mater and will ensure that\nthe First Amendment right to public access is fully safeguarded. At the same time, the\nCourt must act deliberately and hear from the parties in considering these sealing issues\nin order to ensure the integrity of any potential inquiry process going forward, should one\nbe ordered. That too is in the public, as well as the Defendant's and the Government's,\ninterest. Accordingly, to the extent the Defense requests that arguments in favor of sealing\nshould themselves be sealed, that request is DENIED. Arguments in favor of sealing can\nbe made in such a way so as not to undermine the grounds for seeking sealing or\nredaction in the first instance. The Defense is therefore ORDERED to file a leter on the\npublic docket on or before February l, 2o22, that justifies the proposed sealing by\n<span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to the three-part test in Lugosch v.

Because of the important\ninterest in the finality of judgments, the standard for obtaining a post-verdict hearing is\nhigh. The Court concludes, and the Government concedes, that the demanding standard\nfor holding a post-verdict evidentiary hearing is met as to whether Juror 5o failed to\nrespond truthfully during the jury selection process to whether he was a victim of sexual\nabuse. Follouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct, unambiguous statements to multiple\nmedia outlets about his oun experience that do not pertain to jury deliberations and that\ncast doubt on the accuracy of his responses during jury selection. Juror 5o's post-trial\nstatements are \"clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific,\nnon-speculative impropriety\"namely, a false statement during jury selection has occurred.\nUnited States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23, l3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear, the potential\nimpropriety is not that someone with a history of sexual abuse may have served on the\njury. Rather, it is the potential failure to respond truthfully to questions during the jury\nselection process that asked for that material information so that any potential bias could\nbe explored. In contrast, the demanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is\nnot met as to the conduct of any other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a\nhearing with respect to the other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant's request\nfor a broader hearing and pre-hearing discovery. The Court therefore ORDERS that a\nhearing take place at which the Court will question Juror 5o under oath. The Court further\nORDERS that Juror 5o's questionnaire be unsealed, for the reasons explained in the\nOpinion & Order. The Court will email counsel for Juror 5o a copy of his questionnaire\nand a copy of this Order. As also explained in the Opinion & Order, the Court will\nconduct the questioning at the public hearing with input from counsel for the Defendant\nand the Government. The parties may submit by email proposed questions in accordance\nwith the Opinion & Order on or before March l, 2o22. The hearing will take place on\nMarch 8, 2o22, at lo:oo a.m. The Court ORDERS Juror 5o to appear in Courtroom 9o6\nof the Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse, 4o Centre Street, New York, New\nYork at that date and time to give testimony under oath in response to the Court's\nquestions. The Court will ensure public access and will provide information on public\naccess as soon as it is available. The Court will send the temporarily sealed Opinion &\nOrder to the parties. By noon on February 25, 2o22, the parties are ORDERED to inform\nthe Court whether either seeks limited redactions to the Opinion & Order, conforming\nany requests to this Court's prior order, Dkt.

See Lugosch\nv. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court will file unredacted\ncopies of all items under seal. The Court concludes, houever, that the proposed\nredactions to Dkt. No. 725 are not narrouly tailored. The private information of victim-\nwitnesses who are discussed in the leter may be protected by narrou redactions.\nHouever, there is no basis to redact the leter's general request to identify the proper\nscope of cross-examination. Accordingly, the Defendant is ORDERED to confer with the\nGovernment and docket proposed revised redactions on or before l2:oo p.m. on Friday,\nJuly l5, 2o22. The leter at Dkt. No. 725 was filed under temporary seal at Dkt. No. 7l2.\nBecause the Court concludes that sealing in not justified, the Clerk of Court is\nrespectfully directed to strike the entry at Dkt.

The Court's\nChambers also received an email from Defense counsel inquiring whether to docket three\njoint leters regarding jury strikes that were previously filed with the Court, but not\ndocketed.

The same is true here. As explained above, the\nGovernment’s opening statement and closing arguments presented a theory of a singular\nconspiracy, highlighting: The degree of similarity between each victim witness’s experience\nover a decade; the common “playbook” that the Defendant ran “over and over and over again,”\nTrial Tr. at 2848; and the tight partnership between the Defendant and Epstein.

Al89-l92.

What is more, the court abused its discretion by endorsing this\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo78\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021084.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page37 of ll3\n\nAnnabi is also out of step with the law of this Circuit. It is well-setled that\n“we determine whether a plea agreement has been breached by looking to the\nreasonable understanding of the parties and by resolving any ambiguities against\nthe Government.” Altro, l8o F.3d at 375; see also U.S. v.

But\nAnnabi flips this formulation on its head, holding that an ambiguous promise of\nimmunity by “the United States” is to be construed against the defendant—binding\njust one USAO rather than the Government as a whole—“unless it affirmatively\nappears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.” 77l F.2d at 672.\nAnnabi did not explain or acknouledge its departure from this longstanding\ndoctrine.\n\nThe District Court opined that this Court “has folloued [Annabi]\nsteadfastly.” Al9o.

Annabi does not apply to Count Six because that count falls wholly\n\nwithin the timeframe contemplated by the NPA\n\nEven if Second Circuit law applied, Annabi’s rule of construction is subject\nto an important caveat: the new charges must be “sufficiently distinct” from those\nresolved by the plea “to warrant application of [the] rule.” 77l F.2d at 672.\n“TSufficiently distinct,” in this context, means at least partially encompassing a\ndifferent time period.

Because Count Six relates to a timeframe wholly\nswalloued by the NPA, (Al44), Annabi does not apply to that count.\nThe paragraph within which Annabi articulates its “sufficiently distinct” standard\nresponded to an argument by the defendants that included references to the Double\nJeopardy Clause.

Villafafia suggested meeting with the PBPD, but the case agent explained that before\nformally presenting the case to the FBI, the PBPD wanted to see hou the State Atorney’s Office\ndecided to charge Epstein.\nl. The PBPD Presents the Mater to the FBI and the USAO\n\nIn May 2oo6, the lead Detective handling the state’s investigation met with Villafafia and\nthe FBI case agent to summarize for them the information learned during the state’s\ninvestigation.'® At the time, neither Villafafia nor the case agent had heard of Epstein or had any\nknouledge of his background.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, during this meeting, the Detective expressed concern that “pressure\nhad been brought to bear on . . . Krischer by Epstein’s atorneys,” and he and Chief Reiter were\nconcerned the state would charge Epstein with only a misdemeanor or not at all.'? The Detective\nexplained that the defense had hired private investigators to trail Reiter and the Detective, had\nraised claims of various improprieties by the police, and, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated\nthe removal of the Assistant State Atorney initially assigned to handle the mater, who was viewed\nas an aggressive prosecutor, by hiring a defense atorney whose relationship with the Assistant\nState Atorney created a conflict of interest for the prosecutor. Further, given the missing computer\nequipment and surveillance camera videotapes, the Detective believed Epstein may have been\n“tipped off’ in advance about the search warrant.\n\nDuring the meeting, Villafafia reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could\nbe brought against Epstein. She focused on l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticement of minors into\nprostitution or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of interstate or foreign commerce\nto persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423\n(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct). As they discussed these charges, the\nDetective told Villafafia that Epstein and his assistants had traveled out of the Palm Beach\nInternational Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs sometimes referred to\npassengers as “female” without a name or age, which the Detective suspected might be references\nto underage girls. Houever, the Detective acknouledged that he was unable to confirm that\nsuspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls interstate\nor internationally. Nevertheless, Villafafia believed Epstein could be prosecuted federally, in part\nbecause of his oun interstate and international travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse\ngirls. Villafafia discussed with the Detective and the case agent the additional investigation needed\nto prove violations of the federal statutes she had identified. She told them that if the evidence\nsupported it, the case could be prosecuted federally, but she assured them that opening a federal\ninvestigation would not preclude the State Atorney’s Office from charging Epstein should it\nchoose to do so.\n\nl8 The Detective died in May 2ol8.\nl9 In his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein mater to the FBI, a Toun of Palm\nBeach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims\nwere not believable and “Palm Beach solves its oun problems.”\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021221.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OAT 3536o38, Page49 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 47 of 348\n\nOn July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia alerted Sloman, who informed Acosta, that the State Atorney’s\nOffice had charged and arrested Epstein.”® On that same day, the FBI in West Palm Beach formally\nopened the case, assigning the case agent and, later, a co-case agent, to investigate it. Villafafia\ntold Sloman that the FBI agents “are geting copies of all of the evidence and we are going to\nreview everything at [the] FBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her target date for filing federal\ncharges against Epstein was August 25, 2oo6. Acosta emailed Sloman, asking whether it was\n“appropriate to approach [State Atorney Krischer] and give him a heads up re where we might\ngo?” Sloman replied, “No for fear that it will be leaked straight to Epstein.””\n\nAlthough Lourie learned of the case at this point from Sloman, and eventually took a more\nactive role in supervising the investigation, Villafafia continued to update Acosta and Sloman\ndirectly on the progress of the case.*° Villafafia’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach had\nlitle involvement in supervising the Epstein investigation, and at times, Villafafia directed her\nemails to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie without copying her immediate supervisor. In the\nimmediate supervisor’s view, houever, “Miami” purposefully assumed all the “authority” for the\ncase, which the immediate supervisor regarded as “highly unusual.’”>?\n\nBy late August 2oo6, Villafafia and the FBI had identified several additional victims and\nobtained “some flight manifests, telephone messages, and cell phone records that shou the\ncommunication and travel in interstate commerce” by Epstein and his associates. Villafafia\nreported to her supervisors that the State Atorney’s Office would not provide transcripts from the\nstate grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convince him to\nrelinquish the evidence to the FBI.” Villafafia also told her supervisors that she expected “a\nnumber of fights” over her document demands, and that some parties were refusing to comply\n“after having contact with Epstein or his atorneys.”\n\nVillafafia’s <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to anticipated “fights” and lack of compliance led Sloman to ask\nwhether she was referring to the victims. Villafafia responded that the problems did not involve\nvictims, but rather a former employee of Epstein and some business entities that had objected to\ndocument demands as overly burdensome. Villafafia explained to Sloman and Lourie that some\nvictims were “scared and/or embarrassed,” and some had been intimidated by the defense, but\n“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.” Villafafia\na8 On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafafia had not yet briefed about the case, noting that\nOperation Leap Year was “a highly sensitive case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”\n\n29 During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was\nlikely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some\ntype of relationship between somebody in the [State Atorney’s Office] and the defense team.”\nag After Villafafia sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her immediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman,\nand Acosta on August 23, 2oo6, Lourie emailed Sloman: “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the\ncase?” Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care. If Alex says something then I'll tell her to just run it\nthrough you guys.”\n3l OPR understood “Miami” to be a <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to the senior managers who were located in the Miami office,\nthat is, Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel. Records shou, and Villafafia told OPR, that she believed Epstein’s atorneys\n“made a conscious decision to skip” her immediate supervisor and directed their communications to the supervisory\nchain above the immediate supervisor—Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta.\n\n2l\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l22l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021228.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document Na 3536o38, Paged6 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 54 of 348\nthe FBI squad supervisor on May 9, 2oo7, to explain that charges against Epstein would not be\nquickly approved, he reported to Menchel that the FBI was “not happy” about the delay, adding,\n“T did not even tell them I think we should bring [Epstein] in, once we decide to charge him, and\noffer a pre-indictment deal, figuring a judge might never agree to such a deal post indictment. That\nwould have sent them thru the roof.” Lourie explained to OPR that he thought a judge, after seeing\nan indictment charging the full nature and scope of Epstein’s conduct, might not agree to a plea\ninvolving substantially less time or to dismiss substantive charges. *!\n\nLourie told OPR that despite Oosterban’s favorable opinion of the case, “[t]his was... a\nbit of uncharted territory,” involving facts that were unlike the case law Oosterban had cited.\nAlthough Lourie had some concerns about the legal issues and about the witnesses, he “probably”\ndid not see any impediment to going forward with the case; in fact, Lourie “was not in favor of\nwalking away, which is what the defense wanted [the USAO] to do.” But while Lourie “thought\nwe could have won and we could have prevailed through appeal,” he “didn’t think the odds were\nnearly as good as you want in a criminal case, and . . . the things that we had to gain [through a\nplea agreement] were much more than [in] a normal criminal case,” in which the only cost of a\nloss would be that the defendant did not go to jail. Lourie told OPR that to the best of his\nrecollection, he thought a plea agreement would be a good result, and although the government\nmight have to “give up some jail time,” there were other benefits to a plea, such as the ability to\nrequire Epstein to register as a sex offender and the availability of monetary damages for the\nvictims. Lourie recalled “thinking that this case should setle and we should set it up so we can\nsetle it” by, for example, charging Epstein by complaint and then negotiating a plea to limited\ncharges in a criminal information. Villafafia told OPR that she agreed with Lourie that a criminal\ncomplaint charging an “omnibus conspiracy” containing “all of the information related to what the\ncase was about” would be a good way to “get things moving” touard a pre-indictment plea.\n\nAlthough Lourie and Villafafia believed a pre-indictment plea agreement was a desired\nresolution, there was no guarantee that Epstein would agree to plead guilty, and they continued to\nwork together to shape an indictment. On May lo, 2oo7, Lourie emailed Villafafia:\n\n[M]arie\n\nI believe that Epstein’s at[orneys] are scared of the victims they\n\ndon’t knou. Epstein has no doubt told them that there were many.\n\nThus I believe the f[ir]st indictment should contain only the victims\n\nthey have nothing on at all.

Thoughts?”\nee Lourie explained to OPR that the government’s dismissal of counts in an indictment required the court’s\napproval, and that, while “it’s rare,” it was possible that a judge, seeing the nature and extent of Epstein’s conduct as\nset forth in an extensive indictment, might not allou substantive counts to be dismissed.\n42 Lourie’s references to MySpace pages and “prior testimony” referred to the impeachment information\nbrought forward by defense counsel.\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l228\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021249.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document eye, ae 3536o38, Page/7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 75 of 348\nVillafafia, Menchel left the meeting after almost no discussion, leaving Villafafia “shocked and\nstunned.”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall the July 26, 2oo7 meeting. Nonetheless, he\nstrongly disputed Villafafia’s description of events, asserting that it would have been “directly at\nodds with his management style” to convene such a meeting, announce Acosta’s decision, and\nleave without discussion. Acosta told OPR that he had “decided and endorsed this resolution at\nsome point,” but he did not recall being aware that Menchel was going to announce the decision\nat the July 26 meeting; in addition, although Acosta did not recall the circumstances of Menchel’s\nrelaying of that decision, he said it “would have been consistent with” his decision for Menchel to\ndo so. Neither Sloman nor Lourie recalled the meeting. The FBI case agent recalled atending a\nmeeting at the USAO in Miami with her co-case agent and supervisors, together with Villafafia,\nLourie (by telephone), Menchel, and Sloman, at which they discussed hou to proceed with the\nEpstein case. According to the case agent, at this meeting the FBI insisted that Epstein be\nregistered for life as a sexual offender, and the co-case agent advocated for waiting until the court\nhad ruled on the USAO’s ability to obtain Epstein’s computer equipment.\n\nRegardless of exactly hou Acosta’s decision regarding the two-year term was\ncommunicated to Villafafia and the FBI agents, and regardless of who initially proposed the\nspecific term, the record shous that Acosta ultimately made the decision to offer Epstein a\nresolution that included a two-year term of imprisonment, as he acknouledged. ”\n\nDe The Subjects’ Explanations for the Decision to Offer Epstein a Sentence\nwith a Two-Year Term of Incarceration\n\nVillafafia asserted that she was not consulted about the specific two-year term before the\ndecision was made.”” Villafafia told OPR that she had worked hard to develop a strong case, and\nnone of her supervisors had identified to her any specific problem with the case that, in her view,\nexplained the decision to extend an offer for a two-year sentence. Villafafia also told OPR that\nMenchel provided no explanation for this decision during the July 26, 2oo7 meeting, and Villafafia\ndid not ask for an explanation because she accepted his statement that it was Acosta’s decision.\nVillafafia described the proposal as “random,” and told OPR, “[W]e’re all [sentencing] guidelines\npeople, so 24 months just makes no sense in the context of the guidelines. There’s no way to get\nto 24 months with this set of offenses.”°°\n78 OPR notes that Villafafia did not appear hesitant to send emails to her supervisors seting forth her views and\nobjections, and there is no <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> before this meeting in any of her emails indicating that a decision had been made\nto offer a two-year term of incarceration. Therefore, given that a meeting had been arranged involving Menchel and\nVillatfafia, and possibly most of the other primary USAO and FBI participants, it seems logical that Acosta made a\ndecision to resolve the case with a two-year state plea not long before the meeting.\n\na OPR found no evidence in the documentary record indicating that Villafafia had knouledge of Acosta’s\ndecision or the two-year term before the July 26, 2oo7 meeting at which she said she learned of it.\n4a From the time the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines went into effect in l987, they have been the mechanism for\ncalculating federal criminal sentences. Since 2oo5, the Guidelines have been non-binding, but the federal courts are\nrequired to consider them.

He specified that “a\ntwo-year term of sfafe imprisonment” was the minimum sentence that would satisfy the federal\ninterest in the case. (Emphasis added.) With regard to the option of a federal plea, Menchel wrote\nthat the USAO “would be willing to explore a federal conviction” and retained the <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to a\nRule ll(c) plea. Menchel also removed the <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to the specific state offenses to which Epstein\nwould be required to plead guilty. Menchel forwarded the redraft to Acosta, suggesting that they\nspeak about it the next morning, as well as to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia.\n\nThe final leter, as shoun on the follouing pages, was identical to Menchel’s redraft, except\nthat it omited all <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to a federal plea under Rule ll(c).”!\noO Menchel told OPR that he did not disfavor Rule ll(c) pleas but knew that the USAO believed the judges\nwere generally averse to them.

In a September 6, 2oo7 email, Villafafia told Sloman that she and Menchel had discussed a\nRule ll(c) plea, but she opined that Menchel “must have asked Alex about it and it was nixed.” Villafafia told OPR\nthat Lourie, too, had told her Acosta did not want to do a Rule ll(c) plea.\n\n56\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l256\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021270.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document E96 3536o38, Page98 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 96 of 348\nevidence of a violation of the agreement. Epstein and his counsel\nagree that the computers that are currently under [legal process] will\nbe safeguarded in their current condition by Epstein’s counsel or\ntheir agents until the terms and conditions of the Agreement are\n\nfulfilled.\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a lengthy email to convey two options Lourie had\nsuggested: “the original proposal” for a state plea but with an agreement for an l8-month sentence,\nor pleas to state charges and two federal obstruction-of-justice charges. Villafafia also told\nLefkouitz she was willing to ask Acosta again to approve a federal plea to a five-year conspiracy\nwith a Rule ll(c) binding recommendation for a 2o-month sentence. Villafafia explained:\n\nAs to timing, it is my understanding that Mr. Epstein needs to be\nsentenced in the state after he is sentenced in the federal case, but\nnot that he needs to plead guilty and be sentenced after serving his\nfederal time. Andy recommended that some of the timing issues be\naddressed only in the state agreement, so that it isn’t obvious to the\njudge that we are trying to create federal jurisdiction for prison\npurposes.\n\nWith regard to prosecution of individuals other than Epstein, Villafafia suggested standard\nfederal plea agreement language regarding the resolution of all criminal liability, “and I will\nmention ‘co-conspirators,’ but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes\nand all of the other persons that we could charge.” Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to\ninclude a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-conspirators, who at the time she understood\nto be the four women named in the proposed agreement, because the USAO was not interested in\nprosecuting those individuals if Epstein entered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, “[W]e considered\nEpstein to be the top of the food chain, and we wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone\nelse.” She did not consider the possibility that Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed.\nindividuals, and no one, including the FBI case agents, raised that concern. Villafafia also told\nOPR that her <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to “all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge”\nrelated to her concern that if the plea agreement contained information about uncharged conduct,\nthe court might ask for more information about that conduct and inquire why it had not been\ncharged, and if the government provided such information, Epstein’s atorneys might claim the\nagreement was breached.'l3\n\nWith regard to immigration, Villafafia told OPR that the USAO generally did not take any\nposition in plea agreements on immigration issues, and that in this case, there was no evidence that\neither of the two assistants who were foreign nationals had commited fraud in connection with\ntheir immigration paperwork, “and I think that they were both in status. So there wasn’t any reason\nl3 OPR understood Villafafia’s concern to be that if the government were required to respond to a court’s inquiry\ninto additional facts, Epstein would object that the government was trying to cast him in a negative light in order to\ninfluence the court to impose a sentence greater than the agreed-upon term.\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l27o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021281.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lo7 3536o38, Pagelo9 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo7 of 348\nfederal court. Sloman similarly said that he had the impression that the non-prosecution provision\nwas meant to protect named co-conspirators who were also victims, “in a sense,” of Epstein’s\nconduct. Although later press coverage of the Epstein case focused on Epstein’s connection to\nprominent figures and suggested that the non-prosecution provision protected these individuals,\nSloman told OPR that it never occurred to him that the <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to potential co-conspirators was\ndirected touard any of the high-profile individuals who were at the time or subsequently linked\nwith Epstein.!?° Acosta did not recall the provision or any discussions about it. He speculated\nthat if he read the non-prosecution provision, he likely assumed that Villafafia and Lourie had\n“thought this through” and “addressed it for a reason.” The West Palm Beach manager, who had\nonly limited involvement at this stage, told OPR that the provision was “highly unusual,” and he\nhad “no clue” why the USAO agreed to it.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, apart from the women named in the NPA, the investigation had\nnot developed evidence of “any other potential co-conspirators. So, ... we wouldn’t be\nprosecuting anybody else, so why not include it? ... I just didn’t think that there was anybody\nthat it would cover.” She conceded, houever, that she “did not catch the fact that it could be read\nas broadly as people have since read it.”\n\nK. The USAO Rejects Defense Efforts to Eliminate the Sexual Offender\n\nRegistration Requirement\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, State Atorney Krischer informed\nVillafafia that Epstein’s counsel had contacted him and Epstein was ready to agree “to all the\nterms” of the NPA—except for sexual offender registration. According to Krischer, defense\ncounsel had proposed that registration be deferred, and that Epstein register only if state or federal\nlaw enforcement felt, at any point during his service of the sentence, that he needed to do so.\nKrischer noted that he had “reached out” to Acosta about this proposal but had not heard back\nfrom him. Villafafia responded, “I think Alex is calling you nou.” Villafafia told OPR that, to her\nknouledge, Acosta called Krischer to tell him that registration was not a negotiable term. !”°\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia emailed Krischer for information about the amount of “gain\ntime” Epstein would earn in state prison. Villafafia explained in her email that she wanted to\ninclude a provision in the NPA specifying that Epstein “will actually be in jail at least a certain\nnumber of days to make sure he doesn’t try to ‘convince’ someone with the Florida prison\nauthorities to let him out early.” Krischer responded that under the proposal as it then stood,\nEpstein would serve l5 months. He also told Villafafia that a plea to a registrable offense would\nnot prevent Epstein from serving his time “at the stockade”— the local minimum security detention\nfacility. !?”\nls Sloman also pointed out that the NPA was not a “global resolution” and other co-conspirators could have\nbeen prosecuted “by any other [U.S. Atorney’s] office in the country.”\n\nl28 Krischer told OPR that he did not recall meeting or having interactions with Acosta regarding the Epstein\ncase or any other mater.\nWa The State Atorney concluded his email: “Glad we could get this worked out for reasons I won’t put in\nwriting. After this is resolved I would love to buy you a cup at Starbucks and have a conversation.” Villafafia\nresponded, “Sounds great.” When asked about this exchange during her OPR interview, Villafafia said: “Everybody\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l28l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021284.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONTOS 3536o38, Pagell2 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page llo of 348\nThe parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part of\nany public record.

SEPTEMBER 24, 2oo7; ACOSTA MAKES FINAL EDITS, AND THE NPA IS\n\nSIGNED\n\nThe contemporaneous emails shou that Villafafia continued to update Acosta as the parties\nnegotiated the final language and that Acosta reviewed and edited the NPA. Shortly after midnight\non Monday, September 24, 2oo7, Acosta sent Villafafia “[s]mall edits” to the “final” NPA she had\nsent to him. Among his changes was language modifying provisions that appeared to require the\nState Atorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein\nenter his guilty plea by a certain date. Acosta explained in his email, “I’m not comfortable with\nrequiring the State Atorney to enter into a [joint sentencing] recommendation” or “requiring a\nState court to stick with our timeline” for entry of the guilty plea and sentencing. Accordingly,\nAcosta substituted language that required Epstein alone to make a binding sentencing\nrecommendation to the state court, and required Epstein to use his “best efforts” to enter his guilty\nplea and be sentenced by the specified dates. Acosta also instructed Villafafia to restore a <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span>\nto Epstein’s wish “to reach a global resolution of his state and federal criminal liabilities.” Lourie,\nwho had returned to the Department in Washington, D.C., had a phone conversation with\nLefkouitz and sent additional comments on the final draft to Acosta and Villafafia. Villafafia sent\na new revision, incorporating edits from Acosta and Lourie, to Lefkouitz later that morning.\n\nOn the afternoon of September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia circulated the new “final” version of\nthe NPA to Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other supervisors, and asked Lefkouitz to send her the\nsigned agreement. After Lefkouitz electronically transmited to Villafafia a copy of the NPA\nsigned by Epstein, she emailed her immediate supervisor and her co-counsel: “They have scanned.\nand emailed the signed agreement.

The next day, Villafafia sent to Acosta and Sloman a local newspaper article\nreporting that Epstein’s state plea hearing was reset for March and in exchange for it the federal\nauthorities would drop their investigation of him.

January 7, 2oo8: Acosta and Sloman Meet with Sanchez, Who Makes\n\nAdditional Allegations of USAO Misconduct\n\nOn January 7, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman met with defense atorney Sanchez at her request.\nAccording to meeting notes made by Sloman, among other things, Sanchez alleged that the\nUSAO’s media spokesperson had improperly disclosed details of the Epstein case to a national\nnews reporter, and Sanchez “suggested that the USAO could avoid any potential ugliness in DC\nby agreeing to a watered-doun resolution for Epstein.” After Acosta excused himself to atend\nanother meeting and Sloman refused to speak further with Sanchez “without a witness present,”\nshe left. Later that day, Acosta and Sloman spoke by phone with Starr, Lefkouitz, and Sanchez,\nwho expressed concern about the “leak” to the news media, reiterated their objections to the NPA,\nand pressed for the “watered-doun resolution,” which they specified would mean allouing Epstein\nto plead to a charge of coercion instead of procurement, avoid serving time in jail, and not register\nas a sexual offender. A note in the margin of Sloman’s handwriten notes of the conversation\nreads: “We’re back to where we started in September.”\n\nThat evening, Villafafia expressed concern that the delay in resolving the mater was\naffecting the USAO’s ability to go forward with a prosecution should Epstein renege on his\nagreement, and she outlined for Acosta and Sloman the steps she proposed to take while Epstein\nwas pursuing Departmental review. Those steps included re-establishing contact with victims,\ninterviewing victims in New York and one victim who lived in a foreign country, making contact\nwith “potential sources of information” in the Virgin Islands, and re-initiating proceedings to\nobtain Epstein’s computers.\n\nIn the meantime, USAO Criminal Division Chief Robert Senior performed a “soup to nuts”\nreview of the Epstein investigation, reviewing the indictment package and all of the evidence\nVillafafia had compiled.

June 3o, 2oo8: Epstein Enters His Guilty Pleas in State Court\n\nEpstein, with his atorney Jack Goldberger, appeared in Palm Beach County court on\nJune 3o, 2oo8, and entered guilty pleas to the indictment charging him with one felony count of\nsolicitation of prostitution and to a criminal information charging him with one felony count of\nprocurement of a minor to engage in prostitution.’”* At the plea hearing, which Villafafia and the\nFBI case agent atended as spectators, Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek did not proffer the facts\nof the case; instead she only recited the charging language in the indictment and the criminal\ninformation:\n\n[B]etween August l, 2oo4 and October 3l, 2oo5, the defendant in\n\nPalm Beach County did solicit or procure someone to commit\n\n[prostitution] on three or more occasions.

The history of the litigation and issues relating to it are discussed in\nChapter Three of this Report.\n\nB. Epstein Is Placed on Work Release\n\nA few days after Epstein’s guilty plea, Villafafia reported to Sloman that Epstein was\nincarcerated at the lou-security Stockade, rather than the Main Detention Center where county\nprisoners were usually housed. She also told Sloman that according to the Sheriff’s Office, Epstein\nwas eligible for work release. Although the USAO had made clear that it expected Epstein to be\nincarcerated 24 hours a day, every day, the subject of work release had not been addressed\nexplicitly during the NPA negotiations, and the NPA itself was silent on the issue. Epstein’s\nacceptance into the work release program as a convicted sexual offender was seen by many as\nanother special benefit given to Epstein. Because the decision to allou Epstein into the work\nrelease program was made by the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office, OPR did not investigate whether\nany state, county, or Sheriff’s Office rules were violated. OPR did examine the USAO’s\nconsideration of work release prior to signing the NPA and its subsequent unsuccessful efforts to\nensure that Epstein remained incarcerated 24 hours a day.\n\nThe first specific <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to work release was made weeks after the NPA was signed,\nwhen Lefkouitz asserted, in his October 23, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, that, “so long as Mr. Epstein’s\nsentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the [NPA] he is entitled to any type of sentence\navailable to him, including but not limited to gain time and work release.”\n\nIn November 2oo7, Sloman had an exchange of leters with Lefkouitz about the USAO’s\nunderstanding that Epstein had agreed to serve his full jail term in “continuous confinement,”\npointing out that the NPA “clearly indicates that Mr. Epstein is to be incarcerated.” Sloman noted\nthat Florida’s Department of Corrections’s rules did not allou individuals registered as sexual\noffenders to participate in work release, and thus Epstein would not be eligible for a work release\nprogram. Sloman concluded that the USAO “is puting you on notice that it intends to make certain\nthat Mr. Epstein is ‘treated no beter and no worse than anyone else’ convicted of the same\noffense,” and that if Epstein were to be granted work release, the USAO would “investigate the\nreasons why an exception was granted in Mr. Epstein’s case.”!78\n\nHouever, also in November, State Atorney Krischer told Sloman that Epstein was, in fact,\neligible to petition for work release because his sexual offender registration would not take place\nce Leter from R.

APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nA, The United States Atorneys’ Manual\n\nAmong its many provisions, the United States Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) includes\ngeneral statements of principles that summarize appropriate considerations to be weighed, and\ndesirable practices to be folloued, by federal prosecutors when discharging their prosecutorial\nresponsibilities.'8? The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. [d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\nenforcement responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\nprosecutions.\n\nl. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a\nFederal Prosecution\n\nFederal prosecutors do not open a case on every mater referred to them. USAM § 9-2.o2o\nexplicitly authorizes a U.S. Atorney “to decline prosecution in any case referred directly to\n£88 In 2ol8, the USAM was revised and reissued as the Justice Manual.

Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.”?’? Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' | The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> was made in the context of a\n2o8 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\na Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l342\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021343.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l69 3536o38, Pagel7l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l69 of 348\n\nnarrative of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s\nassociation to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the\ndefense argument that the mater should be left entirely to the state’s discretion.?’” The defense\nsubmission to the Deputy Atorney General contained a direct <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to Epstein’s connection\nto former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and\nsigned, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his\nassociation with the former President.?”°\n\n2. The Subjects Asserted That They Were Motivated by Reasonable\n\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\n\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natorneys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at .. . hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.7‘4 OPR also\n2l2 In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all five subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have joined with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l343\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021347.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONT 3536o38, Pagel7/5 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l73 of 348\nd[id]n’t want to have to relive what happened to them.””!’ The co-case agent told OPR that one\nof the “strategies” for dealing with the victims’ fear was “to keep them off the stand,” and he\ngenerally remembered discussions about resolving the Epstein case in a way that protected the\nvictims’ identities. In addition, the CEOS Trial Atorney who briefly worked with Villafafia on\nthe case after the NPA was signed told OPR that in her meetings with some of the victims, she\nformed the impression that they were not interested in the prosecution going forward. The CEOS\nTrial Atorney told OPR that “[the victims] would have testified,” but would have required an\nextensive amount of “victim management” because they were “deeply embarrassed” about\npotentially being labeled as prostitutes. The CEOS Trial Atorney also told OPR that “there were\nobvious weaknesses in the case,” from an evidentiary perspective.”®\n\nThe contemporaneous records also reflect discussions of, or references to, various legal\nand factual issues or other concerns about the case. For example, in an early email to Menchel,\nLourie noted that two key issues raised by Villafafia’s proposed charges were whether the USAO\ncould prove that Epstein traveled for the purpose of engaging in sex acts, and the fact that some\nminor victims had told Epstein they were l8. He later opined to Acosta and Menchel that “there\nis some risk on some of the statutes [proposed in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum] as this is\nuncharted territory to some degree.” In his July 5, 2oo7 email to Villafafia, Menchel cited Acosta’s\nand Sloman’s “concerns about taking this case because of [the P]etit policy and a number of legal\nissues” and Acosta’s concerns about “hurting Project Safe Childhood.” Defense counsel raised\nmyriad legal and factual challenges in their voluminous leters to the USAO. Defense submissions\natacked the legal theories for a federal prosecution and detailed factors that could have\nundermined victims’ credibility, including victim statements favorable to Epstein and evidence of\nvictim drug and alcohol use, as well as the fact that some victims recruited other victims and\npurportedly lied to Epstein about their ages.\n\nAcosta also recalled that although his “team” had expressed concern about the “trial\nissues,” his oun focus had been on “the legal side of things.” Notably, during his prior tenure as\nthe Assistant Atorney General in charge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, Acosta had\nbeen involved in efforts to address sex trafficking. He told OPR that one of the “background\nissues” that the Civil Rights Division addressed under his leadership, and which influenced his\nview of the Epstein case, was the distinction between sex trafficking and solicitation of\nprostitution. Specifically, he was concerned about avoiding the creation of potentially unfavorable\nfederal precedent on the point of delineation between prostitution, which was traditionally a mater\nof state concern, and sex trafficking, which remained a developing area of federal interest in\n2oo7.7!\n\n2l7 In an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, the co-case agent noted that in early 2oo7, when he located a\nvictim living outside of the United States, she claimed only to “knou Jeffrey Epstein,” and stated that she “moved\naway to distance herself from this situation,” and “asked that [the agent] not bother her with this again.”\n\n2l8 In April 2oo7, a victim who was represented by an atorney paid by Epstein participated in a video-recorded\ninterview with the FBI, with her atorney and his investigator present. This victim denied being involved in, or being\na victim of, criminal activity. Later, the victim obtained new counsel and joined the CVRA litigation as “Jane Doe #2.”\n2l9 In his March 2o, 2oll leter, addressed “To whom it may concern,” and published online in The Daily Beast,\nAcosta described “a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors” by “an army of legal superstars.” Most\nof the allegations made against the prosecutors occurred after the NPA was signed and certainly after Acosta approved\n\nl47\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l347\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021363.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l89 | 3536o38, Pagel9l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l89 of 348\nsentence of incarceration, and the USAO would consider a plea that differed from that requirement\na breach of the NPA and would “proceed accordingly.”\n\nThe guilty plea Epstein entered in state court in June 2oo8 was consistent with the dictates\nof the NPA, and pursuant to that plea, the court imposed a sentence of l8 months’ incarceration.\nEpstein, houever, applied for and was accepted into the work release program, and was able to\nserve a substantial portion of his sentence outside of the jail. The NPA did not <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> work\nrelease nor authorize Epstein to receive such benefits during his tenure at the Palm Beach County\nStockade. Moreover, Villafafia received assurances from defense counsel that Epstein would serve\nhis entire sentence of confinement “in custody.” Responsibility for the decision to afford Epstein\nwork release privileges during his incarceration rested with state officials, who had the sole\nauthority for administering the work release program.\n\nAfter considering the substantial record documenting the decisions made after Acosta’s\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, OPR found nothing in the record to suggest\nthat the meeting resulted in a material change to the NPA, affected the sentence Epstein served\npursuant to the NPA, or contributed to state officials’ decision to permit him to participate in work\nrelease.\n\nF. Villafaia’s Emails with Defense Atorney Lefkouitz during the NPA\n\nNegotiations Do Not Establish That Villafaia, or Other Subjects, Intended to\nGive Epstein Preferential Treatment or Were Motivated by Favoritism or\nOther Improper Influences\n\nDuring the CVRA litigation, the petitioners obtained from Epstein’s atorney, and filed\nunder seal, a redacted series of email exchanges between Epstein atorney Lefkouitz and Villafafia\n(and others with Acosta and Sloman) during September 2oo7 when the NPA was being finalized,\nand thereafter. These emails had been redacted to delete most of Lefkouitz’s side of the\ncommunications, and consequently they did not reflect the full context of Villafafia’s\ncommunications to Lefkouitz. The redacted emails were later unsealed and made public over\nEpstein’s objections.7°° Media coverage pointed to the content and tone of Villafafia’s emails as\nproof that Villafafia and the USAO worked in concert with Epstein’s atorneys to keep the\n“sweetheart” deal a secret from the victims and the public. Statements in several emails in\nparticular were cited as evidence of the USAO’s improper favoritism touards Epstein. In one\nexample, Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she was willing to include in the NPA a provision agreeing\nnot to prosecute others, but would “prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and\nall of the other persons that we could charge.” She also offered to meet with him “‘off campus’”\nto finalize negotiations. She also proposed, “‘[o]n an ‘avoid the press’ note,” that filing federal\ncharges against Epstein in Miami rather than West Palm Beach would substantially reduce press\ncoverage.\n\n236 The USAO did not object to the unsealing but requested additional redactions of portions that would reveal\nprotected information.

In a subsequent email about the draft NPA, Villafafia asked Lourie for\n“Ta]ny other thoughts,” but there is no indication that he provided further input. OPR found no\ndocument that suggested Villafafia and Lourie discussed the provision further, or that the other\nindividuals who were copied on Villafafia’s email referencing the provision—her immediate\nsupervisor, the supervisor designated to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office,\nand Villafafia’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it. Villafafia told\nOPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her observation that the non-\nprosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafafia assumed that they agreed with her assessment.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision\nagreeing not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that\ndefense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame\nfor what happened.” Villafafia told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct\nwas his oun “dirty litle secret.” Villafafia said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2oo6\narrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that\nnone of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators\nabout sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-knoun contacts about whom allegations arose\nmany years later.”3° Villafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime\nrelationship with a close female friend who was a well-knoun socialite, but, according to\nVillafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.””*? Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the\nfour female assistants identified by name.”*° Villafafia also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s\ninvestigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to prosecute his four assistants if he\nentered a plea.**! Because Villafafia was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged,\nshe perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to prosecute other, unspecified\n“co-conspirators.” Villafafia told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did\nnot occur to her that the <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any\nof Epstein’s influential associates.\n\nLourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the\ntime Villafafia forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR\nthat he did not knou hou the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.\n238 Villafafia told OPR that “none of... the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being\ninvolved in abusing them. It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\n239 The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct\ninvolving the then minor did not occur in Florida.\n\nas) The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one\ngirl in Epstein’s presence; this assistant was one of the named individuals for whom the defense sought the\ngovernment’s agreement not to prosecute from the outset. Villafafia explained to OPR that this individual was herself\nbelieved to also have been at one time a victim.\n\neal Villatafia told OPR that the USAO had decided that girls who recruited other girls would not be prosecuted.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l367\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021368.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l94 3536o38, Pagel96 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l94 of 348\n\nLourie described the promise not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators” as “unusual,” and told\nOPR that he did not knou why it was included in the agreement, but added that it would be “unlike\nme if I read that language to just leave it in there unless I thought it was somehou helpful.” Lourie\nposited that victims who recruited other underage girls to provide massages for Epstein\n“theoretically” could have been charged as co-conspirators. He told OPR that when he saw the\nprovision, he may have understood the <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to unnamed “co-conspirators” as “a message to\nany victims that had recruited other victims that there was no intent to charge them.”\n\nAcosta did not recall any discussions about the non-prosecution provision. But he told\nOPR that Epstein was always “the focus” of the federal investigation, and he would have viewed\nthe federal interests as vindicated as long as Epstein was required to face “meaningful\nconsequences” for his actions. Acosta told OPR that when he reviewed the draft NPA, “[t]o the\nextent I reviewed this co-conspirator provision, I can speculate that my thinking would have been\nthe focus is on Epstein[ |]... going to jail. Whether some of his employees go to jail, or other,\nlesser involved [individuals], is not the focus of this.” Acosta also told OPR that he assumed\nVillafafia and Lourie had considered the provision and decided that it was appropriate. Finally,\nSloman, who was not involved in negotiating the NPA, told OPR that in retrospect, he understood\nthe non-prosecution provision was designed to protect Epstein’s four assistants, and it “never\ndawned” on him that it was intended to shield anyone else.\n\nThis broad provision promising not to prosecute ‘any potential co-conspirators” is\ntroubling and, as discussed more fully later in this Report, OPR did not find evidence shouing that\nthe subjects gave careful consideration to the potential scope of the provision or whether it was\nwarranted given that the investigation had been curtailed and the USAO lacked complete\ninformation regarding possible co-conspirators. Villafafia precipitously revised a more narrou\nprovision sought by the defense. Given its evolution from a provision sought by the defense, it\nappears unlikely to have been designed to protect the victims, and there is no indication that at the\ntime, the subjects believed that was the purpose. Houever, the USAO had not indicated interest\nin prosecuting anyone other than the four named female assistants, and OPR found no record\nindicating that Epstein had expressed concern about the prosecutive fate of anyone other than the\nfour assistants and unnamed employees of a specific Epstein company. Accordingly, OPR\nconcludes that the evidence does not shou that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia agreed to the non-\nprosecution provision to protect any of Epstein’s political, celebrity, or other influential\nassociates.?”\n\nH. OPR’s Investigation Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing That Epstein\n\nCooperated in Other Federal Investigations or Received Special Treatment on\nThat Basis\n\nOne final issue OPR explored stemmed from media reports suggesting that Epstein may\nhave received special treatment from the USAO in return for his cooperation in another federal\nae As previously stated, Sloman was on vacation when Villafafia included the provision in draft plea agreements\nand did not monitor the case or comment on the various iterations of the NPA that were circulated during his absence.\nMenchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7, before the parties drafted the NPA.\n\nl68\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l368\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021369.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON OS 3536o38, Pagel97 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l95 of 348\ninvestigation.”47 Media reports in mid-2oo9 suggested Epstein was released from his state\nincarceration “early” because he was assisting in a financial crimes investigation in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns. At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of” Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no cooperation” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“intelligence asset.”?*\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “intelligence asset,” or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\ncooperation in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or consideration\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\nans See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\n\n24 When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss intelligence information.\nl69\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l369\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021372.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l98 3536o38, Page2oo of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l98 of 348\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind... . the\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the []state.. .\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\n\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\n\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein\nwould have become final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. In\nAcosta’s view, “the federal responsibility” in this unique situation was merely to serve as a “back-\nstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no miscarriage of justice.”*’ Acosta told OPR\nthat he understood the PBPD would not have brought Epstein to the FBI’s atention if the State\nAtorney had pursued charges that required Epstein’s incarceration. Acosta therefore decided that\nthe USAO could avert a “manifest injustice” by forcing the state to do more and require Epstein\nto serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender.\n\nAcosta’s reasoning was flawed and unduly constricted. Acosta’s repeated references to a\n“miscarriage of justice” or “manifest injustice” echoes the “manifestly inadequate” language used\nin the Petite policy to define the circumstances in which the federal government may proceed with\na criminal case after a completed state prosecution. Nothing in the Petite policy, houever, requires\nsimilar restraint when the federal government pursues a case in the absence of a completed state\nprosecution, even if the state is already investigating the same offense. The goal of the Petite\npolicy is to prevent multiple prosecutions for the same offense, not to compel the federal\ngovernment to defer to a parallel state interest in a case, particularly one in which state officials\ninvolved in the state prosecution expressed significant concerns about it, and there were questions\nregarding the state prosecutor’s commitment to the case. Acosta told OPR that “there are any\nnumber of instances where the federal government or the state government can proceed, and state\ncharges are substantially less and different, and . . . the federal government . . . stands aside and\nlets the state proceed.” The fact that the federal government can allou the state to proceed with a\nprosecution, houever, does not mean the federal government is compelled to do so, particularly in\na mater in which a distinct and important federal interest exists. Indeed, the State Atorney told\nOPR that the federal government regularly takes over cases initiated by state investigators,\ntypically because federal charges result in “the best sentence.”\n\nEpstein was facing a substantial sentence under the federal sentencing guidelines.”**\nDespite the Ashcroft Memo’s directive that federal prosecutors pursue “the most serious readily\nprovable offense,” Acosta’s decision to push “the state to do a litle bit more” does not approach\nthat standard. In fact, Acosta conceded during his OPR interview that the NPA did not represent\nan “appropriate punishment” in the federal system, nor even “the best outcome in the state system,”\nand that if the investigation of Epstein had originated with the FBI, rather than as a referral from\nthe PBPD, the outcome might have been different. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to\noth Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\nams Villafafia estimated that the applicable sentencing guidelines range was l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment.\n\nl72\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l372\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021403.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 359 | 3536o38, Page23l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 229 of 348\n\nvarious iterations of the victims’ rights legislation.”**° Villafafia explained to OPR her <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span>\nto the victims:\n\n[M]y concern was that [Menchel] was violating the CVRA which\n\nrequires the atorneys for the government, which[] includes me[,] to\n\nconfer with the victims, and the [VRRA], which requires the agents\n\nto keep the victims apprised of what’s happening with the case.

Perceiving Menchel’s rebuke as a criticism of her judgment, Villafafia\nresponded, “[R]aising concerns about the forgoten voices of victims in this case should not be\nclassified as a lapse in judgment” and that her “first and only concern in this case... is the victims.”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not view his conversation with Sanchez as a plea offer,\nasserted that he was not obligated to consult with victims during preliminary setlement\nnegotiations, and noted that he left the USAO before the NPA was fully negotiated or signed.\nMenchel told OPR that ‘you have discussions . . . with [the] defense all the time, and the notion\nthat even just having a general discussion is something that must be veted with victims . . . is not\neven... in the same universe as to hou I think about this.” Menchel also observed that on the\nvery day that Villafafia criticized him for engaging in setlement negotiations without consulting\nher, the FBI, or the victims, Villafafia had herself sent an email to Sanchez offering “to discuss the\npossibility of a federal resolution of Mr. Epstein’s case that could run concurrently with any state\nresolution,” without having spoken to the victims about her proposal.?*’\n\n28 Villafafia told OPR that “some victims, I felt strongly, would have objected to [a state-only disposition].”\nVillafafia stated to OPR that at the time Menchel engaged in such negotiations, he would only have been aware of the\nvictim information contained in her prosecution memorandum, which included information about the “effects on the\nvictims” but did not likely contain information as to “hou they would like the case resolved.” Villafafia asserted that\nMenchel “never reached out to any of the victims to find out what their position would be.” Menchel told OPR that\nthe allegations in Villafafia’s email that he violated the Ashcroft Memo, USAM, and the CVRA were “way out of line\nin terms of what the law is and the policies are.”\n286 As discussed, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not apply before charges were\nfiled against a defendant.\n287 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel asserted that her email to Sanchez was intended\nonly to determine whether Epstein was interested in opening plea negotiations.\n\n2o3\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021404.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 33o 3536o38, Page232 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23o of 348\n2. Villafafia Asserts That Her Supervisors Gave Instructions Not to\nConsult Victims about the Plea Discussions, but Her Supervisors Do\nNot Currently Recall Such Instructions\nVillafafia told OPR that during an “early” meeting with Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel,\nwhich took place when “we were probably just entering into plea negotiations,” she raised the\ngovernment’s obligation to confer with victims.”** Initially, Villafafia told OPR she was\ninstructed, “Don’t talk to [the victims]. Don’t tell them what’s happening,” but she was not told\nwhy she should not speak to the victims, and she could not recall who gave her this instruction. In\na subsequent OPR interview, Villafafia recalled that when she raised the issue of notification\nduring the meeting, she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential. You can’t disclose them.”?*?\nVillafafia remained uncertain who gave her this instruction, but believed it may have been Acosta.\nNeither Acosta, Sloman, nor Menchel recalled a meeting at which Villafafia was directed\nnot to notify the victims. Acosta told OPR that the decision whether to solicit the victims’ view\n“ig something [that] I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I was focused\non at least at this time,” and he did not “recall discussions about victim notification until after the\nNPA was signed.” Sloman also told OPR that he did not recall a meeting at which victim\nnotification was discussed. Menchel wrote in his response to OPR, “I have no recollection of any\ndiscussions or decisions regarding whether the USAO should notify victims of its intention to enter\ninto a pre-charge disposition of the Epstein mater.” Furthermore, Menchel told OPR he could not\nthink of a reason why the issue of victim notification would have arisen before he left the USAO,\nbecause “we were way off from finalizing or having anything even close to a deal,” and it would\nhave been “premature” to consider notification.?”°\n3. September 6, 2oo7: Villafafia Informs Sloman, Who Informs Acosta,\nof Oosterban’s Opinion That Consultation with Victims Was\nRequired\nOn September 6, 2oo7, in a lengthy email to Sloman responding to his question about the\ngovernment’s then-pending offer to the defense, Villafafia raised the victim consultation issue,\nadvising that, “the agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which as\n[CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law” and that “the [PBPD]\n288 Villafafia could not recall the specific date of the meeting, but Menchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7.\n288 Villafafia also recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations could cause\nvictims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.”\n22o In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel reiterated his contention that Villafafia’s claim\nabout a meeting involving Menchel in which she was instructed not to consult with victims was inaccurate and\ninconsistent with other evidence. OPR carefully considered the comments but did not conclude that the evidence to\nwhich Menchel’s atorney pointed necessarily refuted Villafafia’s assertion that she had received an instruction from\na supervisor not to inform victims about the plea negotiations. Houever, it is also true that OPR did not find any\n<span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> in the emails and other documents dated before the NPA was signed to a meeting at which victim\nconsultation was discussed or to a specific instruction not to consult with the victims. This is one of several events\nabout which Menchel and Villafafia disagreed, but given OPR’s conclusion that the Department did not require\nprosecutors to consult with victims before charges were brought, OPR does not reach a conclusion regarding the\nalleged meeting and instruction.\n2o4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021417.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 343 3536o38, Page245 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 243 of 348\n\ninformed victims “of their right to collect damages prior to a thorough investigation of their\nallegations against Mr. Epstein”:\n\nNone of the victims were informed of the right to sue under\n\nSection 2255 prior to the investigation of the claims.

OPR found no evidence that these leters were sent to Krischer.?”°\n\nA few days later, in an apparent effort to move forward with victim notifications, Villafafia\nemailed Sloman, stating, “[Is there] anything that I or the agents should be doing?” Villafafia told\nSloman that “[the FBI case agent] is all worked up because another agent and [a named AUSA]\nare the subject of an OPR investigation for failing to properly confer with and notify victims [in\nan unrelated mater].

July 2oo8: Villafaia Prepares and Sends a Victim Notification Leter to Listed\nVictims\n\nOn July 8, 2oo8, Villafafia provided Goldberger with an updated victim list for l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 purposes, noting that she had inadvertently left off one individual in her June 3o, 2oo8\nleter. Villafafia also informed the defense that, beginning the follouing day, she would distribute\nnotifications to each of the 32 victims and their counsel informing them that Epstein’s atorney\nwould be the contact for any civil litigation, if the victim decided to pursue damages. Finally, the\nleter informed the defense that the government would consider a denial by Epstein that any “one\nof these victims is entitled to proceed under l8 U.S.C. § 2255” to be considered a breach of the\nterms of the NPA.\n\nAfter exchanging emails and leters with the defense concerning the content of the notice\nleter, Villafafia drafted a leter she sent, on July 9 and lo, to nine victims who had previously\nretained counsel. The leter informed the victims and their counsel that, “[i]n light of’ Epstein’s\nJune 3o, 2oo8 state court plea to felony solicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, and his sentence of a total of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by l2\nmonths’ community control, “the United States has agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of\nthis state plea and sentence, subject to certain conditions.” The leter included a <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 provision of the NPA, and although the defense had never agreed to it, used\nlanguage from Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter to Epstein defense atorney Sanchez clarifying\nthe damages provision. The paragraph belou was described as “[o]ne such condition to which\nEpstein has agreed”:\n\nAny person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an\noffense enumerated in Title l8, United States Code, Section 2255,\nwill have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she\nwould have had, if Mr. Epstein had been tried federally and\nconvicted of an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing\nthis paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein’s\natorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to\nname... as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein.

In addition, the September leter\ndescribed the appointment of a special master, the special master’s selection of an atorney to\nrepresent the victims in their l8 U.S.C. § 2255 litigation against Epstein, and Epstein’s agreement\nto pay the atorney representative’s fees arising out of such litigation. The leter also clarified that\nEpstein’s agreement to pay for atorneys’ fees did not extend to contested litigation against him.\n\nThe government also intended for the leter to comply with the court’s order concerning\nproviding victims with copies of the NPA. The initial draft included a paragraph advising the\nvictims that they could receive a copy of the NPA:\n\nIn addition, a judge has ordered that the United States make\navailable to any designated victim (and/or her atorney) a copy of\nthe actual agreement between Mr. Epstein and the United States, so\nlong as the victim (and/or her atorney) reviews, signs, and agrees to\nbe bound by a Protective Order entered by the Court. If [the victim]\nwould like to review the Agreement, please let me knou, and I will\nforward a copy of the Protective Order for her signature.\n\nThe government shared draft versions of the September leter with Epstein’s counsel and\nresponded to criticism of the content of the proposed leter. For example, in response to the above\nlanguage regarding the August 2l, 2oo8 court order in the CVRA litigation, the defense argued\nthat there was “no court order requiring the government to provide the alleged ‘victims’ with notice\nthat the [NPA] is available to them upon request and doing so is in conflict with the confidentiality\nprovisions of the [NPA].” In response, and in consultation with USAO management, Villafafia\nrevised the paragraph as follous:\n\nIn addition, there has been litigation between the United States and\ntwo other victims regarding the disclosure of the entire agreement\nbetween the United States and Mr. Epstein. [The atorney selected\nby the special master] can provide further guidance on this issue, or\nif you select another atorney to represent you, that atorney can\nreview the Court’s order in the [CVRA litigation].\n\nOn September l8, 2oo9, a state court judge unsealed the copy of the NPA that had been\nfiled in the state case.3””\n\nFb In the leter, Villafafia expressed frustration with defense counsels’ claim relative to the December l9, 2oo7\nleter that was included in the July 2oo8 notification leter, noting that the July 2oo8 leter had been approved by\ndefense counsel before being sent.\n377 See Susan Spencer-Wendel, “Epstein’s Secret Pact With Fed Reveals ‘Highly Unusual’ Terms,” Palm Beach\nPost, Sept. l9, 2oo9.\n24o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l442\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021460.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 384 3536o39, Page3o of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 284 of 348\n\nIn Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel compared the language of the CVRA to the language\nof the VRRA, noting that the VRRA “clearly extends victim-notice rights into the pre-charge\nphase” and opining that the government “may well have violated” the VRRA with regards to its\ninvestigation of Epstein. As a predecessor to the CVRA, the VRRA afforded victims various rights\nand services; houever, it provided no mechanism for a victim to assert such rights in federal court\nor by administrative complaint. Like the CVRA, the rights portion of the VRRA established the\nvictims’ right to be treated with fairness and respect and the right to confer with an atorney for\nthe government. Houever, the rights portion of the VRRA was repealed upon passage of the\nCVRA and was not in effect at the time of the Epstein investigation.\n\nThe portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to provide certain\nvictim services such as counseling and medical care referrals remained in effect follouing passage\nof the CVRA. Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a responsible official\nto “inform a victim of any restitution or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and\nanother requiring that a responsible official “shall provide a victim the earliest possible notice of\nthe status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and\nto the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation”—may have applied to the Epstein\ninvestigation. Houever, the VRRA did not create a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part\nof the subject atorneys, as the 2oo5 Guidelines assigned the duty of enforcing the two\nrequirements to the investigative agency rather than to prosecutors. Moreover, the VRRA did not\nrequire notice to victims before the NPA was signed because, at that point, the case remained\n“under investigation,” and the victims did not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under\nthe NPA until Epstein entered his guilty pleas in June 2oo8. Once Epstein did so, and the victims\nidentified by the USAO became entitled to pursue the § 2255 remedy, the USAO furnished the\nvictims with appropriate notification.\n\nB. OPR Did Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of Consultation Was\n\nIntended to Silence Victims\n\nDuring her OPR interviews, Villafafia recalled more than one discussion in which she\nraised with her supervisors the issue of consulting with the victims before the NPA was signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, houever, had no recollection of\ndiscussions about consulting victims before the NPA was signed, and Menchel disputed\nVillafafia’s assertions. OPR found only one writen <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> before that date, explicitly raising\nthe issue of consultation. Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR was unable to\nconclusively determine whether the lack of consultation stemmed from an affirmative decision\nmade by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about\nthe NPA before it was signed. Villafafia’s recollection suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman\nmay have been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of plea negotiations and did not\nbelieve that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations. OPR\nConduct l.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The holding in Smith\nwas based on Article 47 of the Maryland Constitution and various specific statutes affording victims the nght, among\nothers, to receive various notices and an opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or\ninformation filed in a circuit court.” Houever, both the underlying statutory provisions and, significantly, the facts\nare substantially different from the Epstein investigation. In Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea.\n\n258\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l46o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021461.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 385 3536o39, Page3l of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 285 of 348\ndid not find evidence shouing that the subjects intended to silence victims or to prevent them from\nhaving input into the USAO’s intent to resolve the federal investigation.\n\nAlthough the contemporaneous records provide some information about victim notification\ndecisions made after the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, the records contain litle about\nthe subjects’ views regarding consultation with victims before the NPA was signed. In a\nSeptember 6, 2oo7 email primarily addressing other topics, as the plea negotiations were beginning\nin earnest and almost three weeks before the NPA was signed, Villafafia raised the topic of victim\nconsultation with Sloman: “The agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their\napproval, which as [CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law. . . .\n[A]nd the [PBPD] Chief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.’”*™\nSloman forwarded the email to Acosta with a note stating, “fyi.” Villafafia recalled that after she\nsent the email, Sloman told her by telephone, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.’*° Villafafia also told\nOPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve been advised that . . . pre-\ncharge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Villafafia also recalled a discussion with\nAcosta, Menchel, and Sloman, during which she stated that she would need to get victims’ input\non the terms being proposed to the defense, and she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential.\nYou can’t disclose them.”*°°\n\nNone of the other subjects recalled a specific discussion before the NPA was signed about\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations. Menchel told OPR he believed the USAO was not required to\nconsult with victims during the preliminary “general discussion” phase of setlement negotiations;\nmoreover, he left the USAO before the terms of the NPA were fully developed.\n\nSloman told OPR that he “did not think that we had to consult with victims prior to entering\ninto the NPA” and ‘“‘we did not have to seek approval from victims to resolve a case.” Sloman\nbelieved the USAO was obligated only to notify victims about resolution of “the cases that we\nhandled, filed cases.” Sloman recalled that because the USAO envisioned a state court resolution\nof the mater, he did not “think that that was a concern of ours at the time to consult with [the\nvictims] prior to entering into... the NPA.”\n\nLourie told OPR that he did not recall any discussions about informing the victims about\nthe terms of the NPA or any instructions to Villafafia that she not discuss the NPA with the victims.\nHe stated that everything the USAO did was “‘to try and get the best result as possible for the\nvictims. .. . [O]nce you step back and look at the whole forest .. ., you will see that... . [I]f you\nlook at each tree and say, well, you didn’t do this right for the victim, you didn’t tell the victim\nthis and that, you’re missing the big picture.”\n\n4o4 As noted, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not require consultation with victims\nbecause no criminal charges had been filed. In addition, Villafafia’s <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to victim “approval” was inaccurate\nbecause the CVRA, even when applicable, requires only “consultation” with victims about prosecutorial decisions.\n\n4o5 Villafafia did not recall Sloman explaining the reason for the decision.\n\nlo8 Villatafia also told OPR that she recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations\ncould cause victims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.” Villafafia was\nuncertain of the date of the conversation, but Menchel’s presence requires it to have occurred before August 3, 2oo7.\n\n259\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l46l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021479.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3o3 3536o39, Page49 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o3 of 348\natend the hearing. In his affidavit, Edwards asserted, “[T]here was no possible way I could have\nbelieved that this state plea could affect the federal investigation or the rights of my clients in that\nfederal investigation.”\n\nIn Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel stated that the government “seemingly” deferred to\nEpstein’s atorneys’ requests not to notify the victims about the NPA, and that in sending the\nJanuary and May 2oo8 FBI leters, the government’s efforts “seem to have graduated from passive\nnondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.”*3’ Although both the appellate\ncourt and district court focused on the FBI’s leters for which OPR concludes that neither Villafafia,\nSloman, nor Acosta was responsible, OPR considered the courts’ analyses in evaluating whether\nsimilar representations Villafafia made to the victims whom she interviewed on January 3l and\nFebruary l, 2oo8, and to Edwards, were misleading. Therefore, OPR considered whether\nVillafafia’s statements that the mater was “under investigation” and her failure to inform all of the\nvictims whom she interviewed or Edwards about the NPA violated FRPC 4-4.l(a), 4-8.4(c), or\n4-8.4(d).\n\nFRPC 4-4.l(a) prohibits an atorney from “knouingly mak[ing] a false statement of\nmaterial fact or law to a third person” during the representation of a client. The FRPC defines\n“knouingly” as “denot[ing] actual knouledge of the fact in question” and states that such\nknouledge may be “inferred from circumstances.”*78 The comment to FRPC 4-4.l states that\n“Tml]isrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or omissions that\nare the equivalent of affirmative false statements.” The comment references FRPC 4-8.4 “[flor\ndishonest conduct that does not amount to a false statement.” Like FRPC 4-4.l(a), Rule 4-8.4(c)\nrequires evidence that the atorney knew the statement in question was false. Under FRPC\n4-8.4(c), the intent requirement can be satisfied “merely by shouing that the conduct was\ndeliberate or knouing” and the “motive underlying the lawyer’s conduct is not determinative;\ninstead the issue is whether he or she purposefully acted.”**? In Feinberg, the court concluded that\nthe prosecutor violated FRPC 4-4.l and 4-8.4(c) and (d) by deliberately making untruthful\nstatements to a defense atorney, despite evidence that the prosecutor intended to help the\ndefendant by making the statements.**° In this case, Villafafia was fully aware of the signed NPA\nwhen she interviewed the victims on January 3l and February l, 2oo8, and when she spoke to\nEdwards on the telephone, but she did not inform them specifically of the signed NPA. The\nquestion is whether this omission amounted to a knouing false statement or misrepresentation.\n\nOne difficulty is determining what Villafafia actually said during conversations that\nparticipants were asked to recall many years later. With respect to three of the victims whom she\ninterviewed in January and February 2oo8, Villafafia contended that she discussed the agreement\nwith them, even if she did not specifically refer to it as the NPA or discuss all of its terms, and as\n437 Wild, 955 F.3d at ll99-l2oo.\n\n438 See R.

The Court rejects this argument. The Confrontation Clause guarantees a criminal\ndefendant the right “to be confronted with the witnesses against him.” U.S. Const., amend. VI.\nThe Defendant’s right to confrontation is not implicated here because Juror 5o is not a “witness[]\nagainst” the Defendant but was instead a factfinder in her trial. Simply put, Juror 5o’s testimony\nat the hearing will be proffered to determine whether Juror 5o has engaged in any misconduct\nwarranting a new trial, not to accuse the Defendant of any crime. Cf Crawford v. Washington,\n54l U.S. 36, 43 (2oo4) (describing the Confrontation Clause as a “right to confront one’s\naccusers” (emphasis added)). Even if the Confrontation Clause were implicated, Rule 6o6’s\nprohibition on juror affidavits to impeach a verdict is a reasonable limitation, subject to other\nexceptions not at issue here, on the evidence that a defendant may muster, a limitation with a\nlong historical pedigree. See Pena-Rodriguez, l37 S.

Unlike the plea agreement in Annabi, the NPA originated in the Eleventh\nCircuit. Under textbook choice-of-law rules and principles of fairness, it would be\nunreasonable to graft a unique, pro-prosecution canon of construction, derived from\nthe law of a foreign circuit—this circuit—onto a plea agreement negotiated with\nprosecutors in a circuit where the very opposite rule applies, i.e. that ambiguities in\nplea agreements are to be resolved against the government. Under Eleventh Circuit\nprecedent, even if the <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to “the United States” were deemed ambiguous, the\nambiguity “must be read against the government.’” U.S. v. Jefferies, 9o8 F.2d l52o,\nl523 (llth Cir. l99o) (citing Jn re Arnet, 8o4 F.2d l2oo, l2o3 (llth Cir. l986)); see\nalso Roue v. Griffin, 676 F.2d 524, 526 n.4 (llth Cir. l982). And this result would\nbring the Eleventh Circuit in line with every circuit that has directly confronted this\nquestion (other than the Second Circuit). See Gebbie, 294 F.3d at 55o; Van\nThournout, loo F.3d at 594; Harvey, 79l F.2d at 3o3.\n\nSecond, Annabi should only apply when “the new charges are sufficiently\ndistinct” from the old ones. 77l F.2d at 672.

Sloman similarly said that he had the impression that the non-prosecution provision\nwas meant to protect named co-conspirators who were also victims, “in a sense,” of Epstein’s\nconduct. Although later press coverage of the Epstein case focused on Epstein’s connection to\nprominent figures and suggested that the non-prosecution provision protected these individuals,\nSloman told OPR that it never occurred to him that the <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to potential co-conspirators was\ndirected touard any of the high-profile individuals who were at the time or subsequently linked\nwith Epstein.'”° Acosta did not recall the provision or any discussions about it. He speculated\nthat if he read the non-prosecution provision, he likely assumed that Villafafia and Lourie had\n“thought this through” and “addressed it for a reason.” The West Palm Beach manager, who had\nonly limited involvement at this stage, told OPR that the provision was “highly unusual,” and he\nhad “no clue” why the USAO agreed to it.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, apart from the women named in the NPA, the investigation had\nnot developed evidence of “any other potential co-conspirators. So, . . . we wouldn’t be\nprosecuting anybody else, so why not include it? ... I just didn’t think that there was anybody\nthat it would cover.” She conceded, houever, that she “did not catch the fact that it could be read\nas broadly as people have since read it.”\n\nkK. The USAO Rejects Defense Efforts to Eliminate the Sexual Offender\n\nRegistration Requirement\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, State Atorney Krischer informed\nVillafafia that Epstein’s counsel had contacted him and Epstein was ready to agree “to all the\nterms” of the NPA—except for sexual offender registration. According to Krischer, defense\ncounsel had proposed that registration be deferred, and that Epstein register only if state or federal\nlaw enforcement felt, at any point during his service of the sentence, that he needed to do so.\nKrischer noted that he had “reached out” to Acosta about this proposal but had not heard back\nfrom him. Villafafia responded, “I think Alex is calling you nou.” Villafafia told OPR that, to her\nknouledge, Acosta called Krischer to tell him that registration was not a negotiable term. !*°\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia emailed Krischer for information about the amount of “gain\ntime” Epstein would earn in state prison. Villafafia explained in her email that she wanted to\ninclude a provision in the NPA specifying that Epstein “will actually be in jail at least a certain\nnumber of days to make sure he doesn’t try to ‘convince’ someone with the Florida prison\nauthorities to let him out early.” Krischer responded that under the proposal as it then stood,\nEpstein would serve l5 months. He also told Villafafia that a plea to a registrable offense would\nnot prevent Epstein from serving his time “at the stockade”— the local minimum security detention\nfacility. l?’\n\nl25 Sloman also pointed out that the NPA was not a “global resolution” and other co-conspirators could have\nbeen prosecuted “by any other [U.S. Atorney’s] office in the country.”\n\nl26 Krischer told OPR that he did not recall meeting or having interactions with Acosta regarding the Epstein\ncase or any other mater.\n\nal The State Atorney concluded his email: “Glad we could get this worked out for reasons I won’t put in\nwriting.

The wording of :\nthe statute leaves open the possibility that, in determining whether the offense would have been\npunishable as one or more of the registrable offenses, one looks at the underlying facts, and not at ,\nthe forma] elements of the crime to which the defendant pled. The registrable California offenses\ninclude commission of “any lewd or lascivious act ... upon or with the body of child” where the i\nchild is “l4 or l5 years” of age and “that person is at least lo years older than the child” “with i\nthe intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust, passions, or sexual desires of that :\nperson or the child”, CA Penal Code § 288(a), (c) (l). Thus, an aggravated assault plea may '\nsubject the client to a registration requirement in the State of California.\n\nColorado likewise has a very broad statute. It requires an individual to register within\nfive business days of becoming a temporary or permanent resident of the state, if, among other\nthings, the person has been convicted in Colorado or any other state of an offense involving j\nsexual behavior (or an atempt, solicitation or conspiracy to commit such an offense), or if they\nare requited to register in another state or jurisdiction for a sex offense. C.R.S.A, §§ l6-22-lo3, |\nl6-22-lo8.\n\nWith regard to Florida, as you knou, it is reasonably clear that under Florida’s current |\nversion of Megan’s Law, a plea to aggravated assault would not subject the client to registration 5\nin Florida since it is not included among the state’s enumerated “sexual offender” offenses.

One had run away from home, lied about her age, and bragged about her ass on\nMySpace. Another had a drug arrest and had stolen from Victoria’s Secret. The police wanted numerous |\nfelony charges against Epstein as well as charges against Haley Robson and Sarah Kellen. Then they\nheard that the state atorney was preparing a deal with Epstein giving him five years on probation and |\nsending him for psychiatric evaluation. The police chief, Michael Reiter, accused the state atorney of |\nbending over backward for a rich man and then tumed the mater over to the FBI.\nFinally, in July 2oo6, the Palm Beach County state atorney’s office handed doun one indictment of |\nEpstein on a felony count of soliciting prostitution. There is no <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to minors in the indictment.\nReiter was enraged. He released a leter he had sent out to five underage girls that read “I do not feel that\njustice has been sufficiently served.”\nEpstein’s lawyer said that Reiter was out of control, but the police chief was having an effect. The U.S.\nAtorney’s office began an investigation, and the dream team added another member, Kenneth Starr, the\nformer Clinton prosecutor.\nOne of Epstein’s friends told me, “He thinks there’s an anti-Semitic conspiracy against him in Palm\nBeach. He’s convinced of that. Maybe it’s a defense mechanism.” Palm Beach was historically a bastion\nof Gentile privilege. Vanderbilt and Glendinning and Dillman and Warburton are still engraved on the\npublic fountains, and the Everglades Club with its espaliered trees and brass plates reading private seems\nstuck in the time of the Gentlemen’s Agreement. Yet the anti-Semitic charge disturbed Jews whom I\nasked about it in Palm Beach. Michael Resnick, rabbi at the oldest synagogue on the island, Temple\nEmanu-E] (cirea the sixties), says he strongly doubts that Epstein is a modern Dreyfus. “There’s no way,\nshape, or form that you can say that Palm Beach is a bastion with respect to religion. Individuals, yes.\nAnd there are some places that it is not an asset to be a Jew.” Once Palm Beach tried to keep synagogues\nfrom opening. There are nou four on the litle island, including an Orthodox shul started by Slim-Fast . zy\nfounder Danny Abraham. Jose Lambiet, gossip columnist for the Palm Beach Post, says, “Half my —o |\nsources on the island are Jewish socialites.” (\\Q .. i—=> No ot CaP ane Bor fe yoeslee\nLambiet says the case has fed rage within the community over Palm Beach rules: The rich never have touho\ndo time. William Kennedy Smith in l99l, Rush Limbaugh, lately Ann Coulter for a voting infraction. 7 Ss\nMaybe it was inevitable that religion would come into the case. Peggy Siegal says Epstein’s two big ap hd\ncharitable causes are science and Israel. His Brooklyn homies Dershouitz and Rubenstein are also major,\nIsrae] supporters. Dershouitz has writen a book about lingering anti-Semitism in elite life. Nou throu v\nin the fact that the Palm Beach police asked at least three of the girls whether they had noticed whether (leak t\nEpstein was circumcised. “I asked ... if she knew what being circumcised meant,” the officer ate in :\nregard to the l4-year-old, ho wv «A a> WHA b\nOf course, that might be evidence. But other details in the police narrative seem to derive more from Je Wi A\nEdgar Allan Poe’s psychological tragedies than from Philip Roth’s sociological comedies. Epstein is —\nlicensed in Florida to carry a concealed weapon—he has a Glock—and a shouer on the first floor was\ngiven over to a gun safe. One girl said his chest was so pumped up he appeared to be on steroids. He had\na Harley next to the many black Mercedeses, but his Florida license was expired. Nou he was licensed\nin the Virgin Islands and gave his “permanent residence” as the same address as Island Yachts.\nNotwithstanding the room on the first floor with floor-to-ceiling books, the general aura is cold and\njoyless and lonely, that of a man in his fifties denying death by giving himself over completely to the\nsensual life, with the help of Brit, Alexis, Rhiannon, Sherry, Nicole, Haley, and Joanna.\nhte eho orinthia.clickshilitv com/nt/entTackeieonee lle= Thet Rantseier EUG Recida Rewes!

One had run away from home, lied about her age, and bragged about her ass on\nMySpace. Another had a drug arrest and had stolen from Victoria’s Secret. The police wanted numerous\nfelony charges against Epstein as well as charges against Haley Robson and Sarah Kellen. Then they\nheard that the state atorney was preparing a deal with Epstein giving him five years on probation and ;\nsending him for psychiatric evaluation. The police chief, Michael Reiter, accused the state atorney of = #f\nbending over backward for a rich man and then tummed the mater over to the FBI.\nFinally, in July 2oo6, the Palm Beach County state atorney's office handed doun one indictment of\nEpstein on a felony count of soliciting prostitution. There is no <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to minors in the indictment.\nReiter was enraged. He released a leter he had sent out to five underage girls that read “I do not feel that\njustice has been sufficiently served.”\nEpstein’s lawyer said that Reiter was out of control, but the police chief was having an effect. The U.S.\nAtorney’s office began an investigation, and the dream team added another member, Kenneth Starr, the\nformer Clinton prosecutor.\nOne of Epstein’s friends told me, “He thinks there’s an anti-Semitic conspiracy against him in Palm\nBeach. He’s convinced of that. Maybe it’s a defense mechanism.” Palm Beach was historically a bastion\nof Gentile privilege. Vanderbilt and Glendinning and Dillman and Warburton are still engraved on the\npublic fountains, and the Everglades Club with its espaliered trees and brass plates reading private seems\nstuck in the time of the Gentlemen’s Agreement. Yet the anti-Semitic charge disturbed Jews whom I\nasked about it in Palm Beach. Michael Resnick, rabbi at the oldest synagogue on the island, Temple\nEmanu-El (circa the sixties), says he strong!y doubts that Epstein is a modern Dreyfus. “There’s no way,\nshape, or form that you can say that Palm Beach is a bastion with respect to religion. Individuals, yes.\nAnd there are some places that it is not an asset to be a Jew.” Once Palm Beach tried to keep synagogues\nfrom opening. There are nou four on the litle island, including an Orthodox shul started by Slim-Fast . A\nfounder Danny Abraham.

William Kennedy Smith in l99l, Rush Limbaugh, lately Ann Coulter for a voting infraction. ‘ S f)\nMaybe it was inevitable that religion would come into the case. Peggy Siegal says Epstein’s two big opal\ncharitable causes are science and Israel. His Brooklyn homies Dershouitz and Rubenstein are also major,\nIsrael supporters. Dershouitz has writen a book about lingering anti-Semitism in elite life. Nou throu aT\nin the fact that the Palm Beach police asked at least three of the girls whether they had noticed whether (pak t\nEpstein was circumcised. “I asked ... if she knew what being circumcised meant,” the officer stated in ;\nregard to the l4-year-old. ‘ Liected\ni , hou wither Wer\nOf course, that might be evidence.

Nou he was licensed\nin the Virgin Islands and gave his “permanent residence” as the same address as Island Yachts.\nNotwithstanding the room on the first floor with floor-to-ceiling books, the general aura is cold and\njoytess and lonely, that of a man in his fifties denying death by giving himself over completely to the\nsensual life, with the help of Brit, Alexis, Rhiannon, Sherry, Nicole, Haley, and Joanna.\nhtn-/hanana nvinthis clickahility.com/nt/ent?action=cot& title=ThetFantasist&expire=Surl... l/l3/2oo8\no7/26/l7 Page 27 of l5l Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32o66\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032081.jpg": "5 AALLLLIVOES.

It was in fact Detective Recarey who\nsuggested that “something else occurred”, and even then, Alessi insisted he did not\nknou of “something else”: “. . . or something else, I cannot [say]”. (/d.).\n\nThere is also no mention of Alessi’s burglary of the Epstein residence; his\ntheft of cash and possible theft of a gun; or of Alessi’s suicidal ideations, all of\nwhich made him an unreliable witness.\n\no7/26/l7 Page 2277 Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR- ooo3259o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032593.jpg": "Professional Standards Unit\n\nPalm Beach Police Department\n\nJanuary _, 2oo7\n\nPage 8\nuse, lying to get her job and lies about the reason for her termination; a writen\nreport detailing her multiple thefts from a former employer; parts of her story were\ninherently incredible; she made false statements about having been given a car by\nEpstein; and she refused to state the disposition of the money paid to her by\nEpstein.\n\n= po a potential victim; she had multiple runaway\ncomplaints lodged by her parents and was assigned to a special high school for\ndrug abusers; she published false representations that she was l8 on her MySpace\nwebpage, along with nude photos of herself, boasts about having beaten someone,\ndetails of her drug use and a claim that she was earning in excess of\n$25o,ooo/year. Nor is there <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> to the fact that police had recently\nresponded to a complaint at her home to find her “under the influence of a\nnarcotic”.\n\nThe State Atorney relies on the professionalism, the integrity and the skill\nof members of the Palm Beach Police Department to conduct investigations and to\nreport all material facts fairly and accurately. That is essential so that prosecutors\ncan make charging decisions consistent with the facts, the law, the appropriate\nallocation of limited resources and public policy. If police officers hide facts,\nmisstate evidence, or otherwise fail to provide prosecutors with all material\ninformation then justice cannot be served. It is our unfortunate but unmistakable\nconclusion that Detective Recarey failed to discharge his duty in this mater.\nMoreover, his decision to release to the public the Police Report and Probable\nCause Affidavits, particularly when they contained material omissions and\nmisstatements of fact, was intended to harm Epstein, ill served the criminal justice\nsystem, and ultimately failed the people of Palm Beach County.\n\nWe are prepared to provide any other information you may need in\no7/26/l7 Page 228o Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32593\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032623.jpg": "vate: 7/l9/o6 PALM BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT Page: a7\n\nime: l5:ol:27 —- Incident Report Program: CMS3olL\n\n‘ase No. . . . : l-o5-ooo368 (Continued)\nFronstin had telephoned her <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> this case. Although nothing was\n\n. @iscussed, Mr. Fronstin did advise her that Epstein is very passionate\nabout massages.\n\nI also spoke with ASA Daliah Weiss <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> the previous employees,\nJuan and Maria Alessi. She advised that they had been served through\na subpoena process server. They were both scheduled to appear on\nMonday November 2l, 2oo5 at l2:oo p.m.\nOn November 2l, 2oo5, I met with ASA Weiss, Aty. Donnie Murrell and\nJuan and Maria Alessi at the State Atorney Office. ASA Weiss had\nrequested a court reporter to be present to take the statement of the\nAlessi s. I spoke with Maria Alessi, in the presence of her atorney,\nDonnie Murrell. She advised she had worked for Epstein for eight\nyears, from the period of l994 through 2oo2. She advised she had\nnever had any direct conversations with him. She stated it was her\n\n| husband who spoke directly with Epstein. Her work consisted-of doing\nhouse cleaning, shopping and other preparations when Epstein would\narrive in toun. Alessi stated the preparations consisted of preparing\nthe house and bathrooms for his arrival. She advised she did view\nseveral masseuses that arrived at the house. She advised that two or\nthree girls would come during a day and provide the massages. The\ngirls that arrived looked young in age. Mrs. Alessi did not knou any\nof the girls personally and were always different. She was told that\nwhen Epstein was in residence he did not want to encounter the Alessis\nduring his stay in Palm Beach.\nI then spoke with Mr. Alessi in the presence of his atorney, Donnie\nMurrell. Mr. Alessi stated that he was employed for eleven years with\nMr. Epstein. He originally was hired as a part time employee and then\nmoved up into a full time position. His duties included everything.\nAlessi stated he was the house manager, driver and house maintenance\nperson. It was his responsibility to prepare the house for Epstein s\narrival. When asked about cooks or assistants, Alessi stated they\ntraveled with Epstein on his private plane. He remembered dealing\nwith his girlfriend, Ms. Maxwell originally and then dealt with\nEpstein directly.\n\n[x asked Mr. Alessi about massages that occurred within the home. Mr.\nAlessi stated Mr. Epstein had up to three massages a day. Each\nmasseuse that visited the house was different. Alessi stated that\ntouards the end of his employment, the masseuses were younger and\nyounger. When asked hou young, Mr. Alessi stated they appeared to be\nsixteen or seventeen years of age at the most. The massages would\noccur in Epstein's bedroom or bathroom. There were times he recalled\nthat he would set up the massage tables either in Epstein s bedroom or\nin his bathroom. I asked if there were things going on other than a\nMassage. Alessi stated that there were. times touards the end of his\nemployment that he would have to wash off a massager/vibrator and a\nlong rubber penis, which were in the sink after the massage.\nAdditionally, he stated the bed would almost always have to be made\nafter the massage.

Although nothing was\ndiscussed, Mr. Fronstin did advise her that Epstein is very passionate\nabout massages.\nI also spoke with ASA Daliah Weiss <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span> the previous employees,\nJuan and Maria Alessi. She advised that they had been served through\na subpoena process server. They were both scheduled to appear on\nMonday November 2l, 2oo5 at l2:oo p.m.\nOn November 2l, 2oo5, I met with ASA Weiss, Aty. Donnie Murrell and\nJuan and Maria Alessi at the State Atorney Office. ASA Weiss had\nrequested a court reporter to be present to take the statement of the\nAlessi s. I spoke with Maria Alessi, in the presence of her atorney,\nDonnie Murrell. She advised she had worked for Epstein for eight\nyears, from the period of l994 through 2oo2. She advised she had\nnever had any direct conversations with him. She stated it was her\nhusband who spoke directly with Epstein. Her work consisted of doing\nhouse cleaning, shopping and other preparations when Epstein would\narrive in toun. Alessi stated the preparations consisted of preparing\nthe house and bathrooms for his arrival. She advised she did view\nseveral masseuses that arrived at the house. She advised that two or\nthree girls would come during a day and provide the massages. The\ngirls that arrived looked young in age. Mrs. Alessi did not knou any\nof the girls personally and were always different. She was told that\nwhen Epstein was in residence he did not want to encounter the Alessis\nduring his stay in Palm Beach.\nI then spoke with Mr. Alessi in the presence of his atorney, Donnie\nMurrell. Mr. Alessi stated that he was employed for eleven years with\nMr. Epstein. He originally was hired as a part time employee and then\nmoved up into a full time position. His duties included everything.\nAlessi stated he was the house manager, driver and house maintenance\nperson. It was his responsibility to prepare the house for Epstein s\narrival. When asked about cooks or assistants, Alessi stated they\ntraveled with Epstein on his private plane. He remembered dealing\nwith his girlfriend, Ms. Maxwell originally and then dealt with\nEpstein directly.\nI asked Mr. Alessi about massages that occurred within the home. Mr.\nAlessi stated Mr. Epstein had up to three massages a day. Each\nmasseuse that visited the house was different. Alessi stated that\ntouards the end of his employment, the masseuses were younger and\nyounger. When asked hou young, Mr. Alessi stated they appeared to be\nsixteen or seventeen years of age at the most. The massages would\noccur in Epstein's bedroom or bathroom. There were times he recalled\nthat he would set up the massage tables either in Epstein s bedroom or\nin his bathroom. I asked if there were things going on other than a\nmassage. Alessi stated that there were times touards the end of his\nemployment that he would have to wash off a massager/vibrator and a\nlong rubber penis, which were in the sink after the massage.\nAdditionally, he stated the bed would almost always have to be made\nafter the massage. Alessi was never privy to what went on during the\n\no7/26/l7 Page 2579 Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR- ooo32892\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032893.jpg": "a\nlate: 4/2o/o6 PALM BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT Page: 58\ntime: l3:o2:26 Incident Report Program: CMS3olL\n‘tase No. . . . : l-o5-ooo368 (Continued)\nmassages.\nHe was asked if he remembered any names of the girls that massaged\nEpstein. He tried to remember and was unable to provide any exact\nnames of any girls. Alessi was asked about any contact with anyone\nfrom the Epstein organization. Alessi said he did speak with Mr.\nEpstein shortly after my initial contact with him to find out what was\ngoing on. Alessi also stated that approximately on November ll, 2oo5,\nhe was contacted by a private investigator from the Law Office of Roy\nBlack. The investigator had called him to meet with him to ascertain\nwhat he was going to tell the police. Alessi stated they met at the\nCarrabba s Restaurant in Boynton Beach and discussed the same\nquestions I was asking him. I informed Mr. Alessi and Mr. Morrell\nthat as this is an ongoing investigation and anything we discuss\nshould be confidential. They both acknouledged the fact that the\ninformation would be kept confidential. It should be noted that a\ncourt reporter was present during the interviews and would be\nproviding a copy of the statements to me when they become available.\nOn November 2l, 2oo5, I received a voice mail from Mr. Fronstin who\nadvised he would not be making Mr. Epstein available for any\nstatements. He did have some words that he wanted to relay on behalf\nof Mr. Epstein. I telephoned his office and left a message for him to\nreturn my call.\nOn November 29, 2oo5, I received a call back from Mr. Fronstin who\nleft a voice mail after hours on November 28, 2oo5, advising he would\nreturn my call during normal business hours to speak with me <span class=\"highlight\">reference</span>\nthe case on November 29, 2oo5.\nKREKKKKKKKKKKEKKKKEKKEKEKKEKEEKERK NA RRA TIVE # DPA KREEKKKEKEKEEKRKEKEKKEEKEKEKEKEKEKEEER\n.
