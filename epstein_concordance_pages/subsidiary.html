El-Sadig, l33 F. Supp. 2d 6oo (N.D. Ohio 2ool). In E/-Sadig, the court held\nthat the defendant, who was alleged to have purchased firearms unlawfully for two members of\nthe Saudi royal family who had traveled with a Saudi prince to the United States, had standing to\nenforce an oral agreement between the government and the prince not to prosecute any of the\nindividuals involved in the purchase. l33 F. Supp. 2d at 6ol. The court concluded that “even if\nthe non-prosecution agreement was never directly communicated to [the defendant], he can\nenforce the non-prosecution agreement as a third party beneficiary.” Jd. at 6o8. Moreover, the\ncourt reasoned, because the prince himself “was not involved in any of the illegal activity, his\nefforts to obtain a commitment not to prosecute were obviously intended by him to benefit third-\nparties,” and therefore the defendant was a third-party beneficiary with standing to enforce the\nagreement. Jd. at 6o9.\n\nBoth Florida West and El-Sadig illustrate hou the government’s argument that Ms.\nMaxwell lacks standing to enforce the NPA is contrary to bedrock principles of contract law, as\napplied to immunity agreements. Like Ms. Maxwell, the defendants in Florida West and El-\nSadig were not parties to the agreements at issue. Like Ms. Maxwell, the defendants were not\nspecifically named in the agreements. Yet in both cases, the courts held that the defendants were\nthird-party beneficiaries with standing to enforce the agreements, because the parties to the\nagreements obviously intended to confer on them the benefit of immunity. Ms. Maxwell\nsimilarly has standing to enforce the co-conspirator immunity provision of the NPA, as the\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2594\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002980.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 46 of 239\nrespects from those underlying contract law, the district court concluded that “third-party\nbeneficiaries have no contractual right to enforce plea agreements.” Jd. at *3-4. The court\nreasoned, “[t]he right to enforce a plea deal does not exist for its oun sake; rather, it is a means to\nachieve fairness in plea bargaining.” /d. at *4. That is because a defendant has the right to enforce\nhis plea agreement, and “enforcement by third parties adds nothing to protecting the defendant’s\nright.” Jd. The same holds true here.\n\nIn support of her claim that she has standing to enforce the NPA, the defendant relies upon\nthree district court decisions, none of which analyzed the threshold question of whether third party\nstanding concepts from contract law apply to plea agreements. In United States v. Florida West\nInt’l Airways, Inc., 853 F. Supp. 2d l2o9, l228 (S.D. Fla. 2ol2), the district court applied the third\nparty beneficiary doctrine to a former airline employee based on a prior plea agreement with the\nairline that immunized, among others, current and former employees of the airline and its\nsubsidiaries. In its analysis, houever, the court applied the doctrine without analyzing the question\nof whether third party beneficiary standing principles apply to plea agreements. /d. For similar\nreasons, the defendant’s reliance on United States v. El-Sadig, l33 F. Supp. 2d 6oo, 6o8-o9 (N.D.\nOhio 2ool) is misplaced. In that case, the court permited a third party to invoke a plea agreement,\nbut it did not analyze or address whether third party standing rules apply to plea agreements. /d.\nLikewise, in United States v. CFW Const. Co., 583 F. Supp. l97, 2o3 (D.S.C. l984), the court\napplied the third party beneficiary doctrine, but relied solely on contracts treatises for support, and\ndid not analyze whether that doctrine should be applied to plea agreements.\n\nIn any event, even if third party beneficiaries had standing to enforce federal plea\nagreements, the defendant has failed to establish that she is a third party beneficiary of the NPA.\nIn order to establish that she has enforceable rights under the NPA, the defendant must shou that\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo298o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004746.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3oo _ Filed o6/l5/2l Page 3 of 32\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

The ever-changing rules are negatively impacting\nMs. Maxwell’s ability to prepare for trial and are interfering with privileged atorney-client\ncommunication. The hyper-surveillance of Ms. Maxwell and counsel during legal visits is highly\ninappropriate and invasive. At a minimum, this should not be sanctioned by the Court.\n\nVery truly yours,\nBOBBI C.

The\ndistrict court has made it clear — again in its latest order — that it won’t\ntell BOP what to do, even though BOP has not justified in any way the\ntreatment that Ms. Maxwell is receiving. As we have said from the start,\neveryone knous the real reason she is being subjected to these abusive\ntactics: because Jeffrey Epstein died on BOP’s watch and it is going to\ntreat Ms. Maxwell as though she is Epstein.\n\nIn sentencing another woman who was held at MDC, District Judge\nColleen McMahon said the defendant “shouldn’t have to suffer for the\nincompetence of the United States Department of Justice and its\n<span class=\"highlight\">subsidiary</span> agency, the Bureau of Prisons. I will do what I can to bring\nyour situation to the people who, if they give a damn, might do\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o335\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021754.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 87, o7/27/2o23, 35482o2, Pagel2 of 35\n\n& Indemn.
