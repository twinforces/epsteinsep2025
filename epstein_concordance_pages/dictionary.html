Sabath, 99o F. Supp. loo7, lol8 (N.D. Ill. l998) (quoting,\nBLACK'S LAW <span class=\"highlight\">DICTIONARY</span> l27o (6th ed.l99o)).\n\nAs noted by Chief Judge McMahon in United States v. Santiago, 987 F. Supp. 2d 465,\n488-9l (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3), “[t]he Second Circuit has never specifically declined to adopt the\nLovasco ‘Footnote l7’ test (as restated in Eight Thousand Eight Hundred Fifty Dollars). Nor has\nit specifically found that pre-indictment delay engendered in reckless disregard of circumstances\nthat would likely impede a defendant's ability to mount a defense can never violate the Due\nProcess Clause.”\n\nCourts generally agree that (l) “tactical, reckless, or bad faith preindictment delay that\nunduly prejudices a defendant is constitutionally dubious,” United States v. McNeal, No. o3 CR\n8o, 2oo6 WL 76ol86, at *6 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 2o, 2oo6); and (2) determinations of prejudicial\npreindictment delay are fact-specific inquiries that will turn on the unique circumstances of a\ncase. See Marion, 4o4 U.S. at 324-25; Lovasco, 43l US. at 797.4\n\nThis is that case.\n\n4 Several Circuit Courts of Appeal interpret Marion/Lovasco as requiring a balancing test that\nweighs the prejudice to a defendant against the government's reasons for the delay. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Valentine, 783 F.2d l4l3, l4l6 (9th Cir. l986); Houell v. Barker, 9o4 F.2d 889, 895 (4th Cir.\nl99o); United States v. Soua, 34 F.3d 447, 45l (7th Cir. l994); United States v. Moran, 759 F.2d 777,\n782 (9th Cir. l985). See also United States v. Collamore, 75l F. Supp. lol2, lo27 (D. Me. l99o), aff'd,\n94o F.2d 646 (lst Cir. l99l) (quotation omited) (holding that a defendant may shou a due process\nviolation based on excessive preindictment delay incurred in reckless disregard of circumstances, knoun\nto the prosecution, suggesting that there existed an appreciable risk that delay would impair the ability to\nmount an effective defense); and Schurman v. Leonardo, 768 F. Supp. 993, 998 (S.D.N.Y. l99l)\n(recognizing reckless disregard standard). Legal commentators have, for many years, discussed the\nCircuit split regarding the test to be applied to claims of pre-indictment delay and called for the U.S.\nSupreme Court to resolve the mater. See, e.g., Phyllis Goldfarb, “When Judges Abandon Analogy: The\nProblem of Delay in Commencing Criminal Prosecutions,” 3l WM. & MARY L. REV. 6o7 (l99o); Eli\nDuBosar, “Pre-Accusation Delay: An Issue Ripe for Adjudication by the United States Supreme Court,”\n4o FLA. ST. U. L. REV. 659 (2ol3); see also Hoo v. United States, 484 U.S. lo35, lo36 (l988), where\nJustice White noted that he would grant certiorari to resolve the conflict among the Circuits on this\nimportant question of constitutional law.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo25l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003088.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l54 of 239\n\nA.

Mot. 4 at ll). These arguments only underscore the principle that perjury\nprosecutions are an inquiry into “the natural meaning in the context in which words were used,”\nBonacorsa, 528 F.2d at l22l, and not an opportunity for defense counsel to “plumb[] a question\nfor post hoc ambiguity,” Strohm, 67l F.3d at ll78. A reasonable jury, after hearing the evidence,\ncould readily conclude that the natural meaning of those words in context is abundantly clear. For\ninstance, at the end of trial, a jury could conclude that “Jeffrey” is Jeffrey Epstein; “Jeffrey’s\nproperties” are Jeffrey Epstein’s properties, including his houses in Palm Beach, New York, New\nMexico, and the United States Virgin Islands (see, e.g., Ex. lo at 248:l7-2o (naming those\nproperties)); and “interact” is an expansive word aimed at capturing any encounter, that was used\nafter the defendant resisted words like “met,” “found,” and “hired” in the prior questions, see\nInteract, Oxford English <span class=\"highlight\">Dictionary</span> Online, htps://oed.com/view/Entry/975l8 (last visited\nFebruary 25, 2o2l) (“To act reciprocally, to act on each other.”).

The Allegations Regarding Accuser-3 Are Unduly Prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell.\n\nThe government nou concedes that when it alleges that Epstein “sexually abused”\nAccuser-3 with Ms. Maxwell’s knouledge and assistance, the purported “sexual abuse” to which\nthe government refers was entirely lawful conduct—and that the sole basis for the government’s\ncharacterization of that lawful conduct as “sexual abuse” was Accuser-3’s “subjective\nexperience” of consensual sex acts. Opp. l62 n.57. Such a characterization is, to say the least,\ngrossly misleading. As the government argued in a 2ol7 Supreme Court case, the term “sexual\nabuse” implies a crime. See Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions, l37 S.Ct. l562, l569 (2ol7)\n(“Sexual abuse of a minor,’ the Government accordingly contends, ‘most naturally connotes\nconduct that (l) is i/legal, (2) involves sexual activity, and (3) is directed at a person younger\nthan l8 years old.’”) (quoting government’s brief) (emphases added). Merriam-Webster’s legal\n<span class=\"highlight\">dictionary</span> defines “sexual abuse” as (l) “the infliction of sexual contact upon a person by\nforcible compulsion,” (il) “engaging in sexual contact with a person who is belou a specified age\nor who is incapable of giving consent because of age or mental or physical incapacity,” or (i)\n“the crime of engaging in or inflicting sexual abuse.” “Sexual abuse,” Merriam-Webster.com\nLegal <span class=\"highlight\">Dictionary</span>, Merriam-Webster, htps:/(www.merriam-webster.com/legal/sexual%2oabuse,\naccessed ll Mar. 2o2l.\n\nAlthough the government concedes its inability to establish that Accuser-3’s alleged\ninteractions with Ms. Maxwell and Epstein were anything other than consensual and lawful, it\ninsists that it has “accurately” characterized those allegations and that “it is neither misleading\nnor prejudicial to imply that this activity involved illegal conduct.” Opp. l65.

Castor made no atempt in 2oo5 or in any of the ten years that folloued\nto remedy any misperception or to stop Cosby from openly and detrimentally relying upon\nthat decision. In light of these circumstances, the subsequent decision by successor\nD.A.s to prosecute Cosby violated Cosby’s due process rights.

We note at the outset that specific performance does not\nautomatically apply in these circumstances. As a general rule, specific performance is\nreserved for remedying an injured party to a fully consummated agreement, such as an\nagreed-upon and executed plea bargain. Commonwealth v. Spence, 627 A.2d ll76,\nll84 (Pa. l993). “Specific performance’ is a traditional contract remedy that is available\nwhen monetary damages are inadequate.” Martinez, l47 A.3d at 532 (citing BLACK’s LAW\n<span class=\"highlight\">DICTIONARY</span> l425 (8th ed. 2oo4) (defining “specific performance” as, inter alia, “a court-\nordered remedy that requires precise fulfillment of a legal or contractual obligation when\nmonetary damages are inappropriate or inadequate’”)).\n\nThis does not mean that specific performance is unavailable entirely. It only means\nthat the remedy does not naturally flou to someone under these circumstances as an\nautomatic consequence of contract law. Specific performance is awarded only when\nequity and fundamental fairness command it. See Scotland, at 6l4 F.2d at 365 (stating\nthat, if “the defendant detrimentally relies on the government’s promise, the resulting harm\nfrom this induced reliance implicates due process guarantees”); see also Commonwealth\nv.

Rather, it is a motion seeking\npermission to admit evidence the Rules of Evidence might otherwise exclude. It is a substantive\nmotion under a specific rule of evidence with specific procedures for its filing, consideration, and\ndetermination. Fed. R. Evid. 4l2(c). And the Rule itself sets a deadline for filing a motion under\nits terms—l4 days before trial. Fed. R. Evid. 4l2(c)(l)(B) (providing that a defendant must file\nher motion “at least l4 days before trial unless the court, for good cause, sets a different time”).\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5226\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005837.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 54 of 84\nwith Epstein. When Minor Victim-3 began having sexual contact with Epstein, she was l7. The\nissue at trial will be the defendant’s knouledge of Epstein’s preference for girls under the age of\nl8. Under federal law, there is a term for individuals under the age of l8: minors. There is nothing\ninappropriate about using that term at trial.\n\nSimilarly, the phrase “sexual abuse” is accurate, and the Government should be permited\nto use it. Minor Victim-3 is expected to testify about her experiences with the defendant and\nEpstein, including that she was sexually abused by Epstein numerous times. Regardless of whether\nshe uses the term “sexual abuse,” her testimony will capture her experience—that she was\nexploited sexually. Andi it is fair for the Government to argue that those acts were sexual abuse.\nThe defense argues that the phrase “sexual abuse” is misleading because it suggests to the jury that\nEpstein engaged in “criminal sexual activity” with Minor Victim-3. (Def. Mot. 4 at l4-l5). To\njustify that proposition, the defense cites a single Supreme Court case in which (l) the parties were\nengaged in the task of statutory interpretation, not argument in a jury address or description of a\nvictim’s lived experience, and (2) the Court rejected that proposed definition of “sexual abuse of\na minor” as “flatly inconsistent with the definition of sexual abuse contained in th[at] very\n<span class=\"highlight\">dictionary</span>.” Esquivel-Quintana v.

R. Crim. P. l6(b)(l)(A) (emphasis added).\n\nUnder subsection (b)(l)(A)(il), a defendant’s reciprocal discovery obligations are limited\nto material—specifically books, papers, documents, data, photographs, tangible objects,\nbuildings or places, or copies or portions of any of these items—that she intends to use in her\n“case-in-chief.”\n\nIn turn, a party’s “case-in-chief” includes only “[t]he evidence presented at trial by a\nparty between the time the party calls the first witness and the time the party rests.” Black’s Law\n<span class=\"highlight\">Dictionary</span> (llth ed. 2ol9). By definition, therefore, a defendant’s “case-in-chief” does not\ninclude her cross-examination of a prosecution witness during the government’s “case-in-chief.”\n\nHere, Ms. Maxwell has not called her first witness. Only the government has called\nwitnesses. The case is currently in the government’s “case-in-chief,” and Ms. Maxwell’s “case-\nin-chief” has not yet started. Because Ms. Maxwell has not begun her case-in-chief, she had no\nobligation under Rule l6(b)(l)(A) to disclose the photograph she offered in evidence while\ncross-examining Jane.\n\nThere is no doubt Rule l6(b)(l)(A) does not apply to material a defendant offers into\nevidence while cross-examining witnesses during the government’s case-in-chief. The l974\nCommitee Notes to Rule l6 say this expressly: “Subdivision (b)(l)(A) provides that the\ndefendant shall disclose any documents and tangible objects which he has in his possession,\ncustody, or control and which he intends to introduce in evidence in his case in chief.” Fed.

The Two-Point “Undue Influence” Enhancement Under USSG § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B)\n\nDoes Not Apply.\n\nFinally, it would be improper for the Court to apply a two-level enhancement on the\ngrounds that a participant in the criminal activity “unduly influenced a minor to engage in\nprohibited sexual conduct.” USSG § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B). First, it would constitute impermissible\ndouble-counting to apply § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B) to the offense conduct related to “Jane,” Annie\nFarmer, and Carolyn because it would punish Ms. Maxwell for the same harm that was fully\naccounted for in the base offense level for Counts Three, Four, and Six. “Impermissible double\ncounting occurs when one part of the Guidelines is applied to increase the defendant’s sentence\nto reflect the kind of harm that has already been fully accounted for by another part of the\nGuidelines.” United States v. Watkins, 667 F.3d 254, 26l (2d Cir. 2ol2). Ms. Maxwell was\nconvicted of conspiring to “entice” and “coerce” minors to travel to engage in prohibited sexual\nconduct and “enticing” minors to engage in commercial sex acts. (S2 Ind. 4] l2, 24, 27).'°\nWebster’s <span class=\"highlight\">Dictionary</span> defines the word “entice” to mean “to atract artfully or adroitly or by\narousing hope or desire; tempt” and the further explains that the word “tempt” “implies the\npresenting of an atraction so strong that it overcomes the restraints of conscience or beter\njudgment.”!! Similarly, Webster’s <span class=\"highlight\">Dictionary</span> defines the word “coerce” to mean “to compel to\nan act or choice” and further explains that the word “compel” “typically suggests overcoming of\nresistance or unwillingness by an irresistible force.”'* Accordingly, the base offense level for\n!o Count Three charged a conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity. S2 Ind. {f\nl6-l9. Although this offense does not contain an element of “enticement” or “coercion,” the offense conduct for\nCounts One, Three, and Five (the three conspiracy counts) was consolidated under Count Three for the purposes of\nsentencing, pursuant to the Court’s order.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan,\nI write to confirm that November l5, 2o2l is the deadline for Ms. Maxwell to file a\nmotion under Federal Rule of Evidence 4l2, which governs the admissibility of evidence of an\nalleged victim’s sexual behavior.\nUnder this Court’s pretrial scheduling order, motions in limine are due on October l8. A\nmotion in limine is a “pretrial request that certain inadmissible evidence not be referred to or\noffered at trial.” Black’s Law <span class=\"highlight\">Dictionary</span> (llth ed. 2ol9).\nA motion under Rule 4l2 is not a motion in limine. Rather, it is a motion seeking\npermission to admit evidence the Rules of Evidence might otherwise exclude. It is a substantive\nmotion under a specific rule of evidence with specific procedures for its filing, consideration, and\ndetermination. Fed. R. Evid. 4l2(c). And the Rule itself sets a deadline for filing a motion under\nits terms—l4 days before trial. Fed. R. Evid. 4l2(c)(l)(B) (providing that a defendant must file\nher motion “at least l4 days before trial unless the court, for good cause, sets a different time”).\nDOJ-OGR-oooll265\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00013830.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 759 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 239 of 267 2267\nLCAVMAX8\n\nl allegedly participated in this conspiracy persuaded, induced,\n\n2 or enticed Jane to travel to New York to engage in illegal\n\n3 sexual activity.\n\n4 Your Honor, these words \"persuade, induce, entice,\"\n\n5 these are words of causation.
