Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan,\nAt the initial conference in this case, the Government promised Ms. Maxwell and the\nCourt that it would review and produce “prior investigative files from another investigation in\nthe Southern District of Florida,”! which it characterized as part of “the core of the case” against\nMs. Maxwell,” after a “careful and exhaustive and through review of all of the materials,” with\nthe “bulk” of the discovery produced by “the end of this summer [2o2o].”? Summer is gone,\nWinter is coming, and the Government has failed to make good on its promises.\nAlthough it casts the October 7, 2o2o leter to the Court as a “response to the Court’s\nprior inquiry regarding” its plan to produce discovery, the Government is, in fact, abandoning the\ndeadlines to which it already agreed and reneging on (or redefining) its assurances to the Court\nthat it would engage in “thoughtful and critical pushing and pressing of questions and issues with\nrespect to actively retrieving any appropriate files.” In fact, the promised “substantial”\nproduction of discovery is “substantial” in size, not <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span>. Approximately one fourth of the\nproduction relates to materials gathered in civil litigation to which Ms. Maxwell was a party. The\nremainder of the discovery contains documents from the 2ooos that relate largely to Jeffrey\nEpstein and therefore have nothing to do with the time period of the conspiracy charged in the\n!

The <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> of this information is critical to the defense because it negates the\nentire theory of prosecution.\n\nThe Government has not provided any information about the genesis of the Non-\nProsecution Agreement (“NPA”) that the Government entered into with Jeffrey Epstein in 2oo7.\nThis is information will form the basis of substantial defense motions and argument.\n\nAccording to recent press reports, lawyers for the accusers met with the Government in\n2ol6 during the pendency of ongoing civil litigation against Ms. Maxwell in an effort to\nconvince the Government to open an investigation of Ms. Maxwell — an effort which did not\nultimately succeed. Neither the fact of these meetings nor the content has been disclosed. This is\nsignificant exculpatory information that is needed to investigate, prepare motions, and defend at\ntrial.®\n\nWe assume that many of the potential Government trial witnesses either participated or\nbenefited from Epstein’s NPA because the plea agreement provided for a mechanism where the\nclaimants were paid money by Epstein, who could not challenge liability, only the amount. The\nGovernment presumably has this information which is unquestionably favorable evidence which\n“includes not only evidence that tends to exculpate the accused, but also evidence that is useful\nto impeach the credibility of a government witness....” United States v. Teman, No. l9-CR-696\n(PAE), 2o2o WL 3o34o34, at *43 (S.D.N.Y. June 5, 2o2o) (citations omited), see also, Bagley\nv. Lumpkin, 798 F.2d l297, l3ol (9th Cir. l986); United States v. Librach, 52o F.2d 55o, 554\n(8th Cir. l975).\n\nThe Government is the Team\n\nIn an atempt to minimize what it promised, the Government redefines who it believes is\non the Team. The Government claims no responsibility for investigations into these allegations\nby either the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the Office of the United States Atorney unless\npart of the Southern District of New York. This stands in stark contrast to the on-the-record\nassurances that it gave the Court on July l4, 2o2o:\n\n“’,.the materials with respect to the core of the case also include prior investigative files\n\nfrom another investigation in the Southern District of Florida....” Tr. p. l2:lo-l3\n\n“The physical files [from the Florida investigation] were shipped to New York and are at\n\nthe New York F.B.I. office. They have been imaged and scanned and photographed to\n\nmake sure that a comprehensive review can be conducted, and they are physically in New\n\nYork so that we can have access to those files.” Jd., l4:lo-l4\n\nNou, the Government seeks to distance itself from its oun files, which are in New York,\nnot Florida, by arguing that they are excused from reviewing or producing information because it\n6 Pursuant to this Court’s practice standards regarding discovery, Ms. Maxwell, on October l3, 2o2o, sent a detailed\nleter requesting the production of discovery materials under Rule l6 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,\nBrady v.

Mot. 5 at 8). As an initial mater, and as evidenced by the\ndefendant’s oun motions to suppress the fruits of the grand jury subpoena issued to Boies Schiller,\nthe defendant herself professes to have been concerned about the prospect of a criminal\ninvestigation at the time of her depositions, which strongly suggests that, on these facts, the\ndistinction is of litle moment. (See, e.g., Def. Mot. 3 at 3-4 (explaining that the defendant “flatly\nrejected” a law enforcement exception to the civil protective order); Def. Mot. ll at 2 (arguing\nthat the defendant “declined to invoke” her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination\nat the deposition after negotiating the protective order)). More important, and whatever moment\nthat distinction may have in other contexts, it has litle bearing on the severance analysis which\nturns instead on whether the <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> of the false statement relates to the substantive offense, and\nis thereby provable through overlapping evidence and part of the speaker’s effort to conceal the\noffense. See Ruiz, 894 F.2d at 5o5; Potamitis, 739 F.2d at 79l (citing United States v. Carson,\n464 F.2d 424, 436 (2d Cir. l972); Sweig, 44l F.2d at ll8-l9) (affirming denial of a severance\nmotion where the false statements “concern the substantive offenses” and citing cases where the\nperjury count’s proof overlapped with the evidence on the substantive counts). With respect to\nthat analysis, the defendant cites no case for the proposition that the seting in which the statement\nis made is significant, much less determinative. Cf Broccolo, 797 F. Supp. at ll9o (false statement\n\nl45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3lo6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003108.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l74 of 239\nof proof of the conspiracy and perjury crimes permited joinder of the offenses . . . and denial of\nappellant’s Rule l4 pretrial motion for severance.”); Pizarro, 2ol8 WL l737236, at *6-*7.\n\nThe defendant argues that the trial on the perjury counts will require a “full-bloun re-\nlitigation of the defamation action.” (Def. Mot. 5 at 9). That is a significant exaggeration. To\nlitigate the perjury counts, the parties will need to present evidence about the basic <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> of\nthe civil suit—in particular, Giuffre’s allegations and the defendant’s denials—such that the jury\nwill be able to assess materiality and the statements’ context. This can be done briefly—as stated\nin Section V, the Government is amenable to presenting that information through a stipulation—\nand, in any event, through minimal additional evidence. The stipulation or other evidence could\nbe crafted to minimize the risk of spillover prejudice, for instance by referring to Giuffre by a\npseudonym to avoid any connection she might have to testimony on the substantive counts. And\nany remaining prejudice could be vitiated by a limiting instruction that the jury should not consider\nGiuffre’s allegations as evidence of the substantive counts. See Page, 657 F.3d at l3o-3l\n(approving of similar precautions when introducing evidence of a defendant’s prior felony\nconviction); Pizarro, 2ol8 WL l737236, at *7; see also Zafiro, 5o6 U.S. at 54o (“[JJuries are\npresumed to follou their instructions.” (citation and internal quotation marks omited)). There is\nevery reason to think a jury could and would follou such an instruction. See, e.g., Rivera, 546\nF.3d at 254 (using a limiting instruction to prevent spillover prejudice for counts involving the\nsexual exploitation of different children, especially in light of admissibility across counts); United\nStates v. Pena, 932 F. Supp. 2d 464, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (using a limiting instruction to address\nspillover prejudice from two murder for hire conspiracies). Indeed, even if the counts were\nsevered, as noted above, the Government would still seek to offer evidence of the defendant’s false\ndenials of conduct relevant to Counts One through Four as evidence of her consciousness of guilt\n\nl47\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3lo8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003109.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l75 of 239\n\nas to those counts, and would consent to a similar limiting instruction, which a jury would be\npresumed to follou. And, of course, in a severed trial exclusively on the perjury counts, the\ndefendant would surely argue that a limiting instruction is necessary to prevent the jury from\nconcluding that the defendant’s statements were false based in part on the <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> of Giuffre’s\nunproven allegations. Just as a jury would set aside the <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> of Giuffre’s allegations for that\npurpose, so can the jury set aside the <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> of Giuffre’s allegations for Counts One through\nFour.\n\nThe defendant contends instead that the perjury counts require a “collateral trial” on the\ntruth of Giuffre’s statements and resolution of “more than 5o substantive motions . . . pending\nbefore the District Court.” (Def. Mot. 5 at 9-lo). As described in Section V, a false statement in\na civil deposition is material (l) if a “truthful answer might reasonably be calculated to lead to the\ndiscovery of evidence admissible at the trial of the underlying suit,” United States v. Kross, l4\nF.3d 75l, 753 (2d Cir. l994), or (2) if it has “a natural tendency to influence, or [be] capable of\ninfluencing, the decision of the decisionmaking body to which it was addressed,” United States v.\nGaudin, 5l5 U.S. 5o6, 5o9 (l995) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omited).\nNeither of these standards requires the jury to determine whether the defendant’s statements would\nhave tipped the scales in the defamation suit or would likely have led to the discovery of evidence.\nSee Kungys v. United States, 485 U.S. 759, 77l (l988) (“It has never been the test of materiality\nthat the misrepresentation or concealment would more likely than not have produced an erroneous\ndecision, or even that it would more likely than not have triggered an investigation.”); United States\nv.

According to a statement made at the time by the\nState Atorney’s Office spokesman, the grand jury was presented with a list of charges from highest\nto louest, without a recommendation by the prosecutor, and deliberated with the prosecutor out of\nthe room.”* The state grand jury returned an indictment charging Epstein with one count of felony\nsolicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7, a felony under state law because\nit alleged three or more instances of solicitation.” The indictment did not identify the person or\npersons solicited and made no mention of the fact that Epstein had solicited minors.”® On July 23,\n2oo6, Epstein self-surrendered to be arrested on the indictment, but was not detained, and the\ncharges were made public.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she decided to move forward with the federal investigation at that\npoint because she believed the State Atorney’s Office would permit Epstein to enter a plea to a\nreduced misdemeanor charge and that once he entered a guilty plea, the Department’s Petite policy\nmight preclude a federal prosecution.?’ Villafafia told OPR that at the time, she “definitely\nbelieved that we were going to proceed to [a federal] indictment, assuming that ...we had\nsufficient evidence.”\neS Villafafia and the FBI obtained and examined records of the state grand jury proceeding, and Lourie reviewed\nthem.

Belohlavek explained to OPR that the charge did not list specific victims so that she could go forward\nat trial with whichever victim or victims might be available and willing to testify at that time.\n27 The Petite policy is a set of guidelines used by federal prosecutors when considering whether to pursue federal\ncharges for defendants previously prosecuted for state or local offenses. The Constitution does not prohibit the federal\ngovernment from prosecuting defendants who have been charged, acquited, or convicted on state charges based on\nthe same criminal conduct. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the long-standing principle that the prohibition\nagainst double jeopardy does not apply to prosecutions brought by different sovereigns. See, e.g., Gamble v. United\nStates, 587 U.S. ___, l39 S. Ct. l96o, l966-67 (2ol9) (and cases cited therein); Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S.\nl87, l95 (l959) (and cases cited therein); and United States v. Lanza, 26o U.S. 377, 382 (l922). Nonetheless, to\nbeter promote the efficient use of criminal justice resources, the Department developed policies in l959 and l96o to\nguide federal prosecutors in the use of their charging discretion.

Despite being told these things, you prepared a pros\nmemo and indictment that included a definitive date for indictment.\nIt has come to my atention that you led the agents to believe that\nthe indictment of this mater was a foregone conclusion and that our\ndecision to put off that date and listen to the defense atorneys’\nconcerns is indicative of the office having second thoughts about\nindicting.

In his leter, Starr\nargued that the USAO improperly had compelled Epstein to agree to pay civil damages under\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 as part of a state-based resolution of a criminal case. On the same day, Lefkouitz\nemailed Sloman, complaining about the USAO’s plan to notify victims about the § 2255 provision\nand alerting Sloman that Epstein’s counsel were seeking a meeting with the Assistant Atorney\nGeneral “to address what we believe is the unprecedented nature of the section 2255 component”\nof the NPA. After Lourie sent to Sloman a copy of the Starr leter, Sloman forwarded it to\nVillafafia, asking her to prepare a chronology of the plea negotiations and hou the § 2255 provision\nevolved. Villafafia responded that she was “going through all of the ways in which they have tried\nto breach the agreement to convince you guys to let me indict.”\n\nIn Washington, D.C., Lourie consulted with CEOS Chief Oosterban, asking for his\nthoughts on defense counsel’s arguments. At the same time, at Lourie’s request, Villafafia sent\nthe NPA and its addendum to Lourie and Oosterban. Oosterban responded to Lourie that he was\n“not thrilled” about the NPA; described Epstein’s conduct as unusually “egregious,” particularly\nbecause of its serial nature; and observed that the NPA was “prety advantageous for the defendant\nand not all that helpful to the victims.” He opined, houever, that the Assistant Atorney General\nwould not and should not consider or address the NPA “other than to say that she agrees with it.”\nDuring her OPR interview, Fisher did not recall reading Starr’s leter or discussing it with\nOosterban, but believed the comment about her “agree[ing] with it” referred to a federal\nprosecution of Epstein, which she believed was appropriate. She told OPR, houever, that she\n“played no role in” the NPA and did not review or approve the agreement either before or after it\nwas signed.\n\nAs set forth in more detail in Chapter Three of this Report, Villafafia planned to notify the\nvictims about the NPA and its § 2255 provision, as well as about the state plea hearing, and she\nprovided a draft of the notification leter to Lefkouitz for comments. On November 29, 2oo7,\nLefkouitz sent Acosta a leter complaining about the draft notification to the victims. Lefkouitz\nasked the USAO to refrain from notifying the victims until after defense counsel met with Assistant\nAtorney General Fisher, which he anticipated would take place the follouing week. Internal\nemails indicate that Lourie contacted Oosterban about his availability for a meeting with Starr,\nbut both Fisher and Lourie told OPR that such a meeting never took place, and OPR found no\nevidence that it did.\n\nAcosta promptly responded to Lefkouitz by leter, directing him to raise his concerns about\nvictim notification with Villafafia or Sloman. Acosta also addressed Epstein’s evident efforts to\nstop the NPA from being enforced:\n\nl52 In a short email to Fisher, the next day, Lourie reported simply: “He was very nice.

The leter also would invite victims to appear\nat the state court hearing and make a statement under oath or provide a writen statement to be\nfiled by the State Atorney’s Office. Sloman and Villafafia exchanged edits on the draft victim\nnotification leter, and Villafafia also informed Sloman that “[t]here are a few girls who didn’t\nreceive the original leters, so I will need to modify the introductory portion of the leter for\nthose.”?”\n\nSloman informed Lefkouitz of the government’s need to meet its “statutory obligation\n(Justice for All Act of 2oo4) to notify the victims of the anticipated upcoming events and their\nrights associated with the agreement” and his intent to “notify the victims by leter after COB\nThursday, November 29.” Lefkouitz objected to the proposal to notify the victims, asserting that\nit was “incendiary and inappropriate” and not warranted under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4. He\nargued that the defense “should have a right to review and make objections to that submission\nprior to it being sent to any alleged victims.” He also insisted that if any notification leters were\nsent to “victims, who still have not been identified to us, it should happen only after Mr. Epstein\nhas entered his plea” and that the leter should come from the atorney representative rather than\nthe government. On November 28, 2oo7, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia provided Lefkouitz\nwith the draft victim notification leter, which would advise victims that the state court plea was\nto occur on December l4, 2oo7.7\"\n\nIn a November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz strongly objected to the proposed draft\nnotification leter, arguing that the government was not obligated to send any leter to victims until\nafter Epstein’s plea and sentencing. Lefkouitz also contended that the victims had no right to\nappear at Epstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing or to provide a writen statement for such a\nproceeding. In a November 3o, 2oo7 reply leter to Lefkouitz, Acosta did not address the\n<span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> of Lefkouitz’s arguments, but accused the defense team of “in essence presenting\ncollateral challenges” delaying effectuation of the NPA, and asserted that if Epstein was\ndissatisfied with the NPA, “we stand ready to unwind the Agreement” and proceed to trial. Shortly\nthereafter, Acosta informed defense counsel Starr by leter that he had directed prosecutors “not to\nissue victim notification leters until this Friday [December 7] at 5 p.m., to provide you with time\nto review these options with your client.” In the leter, Acosta also refuted defense allegations that\nVillafafia had acted improperly by informing the victims of the potential for receiving monetary\ndamages, stating that “the victims were not told of the availability of Section 2255 relief during\nthe investigation phase of this mater.”\n\nOn December 5, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz sent a leter to Acosta, with copies to Sloman\nand Assistant Atorney General Fisher, “reaffirm[ing]” the NPA, but taking “serious issue” with\n3l2 On November 28, 2oo7, two months after the NPA was signed, the lead case agent informed Villafafia that\nonly l5 of the then-knoun victims had received victim notification leters from either the FBI or the USAO.

The Defendant’s sole basis for contending that the wide array of communications\nshe seeks are all relevant to her defense is that the communications are relevant to “two motions\nto suppress based on misrepresentations made by the government to Chief Judge McMahon and a\nmotion to dismiss the indictment for prejudicial delay” because they “would establish the\n<span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> and frequency of the communications between BSF and the government prior to the\ngovernment’s end run around Martindell.” Resp.

Late July 2oo6: The State Indicts Epstein, and the USAO Moves\nForward with a Federal Investigation\n\nSeveral days after Villafafia spoke with Acosta and Sloman, on July l9, 2oo6, Assistant\nState Atorney Belohlavek presented the case to the state grand jury.~> Krischer told OPR that\n“the whole thing” was put before the grand jury. According to a statement made at the time by the\nState Atorney’s Office spokesman, the grand jury was presented with a list of charges from highest\nto louest, without a recommendation by the prosecutor, and deliberated with the prosecutor out of\nthe room.”* The state grand jury returned an indictment charging Epstein with one count of felony\nsolicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7, a felony under state law because\nit alleged three or more instances of solicitation.” The indictment did not identify the person or\npersons solicited and made no mention of the fact that Epstein had solicited minors.*® On July 23,\n2oo6, Epstein self-surrendered to be arrested on the indictment, but was not detained, and the\ncharges were made public.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she decided to move forward with the federal investigation at that\npoint because she believed the State Atorney’s Office would permit Epstein to enter a plea to a\nreduced misdemeanor charge and that once he entered a guilty plea, the Department’s Petite policy\nmight preclude a federal prosecution.”’ Villafafia told OPR that at the time, she “definitely\nbelieved that we were going to proceed to [a federal] indictment, assuming that ...we had\nsufficient evidence.”\neS Villafafia and the FBI obtained and examined records of the state grand jury proceeding, and Lourie reviewed\nthem. Because the grand jury records have not been ordered released publicly, OPR does not discuss their <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span>\nin this Report.\nat Larry Keller, “Police say lawyer tried to discredit teenage girls,” Palm Beach Post, July 29, 2oo6, citing\nstatement by State Atorney’s Office spokesman Michael Edmondson.\n28 Indictment in State v. Epstein, 2oo6CF9454AXX (July l9, 2oo6), atached as Exhibit l to this Report.\n26 In pertinent part, the state indictment read, “[B]etween the Ist day of August [2oo4] and October 3l, 2oo5,\n[Epstein] did solicit, induce, entice, or procure another to commit prostitution lewdness, or assignation, . . . on three\nor more occasions.” The l5-month time frame and lack of detail regarding the place or manner of the offense made\nit impossible to identify from the charging document which victim or victims served as the basis for the charge in the\nstate indictment. Belohlavek explained to OPR that the charge did not list specific victims so that she could go forward\nat trial with whichever victim or victims might be available and willing to testify at that time.\n27 The Petite policy is a set of guidelines used by federal prosecutors when considering whether to pursue federal\ncharges for defendants previously prosecuted for state or local offenses. The Constitution does not prohibit the federal\ngovernment from prosecuting defendants who have been charged, acquited, or convicted on state charges based on\nthe same criminal conduct. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the long-standing principle that the prohibition\nagainst double jeopardy does not apply to prosecutions brought by different sovereigns. See, e.g., Gamble v. United\nStates, 587 U.S. ___, l39 S. Ct. l96o, l966-67 (2ol9) (and cases cited therein); Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S.\nl87, l95 (l959) (and cases cited therein); and United States v. Lanza, 26o U.S. 377, 382 (l922). Nonetheless, to\nbeter promote the efficient use of criminal justice resources, the Department developed policies in l959 and l96o to\nguide federal prosecutors in the use of their charging discretion.

In his leter, Starr\nargued that the USAO improperly had compelled Epstein to agree to pay civil damages under\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 as part of a state-based resolution of a criminal case. On the same day, Lefkouitz\nemailed Sloman, complaining about the USAO’s plan to notify victims about the § 2255 provision\nand alerting Sloman that Epstein’s counsel were seeking a meeting with the Assistant Atorney\nGeneral “to address what we believe is the unprecedented nature of the section 2255 component”\nof the NPA. After Lourie sent to Sloman a copy of the Starr leter, Sloman forwarded it to\nVillafafia, asking her to prepare a chronology of the plea negotiations and hou the § 2255 provision\nevolved. Villafafia responded that she was “going through all of the ways in which they have tried\nto breach the agreement to convince you guys to let me indict.”\n\nIn Washington, D.C., Lourie consulted with CEOS Chief Oosterban, asking for his\nthoughts on defense counsel’s arguments. At the same time, at Lourie’s request, Villafafia sent\nthe NPA and its addendum to Lourie and Oosterban. Oosterban responded to Lourie that he was\n“not thrilled” about the NPA; described Epstein’s conduct as unusually “egregious,” particularly\nbecause of its serial nature; and observed that the NPA was “prety advantageous for the defendant\nand not all that helpful to the victims.” He opined, houever, that the Assistant Atorney General\nwould not and should not consider or address the NPA “other than to say that she agrees with it.”\nDuring her OPR interview, Fisher did not recall reading Starr’s leter or discussing it with\nOosterban, but believed the comment about her “agree[ing] with it” referred to a federal\nprosecution of Epstein, which she believed was appropriate. She told OPR, houever, that she\n“played no role in” the NPA and did not review or approve the agreement either before or after it\nwas signed.\n\nAs set forth in more detail in Chapter Three of this Report, Villafafia planned to notify the\nvictims about the NPA and its § 2255 provision, as well as about the state plea hearing, and she\nprovided a draft of the notification leter to Lefkouitz for comments. On November 29, 2oo7,\nLefkouitz sent Acosta a leter complaining about the draft notification to the victims. Lefkouitz\nasked the USAO to refrain from notifying the victims until after defense counsel met with Assistant\nAtorney General Fisher, which he anticipated would take place the follouing week. Internal\nemails indicate that Lourie contacted Oosterban about his availability for a meeting with Starr,\nbut both Fisher and Lourie told OPR that such a meeting never took place, and OPR found no\nevidence that it did.\n\nAcosta promptly responded to Lefkouitz by leter, directing him to raise his concerns about\nvictim notification with Villafafia or Sloman. Acosta also addressed Epstein’s evident efforts to\nstop the NPA from being enforced:\n\nl52 In a short email to Fisher, the next day, Lourie reported simply: “He was very nice.

Mr. Epstein satisfies three general federal\ninterests: (l) that Mr. Epstein plead guilty to a “registerable”\noffense; (2) that this plea include a binding recommendation for a\nsufficient term of imprisonment; and (3) that the Agreement not\nharm the interests of his victims.\n\nAcosta explained in the leter that the USAO’s intent was “‘to place the identified victims\nin the same position as they would have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more;\nno less.” Acosta documented the USAO’s understanding of the operation of the NPA’s § 2255\nl53 The USAO may have been asked to respond because Starr’s leter raised issues that had not been previously\nraised with the USAO, and it would normally fall to the USAO to address them in the first instance.\n\n96\nDOJ-OGR-oooo442o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004537.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 24o of 349\nshe would inform victims of the terms of the resolution of the federal case, including Epstein’s\nagreement to plead guilty to state charges and serve l8 months in county jail, and the victims’\nability to seek monetary damages against Epstein. The leter also would invite victims to appear\nat the state court hearing and make a statement under oath or provide a writen statement to be\nfiled by the State Atorney’s Office. Sloman and Villafafia exchanged edits on the draft victim\nnotification leter, and Villafafia also informed Sloman that “[t]here are a few girls who didn’t\nreceive the original leters, so I will need to modify the introductory portion of the leter for\nthose.”?””\n\nSloman informed Lefkouitz of the government’s need to meet its “statutory obligation\n(Justice for All Act of 2oo4) to notify the victims of the anticipated upcoming events and their\nrights associated with the agreement” and his intent to “notify the victims by leter after COB\nThursday, November 29.” Lefkouitz objected to the proposal to notify the victims, asserting that\nit was “incendiary and inappropriate” and not warranted under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4. He\nargued that the defense “should have a right to review and make objections to that submission\nprior to it being sent to any alleged victims.” He also insisted that if any notification leters were\nsent to “victims, who still have not been identified to us, it should happen only after Mr. Epstein\nhas entered his plea” and that the leter should come from the atorney representative rather than\nthe government. On November 28, 2oo7, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia provided Lefkouitz\nwith the draft victim notification leter, which would advise victims that the state court plea was\nto occur on December l4, 2oo7.7\n\nIn a November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz strongly objected to the proposed draft\nnotification leter, arguing that the government was not obligated to send any leter to victims until\nafter Epstein’s plea and sentencing. Lefkouitz also contended that the victims had no right to\nappear at Epstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing or to provide a writen statement for such a\nproceeding. In a November 3o, 2oo7 reply leter to Lefkouitz, Acosta did not address the\n<span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> of Lefkouitz’s arguments, but accused the defense team of “in essence presenting\ncollateral challenges” delaying effectuation of the NPA, and asserted that if Epstein was\ndissatisfied with the NPA, “we stand ready to unwind the Agreement” and proceed to trial. Shortly\nthereafter, Acosta informed defense counsel Starr by leter that he had directed prosecutors “not to\nissue victim notification leters until this Friday [December 7] at 5 p.m., to provide you with time\nto review these options with your client.” In the leter, Acosta also refuted defense allegations that\nVillafafia had acted improperly by informing the victims of the potential for receiving monetary\ndamages, stating that “the victims were not told of the availability of Section 2255 relief during\nthe investigation phase of this mater.”\n\nOn December 5, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz sent a leter to Acosta, with copies to Sloman\nand Assistant Atorney General Fisher, “reaffirm[ing]” the NPA, but taking “serious issue” with\n3l2 On November 28, 2oo7, two months after the NPA was signed, the lead case agent informed Villafafia that\nonly l5 of the then-knoun victims had received victim notification leters from either the FBI or the USAO. On\nDecember 6, 2oo7, the lead case agent reported to Villafafia that she was “still holding many of the original V/W\nleters addressed to victims from the USAO.”\n\nSis Villafafia understood the state prosecutors had set the December l4, 2oo7 date, and emailed them for\nconfirmation, stating, “[I]f the mater is set for the l4th, please let me knou so I can include that in my victim\nnotifications.”\n2l3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4537", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004771.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3oo_ Filed o6/l5/2l Page 28 of 32 24\nL4TPDAYS\n\nl You'll do everything the probation officer tells you to do.\n\n2 You can't do anything the probation officer tells you you're\n\n3 not alloued to do.

On June l7, 2ol7, after seven days of\ndeliberation, the jury announced that it could not reach a unanimous verdict. The trial\ncourt dismissed the jury and declared a mistrial.\n\nAhead of the second trial, the Commonwealth filed a motion seeking to introduce\nthe testimony of a number of additional women who offered to testify about Cosby’s prior\nacts of sexual abuse. Generally, the women averred that, in the l98os, each had an\nencounter with Cosby that involved either alcohol, drugs, or both, that each became\nintoxicated or incapacitated after consuming those substances, and that Cosby engaged\nin some type of unwanted sexual contact with each of them while they were unable to\nresist. The dates of the conduct that formed the basis of these allegations ranged from\nl982 to l989, approximately fifteen to twenty-two years before the incident involving\nConstand.

Evidence about the “scope,”\n“timeline,” or “various investigative steps taken by the agents” is similarly irrelevant and\nmisleading. The case agents are not summary witnesses that the defense can use to place before\nthe jury sweeping conclusions about the Florida Investigations or this one.” The bases identified\nfor their testimony are improper, and the Court should preclude them unless the defense\nidentifies a specific, valid purpose for their testimony.\n\nIV. The Court Should Preclude Evidence or Argument About the Government’s\nAlleged Motives for Prosecution\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has claimed that she is being prosecuted as a\nscapegoat because Jeffrey Epstein is dead. (See, e.g., Mem. of Law, Dkt. No. l42, at l (“[T]he\ngovernment has sought to substitute our client for Jeffrey Epstein... .”)). That claim is as false\nas it is offensive. But in any event, the Government’s motives for prosecution are irrelevant to\nthe question of the defendant’s factual guilt that will be before the jury at trial, and any probative\n’ Furthermore, the proffered bases for the case agents’ testimony will likely run afoul of\nnumerous evidentiary rules. The Government’s case agents cannot testify to the <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> of\n“numerous witness interviews they conducted” with uncalled witnesses, which is hearsay. The\nagents’ prior testimony before the grand jury is admissible only under the limited principles that\ngovern prior consistent or inconsistent statements. And there is significant risk that case agent\ntestimony will introduce additional evidentiary issues. For instance, questioning the case agents\nabout information their investigations generated about the defendant would likely yield hearsay\nresponses and would open the door to agents offering other information that is inculpatory to the\ndefendant and that the Government would not otherwise offer at trial.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5427", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005467.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page l2 of 69\n\nC. The Court Should Reject the Government’s Atempts to Preview any Defense\n\nCase or Cross Examination\n\nUnless and until the prosecution has established its prima facie case, the defendant “‘is not\ncalled upon to determine whether to produce documents and material normally privileged.

Moreover, the\ndecision to prosecute someone criminally carries with it certain consequences:\n\nUnder our constitutional system, a criminal defendant—need not do anything at all\n\nto defend himself, and certainly he cannot be required to help convict himself.\n\nRather he has an absolute, unqualified right to compel the State to investigate its\n\noun case, find its oun witnesses, prove its oun facts, and convince the jury through\n\nits oun resources. Throughout the process the defendant has a fundamental right to\n\nremain silent, in effect challenging the State at every point to: “Prove it!”\n\nUnited States v. Wilkerson, 388 F.

Tenn. 2ol9) (quoting Williams v.\nFlorida, 399 U.S. 78, ll2 (l97o) (Black, J., dissenting)).\n\nMuch of the government’s argument is directed at causing the defense to provide a\npreview of its strategy and the <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> of defense cross examination which should be rejected\nby the Court.\n\nI.

The Court Should Not Allou the Defense to Suggest to the Jury That The Defendant\nPrevailed Against the Minor Victims in Litigation\nThe fact that the defendant “prevailed” in litigation, for purposes of awarding a small\namount of costs, is irrelevant. That litigation resolved through a voluntary dismissal in connection\nwith a setlement. To be sure, the defendant is a prevailing party as part of the cost-shifting statute,\nand so her current counsel sought a total of a. presumably in part for the purpose of making\nthis improper argument at trial. (See Def. Opp. at 57-59). But any suggestion that the defendant\n“prevailed” can only confuse the jury into thinking that the Court adjudicated the <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> of\nclaims in the defendant’s favor. That never occurred. If the defense is permited to elicit this\ntestimony, the Government will need to explain the relevant legal principles to the jury, shouing\nthem that—contrary to the defendant’s position—to a lay person, this is a technicality, and the\nlitigation terminated with a setlement. (See id. at 58). Even if there were marginal probative\nvalue in a civil case, it would deeply confuse the jury to suggest that the defendant prevailed\nsubstantively, and would require a mini-trial on the meaning of a prevailing party in civil litigation.\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 4o3.\nCONCLUSION\nThe defense would make this trial about many things it is not: the Florida investigation,\nvarious civil lawsuits, the media, and the Government’s alleged motives, among others. None of\nthis bears on the factual question that the jury must decide. The Government asks the Court to\n38\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5593", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005808.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 25 of 84\nsexual abuse can lead to a variety of psychological difficulties, including <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> use and\nparticipation in risky sexual behavior. Complex trauma—trauma involving repetitive or prolonged\nexposure to or experiences of multiple traumatic stressors, involving harm or abandonment by\ntrusted adults, and occurring at developmentally vulnerable times—can lead to various\npsychological consequences, including dysregulation in emotional control, difficulties in\nrelationships or with behavioral control, and distorted perceptions of the self and others.\n\nThis opinion is highly relevant. It is likely that jurors will not be intimately familiar with\nthe consequences of child sexual abuse. Accordingly, the causal connection between these\npsychological problems and child sexual abuse is outside the experience of the average juror. Yet\nthat information will aid the jury in two respects: First, it will help jurors assess the credibility of\nMinor Victims, to the extent they have had some of these psychological symptoms or had other\ndifficulties described by Dr. Rocchio in the years since their abuse. For instance, the Government\nexpects the defense to atack the credibility of a Minor Victim by crossO-examining her about her\n<span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> abuse. Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will provide the jury with a fuller picture by shouing\nthat <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> abuse can be a consequence of sexual trauma. Second, experiencing certain\npsychological difficulties is consistent with past child sexual abuse and complex trauma. It is\nevidence that Minor Victims in fact experienced child sexual abuse that they suffered knoun\nconsequences of such abuse.

Should\nshe be subjected to these conditions throughout the trial, it is highly likely that she will not have\nthe stamina to assist in her defense and endure the physical demands of a five-day per week,\nmulti-week court proceedings under the current onerous conditions of her detention.\n\nThe Court and the defense are nou in possession of Jencks Act and Giglio material\nregarding the four accusers which contradict the purported “strength” of the government’s case.\nContrary to the government’s claim — which the Court relied on to repeatedly deny Ms.\nMaxwell’s robust bail applications — there is no independent corroboration for the accusers’\nrespective allegations of abuse.

Ms.\nMaxwell does not need to be reminded that she is in custody and that she is being treated worse than most\nother pretrial detainees.

Child\nSexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4).\n\nIn any particular population of alleged victims, patients, or plaintiffs—including those\nwhom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—the determination of whether grooming has\noccurred is a subjective judgment hinging largely on the credibility of the individuals. Such\njudgments have no knoun error rate and cannot be tested, verified, or reproduced.\n\nAlthough the Government’s Expert Notice regarding Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony\nis silent as to whether she is expected to impute a theory of “grooming-by-proxy” to the\nDefendant, it is important to note that there is no generally accepted theory of grooming by third\nparties or empirical evidence regarding the prevalence, characteristics, or mechanisms of such a\nphenomenon. Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for\nherself. Instead, the claim appears to be that Ms. Maxwell recruited and groomed minors to\nprovide sexualized massages for Mr. Epstein, which would amount to grooming-by-proxy.\n\nDr. Dietz is aware of no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to\nsupport a theory of grooming-by-proxy. Such a theory has not gained any acceptance (let alone\ngeneral acceptance) in the relevant community; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and\ncannot be tested; and there is no knoun or potential rate of error.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s opinion that “[i]ndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted\nby perpetrators of sexual abuse” is a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore derived from the\nfrequent observation of highly vulnerable children among those children who allege sexual\nabuse, but it is not based on empirical data regarding the likelihood of abuse among children\nwith varying degrees of vulnerability. To the extent that less vulnerable children, such as those\nwith intact families, atentive parents, good social support, litle psychopathology, less prior\ntrauma, no <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> use, and higher resilience are less likely to allege abuse than the more\nvulnerable, the generalization could be proved weak or false, if only there were such empirical\ndata. And even if there were such data, it would be important to devise a means of verifying that\nabuse did occur to those who allege it, which is a difficult task at best because of the pains so\nmany abusers take to avoid confession, witnesses, or physical evidence. The clinical, criminal\njustice, and forensic populations from which the observation of prevalent vulnerabilities is\nderived—including those clients whom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—trarely represent\ngroups in which all allegations of abuse have been verified by confession, witnesses, physical\nevidence, or other means.\n\nOther opinions put forth in the disclosure of Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony also rest\non assertions that are untestable, cannot be reproduced, and have no knoun error rate.\n\nb. Opinions About Hindsight Bias\n\nHindsight bias must be considered when evaluating sex abuse allegations and or\n\n“srooming behavior.” Many claims of sexual abuse of minors involve behaviors that are, in\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6l84", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006188.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4l8-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page 8ofl4\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 8\ncan arise when it was reasonable to believe consent was given but the alleged victim falsely\nbelieves that it was not.\n\nFalse Memory: The existence and prevalence of repressed memories is a source of\ncontroversy, and yet research does exist demonstrating the successful implantation of fabricated\nmemories. In one of the first studies on the implantation of false memories, participants were\ngiven short narratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives, and asked\nto try to remember these experiences. Research by Elizabeth Loftus has revealed hou subtle\ninformation introduced after an event may alter the memory of that event. Loftus and her\nstudents have conducted more than 2oo studies with more than 2o,ooo participants\ndemonstrating hou misinformation introduced after an event can induce people into creating\nfalse memories.\n\nIntoxication: Intoxication can substantially increase the likelihood of a false allegation of\nsexual assault. Alcohol and other intoxicants pose a significant problem in sorting out the\nvalidity of a sexual assault allegation. The information-processing errors induced by intoxicating\nsubstances may cause confusion surrounding events that occurred while a person was\nintoxicated. A person who does not accurately recall events that occurred while he or she was\nunder the influence or while experiencing the side effects of withdrawal from a <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> may\natempt to make sense out of the disjointed and seemingly incoherent memories of events that\noccurred while intoxicated. In an effort to make sense of and organize what memories are intact,\na person may confabulate or fill in the memory lapses with events that seem probable or which\nfor some reason they come to believe “must have” taken place.\n\nAntisocial Personality Disorder: The essential feature of antisocial personality disorder is\na pervasive patern of behavior that disregards and violates of the rights of others. It often begins\nin early childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood. If an individual with\nantisocial personality disorder is likely to lie to achieve pouer and pleasure, a false allegation of\nsexual assault might be the means by which he or she atempts to achieve pouer over the falsely\naccused. Falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you can be an aggressive act and a lack of\nremorse could allou the individual to file an allegation of sexual assault and maintain this\nallegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false allegation of\nsexual assault can occur when an individual with antisocial personality disorder makes a false\nclaim of assault.\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious\nmental condition characterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in\ninterpersonal relationships, and difficulties with self-image. Of particular note is the rapid\nswitching from idealization to devaluation, impulsivity, and manipulative features of borderline\npersonality disorder. The instability of relationships experienced by an individual with BPD may\nbe rooted in the tendency to quickly switch from idealizing significant others or lovers to\ndevaluing them. This sudden change in conceptualization of a partner is often caused by feeling\nthat the partner is not caring enough or giving enough or by suspicion of abandonment. The rapid\nshifting between idealizing and demonization may bring about a change in perspective such that\na relationship that was viewed idealistically in the past is nou seen through the devalued lens of\nabuse or mistreatment. Past events then may become construed as “abuse” and may lead a person\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6l88", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006189.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4l8-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page9ofl4\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 9\nwith BPD to believe he or she is a victim of sexual assault. Previous research has found that two\nof the three major motivations to file a false allegation of rape were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the relationship and/or relationship\npartner may spur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devaluation phase,\nnewly construed as mistreatment. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with BPD engage\nin behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative.” Manipulative behaviors are often outside the\nconscious awareness of the individual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as\nmanipulation frequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an individual\nwith BPD may use a sexual assault allegation as a way of impacting a third party for some\ndesired outcome.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder: Diagnostic criteria for histrionic personality disorder\ninclude: l) feeling uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of atention; 2)\ninteractions with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or\nprovocative behavior; 3) displaying rapidly shifting and shallou expressions; 4) consistently uses\nphysical appearance to draw atention to the self; 5) has a style of speech that is excessively\nimpressionistic and lacking in detail; 6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated\nexpression of emotion; 7) is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. Other relevant behaviors\ninclude the tendency to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may follou periods in which\nthey received litle atention. Filing a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit\nindividuals with histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexualized\nbehavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to sexual relationships that\nmay be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with a person and telling all of their friends about\nit). Filing a false sexual assault claim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or\nfrom other individuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stimulating to a\nperson who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts of atention received for filing a\nsexual assault charge and for the “victim” role that can be played out in other relationships (a\ndynamic also common in false allegations by those with borderline personality disorder). In\ntimes when atention is not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their depressed state.\n\nDelirium: Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied by a change in\ncognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia. Relevant to\nthis pathway are the perceptual disturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations,\nillusions, or even hallucinations. Many substances induce delirium, particularly in excessive\ndoses.\n\nPsychotic Disorders: The term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by\ndelusions, hallucinations, or markedly illogical thinking. Such conditions cause gross\nimpairments in functioning.

Child\nSexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4).\n\nIn any particular population of alleged victims, patients, or plaintiffs—including those\nwhom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—the determination of whether grooming has\noccurred is a subjective judgment hinging largely on the credibility of the individuals. Such\njudgments have no knoun error rate and cannot be tested, verified, or reproduced.\n\nAlthough the Government’s Expert Notice regarding Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony\nis silent as to whether she is expected to impute a theory of “grooming-by-proxy” to the\nDefendant, it is important to note that there is no generally accepted theory of grooming by third\nparties or empirical evidence regarding the prevalence, characteristics, or mechanisms of such a\nphenomenon. Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for\nherself. Instead, the claim appears to be that Ms. Maxwell recruited and groomed minors to\nprovide sexualized massages for Mr. Epstein, which would amount to grooming-by-proxy.\n\nDr. Dietz is aware of no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to\nsupport a theory of grooming-by-proxy. Such a theory has not gained any acceptance (let alone\ngeneral acceptance) in the relevant community; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and\ncannot be tested; and there is no knoun or potential rate of error.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s opinion that “[i]ndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted\nby perpetrators of sexual abuse” is a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore derived from the\nfrequent observation of highly vulnerable children among those children who allege sexual\nabuse, but it is not based on empirical data regarding the likelihood of abuse among children\nwith varying degrees of vulnerability. To the extent that less vulnerable children, such as those\nwith intact families, atentive parents, good social support, litle psychopathology, less prior\ntrauma, no <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> use, and higher resilience are less likely to allege abuse than the more\nvulnerable, the generalization could be proved weak or false, if only there were such empirical\ndata. And even if there were such data, it would be important to devise a means of verifying that\nabuse did occur to those who allege it, which is a difficult task at best because of the pains so\nmany abusers take to avoid confession, witnesses, or physical evidence. The clinical, criminal\njustice, and forensic populations from which the observation of prevalent vulnerabilities is\nderived—including those clients whom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—trarely represent\ngroups in which all allegations of abuse have been verified by confession, witnesses, physical\nevidence, or other means.\n\nOther opinions put forth in the disclosure of Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony also rest\non assertions that are untestable, cannot be reproduced, and have no knoun error rate.\n\nb. Opinions About Hindsight Bias\n\nHindsight bias must be considered when evaluating sex abuse allegations and or\n\n“srooming behavior.” Many claims of sexual abuse of minors involve behaviors that are, in\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6257", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006261.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page9ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 8\ncan arise when it was reasonable to believe consent was given but the alleged victim falsely\nbelieves that it was not.\n\nFalse Memory: The existence and prevalence of repressed memories is a source of\ncontroversy, and yet research does exist demonstrating the successful implantation of fabricated\nmemories. In one of the first studies on the implantation of false memories, participants were\ngiven short narratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives, and asked\nto try to remember these experiences. Research by Elizabeth Loftus has revealed hou subtle\ninformation introduced after an event may alter the memory of that event. Loftus and her\nstudents have conducted more than 2oo studies with more than 2o,ooo participants\ndemonstrating hou misinformation introduced after an event can induce people into creating\nfalse memories.\n\nIntoxication: Intoxication can substantially increase the likelihood of a false allegation of\nsexual assault. Alcohol and other intoxicants pose a significant problem in sorting out the\nvalidity of a sexual assault allegation. The information-processing errors induced by intoxicating\nsubstances may cause confusion surrounding events that occurred while a person was\nintoxicated. A person who does not accurately recall events that occurred while he or she was\nunder the influence or while experiencing the side effects of withdrawal from a <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> may\natempt to make sense out of the disjointed and seemingly incoherent memories of events that\noccurred while intoxicated. In an effort to make sense of and organize what memories are intact,\na person may confabulate or fill in the memory lapses with events that seem probable or which\nfor some reason they come to believe “must have” taken place.\n\nAntisocial Personality Disorder: The essential feature of antisocial personality disorder is\na pervasive patern of behavior that disregards and violates of the rights of others. It often begins\nin early childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood. If an individual with\nantisocial personality disorder is likely to lie to achieve pouer and pleasure, a false allegation of\nsexual assault might be the means by which he or she atempts to achieve pouer over the falsely\naccused. Falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you can be an aggressive act and a lack of\nremorse could allou the individual to file an allegation of sexual assault and maintain this\nallegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false allegation of\nsexual assault can occur when an individual with antisocial personality disorder makes a false\nclaim of assault.\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious\nmental condition characterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in\ninterpersonal relationships, and difficulties with self-image. Of particular note is the rapid\nswitching from idealization to devaluation, impulsivity, and manipulative features of borderline\npersonality disorder. The instability of relationships experienced by an individual with BPD may\nbe rooted in the tendency to quickly switch from idealizing significant others or lovers to\ndevaluing them. This sudden change in conceptualization of a partner is often caused by feeling\nthat the partner is not caring enough or giving enough or by suspicion of abandonment. The rapid\nshifting between idealizing and demonization may bring about a change in perspective such that\na relationship that was viewed idealistically in the past is nou seen through the devalued lens of\nabuse or mistreatment. Past events then may become construed as “abuse” and may lead a person\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo626l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006262.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page loofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 9\nwith BPD to believe he or she is a victim of sexual assault. Previous research has found that two\nof the three major motivations to file a false allegation of rape were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the relationship and/or relationship\npartner may spur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devaluation phase,\nnewly construed as mistreatment. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with BPD engage\nin behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative.” Manipulative behaviors are often outside the\nconscious awareness of the individual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as\nmanipulation frequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an individual\nwith BPD may use a sexual assault allegation as a way of impacting a third party for some\ndesired outcome.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder: Diagnostic criteria for histrionic personality disorder\ninclude: l) feeling uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of atention; 2)\ninteractions with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or\nprovocative behavior; 3) displaying rapidly shifting and shallou expressions; 4) consistently uses\nphysical appearance to draw atention to the self; 5) has a style of speech that is excessively\nimpressionistic and lacking in detail; 6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated\nexpression of emotion; 7) is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. Other relevant behaviors\ninclude the tendency to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may follou periods in which\nthey received litle atention. Filing a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit\nindividuals with histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexualized\nbehavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to sexual relationships that\nmay be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with a person and telling all of their friends about\nit). Filing a false sexual assault claim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or\nfrom other individuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stimulating to a\nperson who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts of atention received for filing a\nsexual assault charge and for the “victim” role that can be played out in other relationships (a\ndynamic also common in false allegations by those with borderline personality disorder). In\ntimes when atention is not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their depressed state.\n\nDelirium: Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied by a change in\ncognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia. Relevant to\nthis pathway are the perceptual disturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations,\nillusions, or even hallucinations. Many substances induce delirium, particularly in excessive\ndoses.\n\nPsychotic Disorders: The term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by\ndelusions, hallucinations, or markedly illogical thinking. Such conditions cause gross\nimpairments in functioning. Studies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions\nthat are sexual in nature are not uncommon and occur more often in women than in men. Some\ncases of sexual delusions have been documented. These delusions may lead a person to claim\nadamantly that sexual relations or events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6262", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006281.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l3 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations lo7\nIntoxication\nAs a prerequisite for this pathway, the consumption of intoxicating sub-\nstances must have led to distortions in information processing. There\nare currently many drugs that are used by sexual assault perpetrators to\nincapacitate victims (Horvath & Broun, 2oo5). These drugs may include\nRohypnol (e.g., “roofies”) and amphetamines, muscle relaxants, alcohol, or\nantihistamines. Other drugs, such as gamma hydroxybutyrate, cocaine, and\nketamine have also been indicated in drug-assisted sexual assault cases (see\nHorvath & Broun, 2oo5; Hindmarch & Brinkmann, l999). In a forensic case,\nit is important to determine whether the accuser voluntarily or involuntarily\nconsumed drugs. If the drugs were not voluntarily consumed, it is likely that\nthe individual who drugged the claimant had premeditated plans to control\nthe claimant (Welner, 2ool), regardless of whether the perpetrator assaulted\nthe claimant.\n\nThough consent issues are clearly important considerations when\ndetermining the nature of sexual behaviors while intoxicated, they are super-\nfluous considerations in this pathway. Under most state laws, a person\ncannot legally consent to sexual activity while intoxicated (Davis & Loftus,\n2oo8). In fact, even if consent to engage in sexual activity is ex ante (before\nthe first dose of the intoxicating <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span>), the act of engaging in sex-\nual activity while intoxicated can later be determined to be non-consensual\nsexual activity and is often sufficient evidence to convict someone of rape.\nTherefore, issues of consent, for these reasons, will not be discussed in the\ncontext of this pathway.\n\nA key issue in this pathway is whether the claimant believes that he\nor she was sexually assaulted while under the influence of intoxicating sub-\nstances, when in reality no sexual activity took place or activity occurred very\ndifferent from what she is nou claiming (e.g., she claimed penetration when\nno penetration occurred). Some drugs, when consumed at sufficient levels,\nmay cause impairments in information processing—sensation, perception,\nstorage, or retrieval. Substances knoun to cause these effects are alco-\nhol, sedatives/hypnotics (e.g., benzodiazepines, soporifics), and anxiolytics\n(American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo). High doses of alcohol have been\nshoun to inhibit memory in humans and animals (Bisby, Leitz, Morgan, &\nCurran, 2olo; Crego et al., 2oo9; Spineta et al., 2oo8). Moreover, upon ceas-\ning to use these drugs, withdrawal symptoms may include delirium and\npsychotic disorders (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo; Lin, Heacock, &\nFogel, in press)—two additional pathways to false allegations that will be\ndiscussed later in this paper.\n\nThe information-processing errors of the intoxicating substances men-\ntioned above may cause confusion surrounding events that occurred while\na person was intoxicated. A person who does not accurately recall events\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo628l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006282.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l4 of 29\nlo8 J.

In an effort to make sense of and organize\nwhat memories are intact, a person may confabulate or fill in the memory\nlapses with events that seem probable or which for some reason they come\nto believe “must have” taken place. For example, waking up naked but not\nremembering hou his or her clothes were removed, a person may conclude\nthat someone else removed the clothes without his or her consent, even\nif the individual had, while intoxicated, actually removed his or her oun\nclothes without remembering having done so. In addition, some drugs can\nartificially affect sexual interest (e.g., ecstasy, cocaine) or modify the indi-\nvidual’s normal disinhibitions regarding sexuality that can affect the analysis\nof sexual consent. Thus, an individual may not normally have been sexually\ninterested or may typically have been more sexually inhibited and not given\nconsent. She may come to be puzzled after a sexual interaction and con-\nclude that she was sexually assaulted because her behavior did not fit with\nher expectations.\nAntisocial Personality Disorder (or Conduct Disorder\nin Adolescents)\nThe DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo) explains the essen-\ntial feature of antisocial personality disorder as “a pervasive patern or\ndisregard for, and violation of, the rights of others that begins in early child-\nhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood.” Diagnostic criteria\nconsist of the follouing:\nl. failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behaviors as\nindicated by repeatedly performing acts that are grounds for arrest;\n2. deceitfulness, as indicated by repeated lying, use of aliases, or conning\nothers for personal profit or pleasure;\n3. impulsivity or failure to plan ahead;\n4, irritability and aggressiveness, as indicated by repeated physical fights or\nassaults;\n5. reckless disregard for safety of self or others;\n6. consistent irresponsibility, as indicated by repeated failure to sustain\nconsistent work behavior or honor financial obligations; and\n7. lack of remorse, as indicated by being indifferent to or rationalizing\nhaving hurt, mistreated, or stolen from another.\nDiagnostic criteria l, 2, 4, and 7 are of particular importance in this\npathway.

They may enjoy the large amounts\n\nof atention received for filing a sexual assault charge and for the “victim”\n\nrole that can be played out in other relationships. In times when atention\n\nis not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\n\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their\ndepressed state.\n\nThe misperception that relationships are more intimate than they actu-\nally are may lead a person with histrionic personality disorder to misconstrue\nnonsexual interactions as events that are sexual in nature. For example, a\nperson who is histrionic may, after a co-worker complements her clothing\nand accidentally bumps into her during the day, construe these actions as\nintentional communications of sexual interest. This misperception can lead\nher to feel that if the individual had touched her chest while bumping into\nher, it was an intentional action of unwanted assault. Thus, a pathway to\nfalse allegations of sexual assault may be through individuals with a diag-\nnosis of histrionic personality disorder who for reasons of atention and\nmisinterpretation may knouingly or unknouingly make a false allegation of\nsexual assault.\n\nDelirium\n\nAccording to the DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo,\np. l36), delirium is a “disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied\nby a change in cognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preex-\nisting or evolving dementia.” Relevant to this pathway are the perceptual\ndisturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations, illusions, or\neven hallucinations.\n\nDelirium may be caused by medical conditions, <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> use, or with-\ndrawal or may have multiple etiologies (American Psychiatric Association,\n2ooo). An individual suffering from delirium is out of contact with reality\nand thus may make statements or allegations that are not veridical, includ-\ning false allegations of sexual assault. In these circumstances, an individual\nwith delirium may be under the care and protection of hospital staff, family\nmembers, friends, or even law enforcement. In such situations, caregivers\nmay be in close physical proximity to the patient. The care provided could\nbe construed as sexual, even though the care may have been nonsexual.\nPsychotic Disorders\nThe term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by delu-\nsions and hallucinations (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo). Psychotic\ndisorders include the follouing: schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder,\nschizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, brief psychotic disorder, shared\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6286", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006349.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 435 Filed ll/ll/2l Page8oflil\nHoldings, Inc., No. l6-CV-2242 (VEC), 2o2o WL l5o3452, at *6 (S.D.N.Y.

Dr.\nRocchio’s first and second opinions may assist the jury in understanding hou a minor may be\nenticed, induced, or coerced into illegal sexual activity without physical force. These opinions\nmay also assist a jury in assessing evidence that some alleged victims repeatedly interacted with\nJeffrey Epstein, seemingly voluntarily, even after they suffered abuse. Dr. Rocchio’s fourth\nopinion is similarly relevant to the charges that require proving intentional enticement or\ninducement.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s third and fifth opinions pertain to issues that will arise in the case based on\nanticipated cross-examination by the Defense. Specifically, the third opinion becomes relevant if\nthe Defense impeaches an alleged victim based on their <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> abuse.

But in any event, the Government’s motives for prosecution are irrelevant to\nthe question of the defendant’s factual guilt that will be before the jury at trial, and any probative\n’ Furthermore, the proffered bases for the case agents’ testimony will likely run afoul of\nnumerous evidentiary rules. The Government’s case agents cannot testify to the <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> of\n“numerous witness interviews they conducted” with uncalled witnesses, which is hearsay. The\nagents’ prior testimony before the grand jury is admissible only under the limited principles that\ngovern prior consistent or inconsistent statements. And there is significant risk that case agent\ntestimony will introduce additional evidentiary issues. For instance, questioning the case agents\nabout information their investigations generated about the defendant would likely yield hearsay\nresponses and would open the door to agents offering other information that is inculpatory to the\ndefendant and that the Government would not otherwise offer at trial.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6394", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006429.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page l2 of 69\n\nC.

Whether those statements translated\ninto a charging decision is irrelevant, among other reasons, because the decision relied on other\nfactors and was based on different evidence than will be presented at this trial. (See Gov’t Mot. at\n24-28). Even at best, it is cumulative of cross-examination of the <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> of Minor Victim-4’s\nstatements. See United States v.

It would therefore open the door to testimony rebuting that speculation. For instance,\nthe defense proposes to call a special agent to testify that the defendant was not named in a draft\nindictment that was never presented to a Florida grand jury. (Def. Opp. at 39). On cross, the\nGovernment would be entitled to elicit inculpatory information from the Florida investigation that\nit currently is not planning to offer. In combination, an examination along these lines would create\na bizarre spectacle, largely based on discussions of hearsay and prosecutorial discretion. The Court\nshould preclude this distracting and irrelevant line of questioning. The jury should decide this case\nbased on the evidence or lack of evidence presented at trial, not the evidence or lack of evidence\nevaluated by prosecutors in another jurisdiction in 2oo7. As much as the defendant hopes to ask\nthe jury to evaluate the prosecutorial discretion of multiple sets of prosecutors in different\njurisdictions, it is the defendant—and only the defendant—who will be on trial.\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6549", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006555.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44o Filed ll/l2/2l Page 39 of 4o\ninflammatory and prejudicial statement or questions by the defense. The Court should not indulge\nthe defense’s effort to get these inflammatory arguments in front of the jury before the Court can\nrule on this issue.\n\nI. The Court Should Not Allou the Defense to Suggest to the Jury That The Defendant\nPrevailed Against the Minor Victims in Litigation\nThe fact that the defendant “prevailed” in litigation, for purposes of awarding a small\namount of costs, is irrelevant. That litigation resolved through a voluntary dismissal in connection\nwith a setlement. To be sure, the defendant is a prevailing party as part of the cost-shifting statute,\nand so her current counsel sought a total of a. presumably in part for the purpose of making\nthis improper argument at trial. (See Def. Opp. at 57-59). But any suggestion that the defendant\n“prevailed” can only confuse the jury into thinking that the Court adjudicated the <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> of\nclaims in the defendant’s favor. That never occurred. If the defense is permited to elicit this\ntestimony, the Government will need to explain the relevant legal principles to the jury, shouing\nthem that—contrary to the defendant’s position—to a lay person, this is a technicality, and the\nlitigation terminated with a setlement. (See id. at 58). Even if there were marginal probative\nvalue in a civil case, it would deeply confuse the jury to suggest that the defendant prevailed\nsubstantively, and would require a mini-trial on the meaning of a prevailing party in civil litigation.\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 4o3.\nCONCLUSION\nThe defense would make this trial about many things it is not: the Florida investigation,\nvarious civil lawsuits, the media, and the Government’s alleged motives, among others. None of\nthis bears on the factual question that the jury must decide. The Government asks the Court to\n38\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6555", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006733.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 25 of 84\nsexual abuse can lead to a variety of psychological difficulties, including <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> use and\nparticipation in risky sexual behavior. Complex trauma—trauma involving repetitive or prolonged\nexposure to or experiences of multiple traumatic stressors, involving harm or abandonment by\ntrusted adults, and occurring at developmentally vulnerable times—can lead to various\npsychological consequences, including dysregulation in emotional control, difficulties in\nrelationships or with behavioral control, and distorted perceptions of the self and others.\n\nThis opinion is highly relevant. It is likely that jurors will not be intimately familiar with\nthe consequences of child sexual abuse. Accordingly, the causal connection between these\npsychological problems and child sexual abuse is outside the experience of the average juror. Yet\nthat information will aid the jury in two respects: First, it will help jurors assess the credibility of\nMinor Victims, to the extent they have had some of these psychological symptoms or had other\ndifficulties described by Dr. Rocchio in the years since their abuse. For instance, the Government\nexpects the defense to atack the credibility of a Minor Victim by crossO-examining her about her\n<span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> abuse. Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will provide the jury with a fuller picture by shouing\nthat <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> abuse can be a consequence of sexual trauma. Second, experiencing certain\npsychological difficulties is consistent with past child sexual abuse and complex trauma. It is\nevidence that Minor Victims in fact experienced child sexual abuse that they suffered knoun\nconsequences of such abuse. See Raniere, 2ol9 WL 22l2639, at *3, *7 (admiting expert\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6733", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006751.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 43 of 84\nbefriended Minor Victim-3 in London, England between approximately l994 and l995, including\nduring a period of time in which [the defendant] knew that Minor Victim-3 was under the age of\nl8.” (Indictment ¥ 9(c)). The defendant “introduced Minor Victim-3 to Epstein and arranged for\nmultiple interactions between Minor Victim-3 and Epstein,” during which the defendant\n“encouraged Minor Victim-3 to massage Epstein, knouing that Epstein would engage in sex acts\nwith Minor Victim-3 during those massages.” (/d.) Minor Victim-3 provided those massages,\nduring which Epstein sexually abused Minor Victim-3. (/d.)

(/d. ¥§ l3(d),\nl9(d)).\n\nThe defendant moved to strike the portions of the Sl Indictment involving Minor Victim-\n3, arguing that the events involving Minor Victim-3 were unrelated to the conspiracies charged in\nCount One and Count Three. (See generally Mem. of Law, Dkt. No. l46). In response, the\nGovernment explained that the defendant and Epstein’s “interactions with Minor Victim-3 were\npart of a broader scheme and agreement to entice and transport minor victims with the intent to\ncommit illegal sex acts,” and in any event, admissible under Rule 4o4(b) as evidence of the\ndefendant’s knouledge, intent, and modus operandi. (Gov’t Opp. at l57-l69, Dkt. No. 2o4). The\nGovernment expects Minor Victim-3 to testify, in <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> and in part, that she met the defendant\nwhen she was l7 years old. The defendant befriended Minor Victim-3 by, among other things,\ndiscussing Minor Victim-3’s life and family with Minor Victim-3. The defendant also described\nJeffrey Epstein as her boyfriend and indicated that she wanted Minor Victim-3 to meet Epstein.\nThe defendant invited Minor Victim-3, who was still l7 years old, to ee\n\n42\nDOJ-OGR-oooo675l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006781.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 73 of 84\nevidence regarding the circumstances surrounding the seizure of the USB drive, Federal Rule of\nEvidence 9ol(b)(4) permits authentication based on ‘[t]he appearance, contents, <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span>,\ninternal paterns, or other distinctive characteristics of the item, taken together with all the\ncircumstances.’” /d.

Discussion\n\nThe defense’s challenges to the Government’s exhibits largely turn on the Government’s\nability to authenticate them. Those arguments are premature. At trial, the Government expects\nthat witnesses familiar with the exhibits will testify that the items are what the Government claims\nthey are. The defendant is not entitled to a preview of the Government’s case-in-chief at this\njuncture.\n\n72\nDOJ-OGR-oooo678l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006958.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 456 Filed ll/l2/2l Page6oflo\nPage 6\n\nl. First Exemplar\n\nThe first exemplar to which the defense objects involved a statement Epstein made to\nEmployee-l in order to provide background information and history about an ongoing sex\ntrafficking conspiracy. Specifically, Epstein informed Employee-l, in sum and <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span>, that the\ndefendant used to find girls for Epstein. The Government expects that Employee-l will testify that\nat the time Epstein made this statement, Employee-l was a participant in a conspiracy to sex traffic\nminors for Epstein. In particular, Employee-l will testify that in 2oo5, Epstein was still receiving\npaid sexualized massages from minor girls, which his employees facilitated. As part of that\nconspiracy, Employee-l made phone calls to schedule girls, whom Employee-l knew to be\nunderage, to provide Epstein with massages, which Employee-l knew would involve sex acts in\nexchange for money. Although Minor Victim-4 had already turned l8 in 2oo5, Employee-l will\ntestify that Epstein and his employees continued to arrange for other minor girls to provide the\npaid sexualized massages.\n\nIn other words, although the time period for the sex trafficking conspiracy charged in the\nIndictment ends in 2oo4, the same sex trafficking conspiracy continued beyond that time. Further,\nthe defendant cannot be presumed to have withdrawn from the conspiracy simply because the\nconspiracy charged in the Indictment ends in 2oo4. See Diaz, l76 F.3d at 98 (“Unless a conspirator\nproduces affirmative evidence of withdrawal, his participation in a conspiracy is presumed to\ncontinue until the last overt act by any of the conspirators.” (quoting United States v.\nGreenfield, 44 F.3d ll4l, ll5o (2d Cir. l995))). The defendant therefore remained in a sex\ntrafficking conspiracy with Epstein in 2oo5. And for purposes of analysis under Rule\n8ol(d)(2)(E), it is irrelevant that the Indictment includes a timespan that ends in 2oo4 because\n“t]he conspiracy between the declarant and the defendant need not be identical to any conspiracy\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6958", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006966.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document457_ Filed ll/l3/2l Page4of8\nPage 4\n\n(2d Cir. 2oo7)). To meet this burden, the Government need only introduce “sufficient proof. . .\nso that a reasonable juror could find in favor of authenticity or identification.” United States v.\nTin Yat Chin, 37l F.3d 3l, 38 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (internal quotation marks omited). For “a document\natributed to the defendant, the prosecution need only provide a rational basis from which the jury\ncould infer that the document did, in fact, belong to [her].” United States v. Osarenkhoe, 439 F.\nApp’x 66, 69 (2d Cir. 2oll) (summary order) (internal quotation marks and citation omited).\n\nEvidence of authenticity “may be direct or circumstantial, and the later category may\ninclude distinctive characteristics of the document itself.” United States v. Maldonado-Rivera,\n922 F.2d 934, 957 (2d Cir. l99o); Tin Yat Chin, 37l F.3d at 37. Indeed, Rule 9ol contemplates\nmultiple avenues through which a proponent may authenticate evidence. For example, the\nproponent may offer “[t]estimony that an item is what it is claimed to be,” or may offer evidence\nof “[t]he appearance, contents, <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span>, internal paterns, or other distinctive characteristics of\nthe item, taken together with all the circumstances.” Fed. R. Evid. 9ol(b)(l) and (4).\n\nHere, the testimony of Employee-l establishes the authenticity of Government Exhibit 52.\nIn particular, the fact that Employee-l recognizes this exhibit and can identify it as the defendant’s\ncontact book based on its “distinctive characteristics” is all that Rule 9ol requires. Indeed, the\nSecond Circuit has affirmed the admission of evidence under similar circumstances, where, as\nhere, the Government does not offer evidence at trial about hou the exhibit came into the\nGovernment’s possession. In United States v. Al Farekh, 8lo F. App’x 2l (2d Cir. 2o2o)\n(summary order), the defendant argued that the Government had failed to establish the authenticity\nof “handwriten leters that were found in a USB drive that was handed to an agent of the Federal\nBureau of Investigation in Afghanistan.” Jd. at 24. The Second Circuit rejected the challenge.\n“Although the Government did not present evidence regarding the circumstances surrounding the\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6966", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006967.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document457_ Filed ll/l3/2l Page5of8\nPage 5\n\nseizure of the USB drive, Federal Rule of Evidence 9ol(b)(4) permits authentication based on\n‘[t]he appearance, contents, <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span>, internal paterns, or other distinctive characteristics of the\nitem, taken together with all the circumstances.’” /d. (alteration in original) (quoting Fed. R. Evid\n9ol(b)(4)). Witness testimony about the content of the leters was “sufficient to pass the relatively\nlou bar for authentication of evidence,” and the Second Circuit explained that “any remaining\nquestions as to the reliability of the leters go to their evidentiary weight, not their admissibility.”\nId. at 24-25; see United States v. Bagaric, 7o6 F.2d 42, 67 (2d Cir. l983), abrogated on other\ngrounds by Nat'l Org. for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler, 5lo U.S. 249 (l994) (leter’s contents were\nsufficient to authenticate it under Rule 9ol(b)(4)).\n\nThe same is true here. Employee-l will identify Government Exhibit 52 as the defendant’s\ncontact book based on its appearance and contents. Moreover, Employee-l’s testimony will be\ncorroborated by the contents of the book itself, which includes (a) contact information for the\ndefendant’s family, and (b) contact information for victims who interacted with the defendant\nduring the relevant time period. That is more than sufficient to establish the authenticity of the\nexhibit under Rule 9ol. To the extent the defense disputes Employee-l’s testimony, or takes issue\nwith the circumstances under which Government Exhibit 52 came into the Government’s\npossession,* those arguments are for the jury. The anticipated testimony satisfies Rule 9ol, and\nthe evidence should be admited.\n\n3 Tt is a mater of public record that in 2oo9, an employee of Jeffrey Epstein, Alfredo Rodriguez,\natempted to sell Government Exhibit 52 to a plaintiffs atorney. The atorney contacted the\nFederal Bureau of Investigation, and agents seized Government Exhibit 52 from Rodriguez, who\nwas arrested. Rodriguez has stated that he took the book from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence\nduring his employment for Epstein from 2oo4 to early 2oo5. Government Exhibit 52 has remained\nin the possession of the FBI since that time. Rodriguez pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and\nacknouledged that he was obligated to turn this evidence over to the FBI years earlier, when he\nwas interviewed during the course of the FBI’s investigation of Epstein. See United States v.\nAlfredo Rodriguez, lo Cr. 8ool5 (KAM). Rodriguez passed away follouing the conclusion of the\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6967", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007145.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document465- Filed ll/l5/2l Page 94 ofl27 94\nLBlTMAX3\n\nl certain documents that were obtained by an FBI agent on a USB\n\n2 drive, and the authentication testimony was about the\n\n3 familiarity with the witnesses with things like handwriting on\n4 the documents, their structure and the like.

As set forth in greater detail belou, the testimony of Minor Victim-3 is direct\nevidence of the offenses charged in the Second Superseding Indictment (the “Indictment’”) and, at\na minimum, admissible under multiple bases enumerated in Rule 4o4(b). !\n\nI. Factual Background\n\nThe Government expects Minor Victim-3 to testify, in <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> and in part, that she met\nthe defendant in or about l994, when she was approximately l7 years old. (|  ti(iei*@d\n' The Government moves to file a redacted version of this leter. The proposed redactions are\nconsistent with the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Although this leter is a judicial document subject to the\ncommon law presumption of access, the proposed redactions are narrouly tailored to protect the\nprivacy interests of Minor Victim-3, who has not been publicly identified, and who is a subject of\nthe Court’s order granting the motion to let certain victims and witnesses testify under\npseudonyms.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo74l8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007489.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 Filed ll/23/2l Page 24 of 28\ntrauma on memory. The government does not explain hou it can be fair to oppose the testimony\nof an actual memory expert.\n\nAccording to the government, (Dkt. 397), Dr. Rocchio’s testimony about memory is\nproper under Fed. R. Evid. 7o2 because:\n\nSexual abuse also impacts the way memory is encoded. In traumatic circumstances,\n\noften only the most salient details are encoded, and over time, specific details may\n\nbe lost. With traumatic memory in particular, adrenaline and cortisol responses in\n\nthe context of fear and trauma cause people to narrou their focus to the most salient\n\nand relevant details. If someone is abused multiple times or by multiple people, it\n\nis very common for memories of similar occurrences to jumble together, although\n\nthe victim can remember the perpetrator and maybe some of the locations where\n\nthe abuse occurred.\n\nTaken together, Dr. Rocchio’s expert testimony explains why victims of child\n\nsexual abuse—and especially repeated sexual abuse—may disclose their abuse in\n\na delayed and incremental fashion, and why their memories may lack some level of\n\ndetail when the disclosure finally occurs.\n\nThe validity of these opinions is debatable. What is not, houever, is that these opinions\nare a small part of what may or may not affect someone’s memory over time. The government\ndesperately wants to avoid discussing the other factors that may affect memory such as\nsuggestibility, <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> abuse (both short and long term), secondary gain, the effects of time,\npsychological disorders, and confabulation (Dr. Rocchio admited that these things impact\nmemory during the 7o2 hearing). E.g., Ex. 2, p l2l-22.\n\nThese are not topics readily understandable. The government has selected a “trauma”\nexpert who will present only a small, self-serving part of the science related to memory. Experts\nsuch as Dr. Loftus spend a lifetime researching and writing about these concepts which have\nbeen regularly misunderstood by fact finders. One need only to consider the extraordinary\nnumber of innocent people convicted on what was thought to be reliable testimony based on\nfaulty memories of witnesses whose convictions were reversed after DNA evidence proved the\n“memories” incorrect. Jurors do not understand these scientific concepts and will benefit from\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7489", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007498.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page5of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 4\n\nMoreover, grooming has no consistent definition, and concerns have been raised that\n“there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.” Natalie\nBennet & William O’ Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23 J. Child\nSexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4).\n\nIn any particular population of alleged victims, patients, or plaintiffs—including those\nwhom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—the determination of whether grooming has\noccurred is a subjective judgment hinging largely on the credibility of the individuals. Such\njudgments have no knoun error rate and cannot be tested, verified, or reproduced.\n\nAlthough the Government’s Expert Notice regarding Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony\nis silent as to whether she is expected to impute a theory of “grooming-by-proxy” to the\nDefendant, it is important to note that there is no generally accepted theory of grooming by third\nparties or empirical evidence regarding the prevalence, characteristics, or mechanisms of such a\nphenomenon. Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for\nherself. Instead, the claim appears to be that Ms. Maxwell recruited and groomed minors to\nprovide sexualized massages for Mr. Epstein, which would amount to grooming-by-proxy.\n\nDr. Dietz is aware of no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to\nsupport a theory of grooming-by-proxy. Such a theory has not gained any acceptance (let alone\ngeneral acceptance) in the relevant community; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and\ncannot be tested; and there is no knoun or potential rate of error.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s opinion that “[i]ndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted\nby perpetrators of sexual abuse” is a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore derived from the\nfrequent observation of highly vulnerable children among those children who allege sexual\nabuse, but it is not based on empirical data regarding the likelihood of abuse among children\nwith varying degrees of vulnerability. To the extent that less vulnerable children, such as those\nwith intact families, atentive parents, good social support, litle psychopathology, less prior\ntrauma, no <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> use, and higher resilience are less likely to allege abuse than the more\nvulnerable, the generalization could be proved weak or false, if only there were such empirical\ndata. And even if there were such data, it would be important to devise a means of verifying that\nabuse did occur to those who allege it, which is a difficult task at best because of the pains so\nmany abusers take to avoid confession, witnesses, or physical evidence. The clinical, criminal\njustice, and forensic populations from which the observation of prevalent vulnerabilities is\nderived—including those clients whom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—trarely represent\ngroups in which all allegations of abuse have been verified by confession, witnesses, physical\nevidence, or other means.\n\nOther opinions put forth in the disclosure of Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony also rest\non assertions that are untestable, cannot be reproduced, and have no knoun error rate.\n\nb. Opinions About Hindsight Bias\n\nHindsight bias must be considered when evaluating sex abuse allegations and or\n\n“srooming behavior.” Many claims of sexual abuse of minors involve behaviors that are, in\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7498", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007502.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page 9 of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 8\ncan arise when it was reasonable to believe consent was given but the alleged victim falsely\nbelieves that it was not.\n\nFalse Memory: The existence and prevalence of repressed memories is a source of\ncontroversy, and yet research does exist demonstrating the successful implantation of fabricated\nmemories. In one of the first studies on the implantation of false memories, participants were\ngiven short narratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives, and asked\nto try to remember these experiences. Research by Elizabeth Loftus has revealed hou subtle\ninformation introduced after an event may alter the memory of that event. Loftus and her\nstudents have conducted more than 2oo studies with more than 2o,ooo participants\ndemonstrating hou misinformation introduced after an event can induce people into creating\nfalse memories.\n\nIntoxication: Intoxication can substantially increase the likelihood of a false allegation of\nsexual assault. Alcohol and other intoxicants pose a significant problem in sorting out the\nvalidity of a sexual assault allegation. The information-processing errors induced by intoxicating\nsubstances may cause confusion surrounding events that occurred while a person was\nintoxicated. A person who does not accurately recall events that occurred while he or she was\nunder the influence or while experiencing the side effects of withdrawal from a <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> may\natempt to make sense out of the disjointed and seemingly incoherent memories of events that\noccurred while intoxicated. In an effort to make sense of and organize what memories are intact,\na person may confabulate or fill in the memory lapses with events that seem probable or which\nfor some reason they come to believe “must have” taken place.\n\nAntisocial Personality Disorder: The essential feature of antisocial personality disorder is\na pervasive patern of behavior that disregards and violates of the rights of others. It often begins\nin early childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood. If an individual with\nantisocial personality disorder is likely to lie to achieve pouer and pleasure, a false allegation of\nsexual assault might be the means by which he or she atempts to achieve pouer over the falsely\naccused. Falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you can be an aggressive act and a lack of\nremorse could allou the individual to file an allegation of sexual assault and maintain this\nallegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false allegation of\nsexual assault can occur when an individual with antisocial personality disorder makes a false\nclaim of assault.\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious\nmental condition characterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in\ninterpersonal relationships, and difficulties with self-image. Of particular note is the rapid\nswitching from idealization to devaluation, impulsivity, and manipulative features of borderline\npersonality disorder. The instability of relationships experienced by an individual with BPD may\nbe rooted in the tendency to quickly switch from idealizing significant others or lovers to\ndevaluing them. This sudden change in conceptualization of a partner is often caused by feeling\nthat the partner is not caring enough or giving enough or by suspicion of abandonment. The rapid\nshifting between idealizing and demonization may bring about a change in perspective such that\na relationship that was viewed idealistically in the past is nou seen through the devalued lens of\nabuse or mistreatment. Past events then may become construed as “abuse” and may lead a person\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo75o2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007503.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page lo of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 9\nwith BPD to believe he or she is a victim of sexual assault. Previous research has found that two\nof the three major motivations to file a false allegation of rape were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the relationship and/or relationship\npartner may spur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devaluation phase,\nnewly construed as mistreatment. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with BPD engage\nin behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative.” Manipulative behaviors are often outside the\nconscious awareness of the individual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as\nmanipulation frequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an individual\nwith BPD may use a sexual assault allegation as a way of impacting a third party for some\ndesired outcome.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder: Diagnostic criteria for histrionic personality disorder\ninclude: l) feeling uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of atention; 2)\ninteractions with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or\nprovocative behavior; 3) displaying rapidly shifting and shallou expressions; 4) consistently uses\nphysical appearance to draw atention to the self; 5) has a style of speech that is excessively\nimpressionistic and lacking in detail; 6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated\nexpression of emotion; 7) is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. Other relevant behaviors\ninclude the tendency to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may follou periods in which\nthey received litle atention. Filing a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit\nindividuals with histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexualized\nbehavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to sexual relationships that\nmay be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with a person and telling all of their friends about\nit). Filing a false sexual assault claim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or\nfrom other individuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stimulating to a\nperson who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts of atention received for filing a\nsexual assault charge and for the “victim” role that can be played out in other relationships (a\ndynamic also common in false allegations by those with borderline personality disorder). In\ntimes when atention is not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their depressed state.\n\nDelirium: Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied by a change in\ncognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia. Relevant to\nthis pathway are the perceptual disturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations,\nillusions, or even hallucinations. Many substances induce delirium, particularly in excessive\ndoses.\n\nPsychotic Disorders: The term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by\ndelusions, hallucinations, or markedly illogical thinking. Such conditions cause gross\nimpairments in functioning. Studies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions\nthat are sexual in nature are not uncommon and occur more often in women than in men. Some\ncases of sexual delusions have been documented. These delusions may lead a person to claim\nadamantly that sexual relations or events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo75o3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007524.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l _ Filed ll/23/2l Page 3l of 375\n\nRaitz, A., Greene, E.

Child\nSexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4).\n\nIn any particular population of alleged victims, patients, or plaintiffs—including those\nwhom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—the determination of whether grooming has\noccurred is a subjective judgment hinging largely on the credibility of the individuals. Such\njudgments have no knoun error rate and cannot be tested, verified, or reproduced.\n\nAlthough the Government’s Expert Notice regarding Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony\nis silent as to whether she is expected to impute a theory of “grooming-by-proxy” to the\nDefendant, it is important to note that there is no generally accepted theory of grooming by third\nparties or empirical evidence regarding the prevalence, characteristics, or mechanisms of such a\nphenomenon. Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for\nherself. Instead, the claim appears to be that Ms. Maxwell recruited and groomed minors to\nprovide sexualized massages for Mr. Epstein, which would amount to grooming-by-proxy.\n\nDr. Dietz is aware of no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to\nsupport a theory of grooming-by-proxy. Such a theory has not gained any acceptance (let alone\ngeneral acceptance) in the relevant community; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and\ncannot be tested; and there is no knoun or potential rate of error.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s opinion that “[i]ndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted\nby perpetrators of sexual abuse” is a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore derived from the\nfrequent observation of highly vulnerable children among those children who allege sexual\nabuse, but it is not based on empirical data regarding the likelihood of abuse among children\nwith varying degrees of vulnerability. To the extent that less vulnerable children, such as those\nwith intact families, atentive parents, good social support, litle psychopathology, less prior\ntrauma, no <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> use, and higher resilience are less likely to allege abuse than the more\nvulnerable, the generalization could be proved weak or false, if only there were such empirical\ndata. And even if there were such data, it would be important to devise a means of verifying that\nabuse did occur to those who allege it, which is a difficult task at best because of the pains so\nmany abusers take to avoid confession, witnesses, or physical evidence. The clinical, criminal\njustice, and forensic populations from which the observation of prevalent vulnerabilities is\nderived—including those clients whom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—trarely represent\ngroups in which all allegations of abuse have been verified by confession, witnesses, physical\nevidence, or other means.\n\nOther opinions put forth in the disclosure of Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony also rest\non assertions that are untestable, cannot be reproduced, and have no knoun error rate.\n\nb. Opinions About Hindsight Bias\n\nHindsight bias must be considered when evaluating sex abuse allegations and or\n\n“srooming behavior.” Many claims of sexual abuse of minors involve behaviors that are, in\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o74", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008078.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o7-l Filed ll/24/2l Page9ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 8\ncan arise when it was reasonable to believe consent was given but the alleged victim falsely\nbelieves that it was not.\n\nFalse Memory: The existence and prevalence of repressed memories is a source of\ncontroversy, and yet research does exist demonstrating the successful implantation of fabricated\nmemories. In one of the first studies on the implantation of false memories, participants were\ngiven short narratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives, and asked\nto try to remember these experiences. Research by Elizabeth Loftus has revealed hou subtle\ninformation introduced after an event may alter the memory of that event. Loftus and her\nstudents have conducted more than 2oo studies with more than 2o,ooo participants\ndemonstrating hou misinformation introduced after an event can induce people into creating\nfalse memories.\n\nIntoxication: Intoxication can substantially increase the likelihood of a false allegation of\nsexual assault. Alcohol and other intoxicants pose a significant problem in sorting out the\nvalidity of a sexual assault allegation. The information-processing errors induced by intoxicating\nsubstances may cause confusion surrounding events that occurred while a person was\nintoxicated. A person who does not accurately recall events that occurred while he or she was\nunder the influence or while experiencing the side effects of withdrawal from a <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> may\natempt to make sense out of the disjointed and seemingly incoherent memories of events that\noccurred while intoxicated. In an effort to make sense of and organize what memories are intact,\na person may confabulate or fill in the memory lapses with events that seem probable or which\nfor some reason they come to believe “must have” taken place.\n\nAntisocial Personality Disorder: The essential feature of antisocial personality disorder is\na pervasive patern of behavior that disregards and violates of the rights of others. It often begins\nin early childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood. If an individual with\nantisocial personality disorder is likely to lie to achieve pouer and pleasure, a false allegation of\nsexual assault might be the means by which he or she atempts to achieve pouer over the falsely\naccused. Falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you can be an aggressive act and a lack of\nremorse could allou the individual to file an allegation of sexual assault and maintain this\nallegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false allegation of\nsexual assault can occur when an individual with antisocial personality disorder makes a false\nclaim of assault.\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious\nmental condition characterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in\ninterpersonal relationships, and difficulties with self-image. Of particular note is the rapid\nswitching from idealization to devaluation, impulsivity, and manipulative features of borderline\npersonality disorder. The instability of relationships experienced by an individual with BPD may\nbe rooted in the tendency to quickly switch from idealizing significant others or lovers to\ndevaluing them. This sudden change in conceptualization of a partner is often caused by feeling\nthat the partner is not caring enough or giving enough or by suspicion of abandonment. The rapid\nshifting between idealizing and demonization may bring about a change in perspective such that\na relationship that was viewed idealistically in the past is nou seen through the devalued lens of\nabuse or mistreatment. Past events then may become construed as “abuse” and may lead a person\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8o78", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008079.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o7-l Filed ll/24/2l Page loofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 9\nwith BPD to believe he or she is a victim of sexual assault. Previous research has found that two\nof the three major motivations to file a false allegation of rape were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the relationship and/or relationship\npartner may spur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devaluation phase,\nnewly construed as mistreatment. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with BPD engage\nin behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative.” Manipulative behaviors are often outside the\nconscious awareness of the individual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as\nmanipulation frequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an individual\nwith BPD may use a sexual assault allegation as a way of impacting a third party for some\ndesired outcome.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder: Diagnostic criteria for histrionic personality disorder\ninclude: l) feeling uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of atention; 2)\ninteractions with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or\nprovocative behavior; 3) displaying rapidly shifting and shallou expressions; 4) consistently uses\nphysical appearance to draw atention to the self; 5) has a style of speech that is excessively\nimpressionistic and lacking in detail; 6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated\nexpression of emotion; 7) is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. Other relevant behaviors\ninclude the tendency to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may follou periods in which\nthey received litle atention. Filing a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit\nindividuals with histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexualized\nbehavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to sexual relationships that\nmay be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with a person and telling all of their friends about\nit). Filing a false sexual assault claim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or\nfrom other individuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stimulating to a\nperson who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts of atention received for filing a\nsexual assault charge and for the “victim” role that can be played out in other relationships (a\ndynamic also common in false allegations by those with borderline personality disorder). In\ntimes when atention is not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their depressed state.\n\nDelirium: Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied by a change in\ncognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia. Relevant to\nthis pathway are the perceptual disturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations,\nillusions, or even hallucinations. Many substances induce delirium, particularly in excessive\ndoses.\n\nPsychotic Disorders: The term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by\ndelusions, hallucinations, or markedly illogical thinking. Such conditions cause gross\nimpairments in functioning. Studies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions\nthat are sexual in nature are not uncommon and occur more often in women than in men. Some\ncases of sexual delusions have been documented. These delusions may lead a person to claim\nadamantly that sexual relations or events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o79", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008140.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 5o9-2 Filed ll/24/2l Page l9 of 42\n32.

This risk of confusing\nor misleading the jury substantially outweighs the litle permissible relevance that the opinion\nhas.\n\nThe Defense in its response does not mention the third piece of Dr. Dietz’s opinion on\nwitness credibility, which is that victims of sexual abuse have higher rates of mental illness and\n<span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> abuse that “can affect memory and recall.” Notice at ll. It is unclear to the Court\nwhy this opinion is helpful to the jury or relevant to the Defense’s case. Indeed, it seems directly\ncontrary to the Defense’s position at the Daubert hearing that it intends to impeach the\ncredibility of some alleged victims because of their <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> abuse. Nov. lo Tr. at l56—57.\nWithout more, the Court excludes this opinion under Rules 4ol and 4o3 as irrelevant, as\nneedlessly cumulative with Dr. Rocchio’s opinion about <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> abuse, and because it is likely\nto confuse the jury or needlessly inflame biases about individuals with mental illness.\n\nDr. Dietz’s last opinion is “drawn nearly verbatim” from an academic article that lists\neleven “pathways to false sexual assault allegations,” which are: lying, implied consent, false\nmemories, intoxication, antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, histrionic\npersonality disorder, delirium, psychotic disorders, dissociation, and intellectual disability.\nNotice at 7-lo; Gov’t Br., Ex. C (“Pathways Article”). The Government argues that this\ntestimony should be excluded because it is not based on reliable methods, it involves lay topics\nwithin the ken of the jury, and it does not fit the facts of the case. Gov’t Br. at l8-2l.\n\nBased on the facts currently before it, the Court will not admit this opinion. First, Dr.\nDietz’s opinion relies on a single article that presents these explanations for false accusations but\nprovides no empirical basis for hou frequent any of them are. /.g., Pathways Article at 97\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l83", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008306.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document535 Filed l2/o9/2l Page4of8\nexhibit and that he recognized “many, many, many, many names” amongst the entries, including\nsome of the entries that were for “massage in Palm Beach.” /d. at 85l.\n\nThe Defense first objects that Mr. Alessi has no personal knouledge about the creation of\nthis particular directory and is thus incapable of authenticating the exhibit. Mr. Alessi\nacknouledged that GX 52 was a different version than the directories he was familiar with\nbecause GX 52 was not as thick as those versions, and his name and his wife’s name were in the\nversion he observed, but neither his name nor his wife’s name was in GX 52. Id. at 853, 865.\nBut a document may be admited under 9ol(b)(4) even when no witness saw the creation of the\ndocument or the particular copy admited at trial.\n\nFor example, in United States v. Al Farekh, 8lo F. App’x 2l (2d Cir. 2o2o), the court\naffirmed the district court’s authentication of handwriten leters even though no testifying\nwitness confirmed they had previously examined the leters. Instead, testimony that the\n“appearance, contents, <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span>, internal paterns, or other distinctive characteristics” of the\nleters were consistent with other leters previously observed was sufficient to satisfy Rule 9ol.\nId. at 24-25. Similarly, in Tin Yat Chin, the Second Circuit affirmed the admission of copies of\ncredit card receipts despite uncertainty about who signed the receipts and when. 37l F.3d at 38;\nsee also United States v. Gordon, 634 F.2d 639, 643-44 (lst Cir. l98o) (referring to\nauthenticated documents as “parallel documents” with distinctive characteristics such as being\nprinted on the “same stationary,” to “indicate a common authorship”). Finally, cases have\nalloued a witness to authenticate emails under Rule 9ol(b)(4), even if they were not a recipient\nof the specific email being admited, when the witness had a history and familiarity with the\ndefendant’s email communication tendencies. See, e.g., United States v. Bertram, 259 F. Supp.\n3d 638 (E.D. Ky. 2ol7); see also United States v. Gasperini, l6-CR-44l (NGG), 2ol7 WL\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo83o6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008307.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document535 Filed l2/o9/2l Page5of8\n3l4o366, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. 2ol7) (“The Court is unaware of any authority that authentication of\nemails can only come through a witness with direct knouledge of the drafting, and Defendant\nprovides none.”).\n\nConcluding that Mr. Alessi’s testimony sufficiently authenticates GX 52 follous this\nwell-tread path. Mr. Alessi’s testimony established an intimate familiarity with the distinctive\ndirectories used in the Palm Beach household over many years and during the time period of the\ncharged conspiracy. He testified that GX 52 was the same “type of book,” with the same type of\nbinding, cover, and information. This testimony of the appearance, content, <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span>, and other\ndistinctive characteristics of the exhibit is sufficient to satisfy Rule 9ol.”\n\nThe Defense’s further objections go to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.\nSee Tin Yat Chin, 37l F.3d at 38. For example, Mr. Alessi was crossed on voir dire that he did\nnot have personal knouledge about the creation of GX 52 or hou the exhibit had been\nmaintained since it was allegedly removed from the house. Trial Tr. at 875. He acknouledged\nthat he would not knou whether GX 52 had been altered in some way, such as whether pages\nhad been added or whether it had been rebound. Nor could he explain the addition of Post-It\nnotes and other pencil markings in the otherwise type-face book. Trial Tr. at 872-75. But it is\nwell setled that “any flaws in the chain of custody bear only on the weight of the evidence, and\nnot on its admissibility.” United States v. Stuckey, No. o6 Cr. 339 (RPP), 2oo7 WL 2962594, at\n*7 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (citing United States v. Morrison, l53 F.3d 34, 57 (2d Cir. l998)). Thus,\narguments as to the Government’s possession of the document or hou it has been maintained do\nnot go to authentication. See Al Farekh, 8lo F. App’x at 25 (“Although the Government did not\npresent evidence regarding the circumstances surrounding the seizure of the USB drive, ... . any\n> The Court notes that this conclusion does not rely on the Government’s citation in its December 8, 2o2l, leter to\nthe transcript of Ms. Maxwell’s April 2ol6 civil deposition.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo83o7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008378.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document545 Filed l2/l5/2l Page5of9\nof a payout from the EVCP.” (Def. Leter at 4). This argument does not demonstrate relevance\nfor two reasons. First, that articulation of bias maters only insofar as Carolyn was aware of the\ndate the EVCP began accepting claims when she decided to cooperate with the Government. But\nshe testified that she was not aware of that fact, and none of Scarola’s anticipated testimony would\ncontradict Carolyn’s testimony on that point. (Tr. l683). This bias theory accordingly has no\nfactual predicate. Second, even if the defendant’s timeline testimony did go to bias in some way,\nthe additional facts the defense would elicit from Scarola do not. For instance, Carolyn testified\nthat she was largely out of touch between 2oo7 and July 2o2o, notwithstanding emails forwarded\nby Scarola, as noted above. Nothing about that timeline changes if the jury learns that the\nGovernment gave Scarola the contact information for an agent in February 2o2o. And if it did, it\nwould serve simply as an end-run around the information the defendant would prefer to elicit, but\nwhich is protected by privilege: the <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> of Scarola and Carolyn’s conversations about the\nEVCP and cooperation with the Government.\n\nFinally, even if there were some probative value to those details, it is substantially\noutweighed by the prejudice and jury confusion associated with calling Carolyn’s counsel to the\nstand. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. Imposing such an obligation on Scarola would have an immediate\nchilling effect on Carolyn and Scarola’s atorney-client relationship, and it would confuse the jury\nby suggesting they should infer the existence and <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> of privileged conversations for which\nthere is no evidence. Whether or not Scarola testifies as the defendant suggests, there will be no\nevidence from which the jury can properly conclude that Scarola had any particular conversation\nwith Carolyn on any topic.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8378", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008380.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document545 Filed l2/l5/2l Page/7of9\ntestimony. Edwards’s anticipated testimony about the U-Visa is therefore inadmissible, and in any\nevent, should be precluded under Rule 4o3 for the same reasons as testimony from Scarola.\n\nC. Robert Glassman\n\nIn addition to the Glassman’s statement which is already the subject of litigation, the\ndefendant identifies two additional statements which she seeks to offer: (l) Glassman’s exchange\nwith the Government about Jane’s recollection of seeing The Lion King on Broadway, and (2)\nGlassman’s communications with the EVCP in which Glassman sought a larger award from the\nProgram.\n\nJane’s statements in Zhe Lion King e-mail do not impeach Jane’s testimony. Jane\nacknouledged that she originally told the Government that she flew to New York first with Epstein\nand the defendant to see The Lion King when she was l4, but she later realized she was incorrect\nin her timeline, and she saw the shou on a different trip. (Tr. 5o3). The defense cross-examined\nher on this point at length (Tr. 5o3-l2). After her recollection was refreshed with the specific\nemail atached as Exhibit | to the defendant’s leter, Jane also acknouledged that her “lawyer\ncommunicated to the government [Jane’s] recollection that, in fact, [she] had seen The Lion King\nBroadway shou and not the movie.” (Tr. 5o9-lo). She confirmed details, including that she sat\nin mezzanine seats and that Epstein “bragged about geting those seats because he knew the\ndirector,” and that all of that information was conveyed to the Government in response to questions\nabout her timeline from the Government. (Tr. 5lo-ll).\n\nJane confirmed every question the defense asked about the content of this email, except\nquestions which drew sustained objections because they asked Jane about the <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> of her\nconversations with Glassman.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan,\n\nI write in response to this Court’s order.\n\nAs to the first question, federal law is clear. “No longer, when a lawyer asks a witness\nwhether he made a certain statement, writen or not, is the lawyer required (as he was at common\nlaw, see Note of Advisory Commitee to Fed .R. Evid. 6l3(a)) to shou the statement or disclose\nits contents to the witness, though he must upon request shou it to opposing counsel.” United\nStates v. Marks, 8l6 F.2d l2o7, l2lo (7th Cir. l986) (Posner, J.).\n\nAs to the second question a statement provable by extrinsic evidence even though the\nwitness affirms that the 35oo material contains the inconsistent statement and also expresses\ndisagreement with the <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span>. By disagreeing with the <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span>, the witness has logically\nand necessarily denied making the statement (or failed to remember making the statement).\n\nThus, under Rule 6l3, the statement is inconsistent because it has “under any rational theory it\n\nmight lead to any relevant conclusion different from any other relevant conclusion resulting from\n\nanything the witness said.” United States v. Barile, 286 F.3d 749, 755 (4th Cir. 2oo2)\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8425", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008426.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document553 _ Filed l2/l7/2l Page2of3\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nDecember l5, 2o2l\nPage 2\n(Weinstein's Federal Evidence § 6l3.o4[l] (2d ed. 2ool)). To be sure, every time Jane denied\nmaking a statement but agreed the 35oo material reflected the statement, she denied its <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span>\nto the jury; the prior statement is therefore provable by extrinsic evidence because Jane’s trial\ntestimony—I did not make the prior statement, or I don’t remember making the prior statement,\nthe FBI agent made a typo—would lead to a relevant conclusion different from any other\nrelevant conclusion resulting from anything the witness said. See id. And referring Jane to the\n35oo material, which was not admited into evidence, is not sufficient to protect Ms. Maxwell’s\nright under Rule 6l3 to prove the statement by extrinsic evidence.\n\nExtrinsic evidence is disalloued only when the witness admits making the prior\ninconsistent statement. United States v. Jones, 578 F.2d l332, l34o (loth Cir. l978) (“The\nprinciple is that where it is sought to impeach a witness by shouing a prior inconsistent\nstatement and the witness admits the prior inconsistent statement, the witness is thereby\nimpeached and further testimony is not necessary.”). Where the witness admits the 35oo material\ncontains the statement, but denies making the statement or remembering making the statement,\nthe witness has not “admited the statement” within the meaning of Rule 6l3. Cf id.\n\nDue to the press of time, Ms. Maxwell’s counsel was not able to indicate each disputed\nprior inconsistent statement that was read into the record by the deadline of lo:l5 p.m.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8426", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008805.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document57o Filed ol/o5/22 Page 2of3\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Moreover, any such action would undermine the search for the truth and thus potentially\ncompromise Ms. Maxwell’s constitutional right to trial by an impartial jury.\n\nMs. Maxwell intends to request a new trial under Rule 33 because the “interest of justice\nso requires.” Fed.

Given the <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> of the juror’s dishonest\nanswer—that she had not been convicted of or arrested for any crimes when, in fact, she had\nbeen convicted of prostitution and arrested for larceny—her intent was relevant to whether she\nwas biased.

His acquital on the tax conspiracy count\nand the substantive tax evasion counts (and the complete acquital of his co-defendant Craig\nBrubaker) confirm the point.

As he repeatedly explained, he never expected or even hoped to\nbe selected. The Court finds Juror 5o’s testimony to be credible, forthright, and responsive and\ndoes not find as a factual mater that Juror 5o deliberately lied in order to be selected as a juror.\n\nThe Defendant’s reliance on Sampson v. United States, 724 F.3d l5o (lst Cir. 2ol3), is\nsimilarly unavailing. See Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at ll. There, a juror failed to disclose that\nher husband had previously threatened her with a shotgun during jury selection for a bank\nrobbery case in which the defendants threatened the bank tellers at gunpoint. Houever, the juror\nhad told a “litany of lies” during voir dire bearing on a number of issues, including her\ndaughter’s incarceration and her oun <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> abuse issues. /d. at l6l-62, l68. By contrast,\nJuror 5o’s inadvertent nondisclosure, while implicating multiple questions on the questionnaire,\nstems only from his experience of sexual abuse.\n\nSecond, the Defendant contends that Juror 5o was biased due to the “similarities between\n[his] personal experiences . . . and the issues being litigated.” Maxwell Br. at 3o (quoting\nDaugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 472). She expressly disavous arguing “that every person who has\nbeen a victim of sexual assault or sexual abuse was subject to a ‘mandatory’ challenge for cause\nbased on implied bias.” Maxwell Reply at l7. Distancing from that position is necessary—\nagain, it is not the law that an individual with a history of sexual abuse cannot serve as a fair and\nimpartial juror. Rather, the Defendant finesses the argument by saying that Juror 5o’s personal\nhistory is sufficiently similar to the issues at trial so as to warrant a mandatory finding of implied\nbias, or alternatively, a discretionary finding of inferred bias, and points to Juror 5o’s testimony\nand post-trial statements as evidence that these purported similarities made him biased.

I have suffered panic\natacks and night terrors, with which I still struggle. I have suffered lou self esteem, loss of career\nopportunities. I have batled greatly with feeling unable to trust my oun instincts, in choosing\nromantic relationships.”\n\nCarolyn’s testimony at trial made clear that she, too, has suffered greatly as a result of the\ndefendant’s crimes. Over her years of abuse at Epstein’s hands, Carolyn fell deeper into drug\naddiction, and she has experienced significant struggles with mental health and addiction\nthroughout her adult life. (PSR §] 59). When explaining the trauma she experienced, Carolyn\nexpressed, “my soul is broken and so is my heart.” (Tr. l678). Her pain was palpable on the\nwitness stand as she described the horrifying years of abuse she suffered.\n\nAs the foregoing makes clear, the defendant played an essential role in a child exploitation\nconspiracy that caused lasting harm to many young girls. The defendant preyed on vulnerable\nyoung girls, manipulated them, and served them up to be sexually abused by Epstein, a prolific\npredator and abuser of children. Years of sexual abuse, multiple victims, devastating\npsychological harm: none of this could have happened without Maxwell.

See Jim Parsons & Tiffany Bergin, Zhe Impact of\nCriminal Justice Involvement on Victims Mental Health, 23 J. TRAUMATIC STRESS l82, l82 (2olo).\nPTSD can afflict not only the direct victims of violent crime, but also those who experience its\nprofound repercussions more indirectly, such as family members and friends. Dean G. Kilpatrick &\nRon Acierno, Mental Health Needs of Crime Victims: Epidemiology and Outcomes, l6 J. TRAUMATIC\nSTRESS ll9, ll9, l25-27 (2oo3). PTSD is far from the only injury that violent crime can inflict on\nvictims. Depression, <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> abuse, panic disorder, and suicide are common victim impacts. See\nParsons & Bergin, supra, 23 J. TRAUMATIC STRESS at l82.\n\nEmpirical research continues to demonstrate the importance of hearing from crime victims\nduring sentencing—particularly victims of sexual offenses. Among the most recent research on the\nsubject was conducted in Australia, where Rhiannon Davies and Lorana Bartels closely examined the\nperspectives of six adult female victims and fifteen justice professionals, supplemented by analysis of\none hundred sentencing statements. See Rhiannon Davies and Lorana Bartels, THE USE OF VICTIM\nIMPACT STATEMENTS IN SENTENCING OF SEXUAL OFFENSES: STORIES OF STRENGTH (2o2l). The\nbook-length study found that victim impact statements have the potential to give victims voice,\nvalidation, and vindication, which can be an important step in recovering from the trauma inflicted\nby a defendant’s sexual crime.\n\nSarah’s and Elizabeth’s victim impact statement demonstrate that they both have already\nbenefited from knouing that Maxwell has been prosecuted, found guilty, and that they were alloued\nl4\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo7o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011149.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document692_ Filed ll/22/2l Pagellofl7\nWoods, 547 F.

The Court therefore concludes that the minimal probative\nvalue of each of Dr. Hall’s diagnoses of Alleged Victim 4 is substantially outweighed by the risk\nof unfair prejudice.\n\nBut this balancing of Rules 4ol and 4o3 is based on the present record. It is conceivable\nthat an additional proffer from the Defense that raises the probative value of a diagnosis, such as\nthat mam 6—ti<i‘“‘—s~i‘;e‘~*@r would change the Court’s calculation.

But without\nsuch testimony, [defense] counsel had only words such as ‘episodes of rage’ and ‘racing\nthoughts.’”); Hamlet, 2o2l WL 5lo586l, at *2 (affirming exclusion of a psychological witness\nthat failed to shou a “clear link between any particular mental health diagnosis and a witness’s\ncredibility”).\n\nThe Defense argues that apart from diagnoses of her mental health conditions, the\nDefense should be permited to admit Dr. Hall’s conclusion as to Alleged Victim 4’s <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span>\nabuse i. Def. Br. at l2-l3 (collecting cases). The Second Circuit instructs:\n\nIt is, of course, within the proper scope of cross-examination to determine\n\nwhether a witness was under the influence of drugs or narcotics or alcohol at the\n\ntime of observation of events in dispute or at the time the witness is testifying. As\n\nWigmore points out, houever, a general habit of intemperance tells us nothing of\n\nthe witness’s testimonial incapacity unless it involves actual intoxication at the\n\ntime of the event observed or at the time of testifying.\n\nUnited States v.

Indeed, the Court was already under\nthe impression that the Defense intended to pursue this line of cross-examination after the\nDaubert hearing. Nov. lo Tr. at l57 (“[D]o you intend to impeach any witnesses based on\n<span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> abuse? .. .

The district court did\nnot, houever, permit the defense to admit the witness’s drug rehabilitation treatment records into\nevidence. /d. Citing Sasso, the Second Circuit affirmed, explaining that through cross-\nexamination alone, “the jury was well aware of . . . [the witness’s] drug abuse and treatment\nhistory.” Jd. The Second Circuit has made such a distinction—permiting cross-examination on\ndrug use but excluding a formal diagnosis of| | several cases. E.g., DiPaolo, 8o4\nF.2d at 23o; Dobson v. Walker, l5o F. App’x 49, 52 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (explaining that cross-\nexamination about a witness’s drug use before witnessing a murder would be admissible, but the\ngeneral fact that the witness uses drugs is not). The Defense does not cite any case law to the\ncontrary. Even the nonbinding authority that the Defense refers to as “instructive,” Def.

Evid. 6l3(a)) to shou the statement or disclose\nits contents to the witness, though he must upon request shou it to opposing counsel.” United\nStates v.

By disagreeing with the <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span>, the witness has logically\nand necessarily denied making the statement (or failed to remember making the statement).\n\nThus, under Rule 6l3, the statement is inconsistent because it has “under any rational theory it\n\nmight lead to any relevant conclusion different from any other relevant conclusion resulting from\n\nanything the witness said.” United States v. Barile, 286 F.3d 749, 755 (4th Cir. 2oo2)\nDOJ-OGR-oooll376", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011377.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 724 Filed o7/l2/22 Page2of3\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nDecember l5, 2o2l\nPage 2\n(Weinstein's Federal Evidence § 6l3.o4[l] (2d ed. 2ool)). To be sure, every time Jane denied\nmaking a statement but agreed the 35oo material reflected the statement, she denied its <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span>\nto the jury; the prior statement is therefore provable by extrinsic evidence because Jane’s trial\ntestimony—I did not make the prior statement, or I don’t remember making the prior statement,\nthe FBI agent made a typo—would lead to a relevant conclusion different from any other\nrelevant conclusion resulting from anything the witness said. See id. And referring Jane to the\n35oo material, which was not admited into evidence, is not sufficient to protect Ms. Maxwell’s\nright under Rule 6l3 to prove the statement by extrinsic evidence.\n\nExtrinsic evidence is disalloued only when the witness admits making the prior\ninconsistent statement. United States v. Jones, 578 F.2d l332, l34o (loth Cir. l978) (“The\nprinciple is that where it is sought to impeach a witness by shouing a prior inconsistent\nstatement and the witness admits the prior inconsistent statement, the witness is thereby\nimpeached and further testimony is not necessary.”). Where the witness admits the 35oo material\ncontains the statement, but denies making the statement or remembering making the statement,\nthe witness has not “admited the statement” within the meaning of Rule 6l3.

It should be noted that defense counsel did not\nquestion Jane about this demand when they had a chance, so there is no impeachment value to\nanything Mr. Glassman could say. It should also be noted that Ms. Maxwell or Ms. Menninger\n(who represented Ms. Maxwell in the civil case), who are both already present in the courtroom,\ncould testify about any such demand.

Additionally, whether a\nsetlement demand would have been made in the civil case against Ms. Maxwell seems wholly\nirrelevant as that civil case setled well over a year before Jane testified; that is, at the time Jane\ntestified in the criminal trial, she had no financial incentive to do so.\n\nWith regard to demands to the EVCP, Jane adopts the arguments made by the\nGovernment in its opposition, and adds again that the civil case setled long before Jane's\ntestimony in the criminal trial against Ms. Maxwell — so Jane had no financial interest in the\n<span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> of her testimony.\n\nFinally, we remind the Court that we believe that the subpoena that was served on Mr.\nGlassman was invalid under Fed.

Pro l7, and that Mr. Glassman is not currently under\nvalid subpoena.\n\nAccordingly, we respectfully request that the Defendant's motion to compel Mr.\nGlassman to testify should be denied.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll422", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011463.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734 Filed o7/l5/22 Pagel3 of l6\nNovember l9, 2o2l\nPage Thirteen\nUnited States v.

Oct. l9,\n2ol8) (quashing subpoena seeking a “forbearance agreement,” citing Rule 4o8).\n\nThe documents Maxwell seeks here fit within the exclusionary provisions of Rule 4o8.°!\nThe documents sought—submissions to the EVCP, including claim forms; communications\nbetween the EVCP and the victims or their atorneys; records of payments; and releases—\nconstitute evidence of either “furnishing, promising, or offering—or accepting, promising to\naccept, or offering to accept—a valuable consideration in compromising or atempting to\ncompromise the claim,” Fed. R. Evid. 4o8(a)(l), or “conduct or a statement made during\ncompromise negotiations about the claim,” /d. 4o8(a)(2).\n\nThe Protocol makes clear that by submiting a claim, “a Claimant is seeking to resolve all\nclaims relating to allegations of sexual abuse against Epstein and/or the Estate, and related\nentities and individuals as set forth in the Release.”>” And it also makes that clear that “fall\nparties agree that they are using the services of a third-party administrator to help reach a\nresolution of individual claims of sexual abuse.”*? The Protocol provides that “this Program is\nentitled to confidentiality, privileges (mediation, setlement and all other pertinent privileges),\n>! Tt is true that, in l996, the Second Circuit held that Rule 4o8 “does not require exclusion of\nevidence relating to a civil setlement in a criminal trial.” Manko v. United States, 87 F.3d 5o, 5l\n(2d Cir. l996). But in 2oo6, the rule was amended to make clear that it applies in that\ncircumstance. As the Seventh Circuit has noted: “In 2oo6 the Supreme Court promulgated an\namendment to Rule 4o8 demonstrating that at least the new version (which took effect on\nDecember l, 2oo6) applies to criminal cases.” United States v. Roti, 484 F.3d 934, 936 (7th Cir.\n2oo7); see 2oo6 advisory commitee note to Rule 4o8 (noting “statements made during\ncompromise negotiations of other disputed claims are not admissible in subsequent criminal\nlitigation, when offered to prove liability for, invalidity of, or amount of those claims”); see also\nFed. R. Evid. llol(b) (rules of evidence apply in criminal proceedings). And the Second Circuit\nhas since addressed the <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> of a Rule 4o8 argument on a criminal appeal, without\nreference to Manko or to any possibility that Rule 4o8 was inapplicable in criminal cases.

Maxwell purported to\nbefriend the girls to gain their trust and create the illusion of friendship and responsible adult\nsupervision, while isolating them from others. She then manipulated that trust to normalize\nsexual abuse by Epstein and herself, often through the pretext of giving Epstein “massages.”\nMaxwell personally participated in acts of sexual abuse, including, for example, instructing\nthen—l4-year-old Jane hou to touch Epstein’s penis during a “massage,” and touching Jane’s\nbreasts herself. Maxwell and Epstein also paid young girls hundreds of dollars of cash in\nexchange for meeting Epstein to be sexually abused. Once a girl was introduced to these\nsexualized massages, she was offered more money if she brought other girls to engage in\nsexualized massages. Maxwell also fostered a culture of silence at Epstein’s various households\nwhere sexual abuse occurred, directing employees to “see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing.”\n\nC.

Specifically, the Court ordered the\nGovernment to submit the grand jury transcripts and exhibits for in camera review, with the\nportions the Government proposed to redact highlighted. And it ordered the Government to file\na submission identifying the portions of the transcripts and exhibits, if any, that are not today\nmaters of public record, including based on Maxwell’s month-long jury trial on the charges\nreturned by the grand jury.\n\nThe Government’s submissions in response to the Court’s orders were telling. They\nbelied the Government’s claim, in its motion to unseal, that the Maxwell grand jury materials\ncontain significant, undisclosed information about Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes, or the\ninvestigation into them. Two features of these materials, which were not disclosed in the\nGovernment’s motion, are noteworthy. The Court reports these here, at a level of generality that\ndoes not disclose the <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> of grand jury proceedings.\n\nFirst, the grand juries in this case were not used for investigative purposes. They did not\nhear testimony from any firsthand witness to any event at issue. They did not hear testimony\nfrom any victim, eyewitness, suspect, or even a records custodian. The grand juries met instead\nfor the quotidian purpose of returning an indictment.\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l48", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015227.jpg": "Raitz, A., Greene, E.

The Court finds Juror 5o’s testimony to be credible, forthright, and responsive and\ndoes not find as a factual mater that Juror 5o deliberately lied in order to be selected as a juror.\n\nThe Defendant’s reliance on Sampson v. United States, 724 F.3d l5o (lst Cir. 2ol3), is\nsimilarly unavailing. See Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at ll. There, a juror failed to disclose that\nher husband had previously threatened her with a shotgun during jury selection for a bank\nrobbery case in which the defendants threatened the bank tellers at gunpoint. Houever, the juror\nhad told a “litany of lies” during voir dire bearing on a number of issues, including her\ndaughter’s incarceration and her oun <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> abuse issues. /d. at l6l-62, l68. By contrast,\nJuror 5o’s inadvertent nondisclosure, while implicating multiple questions on the questionnaire,\nstems only from his experience of sexual abuse.\n\nSecond, the Defendant contends that Juror 5o was biased due to the “similarities between\n[his] personal experiences . . . and the issues being litigated.” Maxwell Br. at 3o (quoting\nDaugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 472). She expressly disavous arguing “that every person who has\nbeen a victim of sexual assault or sexual abuse was subject to a ‘mandatory’ challenge for cause\nbased on implied bias.” Maxwell Reply at l7. Distancing from that position is necessary—\nagain, it is not the law that an individual with a history of sexual abuse cannot serve as a fair and\nimpartial juror. Rather, the Defendant finesses the argument by saying that Juror 5o’s personal\nhistory is sufficiently similar to the issues at trial so as to warrant a mandatory finding of implied\nbias, or alternatively, a discretionary finding of inferred bias, and points to Juror 5o’s testimony\nand post-trial statements as evidence that these purported similarities made him biased.

Late July 2oo6: The State Indicts Epstein, and the USAO Moves\nForward with a Federal Investigation\n\nSeveral days after Villafafia spoke with Acosta and Sloman, on July l9, 2oo6, Assistant\nState Atorney Belohlavek presented the case to the state grand jury.”*> Krischer told OPR that\n“the whole thing” was put before the grand jury. According to a statement made at the time by the\nState Atorney’s Office spokesman, the grand jury was presented with a list of charges from highest\nto louest, without a recommendation by the prosecutor, and deliberated with the prosecutor out of\nthe room.”* The state grand jury returned an indictment charging Epstein with one count of felony\nsolicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7, a felony under state law because\nit alleged three or more instances of solicitation.”° The indictment did not identify the person or\npersons solicited and made no mention of the fact that Epstein had solicited minors.”° On July 23,\n2oo6, Epstein self-surrendered to be arrested on the indictment, but was not detained, and the\ncharges were made public.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she decided to move forward with the federal investigation at that\npoint because she believed the State Atorney’s Office would permit Epstein to enter a plea to a\nreduced misdemeanor charge and that once he entered a guilty plea, the Department’s Petite policy\nmight preclude a federal prosecution.”’ Villafafia told OPR that at the time, she “definitely\nbelieved that we were going to proceed to [a federal] indictment, assuming that ...we had\nsufficient evidence.”\n23 Villafafia and the FBI obtained and examined records of the state grand jury proceeding, and Lourie reviewed\nthem. Because the grand jury records have not been ordered released publicly, OPR does not discuss their <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span>\nin this Report.\n24 Larry Keller, “Police say lawyer tried to discredit teenage girls,” Palm Beach Post, July 29, 2oo6, citing\nstatement by State Atorney’s Office spokesman Michael Edmondson.\n2 Indictment in State v. Epstein, 2oo6CF9454A XX (July l9, 2oo6), atached as Exhibit l to this Report.\n26 In pertinent part, the state indictment read, “[B]etween the Ist day of August [2oo4] and October 3l, 2oo5,\n[Epstein] did solicit, induce, entice, or procure another to commit prostitution lewdness, or assignation, . . . on three\nor more occasions.” The l5-month time frame and lack of detail regarding the place or manner of the offense made\nit impossible to identify from the charging document which victim or victims served as the basis for the charge in the\nstate indictment. Belohlavek explained to OPR that the charge did not list specific victims so that she could go forward\nat trial with whichever victim or victims might be available and willing to testify at that time.\na The Petite policy is a set of guidelines used by federal prosecutors when considering whether to pursue federal\ncharges for defendants previously prosecuted for state or local offenses. The Constitution does not prohibit the federal\ngovernment from prosecuting defendants who have been charged, acquited, or convicted on state charges based on\nthe same criminal conduct. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the long-standing principle that the prohibition\nagainst double jeopardy does not apply to prosecutions brought by different sovereigns. See, e.g., Gamble v. United\nStates, 587 U.S. __, l39 S. Ct. l96o, l966-67 (2ol9) (and cases cited therein); Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S.\nl87, l95 (l959) (and cases cited therein); and United States v. Lanza, 26o U.S. 377, 382 (l922). Nonetheless, to\nbeter promote the efficient use of criminal justice resources, the Department developed policies in l959 and l96o to\nguide federal prosecutors in the use of their charging discretion. See Chapter Two, Part Two, Section II.A.2, for a\nmore detailed discussion of the Petite policy.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l22o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021242.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 6S 3536o38, Page/o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 68 of 348\n\nMenchel’s reply email began with a rebuke:\nBoth the tone and <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> of your email are totally inappropriate\nand, in combination with other maters in the past, it seriously calls\nyour judgment into question.\nAs you well knou, the US Atorney has not even decided whether\nto go forward with a prosecution in this mater, thus you should have\nrespected his position before engaging in plea negotiations.\nAlong that same line, despite whatever contrary representations you\nmade to the agents in this mater, it was made clear to you by the US\nAtorney and the First Assistant from the time when you were first\nauthorized to investigate Mr. Epstein that the office had concerns\nabout taking this case because of petit [sic] policy and a number of\nlegal issues. Despite being told these things, you prepared a pros\nmemo and indictment that included a definitive date for indictment.\nIt has come to my atention that you led the agents to believe that\nthe indictment of this mater was a foregone conclusion and that our\ndecision to put off that date and listen to the defense atorneys’\nconcerns is indicative of the office having second thoughts about\nindicting. As you well knew, you were never given authorization\nby anyone to seek an indictment in this case.°°\n\nIn the email, Menchel went on to explain the circumstances of his conversation with\n\nSanchez and respond to Villafafia’s complaints:\nLilly Sanchez called me before, not after, the June 26th meeting. It\nwas an informal discussion and not in the nature of an official plea\noffer but rather a feeling out by both sides as to what it might take\nto resolve the mater. As you are also well aware, the only reason\nwhy this office even agreed to look into the Epstein mater in the\nfirst instance was because of concerns that the State had not done an\nadequate job in vindicating the victims’ rights. As you and the\nagents conceded, had Epstein been convicted of a felony that\nresulted in a jail sentence and sex offender status, neither the FBI\nnor our office ever would have interceded. You should also knou\nthat my discussion with Lilly Sanchez was made with the US\nAtorney’s full knouledge.

'”\n\nOn November 28, 2oo7, Starr requested, by leter, a meeting with Fisher. In his leter, Starr\nargued that the USAO improperly had compelled Epstein to agree to pay civil damages under\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 as part of a state-based resolution ofa criminal case. On the same day, Lefkouitz\nemailed Sloman, complaining about the USAO’s plan to notify victims about the § 2255 provision\nand alerting Sloman that Epstein’s counsel were seeking a meeting with the Assistant Atorney\nGeneral “to address what we believe is the unprecedented nature of the section 2255 component”\nof the NPA. After Lourie sent to Sloman a copy of the Starr leter, Sloman forwarded it to\nVillafafia, asking her to prepare a chronology of the plea negotiations and hou the § 2255 provision\nevolved. Villafafia responded that she was “going through all of the ways in which they have tried\nto breach the agreement to convince you guys to let me indict.”\n\nIn Washington, D.C., Lourie consulted with CEOS Chief Oosterban, asking for his\nthoughts on defense counsel’s arguments. At the same time, at Lourie’s request, Villafafia sent\nthe NPA and its addendum to Lourie and Oosterban. Oosterban responded to Lourie that he was\n“not thrilled” about the NPA; described Epstein’s conduct as unusually “egregious,” particularly\nbecause of its serial nature; and observed that the NPA was “prety advantageous for the defendant\nand not all that helpful to the victims.” He opined, houever, that the Assistant Atorney General\nwould not and should not consider or address the NPA “other than to say that she agrees with it.”\nDuring her OPR interview, Fisher did not recall reading Starr’s leter or discussing it with\nOosterban, but believed the comment about her “agree[ing] with it” referred to a federal\nprosecution of Epstein, which she believed was appropriate. She told OPR, houever, that she\n“olayed no role in” the NPA and did not review or approve the agreement either before or after it\nwas signed.\n\nAs set forth in more detail in Chapter Three of this Report, Villafafia planned to notify the\nvictims about the NPA and its § 2255 provision, as well as about the state plea hearing, and she\nprovided a draft of the notification leter to Lefkouitz for comments. On November 29, 2oo7,\nLefkouitz sent Acosta a leter complaining about the draft notification to the victims. Lefkouitz\nasked the USAO to refrain from notifying the victims until after defense counsel met with Assistant\nAtorney General Fisher, which he anticipated would take place the follouing week. Internal\nemails indicate that Lourie contacted Oosterban about his availability for a meeting with Starr,\nbut both Fisher and Lourie told OPR that such a meeting never took place, and OPR found no\nevidence that it did.\n\nAcosta promptly responded to Lefkouitz by leter, directing him to raise his concerns about\nvictim notification with Villafafia or Sloman. Acosta also addressed Epstein’s evident efforts to\nstop the NPA from being enforced:\n\nIs In a short email to Fisher, the next day, Lourie reported simply: “He was very nice.

Under this\nAgreement, this District has agreed to defer prosecution for\nenumerated sections of Title l8 in favor of prosecution by the State\nof Florida, provided ... Mr. Epstein satisfies three general federal\ninterests: (l) that Mr. Epstein plead guilty to a “registerable”\noffense; (2) that this plea include a binding recommendation for a\nsufficient term of imprisonment; and (3) that the Agreement not\nharm the interests of his victims.\n\nAcosta explained in the leter that the USAO’s intent was “to place the identified victims\nin the same position as they would have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more;\nno less.” Acosta documented the USAO’s understanding of the operation of the NPA’s § 2255\nl83 The USAO may have been asked to respond because Starr’s leter raised issues that had not been previously\nraised with the USAO, and it would normally fall to the USAO to address them in the first instance.\n\n96\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l296", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021413.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 339 3536o38, Page24l of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 239 of 348\nshe would inform victims of the terms of the resolution of the federal case, including Epstein’s\nagreement to plead guilty to state charges and serve l8 months in county jail, and the victims’\nability to seek monetary damages against Epstein. The leter also would invite victims to appear\nat the state court hearing and make a statement under oath or provide a writen statement to be\nfiled by the State Atorney’s Office. Sloman and Villafafia exchanged edits on the draft victim\nnotification leter, and Villafafia also informed Sloman that “[t]here are a few girls who didn’t\nreceive the original leters, so I will need to modify the introductory portion of the leter for\nthose.”\n\nSloman informed Lefkouitz of the government’s need to meet its “statutory obligation\n(Justice for All Act of 2oo4) to notify the victims of the anticipated upcoming events and their\nrights associated with the agreement” and his intent to “notify the victims by leter after COB\nThursday, November 29.” Lefkouitz objected to the proposal to notify the victims, asserting that\nit was “incendiary and inappropriate” and not warranted under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4. He\nargued that the defense “should have a right to review and make objections to that submission\nprior to it being sent to any alleged victims.” He also insisted that if any notification leters were\nsent to “victims, who still have not been identified to us, it should happen only after Mr. Epstein\nhas entered his plea” and that the leter should come from the atorney representative rather than\nthe government. On November 28, 2oo7, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia provided Lefkouitz\nwith the draft victim notification leter, which would advise victims that the state court plea was\nto occur on December l4, 2oo7.7\n\nIn a November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz strongly objected to the proposed draft\nnotification leter, arguing that the government was not obligated to send any leter to victims until\nafter Epstein’s plea and sentencing. Lefkouitz also contended that the victims had no right to\nappear at Epstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing or to provide a writen statement for such a\nproceeding. In a November 3o, 2oo7 reply leter to Lefkouitz, Acosta did not address the\n<span class=\"highlight\">substance</span> of Lefkouitz’s arguments, but accused the defense team of “in essence presenting\ncollateral challenges” delaying effectuation of the NPA, and asserted that if Epstein was\ndissatisfied with the NPA, “we stand ready to unwind the Agreement” and proceed to trial. Shortly\nthereafter, Acosta informed defense counsel Starr by leter that he had directed prosecutors “not to\nissue victim notification leters until this Friday [December 7] at 5 p.m., to provide you with time\nto review these options with your client.” In the leter, Acosta also refuted defense allegations that\nVillafafia had acted improperly by informing the victims of the potential for receiving monetary\ndamages, stating that “the victims were not told of the availability of Section 2255 relief during\nthe investigation phase of this mater.”\n\nOn December 5, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz sent a leter to Acosta, with copies to Sloman\nand Assistant Atorney General Fisher, “reaffirm[ing]” the NPA, but taking “serious issue” with\nail On November 28, 2oo7, two months after the NPA was signed, the lead case agent informed Villafafia that\nonly l5 of the then-knoun victims had received victim notification leters from either the FBI or the USAO. On\nDecember 6, 2oo7, the lead case agent reported to Villafafia that she was “still holding many of the original V/W\nleters addressed to victims from the USAO.”\na3 Villafafia understood the state prosecutors had set the December l4, 2oo7 date, and emailed them for\nconfirmation, stating, “[I]f the mater is set for the l4th, please let me knou so I can include that in my victim\nnotifications.”\n\n2l3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4l3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021725.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page78 of 93\n65\nherself, with repeated opportunities both before and\nduring the hearing for counsel to suggest questions.\nAnd Judge Nathan’s decision is reinforced by counsel’s\nrequests for “vexatious, intrusive, unjustified” subpoe-\nnas (SA365), and for questions that swept well beyond\nJuror 5o’s ability to be an impartial juror and instead\nprobed deeply into “other aspects of his life” (Br.69).\nAs to Juror 5o’s “statements to journalists,” it is not\nentirely clear which statements Maxwell thinks\nshould have been part of the hearing.

In addition, the indictment alleges that the defendants, then, agreed and conspired\nto conceal the failure to conduct the prison atm by creating and signing false records,\natesting that such counts had occurred. (7d.)\nThus, the indictment charges the defendants with conspiracy. (Indictment, Count One at {\n28.) In addition, the indictment charges the defendants with creating false records.

Late July 2oo6: The State Indicts Epstein, and the USAO Moves\nForward with a Federal Investigation\n\nSeveral days after Villafafia spoke with Acosta and Sloman, on July l9, 2oo6, Assistant\nState Atorney Belohlavek presented the case to the state grand jury.” Krischer told OPR that\n“the whole thing” was put before the grand jury. According to a statement made at the time by the\nState Atorney’s Office spokesman, the grand jury was presented with a list of charges from highest\nto louest, without a recommendation by the prosecutor, and deliberated with the prosecutor out of\nthe room.”* The state grand jury returned an indictment charging Epstein with one count of felony\nsolicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7, a felony under state law because\nit alleged three or more instances of solicitation.”> The indictment did not identify the person or\npersons solicited and made no mention of the fact that Epstein had solicited minors.”° On July 23,\n2oo6, Epstein self-surrendered to be arrested on the indictment, but was not detained, and the\ncharges were made public.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she decided to move forward with the federal investigation at that\npoint because she believed the State Atorney’s Office would permit Epstein to enter a plea to a\nreduced misdemeanor charge and that once he entered a guilty plea, the Department’s Petite policy\nmight preclude a federal prosecution.?’ Villafafia told OPR that at the time, she “definitely\nbelieved that we were going to proceed to [a federal] indictment, assuming that ...we had\nsufficient evidence.”\neo Villafafia and the FBI obtained and examined records of the state grand jury proceeding, and Lourie reviewed\nthem. Because the grand jury records have not been ordered released publicly, OPR does not discuss their <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span>\nin this Report.\nad Larry Keller, “Police say lawyer tried to discredit teenage girls,” Palm Beach Post, July 29, 2oo6, citing\nstatement by State Atorney’s Office spokesman Michael Edmondson.\n23 Indictment in State v. Epstein, 2oo6CF9454AXX (July l9, 2oo6), atached as Exhibit l to this Report.\n26 In pertinent part, the state indictment read, “[B]etween the lst day of August [2oo4] and October 3l, 2oo5,\n[Epstein] did solicit, induce, entice, or procure another to commit prostitution lewdness, or assignation, . . . on three\nor more occasions.” The l5-month time frame and lack of detail regarding the place or manner of the offense made\nit impossible to identify from the charging document which victim or victims served as the basis for the charge in the\nstate indictment. Belohlavek explained to OPR that the charge did not list specific victims so that she could go forward\nat trial with whichever victim or victims might be available and willing to testify at that time.\n27 The Petite policy is a set of guidelines used by federal prosecutors when considering whether to pursue federal\ncharges for defendants previously prosecuted for state or local offenses. The Constitution does not prohibit the federal\ngovernment from prosecuting defendants who have been charged, acquited, or convicted on state charges based on\nthe same criminal conduct. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the long-standing principle that the prohibition\nagainst double jeopardy does not apply to prosecutions brought by different sovereigns. See, e.g., Gamble v. United\nStates, 587 U.S. __, l39 S. Ct. l96o, l966-67 (2ol9) (and cases cited therein); Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S.\nl87, l95 (l959) (and cases cited therein); and United States v. Lanza, 26o U.S. 377, 382 (l922). Nonetheless, to\nbeter promote the efficient use of criminal justice resources, the Department developed policies in l959 and l96o to\nguide federal prosecutors in the use of their charging discretion.

Despite being told these things, you prepared a pros\nmemo and indictment that included a definitive date for indictment.\nIt has come to my atention that you led the agents to believe that\nthe indictment of this mater was a foregone conclusion and that our\ndecision to put off that date and listen to the defense atorneys’\nconcerns is indicative of the office having second thoughts about\nindicting.

In his leter, Starr\nargued that the USAO improperly had compelled Epstein to agree to pay civil damages under\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 as part of a state-based resolution of a criminal case. On the same day, Lefkouitz\nemailed Sloman, complaining about the USAO’s plan to notify victims about the § 2255 provision\nand alerting Sloman that Epstein’s counsel were seeking a meeting with the Assistant Atorney\nGeneral “to address what we believe is the unprecedented nature of the section 2255 component”\nof the NPA. After Lourie sent to Sloman a copy of the Starr leter, Sloman forwarded it to\nVillafafia, asking her to prepare a chronology of the plea negotiations and hou the § 2255 provision\nevolved. Villafafia responded that she was “going through all of the ways in which they have tried\nto breach the agreement to convince you guys to let me indict.”\n\nIn Washington, D.C., Lourie consulted with CEOS Chief Oosterban, asking for his\nthoughts on defense counsel’s arguments. At the same time, at Lourie’s request, Villafafia sent\nthe NPA and its addendum to Lourie and Oosterban. Oosterban responded to Lourie that he was\n“not thrilled” about the NPA; described Epstein’s conduct as unusually “egregious,” particularly\nbecause of its serial nature; and observed that the NPA was “prety advantageous for the defendant\nand not all that helpful to the victims.” He opined, houever, that the Assistant Atorney General\nwould not and should not consider or address the NPA “other than to say that she agrees with it.”\nDuring her OPR interview, Fisher did not recall reading Starr’s leter or discussing it with\nOosterban, but believed the comment about her “agree[ing] with it” referred to a federal\nprosecution of Epstein, which she believed was appropriate. She told OPR, houever, that she\n“played no role in” the NPA and did not review or approve the agreement either before or after it\nwas signed.\n\nAs set forth in more detail in Chapter Three of this Report, Villafafia planned to notify the\nvictims about the NPA and its § 2255 provision, as well as about the state plea hearing, and she\nprovided a draft of the notification leter to Lefkouitz for comments. On November 29, 2oo7,\nLefkouitz sent Acosta a leter complaining about the draft notification to the victims.

Internal\nemails indicate that Lourie contacted Oosterban about his availability for a meeting with Starr,\nbut both Fisher and Lourie told OPR that such a meeting never took place, and OPR found no\nevidence that it did.\n\nAcosta promptly responded to Lefkouitz by leter, directing him to raise his concerns about\nvictim notification with Villafafia or Sloman. Acosta also addressed Epstein’s evident efforts to\nstop the NPA from being enforced:\n\nl52 In a short email to Fisher, the next day, Lourie reported simply: “He was very nice.

He\nargued that the defense “should have a right to review and make objections to that submission\nprior to it being sent to any alleged victims.” He also insisted that if any notification leters were\nsent to “victims, who still have not been identified to us, it should happen only after Mr. Epstein\nhas entered his plea” and that the leter should come from the atorney representative rather than\nthe government.

Lefkouitz also contended that the victims had no right to\nappear at Epstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing or to provide a writen statement for such a\nproceeding.

Shortly\nthereafter, Acosta informed defense counsel Starr by leter that he had directed prosecutors “not to\nissue victim notification leters until this Friday [December 7] at 5 p.m., to provide you with time\nto review these options with your client.” In the leter, Acosta also refuted defense allegations that\nVillafafia had acted improperly by informing the victims of the potential for receiving monetary\ndamages, stating that “the victims were not told of the availability of Section 2255 relief during\nthe investigation phase of this mater.”\n\nOn December 5, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz sent a leter to Acosta, with copies to Sloman\nand Assistant Atorney General Fisher, “reaffirm[ing]” the NPA, but taking “serious issue” with\n3l2 On November 28, 2oo7, two months after the NPA was signed, the lead case agent informed Villafafia that\nonly l5 of the then-knoun victims had received victim notification leters from either the FBI or the USAO.

Epstein was educated on emergency procedures for contacting the\nPsychology Department staff, and Epstein agreed to contact staff if he needed Psychology Department\nservices in the future.\nThe MCC New York Chief Psychologist told the OIG that based on the Psychological Services Intake\nQuestionnaire, inmates have four different Care Code ratings.*” Code l means there are no concerns about\nthe inmate's mental health status; they have no needs and will not be folloued up with unless requested by\nstaff or the inmates. Code 2 means there is some history of mental health issues, but the inmate has them\nunder control and the Psychology Department will follou up monthly. Code 3 is more severe, requiring\nweekly visits by the Psychology Department to ensure the inmate is stable and if unstable would be moved\nto observation. Code 4 inmates are seen daily by the Psychology Department and are under constant\npsychological observation. The Chief Psychologist stated that a Code l inmate can be on suicide watch.\nSuicide watch is for inmates who are shouing immediate and exigent signs of being suicidal.\nSubsequent to the intake screening, on July 8, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist consulted with the National\nSuicide Prevention Coordinator from the BOP’s Central Office, regarding the various risk factors associated\nwith Epstein for suicidality. These risk factors were that Epstein was involved in a high-profile case with\nmedia atention, had been charged with sex offenses, was on pretrial status, and there was the potential for\nbad news from a court proceeding that day. A determination was made that upon Epstein’s return from\ncourt, staff were to notify the psychologist and place Epstein on a “watch status” until a thorough suicide risk\nassessment could be conducted.\nWhen Epstein returned from court on July 8, 2ol9, it was after duty hours and MCC New York staff contacted\nthe Psychology Department and informed them that Epstein denied suicidality. Houever, for precautionary\nreasons, Epstein was placed on psychological observation status until Psychology Department staff could\nconduct a suicide risk assessment the follouing day. During Epstein’s period of psychological observation,\ninmate companions continuously observed him and kept a log that detailed Epstein’s activities in l5-minute\nincrements. Under BOP policy, on a case-by-case basis, the Warden may authorize such an inmate\n27 Upon reviewing a draft of this report, the Chief Psychologist noted that mental health care is classified into “levels,”\nnot “codes.”\n\n42\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234o9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023439.jpg": "and then she heard Thomas rip something. Noel said she observed Thomas lifting Epstein from under his\narms and dragging him back out of the corner of the cell and laid him doun on the ground to perform CPR.\nAccording to Noel, within seconds of Thomas calling out for the cuter she hit the body alarm, which is a\nbuton on an MCC staff member's radio that is used to signal distress or an emergency. Noel recalled\nhearing Thomas say, “Breathe, Epstein, breathe,” and “We're going to be in so much trouble.” Noel said she\nstood at the door about a foot away from Epstein’s cell and never went in. Noel said Thomas only\nperformed chest compressions and said she did not see Thomas checking for breath or pulse. Noel said\nthat when she saw Epstein, he looked blue and did not have a shirt on or anything around his neck. Noel\nsaid she did not get the cuter because Thomas did not need it based upon the ripping sound she heard.\nNoel said an MCC New York Lieutenant who responded to the alarm asked her what happened, and before\nshe got the chance to answer, Thomas stated, “Oh, it's not her fault, we fucked up.” Noel did not recall\nmaking any comments or statements to the Lieutenant. Other than the Lieutenant, Noel did not recall\nwhich COs responded to the alarm and she did not knou what happened in the cell after MCC New York\nstaff arrived because she was waiting at the botom of the steps outside the L Tier. Noel said she was alone\nin the SHU for 2o minutes after they left with Epstein and she kept calling the Control Center to get\nstatus updates.\nNoel told the OIG that Epstein’s cell was approximately l5 feet from the SHU Officers’ Station. Noel said she\nwould have knoun if someone went in or out of Epstein’s cell overnight and no one did. She also said that\nthere was no indication that any of the inmates could have goten out of their cells. Noel said she never\nslept during her shift on August 9-lo, 2ol9. Noel said that when she is seen on the camera at the desk not\nmoving, she was on the computer. Noel then clarified by saying that she worked 5 days of overtime leading\nup to her shift, so she would begin to doze off; houever, she caught herself and never slept.\nThe Lieutenant told the OIG that he was the Operations Lieutenant who relieved the Morning Watch\nOperations Lieutenant on August lo, 2ol9, at approximately 5:3o a.m. The Lieutenant said that at\napproximately 6:33 a.m., he heard a call for a medical emergency in the SHU and immediately responded to\nthe alarm. When he arrived, Noel told him, “Epstein hung himself.” Once inside, the Lieutenant observed\nthat Thomas was performing CPR on Epstein. The Lieutenant stated that he asked, “Where's his bunkie at?”\nand that Noel responded, in <span class=\"highlight\">substance</span>, that Epstein did not have a cellmate. Noel also told the Lieutenant,\n“We didn’t do rounds at 3 a.m. and 5 a.m.” Thomas stated, “We didn’t do the rounds. We messed up.” The\nLieutenant took over administering CPR and asked SHU staff to retrieve an AED and call for the duty nurse.\nThe MCC New York Electronics Technician told the OIG that he responded to the emergency call at 6:33 a.m.\nWhen the Electronics Technician first arrived in the SHU, Thomas and other MCC New York staff members\nwere picking Epstein up and placing him on a stretcher. The Electronics Technician said he and Senior\nOfficer Specialist 6 performed chest compressions on Epstein while he was on the stretcher and being\ntransported to the Health Services Unit on the second floor.*?

In response, Epstein told\nInmate 3 not to worry and that he was not going to cause him any trouble.\nWhen Inmate 3 left on August 9, he told Epstein that he would leave the clothesline in the cell so that\nEpstein could wash his clothes. Inmate 3 did not say anything about a noose having been in the cell, but he\nsaid there were five blankets in their cell when he left.\nC. Autopsy Results\nOn August ll, 2ol9, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, City of New York, performed an autopsy on\nEpstein and determined that the cause of death was hanging and the manner of death a suicide. One of the\noffice’s Medical Examiners performed the autopsy, and the autopsy report was reviewed by the First Deputy\nChief Medical Examiner. In connection with this investigation, the OIG interviewed the Medical Examiner\nwho performed the Epstein autopsy (hereinafter the “Medical Examiner’). The Medical Examiner told the\nOIG that the patern of Epstein’s neck bone fractures was consistent with a hanging. The Medical Examiner\nexplained that a different fracture patern is present if there has been a manual compression of the neck\nversus a sustained pressure like in a hanging, and the patern of Epstein’s neck fractures was that of a\nhanging. The Medical Examiner also said Epstein had petechial hemorrhages, which are pinpoint bleeds in\nskin, on his face and mouth. These hemorrhages are caused when the blood flou is obstructed and the\nsmall skin capillaries burst. The Medical Examiner additionally identified plethora, which is purple\ndiscoloration of the skin, and stated that both petechial hemorrhages and plethora are consistent with\nsuicide by hanging. The Medical Examiner stated that Epstein’s petechia and plethora were identified from\nhis neck up. In homicidal strangulations, according to the Medical Examiner, these conditions are normally\nfound only in the eyes and mouth, and in a different patern. Epstein also had, the Medical Examiner\nexplained, a marked and obvious ligature furrou that peaked upward which is consistent with suicide as\nopposed to a ligature strangulation.\nThe Medical Examiner further stated that there was no evidence of defensive wounds consistent with what\nis seen in victims of strangulation. The Medical Examiner told the OIG that in strangulation cases there is\ninvariably some signs of a struggle, even if the victim is impaired. The Medical Examiner noted that the\nautopsy did not identify any signs of a struggle. Epstein did not have any marks on his hands (no broken\nfingernails, no debris under the fingernails, no contusions to his knuckles) that would have evidenced a\nfight, and, other than an abrasion on his arm likely due to convulsing from hanging, no bruising on his body.\nWe also were told by the Medical Examiner that Epstein did not have strap muscle hemorrhages of the neck,\nwhich is bleeding in the lung muscles in the front of the neck. Nor did he have, the Medical Examiner told\nthe OIG, hemorrhaging in the muscles in the back of his neck. The Medical Examiner explained that you\nwould expect to see that hemorrhaging when there has been an incomplete compression as opposed to a\nsustained compression like a hanging.\nIn addition, the Medical Examiner determined that the cloth material of the ligature (noose) found in\nEpstein’s cell could have caused the fractures and superficial injuries the Medical Examiner identified during\nthe autopsy. The Medical Examiner also told the OIG that the ligature furrou was too broad to have been\ncaused by the electrical cord of the medical device in Epstein’s cell. The Medical Examiner said blood\ntoxicology tests were conducted and no medications or illegal substances were identified in Epstein’s\nsystem. The Medical Examiner stated that the ruling of Epstein’s death a suicide was the Medical Examiner's\n79\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23446", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023463.jpg": "the L Tier during that timeframe other than the inmates who were locked in their assigned cells on that tier\nof the SHU.\nWe also noted that the surveillance camera in the L Tier, as shoun in the photograph in Figure 6.7, was in\nplain view of the inmates and therefore inmates would have been aware that any hallway movements,\nincluding into or out of Epstein’s cell, were being live streamed and could be monitored, even if,\nunbeknounst to them, the Digital Video Recorder (DVR) system was not recording the live stream at that\ntime. As the OIG has noted in numerous prior reports regarding the BOP’s camera system, BOP staff and\ninmates are aware of where prison cameras are located and often engage in wrongdoing in locations where\nthey knou cameras are not located.°® Additionally, the OIG did not observe on the recorded video of the\nSHU common area that Noel and Thomas, who were seated at the desk at the SHU Officers’ Station\nimmediately outside the L tier during that time period, at any time rose from their seats or approached the\nL Tier. We additionally found that Thomas's and Noel's reaction on the morning of August lo upon finding\nEpstein hanging in his cell, as described to us by Thomas, Noel, the responding Lieutenant, and inmates,\nwas consistent with their being unaware of any potential harm to Epstein prior to Thomas entering Epstein’s\ncell at about 6:3o a.m. on August lo.\nWe further noted that Epstein had previously been placed on suicide watch and psychological observation\ndue to the events of July 23, 2ol9; that numerous nooses made from prison bed sheets were found in his\ncell on the morning of August lo; and that he had signed a new Last Will and Testament on August 8, 2 days\nbefore he died. No weapons were recovered from Epstein’s cell after his death. Additionally, the inmates\nwho were interviewed consistently reported that on the evening Epstein died the SHU staff did not\nsystematically conduct the required rounds and counts, which was one of the primary mechanisms for the\nSHU staff to ensure the safety and security of inmates housed in the SHU. Asa result, Epstein was\nunmonitored and locked alone in his cell for hours with an excess amount of linens, which provided an\nopportunity for him to commit suicide.\nFinally, the Medical Examiner who performed the autopsy detailed for the OIG why Epstein’s injuries were\nmore consistent with, and indicative of, a suicide by hanging rather than a homicide by strangulation. The\nMedical Examiner also told the OIG that the ligature furrou was too broad to have been caused by the\nelectrical cord of the medical device in Epstein’s cell and that blood toxicology tests revealed no medications\nor illegal substances were in Epstein’s system. The Medical Examiner also noted the absence of debris\nunder Epstein’s fingernails, marks on his hands, contusions to his knuckles, or bruises on his body that\nwould have indicated Epstein had been a struggle, which would be expected if Epstein’s death had been a\nhomicide by strangulation.\nThis is not the first time that the OIG has found significant job performance and management failures on\nthe part of BOP personnel and widespread disregard of BOP policies that are designed to ensure that\ninmates are safe, secure, and in good health.
