Ghislaine\nwas no exception in deeply absorbing, exhibiting and living these values. For example, | think it\nis no small feat to train and become a helicopter pilot, an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT),\nsubmersible pilot and more, as they all require dedication, concentration and quick thinking and\nreactions and no small amount of courage. These are not the usual pursuits of a\n“flipbberti-gibbet” or a “socialite”, terms with which my sister has been branded with to this day.\nGhislaine was always an extremely generous, thoughtful and kind host in New York to her many\nsiblings including me, and her many nieces and nephews which | deeply appreciated. She also\nhelped our mother greatly in her late life and exhibited deep caring and concern which | noticed\npersonally on many occasions. For example she dropped everything and flew to France at her\noun expense to help me with medical issues our mother was having and to just be there to\ncomfort her. She also did not hesitate to help her many personal friends with their problems not\nonly with kindness but practical help too and did not ask for anything in return.\n\nMy sister was also very entrepreneurial in creating and investing in multiple companies and\norganizations which created products and services, as well as employment.
