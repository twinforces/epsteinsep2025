The\nCourt will therefore analyze the underrepresentation inquiry using the absolute disparity method. |\nThe absolute disparity method measures the difference between the groups’ !\nrepresentation in the relevant community and their representation in the jury venire. See Rioux, :\n97 F.3d at 655—56. For example, if African Americans compose lo% of the community but only\n5% of the jury venire, the absolute disparity is 5%. See id.

The partics do not dispute that African Americans make up )\nll.2o% and Hispanic Americans make up l2.97% of the White Plains master wheel. (Gov’t\nOpp. Br. at 2o.) In the relevant community, African Americans make up l2.45% and Hispanic\nAmericans l4.l2% of the jury eligible population. (Schulte Reply at 6-7, Gov’t Opp. Br. at l8.)\nAccordingly, the absolute disparities are l.25% for African Americans (l2.45% - ll.2o%) and\nl.l5% for Hispanic Americans (l4.l2% - l2.97%).

The\nWhite Plains Qualified Wheel is comprised of 8.76% Black or African-American persons and\nlo.48% Latino or Hispanic persons. (/d. at § l7; see also Martin Aff. at § 55). This results in\nabsolute disparities of 3.69% and 3.64%, respectively. These figures are also comfortably within\nthe range that the Second Circuit has determined does not satisfy the second prong of the Duren\ntest. Moreover, as discussed belou, the factors that cause the disparity between the White Plains\nQualified Wheel and the White Plains Master Jury Wheel, as well as the voting age population,\nare not the result of systematic exclusion.\n\nIt is only by employing an apples-and-oranges method of comparing the White Plains\nQualified Wheel to the jury eligible populations of the “Manhatan Division” or the entire Southern\nDistrict that the defendant is able to identify disparities that might arguably satisfy the second\nprong of Duren. Because that method has no basis in the law, the defendant’s claim fails at the\nsecond prong.\n\nb. Any Potential Underrepresentation Is Not Due to Systematic\nExclusion\n\nEven assuming the defendant had satisfied the second prong of the Duren test—which she\nhas not—she most certainly has not demonstrated that any underrepresentation is “due to\nsystematic exclusion of the group in the jury-selection process.” Rioux, 97 F.3d at 654 (emphasis\nadded). That is, she cannot establish that the exclusion is the product of “the system of jury\nselection itself, rather than external forces.” Id. at 658 (emphasis added). She therefore cannot\nsatisfy the third prong of Duren.\n\nAs then-District Judge Bianco explained, “systematic exclusion does not occur simply\nbecause a facially neutral disqualification criterion disproportionately impacts a particular group.”\nBarlou, 732 F.

This Court ordered that the parties meet and confer regarding a trial start date and\nto \"agree to the earliest possible trial date this fall and to seek adjustments to other schedules in\norder to facilitate an early fall trial start date.\" (Dkt. 266 at 3). Defense counsel atempted to\nconfer with the government in good faith to find a mutually acceptable date. We sent several\nemails to counsel stating our reliance on our April 22d submission (Dkt. 246) where we specified\nour conflicts and the justification for our request. By contrast, and despite our requests for\nclarification, the government failed to provide any details to justify its request to delay the trial\nstart to November 29, 2o2l. Instead, the government filed a lengthy submission to the Court,\ncomplete with case law citations, at 8:l2 p.m., a few hours before the deadline for the “joint\nleter.” Moreover, the government also audaciously seeks by way of their joint leter regarding\nthe trial date to re-litigate the schedule this Court has already crafted after hearing from the\nparties both on submissions and in person, without even the courtesy of a motion for\nreconsideration on that schedule.\n\nFor the reasons previously detailed in our April 22d leter to the Court, defense counsel’s\nearliest possible — and <span class=\"highlight\">preferred</span> — trial start date is November 8\". As the Court is aware, Judge\nFurman moved my October 4\" trial to March, clearing the way for this trial to start on November\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4ll7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004119.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 276 Filed o5/ll/2l Page 3 of 4\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\n\nThanksgiving. The government does not explain why this witness is unavailable, and then they\n\nnote, in a footnote, that the witness actually would be available to testify touards the end of the\ngovernment’s case. In essence, that is less a “conflict” than a requirement that the government\n\nput on its case in a different order. It is also biterly ironic that the government had been pushing\n\nfor the earliest possible trial date to protect the victims’ interests, but nou seeks to postpone it to\n\nkeep the trial team together and to put its witnesses on in a <span class=\"highlight\">preferred</span> order.\n\nBy contrast, pushing the trial to the end of November will have a severe and irreparable\nimpact on Ms. Maxwell's defense. First, she will be detained longer. Second, the estimated four\nweeks for the government's case will result in Ms. Maxwell's defense being pressed to conclude\nbefore the holidays or worse, extending the case into the new year, which the Court already\nconcluded was unwarranted delay. While the government may complete its case-in-chief before\nChristmas, the defense will not. This will cast defense counsel and the defense case in a negative\nlight as jurors impatiently wait for the trial to conclude before Christmas, which it won’t. Third,\nstarting on the Monday after Thanksgiving will pose impediments to the potential jury pool —\nmany of whom will hopefully be able to travel to see family for the first time since before\nCOVID -- and will disrupt travel plans for counsel and our families. Fourth, Ms. Maxwell's\nwitnesses who will be traveling from various locations will be forced to book uncertain travel\nplans in the days leading up to — or after -- the holiday season.\n\nTo accommodate the government’s vaguely articulated scheduling issues, we informed\ngovernment counsel that we would consider starting on November l5, but no later.\n\nWe firmly request that the Court set the trial to start on November 8\" to ensure that the\ntrial will conclude before Christmas.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4ll9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004381.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 84 of 349\nPt U.S. Department of Justice\n(oe ee\noy i United Stater Atorney\na Southern District of Florida\nAR.

That offer was not meant as a starting point for negotiations, it is the minimum\nterm of imprisonment that will obviate the need for federal prosecution, The Office has\nnever agreed that a state prison sentence is not appropriate for Mr. Epstein. Rather we\nsimply stated that if Mr. Epstein <span class=\"highlight\">preferred</span> to serve his sentence in a federal penctentiary, we\nwould be willing to explore a federal conviction that may allou that in lieu of any state\nresolution. Further, as | made clear in our follou up telephone conversation after the\nmeeting, a plea to two federal misdemeanors was never extended or meant as an offer.\n\nWe also would reiterate that the agreement to Section 2255 liability applies to all of\nthe minor girls identified during the federal investigation, not just the l2 that form the basis\nof an initial planned charging instrument.\n\nAs you knou, the ability to engage in flexible plea negotiations is dramatically\nchanged upon the return of an indictment, Once an indictment is returned, the Office does\nnot intend to file a Superseding Information containing a lesser charge or to dismiss the case\nin favor of state prosecution.\n\n57\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l257", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022838.jpg": "Page 295\nl hou Mr. Epstein changed, but at some point,\n2 Mr. Epstein definitely <span class=\"highlight\">preferred</span> younger women?\n3 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: I accept.\n4 TODD BLANCHE: And I think you said\n5 yesterday, but say it again since we're talking about\n6 it.

Once an indictment is returned, the Office does\nnot intend to file a Superseding Information containing a lesser charge or to dismiss the case\nin favor of state prosecution.\n\n57\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o95", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES010/DOJ-OGR-00025501.jpg": "Page l3l8\nFW PORE CHOW AU VUE GUE MU CONQUER Oy GU CO ee Un COU an\nthe Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General.

The premise for the business is simple, if counter-intuitive:\nextreme wealth brings a host of unique and often intractable problems to its possessor,\nic., family, security, investment, tax planning, estate planning, etc. Jeffrey has studied\nfamilies possessing such wealth, offers advice in all of these areas and, in the process,\ninsulates the family head from the passions and emotions of other family members\naffected by the decisions of the family head.' In essence, Jeffrey offers new potential\nclients the scenario of “no longer having to worry about their money.” Jeffrey continues\nin this unique “niche” business to this day. The business is currently based in the U.S.\nVirgin Islands, with New York City being the base of his charitable operations. Jeffrey’s\nbusiness and personal interests currently employ approximately l6o people. Of these,\nhouever, he is the only income-producing person.\n\nJeffrey is single, having never married or fathered any children. He has shied\naway from becoming a parent because the demands of his business would not allou him\nthe kind of time and presence needed to be a good parent. During his adulthood, Jeffrey\n\n° has had two long-term relationships: the first with Eva Andersson from l98l to l99o,\nand the second with Ghislaine Maxwell from l99l to 2ooo. (These will be treated in\n\ngreater detail belou.) Jeffrey currently maintains residences in New York City; West\nPalm Beach, Florida; the Virgin Islands; Santa Fe, New Mexico; and Paris, France; as he\nwas enrolled as a visiting fellou at Harvard, he also has a rented apartment in Cambridge,\nMassachusets.\n\nJeffrey has always been shy socially but is articulate and engaging in person. He\nhas <span class=\"highlight\">preferred</span> to maintain his privacy despite his business associations with many wealthy\nand well-knoun people in New York City and elsewhere. In 2oo5, Jeffrey agreed to\naccompany and fly former President Bill Clinton on his AIDS Initiative journey to\nAfrica. While Jeffrey does not regret his decision to do so because of the great good that\nit did, it has also had the collateral effect of raising Jeffrey’s profile in the media and\notherwise impacting the quiet life he has sought to live.\n\n‘Jeffrey offered the follouing example. The daughter of a client becomes engaged. Because of the\ndifficulty of knouing whether her suitor is motivated by love or by money, a pre-nuptial agreement is\ncalled for. Were the client to insist on this with his daughter, he might well incur her wrath because of the\nimplicit questioning of the motivation of her betrothed. With Jeffrey as the family advisor to the client,\nhouever, it would be he who would deliver the news to the daughter, and it would be he who would incur\nand absorb her wrath, thus insulating the client from these unpleasantries.\n\n3\n| Public Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33223"};
