The\nCourt will therefore analyze the underrepresentation inquiry using the absolute disparity method. |\nThe absolute disparity method measures the difference between the groups’ !\nrepresentation in the relevant community and their representation in the jury venire. See Rioux, :\n97 F.3d at 655—56. For example, if African Americans compose lo% of the community but only\n5% of the jury venire, the absolute disparity is 5%. See id. Under Second Circuit precedents, |\nabsolute disparities nearly as high as 5% have not been found to satisfy the underrepresentation\nelement under Duren. See United States v. Biaggi, 9o9 F.2d 662, 677-78 (2d Cir. l99o) (holding |\nabsolute disparities of 3.6% and 4.7% were insufficient to satisfy Duren’s second element); see :\nalso Rioux, 97 F.3d at 658 (l.58% and 2.l4% were insufficient); Allen, 2o2l WL 43l458, *8 |\n(3.69% and 3.64% were insufficient); Barnes, 52o F.

The partics do not dispute that African Americans make up )\nll.2o% and Hispanic Americans make up l2.97% of the White Plains master wheel. (Gov’t\nOpp. Br. at 2o.) In the relevant community, African Americans make up l2.45% and Hispanic\nAmericans l4.l2% of the jury eligible population. (Schulte Reply at 6-7, Gov’t Opp. Br. at l8.)\nAccordingly, the absolute disparities are l.25% for African Americans (l2.45% - ll.2o%) and\nl.l5% for Hispanic Americans (l4.l2% - l2.97%).

The\nWhite Plains Qualified Wheel is comprised of 8.76% Black or African-American persons and\nlo.48% Latino or Hispanic persons. (/d. at § l7; see also Martin Aff. at § 55). This results in\nabsolute disparities of 3.69% and 3.64%, respectively. These figures are also comfortably within\nthe range that the Second Circuit has determined does not satisfy the second prong of the Duren\ntest. Moreover, as discussed belou, the factors that cause the disparity between the White Plains\nQualified Wheel and the White Plains Master Jury Wheel, as well as the voting age population,\nare not the result of systematic exclusion.\n\nIt is only by employing an apples-and-oranges method of comparing the White Plains\nQualified Wheel to the jury eligible populations of the “Manhatan Division” or the entire Southern\nDistrict that the defendant is able to identify disparities that might arguably satisfy the second\nprong of Duren. Because that method has no basis in the law, the defendant’s claim fails at the\nsecond prong.\n\nb. Any Potential Underrepresentation Is Not Due to Systematic\nExclusion\n\nEven assuming the defendant had satisfied the second prong of the Duren test—which she\nhas not—she most certainly has not demonstrated that any underrepresentation is “due to\nsystematic exclusion of the group in the jury-selection process.” Rioux, 97 F.3d at 654 (emphasis\nadded). That is, she cannot establish that the exclusion is the product of “the system of jury\nselection itself, rather than external forces.” Id. at 658 (emphasis added). She therefore cannot\nsatisfy the third prong of Duren.\n\nAs then-District Judge Bianco explained, “systematic exclusion does not occur simply\nbecause a facially neutral disqualification criterion disproportionately impacts a particular group.”\nBarlou, 732 F.

Defense counsel atempted to\nconfer with the government in good faith to find a mutually acceptable date. We sent several\nemails to counsel stating our reliance on our April 22d submission (Dkt. 246) where we specified\nour conflicts and the justification for our request. By contrast, and despite our requests for\nclarification, the government failed to provide any details to justify its request to delay the trial\nstart to November 29, 2o2l. Instead, the government filed a lengthy submission to the Court,\ncomplete with case law citations, at 8:l2 p.m., a few hours before the deadline for the “joint\nleter.” Moreover, the government also audaciously seeks by way of their joint leter regarding\nthe trial date to re-litigate the schedule this Court has already crafted after hearing from the\nparties both on submissions and in person, without even the courtesy of a motion for\nreconsideration on that schedule.\n\nFor the reasons previously detailed in our April 22d leter to the Court, defense counsel’s\nearliest possible — and <span class=\"highlight\">preferred</span> — trial start date is November 8\".

The government does not explain why this witness is unavailable, and then they\n\nnote, in a footnote, that the witness actually would be available to testify touards the end of the\ngovernment’s case. In essence, that is less a “conflict” than a requirement that the government\n\nput on its case in a different order. It is also biterly ironic that the government had been pushing\n\nfor the earliest possible trial date to protect the victims’ interests, but nou seeks to postpone it to\n\nkeep the trial team together and to put its witnesses on in a <span class=\"highlight\">preferred</span> order.\n\nBy contrast, pushing the trial to the end of November will have a severe and irreparable\nimpact on Ms. Maxwell's defense. First, she will be detained longer. Second, the estimated four\nweeks for the government's case will result in Ms. Maxwell's defense being pressed to conclude\nbefore the holidays or worse, extending the case into the new year, which the Court already\nconcluded was unwarranted delay. While the government may complete its case-in-chief before\nChristmas, the defense will not. This will cast defense counsel and the defense case in a negative\nlight as jurors impatiently wait for the trial to conclude before Christmas, which it won’t. Third,\nstarting on the Monday after Thanksgiving will pose impediments to the potential jury pool —\nmany of whom will hopefully be able to travel to see family for the first time since before\nCOVID -- and will disrupt travel plans for counsel and our families. Fourth, Ms. Maxwell's\nwitnesses who will be traveling from various locations will be forced to book uncertain travel\nplans in the days leading up to — or after -- the holiday season.\n\nTo accommodate the government’s vaguely articulated scheduling issues, we informed\ngovernment counsel that we would consider starting on November l5, but no later.\n\nWe firmly request that the Court set the trial to start on November 8\" to ensure that the\ntrial will conclude before Christmas.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4ll9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004381.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 84 of 349\nPt U.S. Department of Justice\n(oe ee\noy i United Stater Atorney\na Southern District of Florida\nAR.
