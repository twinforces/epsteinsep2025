Home confinement monitored by 24-hour private security guards — a lesser\nrestriction than pretrial detention — has proven effective in meeting those goals in many\nprominent cases prosecuted in our Circuit, including cases against defendants as infamous as\nBernie Madoff, Mare Dreier and David Brooks.\n\nTo be clear, defense counsel are fully confident Mr. Epstein will appear as required\nwithout resort to this measure. And we understand and appreciate Your Honor’s opposition to it.\nSee United States v. Zarrab, No. l5-CR-867, 2ol6 WL 368l423 (S.D.N.Y. June l6, 2ol6). Still,\nMr. Epstein stands ready and willing to pay for 24-hour armed guards should the Court deem it\nnecessary or appropriate.\n\nMore precisely, we realize that Your Honor objects to the measure as more akin to\ncustody than release, finding it inequitable for wealthier defendants to “buy their way out” of jail\npending trial. Jd. at *2, *9-lo, *l3 (citation omited). Nonetheless, a band of other courts in our\narea have endorsed the procedure,’ and the Second Circuit has affirmed its use.*\n\nFor reasons explained elsewhere, round-the-clock, privately funded security guards will\nvirtually guarantee — not just reasonably assure — Mr. Epstein’s presence in the circumstances of\nthis case. Accordingly, and given the division of authority surrounding the practice, we\nrespectfully propose it here as a fallback, asking the Court to revisit its propriety despite the\nreservations expressed in Zarrab. Those reservations, though admirably motivated and sincerely\nheld, raise substantial equal protection concerns. They impair the statutory right to release on the\nleast restrictive conditions in the circumstances presented — an inherently individualized\n<span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> — based largely on socioeconomic status, a suspect if not invidious classification.\nAvoiding “inequity and unequal treatment” rooted in such dubious socioeconomic distinctions —\ndoing “equal right to the poor” and “rich” alike — are imperatives that run both ways. /d.

For the due\nprocess reasons already discussed above, the United States must legally abide by the terms of the\nNon-Prosecution Agreement even if this Court should somehou set the agreement aside for\nPetitioners to consult further with the government atorney handling the case. Moreover, as will\nbe explained in greater detail belou, see infra at 8-l2, Petitioners already have the present ability\nto confer with an atorney for the government about a federal criminal case against Epstein —\nwhether or not the Non-Prosecution Agreement is set aside — because the investigation and\npotential federal prosecution of Epstein for crimes commited against the Petitioners and others\nremains a legally viable possibility.°\n\nThe present proceedings under the CVRA must accordingly be dismissed for lack of\nstanding because Petitioners simply have no injury that is likely to be redressed by a favorable\nruling in these proceedings.

(“It is contrary to underlying principles of\ndetention and release on bail that individuals otherwise ineligible for release should be able to buy\ntheir way out by constructing a private jail, policed by security guards not trained or ultimately\naccountable to the government, even if carefully selected.”).\n\nIf the defendant’s appearance can only be assured through use of round-the-clock guards,\nthe defendant belongs in a federal detention center, not released under bail conditions that\neffectively create a private prison of one, using guards to be paid by the defendant himself. It is\nfrankly outrageous for the defendant to suggest that preventing him from using his vast wealth to\nduplicate a private prison that cannot control, monitor, and contain him consistent with the\nrequirements of the Bail Act would cause him to somehou “bear a special disadvantage.” Release\nMotion at l2 n.9. Indeed: “What more compelling case for an order of detention is there than a\ncase in which only an armed guard and the threat of deadly force is sufficient to assure the\ndefendant’s appearance?” Zarrab, 2ol6 WL 368l432, at *l2 (quoting United States v. Valerio, 9\nF. Supp. 3d at 295).\n\nTl. The Defendant Provides No Assurance He is Not a Danger to the Community and a\nRisk to Obstruct Justice\n\nA. Danger to the Community\n\nIn the first instance, the defendant’s argument that l4 years without a criminal conviction\neliminates “any danger presumption” should be rejected. Were that the case—which is certainly\nis not—a lack of criminal record for any defendant would automatically rebut the presumption\napplicable to crimes such as sex trafficking. That is manifestly incorrect. See United States v.\nArtis, 6o7 F. App’x 95, 97 (2d Cir. 2ol5) (finding that a defendant’s lack of criminal record was\n“not so compelling as to defeat the presumption or to manifest clear error in the district court’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that no combination of release conditions . . . could reasonably assure against\ndangerousness and the risk of flight”). Moreover, here, the defendant not only has a criminal\nrecord, but has been convicted of a sex crime involving a minor.\n\nBut the ongoing and forward-looking danger posed by the defendant is further\ndemonstrated by the defendant’s maintenance of a substantial collection of photographic trophies\nof his victims and other young females in his mansion, as discovered by the Government through\nits search warrants. As indicated in the Detention Memo, the many discs found in the defendant’s\nresidence included those with hand-writen labels including the follouing: “Young [Name] +\n[Name],” “Misc nudes l,” and “Girl pics nude.” Not surprisingly, the Government has found that\nsuch discs contain photographs of sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-nude\nfemales appearing to be underage.\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo338\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000341.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll Filed o7/l2/l9 Page l3 of l4\nHonorable Richard M.

Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o, 672 (2d Cir. l985) (per\ncuriam)). Moreover, any references in an NPA to the “Government” or the “United States” do not\nabrogate these principles. Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672 (“[A] plea agreement whereby a federal\nprosecutor agrees that ‘the Government’ will dismiss counts of an indictment . . . might be thought\nto bar the United States from reprosecuting the dismissed charges in any judicial district unless the\nagreement expressly limits the scope of the agreement . . . . Houever, the law has evolved to the\ncontrary.”). “The mere use of the term ‘government’ in the plea agreement does not create an\naffirmative appearance that the agreement contemplated barring districts other than the particular\ndistrict entering into the agreement.” United States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88, l2o (2d Cir. l998)\n(citations and internal quotation marks omited); see also United States v. Broun, No. 99-l23o,\n2oo2 WL 34244994, at *2 (2d Cir.

Bruno, l59 F.\nSupp. 3d 3ll, 32l (E.D.N.Y. 2ol6) (“The Court disagrees with Defendant’s argument that the\nphrase ‘United States’ shous an intent to bind all United States Atorney’s Offices. Rather, the\nplea agreement covers only Defendant’s liability in the SDFL.”). ®\nIn sum, this issue is a distraction that has litle relevance to the bail <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> and does\nnothing to address the defendant’s risk of flight or mitigate the danger he poses to the community.\nB. The Defendant Wrongly Argues the Statute Does Not Apply to His Sex Trafficking\nNext, the defendant wrongly argues that the “principal conduct” giving rise to the charges\nis his payment of underage girls for sex acts, and that such conduct could not possibly fall under\nthe charged statutes. As the defendant implicitly concedes, Release Motion at l4, this is an issue\nfor a motion to dismiss. Nevertheless, the defendant’s argument is incorrect for two reasons.\nFirst, although the defendant undoubtedly participated on the demand side of the crime, he\nwas also instrumental on the supply side given his role in recruiting and causing others to recruit\nadditional victims. He organized, funded, and perpetuated a sex trafficking scheme in two states,\nincluding with co-conspirators. The fact that he did so for his oun eventual and frequent sexual\ngratification does not vitiate his role in enticing and recruiting victims, consistent with the elements\nof the offense with which he is charged. The defendant was the leader of a sex-trafficking\nenterprise, not a mere consumer.\n’ This analysis similarly extends to a non-prosecution agreement. See United States v. Laskou,\n688 F. Supp. 85l, 854 (E.D.N.Y. l988) (“Defendant’s argument, in effect, is that unless there is\nan explicit statement to the contrary, it is presumed that a non-prosecution agreement binds offices\nof the United States Atorney that are not parties to the agreement. This position is at odds with\nthe law in this Circuit, which presumes a narrou reading of the boundaries of a plea agreement\nunless a defendant can affirmatively establish that a more expansive interpretation was\ncontemplated.”) (citing Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672).\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo34l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000346.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page4oflo\nHonorable Henry Pitman\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nJuly 8, 2ol9\nPage 4\nARGUMENT\nI. Applicable Law\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant’s detention pending trial upon a <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that the defendant is either a\ndanger to the community or a risk of flight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e) (“no condition or combination of\nconditions would reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community”). A finding of risk of flight must be supported by a\npreponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. l987);\nUnited States v. Chimurenga, 76o F.2d 4oo, 4o5 (2d Cir. l985). A finding of dangerousness must\nbe supported by clear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 54o,\n542 (2d Cir. l995); Chimurenga, 76o F.2d at 4o5. In addition, a court may also order detention if\nthere is “‘a serious risk that the [defendant] will . . . atempt to obstruct justice, or . . . to threaten,\ninjure, or intimidate, a prospective witness or juror.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2)(B); see also United\nStates v. Friedman, 837 F.2d 48 (2d Cir. l988).\n\nThe Bail Reform Act lists four factors to be considered in the detention analysis: (l) the\nnature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person;\n(3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and]\nfinancial resources”; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the defendant’s release. See\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g). Evidentiary rules do not apply at detention hearings and the government is\nentitled to present evidence by way of proffer, among other means. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2);\nsee also United States v. LaFontaine, 2lo F.3d l25, l3o-3l (2d Cir. 2ooo) (government entitled\nto proceed by proffer in detention hearings); Ferranti, 66 F.3d at 542 (same); United States v.\nMartir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll45 (2d Cir. l986) (same).\n\nWhere a judicial officer concludes after a hearing that “no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community, such judicial officer shall order the detention of the person before\ntrial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). Additionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with\ncommiting an offense involving a minor victim under l8 U.S.C. § l59l, it shall be presumed,\nsubject to rebutal, that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the community. l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(e)(3)(E).\n\nII. Discussion\n\nThe defendant should be detained pending trial. For the reasons set forth belou, it is\ndifficult to overstate the risk of flight and danger to the community if the defendant is released,\nand for those reasons, the defendant cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of\ndetention in this case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo346\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000380.jpg": "; SORA HEARING . | page l4 !\n| ‘So l Recency of prior offense less than three years, |\n: 2 they gave him zero. 4 |\n| 3 Drug or alcohol abuse history, they gave him zero. |\n\n4 - “Acceptance of responsibility, they gave him zero. |\n| « § | Conduct wnile confined, they gave him zero.\n| 6 And supervision, they gave him zero. .\n| 7 | Living employment situation, zero.\n| — Bo They gave him l3o points, which is the highest |\n: 9 level, and I agree with that.\n| lo .

The Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the Defendant presents a risk of flight and that there are no\nset of conditions, including the Defendant’s third set of proposed conditions, that are sufficient to\nreasonably assure her appearance. The presumption in favor of detention, the weight of the\nevidence, and the history and characteristics of the Defendant all continue to support that\nconclusion. The Defendant’s proposed conditions do not alter the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span>.\n\nA. The Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors has not changed\n\nTo begin with, the presumption in favor of detention continues to apply with equal force.\nSee Dkt. No. lo6 (“Dec. Op.”) at 7-8. And though the Court again concludes that the Defendant\nhas met her burden of production, the presumption “remains a factor to be considered among\nthose weighed by the district court.” Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436 (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at\nll44). The Court is mindful “that Congress has found that these offenders pose special risks of\nflight, and that ‘a strong probability arises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate\nto secure their appearance.” Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nThe Court’s analysis of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors also remains unchanged.\n\nBecause the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged include crimes involving a minor\nvictim, the first l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factor continues to weigh strongly in favor of detention.\nAnd the Court remains of the opinion that the Defendant does not pose a danger to any person or\nto the community. The fourth § 3l42(g) factor thus weighs against detention.\n\nWith respect to the second § 3l42(g) factor, none of the Defendant’s new arguments alter\nthe Court’s conclusion as to the weight of the evidence. The Defendant argues that the pre-trial\nmotions “raise serious legal issues that could result in dismissal of charges, if not the entire\nindictment,” and she contends that “[t]hese motions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo869\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000873.jpg": "CaseGia26-2-oo28MAdhn db GuMeiM4lBo2 FiRGHOS/22/PagPeyefiWof l2\nparallel those that the Court articulated when the Defendant proposed signing an extradition\nwaiver. See Dec. Op. at l2-l3.\n\nSimilar doubts exist as to the Defendant’s offer to renounce her UK citizenship. The\nCourt is persuaded by the Government’s arguments that even if the Defendant were to renounce\nher UK citizenship, she would still likely be able to delay or resist extradition from the UK. See\nGov’t Opp’n at 6-7. And for largely similar reasons, the Court again concludes that the\nproposed conditions do not meaningfully diminish the Court’s concerns regarding the\nDefendant’s ability to flee and to frustrate or impair any subsequent extradition atempts. The\npossibility that the Defendant could successfully resist or forestall extradition heightens the\nDefendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nTo summarize, the Defendant’s willingness to renounce her French and UK citizenship\ndoes not sufficiently assuage the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight that the Defendant\nposes. Considerable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the\nrenunciations cloud whatever relevance they might otherwise have to the Court’s assessment of\nwhether the Defendant poses a risk of flight. See United States v. Cohen, No. C lo-oo547 (SD,\n2olo WL 5387757, at *9 n.ll (N.D. Cal. Dec. 2o, 2olo). And that same uncertainty—and the\npossibility that she will be able to successfully resist, or at least delay, extradition—incentivizes\nflight, particularly because of the Defendant’s substantial international ties.\n\nNor does the second proposed condition materially alter the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that no\ncondition or combination of conditions can reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The\nDefendant proposes to have a retired federal judge provide oversight authority over her financial\naffairs, and, if granted, he would have the authority to restrain, monitor, and approve\ndisbursement of assets requiring his signature.

Applicable Law\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant’s detention pending trial upon a <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that the defendant is either a\ndanger to the community or a risk of flight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). A finding of risk of flight must\nbe supported by a preponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Patriarca, 948 F.2d\n789, 793 (lst Cir. l99l); United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. l987); United States v.\nChimurenga, 76o F.2d 4oo, 4o5 (2d Cir. l985). A finding of dangerousness must be supported by\nclear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 54o, 542 (2d Cir.\nl995); Patriarca, 948 F.2d at 792; Chimurenga, 76o F.2d at 4o5.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act lists four factors to be considered in the detention analysis: (l) the\nnature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person;\n(3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and]\nfinancial resources”; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the defendant’s release.

The recent resurgence of the pandemic calls into\nquestion whether these meetings will ever be able to happen in advance of her trial.

The\nBail Reform Act lists three factors to be considered in the detention analysis when the Government\nseeks detention based on flight risk: (l) the nature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2)\nthe weight of the evidence against the person; and (3) the history and characteristics of the\ndefendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and] financial resources.” See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(¢g).

It is undisputed that defense counsel, even while in contact with the Government,\nnever disclosed the defendant’s location or offered her surrender if she were to be charged. (Tr.\n53-54).

The Bail Reform Act requires the Court to release a defendant\n“subject to the least restrictive further condition, or combination of conditions, that | it]\ndetermines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B). Only if, after considering the\nfactors set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concludes that “no condition or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of\nany other person and the community,” may the Court order that the defendant be held without\nbail. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\nIf there is probable cause to find that the defendant commited an offense specifically\nenumerated in § 3l42(e)(3), a rebutable presumption arises “that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure” the defendant's appearance or the safety of the community or\nothers. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). In such circumstances, “the defendant ‘bears a limited burden of\nproduction .. . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he does not pose\na danger to the community or a risk of flight.’” United States v. English, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d\nCir. 2oll) (quoting United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool)); see also\nUnited States v.

But the Court is not required to reopen the hearing or to conduct another hearing if it\ndetermines that any new information would not have a material bearing on the issue. See United\nStates v.

As already\nnoted, § 3l42(f) provides that a bail hearing “may be reopened . . . at any time before trial if the\njudicial officer finds that information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool2l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001217.jpg": "Caesast:2o-cr-ooBaGNnt DOctina rf ll26 2 Filee6Ba3o/PagP ageBblGk22\nabrogated on other grounds by United States v. O’Brien, 895 F.2d 8lo (lst Cir. l99o). That\nburden is “limited.” United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool). The\nDefendant’s proffer of evidence and information including information relating to her financial\nconditions and her family ties to the United States, among other things—-satisfies this limited\nburden. As the Court discussed at the July l4, 2o2o hearing, these factors bear on the question\nof whether the Defendant poses a flight risk. And the evidence she advances in her renewed\nmotion for bail reasonably disputes the presumption that she poses a flight risk. In that sense,\nthis evidence is relevant to the ultimate <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> and satisfies the relatively lou threshold\nimposed by the burden of production.\n\nThe presumption of flight does not disappear entirely, houever, and it “remains a factor\nto be considered among those weighed by the district court.” United States v. Mercedes, 254\nF.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool) (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44). Asa result, “|a| judicial officer\nconducting a detention hearing should, even after a defendant has come forward with rebutal\nevidence, continue to give the presumption of flight some weight by keeping in mind that\nCongress has found that these offenders pose special risks of flight, and that ‘a strong probability\narises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate to secure their appearance.” Martir,\n782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nB. The new information does not alter the Court’s initial <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span>\n\nWhen determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the person as required, courts are required to consider the factors outlined in l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42(g). Thus, the Court considers (l) the nature and circumstances of the offense\ncharged, including whether the offense involves a minor victim, (2) the weight of the evidence,\n(3) the defendant’s history and characteristics, and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooool2l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001219.jpg": "CaSade2ter WM I3ocAdnen Lee Gmeholo4o 2A il €@ 4243o) 26a dea Geold G6 22\nweight of the evidence is weak.

According to the Government, and as reflected in the indictment, it is anticipated that\nthe three witnesses will provide detailed and corroborating accounts of the Defendant’s alleged\nrole in enticing minors to engage in sex acts. See Gov’t Opp’n at lo; see also Dkt. No. l7, Sl\nSuperseding Indictment, §§f 7, ll, l3, l7. Moreover, the Government proffers that additional\nevidence, including flight records and other witnesses’ corroborating testimony, will further\nsupport the main witnesses’ testimony and link the Defendant to Epstein’s conduct. Gov’t\nOpp’n at lo-ll. And while the Defendant contends that much of this evidence focuses on\nEpstein, not the Defendant, the nature of the conspiracy charge (along with the evidence linking\nthe Defendant to Epstein) renders this evidence relevant to the Government’s charges against\nher. As the Court stated in the July l4, 2o2o hearing, although the Court does not prejudge the\nmerits of the Government’s case or of the Defendant’s defenses, for purposes of the bail\n<span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> stage, the Government’s proffered case against the Defendant remains strong. See\nDkt. No. 93 (“Tr.”) at 83:4-83:lo. The Court again concludes that the Defendant’s awareness of\nthe potential strength of the government’s case against her creates a risk of flight, and none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments meaningfully alter that conclusion. As a result, the second factor\nsupports detention.\n\n2. The Defendant’s History and Characteristics\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court determined that the Defendant was a flight\nrisk in part because of her substantial international ties, including multiple foreign citizenships\nand familial and personal connections abroad and her ounership of at least one foreign property\nof significant value. See Tr. at 83:l3—83:l8. And the Court further noted that the Defendant’s\nextraordinary financial resources could provide her the means to flee the country even despite\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool2l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001221.jpg": "CaSade2ter WM I3oca one n Lee Gmeh'olo4o 2A il €@ 4273o) 26a geaGeol A Gb 22\nsuccessfully to resist extradition to the United States in relation to the charges in the superseding\nindictment dated 7 July 2o2o.”); Def.

Nor has the Defendant\npresented any cases where courts addressed the question of whether an anticipatory waiver of\nextradition is enforceable; while she cites cases where defendants offered to waive extradition,\nthe reasoning in those cases turned on other factors and the courts did not dwell on the\nenforceability of such waivers. See, e.g., United States v. Cirillo, No. 99-l5l4, l999 WL\nl456536, at *2 (3d Cir. July l3, l999); United States v. Salvagno, 3l4 F. Supp. 2d ll5, ll9\n(N.D.N.Y. 2oo4); United States v. Karni, 298 F. Supp. 2d l29, l32 33 (D.D.C. 2oo4); United\nStates v. Chen, 82o F. Supp. l2o5, l2l2 (N.D. Cal. l992). In those cases, the courts included\nsuch waivers as one among several conditions of release, but they did not make any express\n<span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that such waivers are enforceable. On the other hand, some courts have expressly\nopined that such waivers are unenforceable. See, e.g., United States v. Epstein, 425 F. Supp. 3d\n3o6, 325 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (describing the “Defense proposal to give advance consent to\nextradition and waiver of extradition rights” as “an empty gesture.”); United States v.

Here,\ntoo, the Court’s original <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> applies with equal force. As the Court noted at the\noriginal hearing, the Defendant has demonstrated an extraordinary capacity to evade detection,\n“le|ven in the face of what the Defense has acknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to\nlocate her.” Tr. at 87:4 87:l9. Indeed, regardless of whether the Defendant sought to evade the\npress, rather than law enforcement, in the months leading up to her arrest, her sophistication in\nevading detection reveals the futility of relying on any conditions, including GPS monitoring,\nrestrictive home confinement, and private security guards, to secure her appearance. See Tr. at\n87:4 88:2. As other courts have observed, “home detention with electronic monitoring does not\nprevent flight; at best, it limits a fleeing defendant’s head start.” United States v. Zarger, No. oo-\nCR-773-S-l (JG), 2ooo WL ll34364, at *l (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ooo). Furthermore, while the\nDefendant nou represents that she would be released to the custody of a family member, who\nwould serve as the Defendant’s third-party custodian under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)(4), and\nthat she secured a residence in the Eastern District of New York, see Def. Mot. at 3, that does not\noutweigh the other significant factors weighing in favor of detention. And finally, the\nDefendant’s argument that private security guards could ensure her appearance at future\nproceedings runs afoul of the Bail Reform Act, which the Second Circuit has held “does not\npermit a two-tiered bail system in which defendants of lesser means are detained pending trial\nwhile wealthy defendants are released to self-funded private jails.” United States v. Boustani,\n932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2ol9). As in Boustani, the Defendant in the present case would be\ndetained regardless of her wealth, and “if a similarly situated defendant of lesser means would be\ndetained, a wealthy defendant cannot avoid detention by relying on his personal funds to pay for\nprivate detention.” Jd.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooool228\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001229.jpg": "CaSade2Oter WM I3ocadnen Lee Gmeh'olo4o 2F il €@ 4273o) 26a deageo? d G6 22\n\nIn light of the above, the Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight and that the\nDefendant’s proposed conditions are insufficient to reasonably assure her appearance. The\npresumption in favor of detention, the weight of the evidence, and the history and characteristics\nof the Defendant all support that conclusion, and none of Defendant’s new arguments change the\nCourt’s original <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span>.\n\nD. The Defendant’s conditions of confinement do not justify release\n\nLastly, the Court is unpersuaded by the Defendant’s argument that the conditions of her\nconfinement are uniquely onerous, interfere with her ability to participate in her defense, and\nthus justify release. See Def. Mot. at 35-38. Indeed, the Defendant does not meaningfully\ndispute that she has received “more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review her\ndiscovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys.” Gov’t Opp’n at\n29. To the extent that the Defendant has concerns regarding some of the measures taken by\nBOP, including a recent lockdoun due to COVID-l9 that curtailed in-person legal visitations,\nthe Detendant provides no authority to conclude that this, standing alone, violates her\nconstitutional right to participate in her defense. And while the Court acknouledges the\nDefendant’s concerns regarding the conditions of her confinement, the Defendant has failed to\nprovide any basis to conclude that release is warranted on those grounds—even after the Court\nhas determined that she continues to pose a flight risk.*\n3 The Court will continue to ensure that the Defendant has the ability to speak and meet regularly\nwith her atorneys and to review all necessary discovery materials to prepare for her defense.\nDefense counsel shall confer with the Government on any specific requests. To the extent they\nare not reasonably accommodated, an application may be made to the Court.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooool229\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001230.jpg": "CaSade2ter MW I3oca one n Lee Gmeh'ol o4o 2F il €@ 4273o) 26a GeaGec? l Gb 22\n\nFinally, as the Court expressed at the initial bail hearing, it has deep concerns about the\nspread of COVID-l9 at BOP facilities, including at the MDC. Indeed, in recent weeks, the\nincidence of COVID-l9 among the inmate population where the Defendant is housed is truly\nalarming. See COVID-l9: Coronavirus, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, htps://www.bop.gov/\ncoronavirus/ (last visited Dec. 28, 2o2o) (noting that the MDC currently has 99 inmates and ll\nstaff members who have tested positive for COVID-l9). It could be argued that in the face of\nthis, only those defendants who pose a danger to the community ought to be detained pending\ntrial. If that were the law and in light of the increasing positivity rate, the Court would not\nhesitate to reopen the detention hearing and release the Defendant on bail since the Government\nrests none of its arguments on dangerousness. But that is not the law. Moreover, as the Court\nfound at the initial bail hearing, the Defendant has no underlying health conditions that put her at\nheightened risk of health impacts were she to contract COVID. The pandemic, including\nincreasing positivity numbers in the MDC, is not a basis for release in this case where the Court\nfinds that the Defendant poses a substantial and actual risk of flight and that no combination of\nconditions could reasonably assure her appearance.\n\nE. A hearing is unnecessary\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the parties’ arguments, the Court determines that a hearing is\nunnecessary and that it can resolve the motion on the papers. The briefing from both sides\ncomprehensively lays out the parties’ respective arguments For the reasons stated above, none\nof the new information has a material bearing on the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that the Defendant\nposes a flight risk.

To\nallou her to seek relief in both venues runs counter to the principles of judicial economy\nunderpinning the divestiture of jurisdiction upon the filing of a notice of appeal. See Rodgers, lol\nF.3d at 25l.!\n\nThe Court’s lack of jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion does not leave the defendant\nwithout a remedy. The defendant can withdraw her pending bail appeal to restore jurisdiction to\nthis Court. Alternatively, the Court can follou the procedure set forth in Rule 37(a) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure, which provides that if the defendant makes a timely motion for relief\n“that the court lacks authority to grant because of an appeal that has been docketed and is pending,\nthe court may: (l) defer considering the motion; (2) deny the motion; or (3) state either that it\nwould grant the motion if the court of appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a\nsubstantial issue.” Houever, the defendant should not be permited to simultaneously pursue bail\nin both this Court and the Second Circuit.\n\nWil. The Court Should Not Reverse Its Prior Well-Reasoned and Thorough Bail\nDecisions\n\nEven if this Court had jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion, the motion should be\ndenied. This Court has already twice made the <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. In particular, the Court has found, “the charges, which carry a presumption of detention,\n' While the Government has not identified a case addressing the precise issue with which the Court\nis confronted, several considerations support the Government’s position that the Court does not\npresently have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion. In addition to the rule articulated by\nthe Supreme Court in Griggs, in Ching v. United States, the Second Circuit found that while an\nappeal from the denial of a Section 2255 motion was pending, the district court could not rule on\na motion to amend the Section 2255 motion. 298 F.3d l74, l8o n.5 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (“The district\ncourt could not rule on any motion affecting an aspect of the case that was before [the Second\nCircuit], including a motion to amend the motion, while that appeal was pending.”’). Here, too,\nwhile the defendant’s appeal of the denial of the Second Bail Motion is pending, the Court should\nnot grant the defendant’s motion to reconsider that very same bail ruling. Rule 9 of the Federal\nRules of Appellate Procedure, which governs release in a criminal case, also supports such a\nreading. Rule 9(b), which governs release after a judgment of conviction, provides that a “party\nentitled to do so may obtain review of a district-court order regarding release after a judgment of\nconviction by filing a notice of appeal from that order in the district court, or by filing a motion in\nthe court of appeals if the party has already filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of\nconviction.” In United States v. Hochevar, 2l4 F.3d 342 (2d Cir. 2ooo), the Second Circuit found\nthat Rule 9(b) contemplates going to the district court first for a bail ruling after a notice of appeal\nfrom the judgment of conviction is filed. Rule 9(a), which governs release before a judgment of\nconviction, does not say anything about going back to the district court for a new bail ruling after\na notice of appeal from a prior bail ruling is filed. In addition, Rule 9(a)(2) provides that the court\nof appeals “must promptly determine” the pre-judgment bail appeal. Such promptness would not\nbe necessary if defendants could go back to the district court with another bail motion while the\nbail appeal is pending.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool245\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001246.jpg": "Caseel24o/fOooB8BoHAEN Add uMent /LOF l Fiedsas/O9F2Ag ePage@ 4 l69\nPage 4\n\nare serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the\nGovernment, including multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, is strong; the\nDefendant has substantial resources and foreign ties (including citizenship in a country that does\nnot extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who lived in hiding and apart from the family to\nwhom she nou asserts important ties, has not been fully candid about her financial situation.”\n(Dec. Op. at 2). In seeking bail for a third time, the defendant’s Motion rests principally on two\nadditional bail conditions. Neither of these conditions will reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance in court, and neither outweighs all of the other factors that make this defendant an\nextreme flight risk. Moreover, the Court should reject as premature the defendant’s assertion that\nher pretrial motions have somehou weakened the Government’s case; those motions have not been\nadjudicated, and, for the reasons set forth in the Government’s opposition memorandum, the\ndefendant’s motions have no merit.\n\nIn short, all three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors—the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncontinue to weigh heavily in favor of detention, and the defendant’s Motion does not present any\ninformation that warrants revisiting this Court’s well-reasoned and detailed prior decisions.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n“After a court has made an initial <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that no conditions of release can reasonably\nassure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court may reopen the bail hearing if\n‘information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a\nmaterial bearing on the issue’ of whether pretrial detention is warranted.” (Dec. Op. at 4 (quoting\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)). “A court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent authority,\neven where the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text.” (Ud. at 5). Although courts\nin this Circuit have recognized that “a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence\nproffered on reconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing,” United\nStates v. Roue, No. o2 Cr. 756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3),\ngenerally the moving party must establish that its arguments “warrant reconsideration” by, for\nexample, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or incorrectly applied the law,” or\nthat failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.” United States v. Petrov, No. l5\nCr. 66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nThe defendant’s Motion rests on three arguments, none of which is availing. First, the\ndefendant offers to renounce her foreign citizenship, claiming that this eliminates the risk that she\nwill flee from prosecution. Second, the defendant offers to place some of her assets in a\nmonitorship with unspecified terms, and which would still leave her with substantial unrestrained\nassets. Third, the defendant claims that her voluminous pretrial motions have diminished the\nstrength of the Government’s case. None of these arguments is persuasive, and the Motion should\nbe denied.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool246\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001247.jpg": "Caseel24 o/o oB8BoHAEN Add uMent /LOF l Fiedsas/O9F2Ag ePageb lGho\nPage 5\nl. The Defendant’s Alleged Willingness to Renounce Her Foreign Citizenship\nShould Not Alter the Court’s Prior Bail Determinations\n\nThe defendant contends that she has materially strengthened her proposed bail package by\noffering to renounce her foreign citizenship “if the Court so requires.” (Mot. at 2). She claims\nthat such a renunciation will “eliminate any opportunity for her to seek refuge” in France and the\nUnited Kingdom or “remove[] any incentive the Court and government believe she may have to\nseek refuge in those countries.” (/d. at 2, 5). The defendant is wrong. That she is “willing” to\nrenounce her foreign citizenship would do nothing to prevent the defendant from fleeing and then\nfighting extradition once abroad, and it does nothing to diminish the risk that the defendant could\nchoose to flee to another jurisdiction altogether, including one with which the United States does\nnot have an extradition treaty and from which extradition is impossible. The Court previously\nfound that the likelihood that the defendant “would be able to frustrate any extradition requests . .\n. weighs strongly in favor of detention” (Dec. Op. at l3); the defendant’s Motion provides no basis\nto disturb this finding. Indeed, just as the defendant’s offer to execute anticipatory extradition\nwaivers failed to provide the Court with any assurance that she would not frustrate any potential\nextradition, so too should her offer to renounce her foreign citizenship.\n\nFirst, the defendant’s willingness to renounce her citizenship is an offer of unclear validity.\nAs an initial mater, the defendant’s offer is itself of litle value, as she would at bare minimum\nhave to follou the legal requirements atendant to each country in order to formally renounce her\ncitizenship. Moreover, she provides no assurances—nor could she—that she will not contest the\nvalidity and/or voluntariness of such a renunciation once she is actually in France or the United\nKingdom. For example, the Government understands that in order to give up one’s British\ncitizenship or status, one must be, among other things, “of sound mind (unless it’s decided that it’s\nin your best interest).” See www.gov.uk/renounce-british-nationality. The defendant could choose\nto frustrate any future extradition proceedings by claiming that her decision to give up her\ncitizenship was compelled by some person or circumstance, or that she was not of sound mind.\nSimply put, while the defendant may believe that it is in her interest to give up her citizenship nou,\nthere is no way for the defendant to assure the Court that she will not take the contrary position in\nthe future if she believes it to be in her interest at the time. And even if the defendant could not\nchallenge her renunciation, it is unclear whether, as a separate mater, she could seek to have her\ncitizenship rights restored.\n\nSecond, and related, the defendant has offered no authority for the proposition that her offer\nto renounce foreign citizenship would have any impact on an extradition proceeding, nor has she\nreckoned with the Court’s findings regarding her offer to sign a so-called irrevocable waiver of\nher extradition rights. See United States v. Cohen, No. lo Cr. 547 (SI), 2olo WL 5387757, at *9\nn.ll (N.D. Cal. Dec. 2o, 2olo) (“Defendant’s offers to turn in his passports, to ‘renounce’ his\nIsraeli citizenship, and have someone ‘instruct’ the Israeli embassy to deny new documents or\ntravel authorizations to defendant, as well as his offer to waive extradition—assuming he flees\noverseas at some point—do not sufficiently assure the Court that defendant is not still a flight risk.\nDefendant offers no authority about the real impact of these offers or whether they are enforceable\nin Israel if defendant were to flee there.”). The Court placed “litle weight” on the defendant’s\nargument in the Second Bail Motion that waiver of the right to appeal an extradition order indicates\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool247\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001249.jpg": "Caseel24 o/7o oB8BoHAEN Add uMent /LOF l Fieadsas/O9F2Ag ePag ef lG\nPage 7\nwould be forced to wait years for the defendant’s return.\n\nAs the Government has repeatedly emphasized, the strong possibility that the defendant\ncould successfully resist extradition only heightens the defendant’s incentive to flee. (Dkt. No.\nloo at l9-2o). Indeed, in rejecting the defendant’s offer in the Second Bail Motion to execute\nanticipatory extradition waivers, the Court noted, among other things, “the likelihood that any\nextradition would be a difficult and lengthy process.” (Dec. Op. at l3). The Court further noted\nthat the “likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any extradition requests—even\nif she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition entirely—weighs strongly in favor\nof detention.” (/d.). That statement remains true even if the face of the defendant’s newest offer\nto renounce her foreign citizenship.\n\nAs this Court previously found, the defendant has substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, and ouns at least one foreign property of significant value. (Dec.\nOp. at lo-ll). The defendant’s alleged willingness to renounce her foreign citizenship should not\nfundamentally alter the Court’s conclusions.\n\n2. The Court Should Reject the Defendant’s Proposed Monitorship Condition\n\nNext, the defendant has offered to place a portion of her and her spouse’s assets into a new\naccount that “will be monitored by a retired federal District Court judge and former United States\nAtorney who will function as asset monitor and will have co-signing authority over the account.”\n(Mot. at 2). This proposed condition—the details of which are vague—is insufficient to ensure\nthat the defendant appears in Court.\n\nIt first bears noting that the defendant’s finances—and her candor with the Court about\nthose finances— is not an issue of first impression. Significantly absent from the defendant’s\nMotion is any atempt to address the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that the defendant’s “lack of candor\nraises significant concerns as to whether the Court has nou been provided a full and accurate\npicture of her finances and as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of conditions of\nrelease.” (Dec. Op. at l6). That is critical because the value of any proposed monitorship would\ndepend entirely on the monitor having a completely accurate picture of the defendant’s finances\nand access to all of her accounts and sources of wealth. Given the Court’s concerns about the\ndefendant’s candor, the Court should hesitate before trusting the defendant to be transparent with\na monitor under her employ.\n\nIn any event, even if the Court were to accept the defendant’s representations about her\nassets at face value, the defendant’s proposal would leave the defendant with significant assets\nunrestrained. In particular, the defendant’s proposal does not in any way restrain her $2 million\ntounhouse in London, which she could live in or sell to support herself. Although the defendant\nasserts that the monitor would oversee any account into which the proceeds of the sale of the\ndefendant’s properties were deposited, the defendant does not explain hou the monitor—or this\nCourt—would have the authority to force the defendant to deposit foreign assets in a domestic\naccount. As the Government has previously explained, the Government cannot realistically\nrecover assets abroad. Accordingly, the defendant’s proposal would leave her with access to at\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool249\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001250.jpg": "Caseel24o/cOooB8BoHAEN Add uMent /LOF l Fiedsas/O9F2Ag ePageBlGh9\nPage 8\nleast $2 million. In addition, the defendant proposes that she retain an additional half a million\ndollars in liquid assets in an unrestrained account, as well as any future income.” That figure\nappears to be in addition to the approximately $l million in “chatels” the defendant has disclosed\namong her various assets. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. In short, the defendant’s proposal would leave\nher with ample resources to fund her flight from prosecution.\n\nFurther still, the defendant’s Motion provides only cursory details of the monitorship\nprogram she proposes, and it offers no legal precedent to explain what, if any, authority this Court\nhas to establish and oversee such a monitorship. Aside from defense counsel’s assertions, the\nMotion offers nothing that would enable the Court to meaningfully consider the details of such a\nmonitorship. Among other things, it is unclear from the defendant’s Motion whether such a\nprogram would require the defendant’s voluntary compliance with the monitorship, or whether the\nfunds would be placed in a bank account that the defendant could not access. Given that the\ndefendant’s Motion suggests that atorney’s fees could be disbursed without approval, it appears\nthat the defendant’s proposal would provide her latitude to engage in financial transactions, subject\nonly to a review that would require her voluntary compliance.\n\nFinally, although the defendant does not provide any detail about the amount of money she\nwould pay the monitor, presumably the monitor would not undertake this responsibility for free.\nAs a result, the tension between the monitor’s obligation to review the defendant’s finances and\nthe monitor’s employment relationship with the defendant creates a conflict of interest. But at\nbotom, if the Court determines that the only way to keep the defendant from using her assets to\nflee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too great a flight risk to release.\n\nIn sum, in light of this Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that the defendant “has not been fully candid\nabout her financial situation,” the Court should reject the defendant’s vague proposal. (Dec. Op.\nat 2). Nothing in the defendant’s Motion should alter the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that the defendant\nposes a significant risk of flight, and that she has the resources and skills to flee prosecution. The\nCourt should reject the proposed bail conditions.\n\n3. The Defendant’s Pending Pretrial Motions Have Not Diminished the Strength\nof the Government’s Case\n\nFinally, the defendant also argues that the “numerous substantive pretrial motions nou\nbefore the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government’s case.” (Mot. at 7).\nBut the defendant cannot merely point to the sheer volume of briefing she has filed to suggest that\nthe strength of the Government’s case has diminished. To the contrary, as the Government has set\nforth in detail in its memorandum in opposition, the defendant’s pretrial motions are entirely\nwithout merit. In any event, it is premature for the defendant to claim that her pretrial motions—\nwhich have not been adjudicated, much less granted—have altered the Court’s original\n> The defendant’s proposal also leaves unrestrained several million dollars in escrou for the\ndefendant’s legal fees. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9 (listing approximately $7.6 million in retainer fees);\nsee also Mot. at 6. If the defendant fled the country, her counsel would presumably be required to\nreturn those funds to the defendant, who would no longer need defense counsel in this case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool25o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001251.jpg": "Caseel22 o/o o8BoHAEN 2ADetuMhent ‘LOZ l Filecgsas/O9F2ig eP aged l6h\nPage 9\n<span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that the Government’s case is strong.\nIV. Conclusion\nThe defendant continues to represent a “plain[]” risk of flight. (Dec. Op. at l).

The Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the Defendant presents a risk of flight and that there are no\nset of conditions, including the Defendant’s third set of proposed conditions, that are sufficient to\nreasonably assure her appearance. The presumption in favor of detention, the weight of the\nevidence, and the history and characteristics of the Defendant all continue to support that\nconclusion. The Defendant’s proposed conditions do not alter the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span>.\n\nA. The Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors has not changed\n\nTo begin with, the presumption in favor of detention continues to apply with equal force.\nSee Dkt. No. lo6 (“Dec. Op.”) at 7-8. And though the Court again concludes that the Defendant\nhas met her burden of production, the presumption “remains a factor to be considered among\nthose weighed by the district court.” Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436 (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at\nll44). The Court is mindful “that Congress has found that these offenders pose special risks of\nflight, and that ‘a strong probability arises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate\nto secure their appearance.” Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nThe Court’s analysis of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors also remains unchanged.\n\nBecause the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged include crimes involving a minor\nvictim, the first l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factor continues to weigh strongly in favor of detention.\nAnd the Court remains of the opinion that the Defendant does not pose a danger to any person or\nto the community. The fourth § 3l42(g) factor thus weighs against detention.\n\nWith respect to the second § 3l42(g) factor, none of the Defendant’s new arguments alter\nthe Court’s conclusion as to the weight of the evidence. The Defendant argues that the pre-trial\nmotions “raise serious legal issues that could result in dismissal of charges, if not the entire\nindictment,” and she contends that “[t]hese motions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooool279\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001283.jpg": "Casest: 2o-cr/ooB8G ANA B6cuMe?t VEO 2 Filedsas/22/PagPage 4ol65l2\nparallel those that the Court articulated when the Defendant proposed signing an extradition\nwaiver. See Dec. Op. at l2-l3.\n\nSimilar doubts exist as to the Defendant’s offer to renounce her UK citizenship. The\nCourt is persuaded by the Government’s arguments that even if the Defendant were to renounce\nher UK citizenship, she would still likely be able to delay or resist extradition from the UK. See\nGov’t Opp’n at 6-7. And for largely similar reasons, the Court again concludes that the\nproposed conditions do not meaningfully diminish the Court’s concerns regarding the\nDefendant’s ability to flee and to frustrate or impair any subsequent extradition atempts. The\npossibility that the Defendant could successfully resist or forestall extradition heightens the\nDefendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nTo summarize, the Defendant’s willingness to renounce her French and UK citizenship\ndoes not sufficiently assuage the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight that the Defendant\nposes. Considerable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the\nrenunciations cloud whatever relevance they might otherwise have to the Court’s assessment of\nwhether the Defendant poses a risk of flight. See United States v. Cohen, No. C lo-oo547 (SD,\n2olo WL 5387757, at *9 n.ll (N.D. Cal. Dec. 2o, 2olo). And that same uncertainty—and the\npossibility that she will be able to successfully resist, or at least delay, extradition—incentivizes\nflight, particularly because of the Defendant’s substantial international ties.\n\nNor does the second proposed condition materially alter the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that no\ncondition or combination of conditions can reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The\nDefendant proposes to have a retired federal judge provide oversight authority over her financial\naffairs, and, if granted, he would have the authority to restrain, monitor, and approve\ndisbursement of assets requiring his signature.

Not so. “It is well established in this circuit that proffers are permissible both in\nthe bail <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> and bail revocation contexts.” United States v.

Martir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll45 (2d Cir. l986) (“a\ndetention hearing is not to serve as a mini-trial ... or as a discovery tool for the\ndefendant’). This Court has thus repeatedly upheld the Government’s ability to\nproceed by proffer in bail proceedings. See, e.g., United States v.

Judge Nathan’s reliance on the Government’s proffers was\nentirely proper, particularly on the facts of this case. This is not a case where the\nGovernment “simply stat[ed] in general and conclusory terms what it hoped to\nprove,” or where the Government proffered the statements of a single witness with\na history of perjury. Lafontaine, 2lo F.3d at l3l. The Indictment—which reflects\nfar more than just a proffer but instead the probable cause <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> of the grand\njury after receiving evidence—sets forth in detail the expected testimony of three\nvictim-witnesses, describing specific actions Maxwell took with respect to each.\n(Ind. {| 7(a)-(c)). And as the Government explained, each victim-witness’s testimony\nis corroborated by the testimony of other witnesses and by documentary evidence.\n(Ex. A at 5; Ex. F at 9-l2). Judge Nathan was entitled to rely on these proffers in\nassessing the strength of the evidence.\n\n36. Maxwell’s remaining arguments repeat contentions made belou\nbut do not meaningfully engage with Judge Nathan’s considered rejection of them.\nMaxwell disputes that she was hiding from law enforcement before her arrest (Br.\n23-24), but Judge Nathan was dubious of that assertion and found that even assuming\nMaxwell was hiding from the media, not the Government, her evasive actions\ndemonstrated her “extraordinary capacity to evade detection.” (Ex. D at 87).\nMaxwell asserts in conclusory fashion that her proposed bail package alleviates any\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooool336\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001337.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 4o-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page2o of 25\n\nconcerns about her foreign citizenship or substantial assets (Br. 24-25), but Judge\nNathan thoroughly analyzed these assertions and, after multiple rounds of briefing\nregarding the efficacy of Maxwell’s proposed package, was not persuaded. (Ex. H\nat ll-l4; Ex. L at 8-ll). Maxwell atempts to compare herself to other high-profile\ndefendants (Br. 25), but Judge Nathan rejected the comparison, noting “crucial\nfactual differences” in several of these cases (Ex.

(Br. l3-l9). Judge Nathan did not\nabuse her discretion or clearly err by concluding otherwise.° To the contrary, Judge\nNathan has gone to significant lengths to ensure that Maxwell has adequate access\nto her counsel and opportunity to prepare her defense.\n° As noted, this Court has not resolved which standard of review applies to such an\napplication. The Government submits that the decision of whether temporary release\nis “necessary” is a mixed question of law and fact which, like the district court’s bail\n<span class=\"highlight\">determination</span>, should be reviewed for clear error. See United States v. Matis, 963\nF.3d 285, 29l (2d Cir. 2o2o).

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOnce again, the government reports second- and third-hand information from the MDC,\nthe reliability of which becomes increasingly questionable. In its May 5\" leter regarding the\nMDC’s flashlight security checks of Ms. Maxwell (Dkt. 27o), the government contradicts a\nprevious report that Ms. Maxwell “has an eye mask.” This allegation, immediately refuted by her\ncounsel, was a focus of the Second Circuit’s questioning during oral argument of Ms. Maxwell’s\nbail appeal. Nou, the government reports that the MDC cannot provide an eye mask to Ms.\nMaxwell and that an eye mask is considered contraband. This alone is a basis for the Court to\nquestion the veracity of representations made by the MDC.\n\nTo justify the l5-minute flashlight surveillance that is causing Ms. Maxwell’s disruptive\nsleep and sleep deprivation, the MDC claims that Ms. Maxwell is on “an enhanced security\nschedule.” The reasons given to support the need for “heightened safety and security concerns”\nwith respect to Ms. Maxwell are spurious. They single out Ms. Maxwell to the detriment of\nother pretrial detainees who face even more serious charges and potential stress (i.e., defendants\ncharged with murder and terrorism offenses subjected to life sentences without possibility of\nrelease and the death penalty) and who are incarcerated in cells by themselves. The MDC\natempts to shift the focus of its conduct by claiming that it is responsive to Ms. Maxwell’s\n“expressed concern for her safety if she were housed in general population.”\n\nThe MDC should fact check its records before making bold assertions. The Intake\nScreening Form completed by Ms. Maxwell upon entry to the MDC on July 6, 2o2o posed the\nfollouing question: “Do you knou of any reason why you should not be placed in general\npopulation?” Ms. Maxwell responded “No.” It is the MDC, not the inmate, who makes the\n<span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> regarding general population or degree of segregation.

This Court has already affirmed Judge Nathan’s bail\ndeterminations and denied Maxwell’s application for pretrial release. The only\nchanged circumstance since this Court rendered that decision—Judge Nathan’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that the MDC’s nightime security protocols do not interfere with\nMaxwell’s ability to prepare for trial—does nothing to alter the conclusion that\nJudge Nathan did not clearly err or abuse her discretion when denying Maxwell’s\nprior bail applications.\n\n29. Asan initial mater, it bears noting that Maxwell did not docket\na new appeal from any order entered by Judge Nathan. Instead, she filed her\n“renewed motion” under the same docket as her initial appeal, thereby effectively\nasking the same panel of this Court to reconsider its earlier decision. To the extent\nthis motion is construed as one for panel reconsideration, it is untimely under Federal\nRule of Appellate Procedure 4o(a)(l) and Local Rules 4o.l and 4o.2.\n\n3o. In addition, since this Court denied Maxwell’s bail appeal,\nMaxwell has not filed a renewed motion for bail or temporary release in the District\nCourt based on any alleged changed circumstances. As this Court has explained in\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool455\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001456.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 73, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Pagel6 of 24\n\nthe context of post-conviction bail proceedings, “given the findings that must be\nmade in order to warrant release, it is generally more appropriate that the motion be\nmade initially in the district court.” United States v. Hochevar, 2l4 F.3d 342, 344\n(2d Cir. 2ooo) (per curiam); see Fed. R. App. P. 9(a) (providing for appeals from\ndetention orders); cf. generally Stack v.

The Order Maxwell annexes to her\nmotion—an Order regarding security checks at the MDC (Mot. Ex. B)—ls not a bail\n<span class=\"highlight\">determination</span>, and Maxwell has not taken an appeal from that Order. See Fed. R.\nApp. P. 9(a) (requiring that a party appealing a detention order must file “a copy of\nthe district court’s order . . . as soon as practicable after filing the notice of appeal’).\nNo bail <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> is properly before this Court.\n\n3l. In any event, Maxwell’s “renewed motion” is substantively\nmeritless. This Court has already held that Judge Nathan did not commit clear error\nin finding, three times, that the Government established by a preponderance of the\nevidence that Maxwell is a risk of flight and no bail conditions could reasonably\nassure her appearance in court. This Court has also concluded that Judge Nathan\ndid not abuse her discretion or clearly err in determining that Maxwell’s conditions\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooool456\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001490.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document4 Filed o7/o2/2o Page 4of lo\nthe defendant would encourage victims to accept Epstein’s offers of financial assistance, including\noffers to pay for travel or educational expenses. The victims were as young as l4 years old when\nthey were groomed and abused by Maxwell and Epstein, both of whom knew that their victims\nwere minors.\n\nThe Indictment further alleges that the defendant lied under oath to conceal her crimes. In\n2ol6, the defendant gave deposition testimony in connection with a civil lawsuit in the Southern\nDistrict of New York. During the deposition, the defendant was asked questions about her role in\nfacilitating the abuse of minors.

Applicable Law\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant’s detention pending trial upon a <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that the defendant is either a\ndanger to the community or a risk of flight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). A finding of risk of flight must\nbe supported by a preponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Patriarca, 948 F.2d\n789, 793 (lst Cir. l99l); United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. l987); United States v.\nChimurenga, 76o F.2d 4oo, 4o5 (2d Cir. l985). A finding of dangerousness must be supported by\nclear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 54o, 542 (2d Cir.\nl995); Patriarca, 948 F.2d at 792; Chimurenga, 76o F.2d at 4o5.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act lists four factors to be considered in the detention analysis: (l) the\nnature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person;\n(3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and]\nfinancial resources”; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the defendant’s release.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in opposition to the defendant’s leter of\nAugust lo, 2o2o (the “Defense Leter” or “Def. Ltr.”), requesting that the Court order the\nGovernment to disclose the names of certain Government witnesses ll months prior to trial, and\nrequesting that the Court intervene in the protocols and individualized inmate determinations of\nthe Bureau of Prisons. Both applications should be denied.\n\nA. The Defendant’s Demand That the Government Name Certain Trial Witnesses\n\nFor the third time in as many weeks, the defendant and her counsel have applied to the\nCourt for relief that is premature, meritless, or both. See Order dated July 23, 2o2o (Dkt. 28)\n(denying the defendant’s request that the Court enter an order prohibiting the Government and\natorneys for non-parties from making extrajudicial statements “concerning this case”); Order\ndated July 3o, 2o2o (Dkt. 37) (denying the defendant’s application for a protective order that would\nallou the defense to publicly name and identify victims). In the defendant’s most recent\napplication, she asks the Court to order that the Government disclose a partial witness list, in the\nform of identifying certain victims referenced in the Superseding Indictment (the “Indictment’’),\nfully ll months prior to trial. This request is at best premature given that the production of\ndiscovery, on the schedule agreed to by the defendant, has just begun. Moreover, the parties have\nhad no discussions about—let alone asked the Court to set—a schedule for pretrial disclosures,\nincluding for witness lists and 35oo material.\n\nIn the first instance, the defendant complains about the status of discovery production,\narguing that “almost six weeks since” the arrest of the defendant, the Government is “just nou\nbeginning to produce Rule l6 discovery, despite confirming to the Court that discovery would\nbegin as soon as the Court entered a protective order.” Def. Ltr. at 2. The suggestion that the\nGovernment somehou delayed that initial production is nonsense. As the Court is aware, the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool7l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001722.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 4l Filed o8/l3/2o Page 4 of5\n\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nAugust l3, 2o2o\n\nPage 4\nany such issues as the discovery process continues. To date, the defendant has yet to ask the\nGovernment a single substantive question about the discovery. The Government is also prepared\nto engage in good faith discussions with the defense about an appropriate schedule for disclosure\nof 35oo material, exhibit lists, and witness lists, all of which the Government expects to produce\nreasonably in advance of the trial date in July 2o2l to permit the defense to investigate witnesses.\nBut particularly given the nature of the charges, the Government’s strong desire to protect the\nprivacy of the alleged victims, and the lack of any legal precedent for the defendant’s request, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that at the present time—eleven months prior to trial, nearly\nthree months prior to the discovery deadline, and more than four months prior to the pretrial\nmotions deadline—there is no basis for the defendant to demand the Government disclose the\nidentity of its witnesses.\n\nB. The Defendant’s Request that the Court Dictate the Conditions of Her Confinement\n\nThe defendant’s requests with respect to the conditions of her confinement at the\nMetropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) are similarly premature and unavailing, and her request\nthat the Court dictate the terms of her confinement to the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”’) should also\nbe denied.’\n\nAs an initial mater, the defendant’s argument that she is being treated “worse” than other\ninmates is incorrect. There is no merit to her complaints about being monitored by staff, as it is\nentirely appropriate for BOP to carefully monitor any inmate, particularly a new inmate who has\nnever before been incarcerated and who faces the strong likelihood of serving many years in prison.\nAdditionally, like all inmates, the defendant may be subject to observation or searches of her\nperson or space as appropriate.” It is otherwise entirely unclear what specific “privileges given to\nother pretrial detainees” the defendant believes she is being denied.\n\nMore generally, the defendant, like all pretrial inmates, is subject to an individualized\nassessment by the BOP with respect to his or her placement in a facility. Here, for reasons\nincluding safety, security, and the orderly functioning of the facility, BOP has made the\n<span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that, at present, the defendant should not be fully integrated into the dorm-style\naccommodations of the general population. The Government understands from BOP that it will\n4 Once again, defense counsel has rushed to seek Court intervention on issues they have made litle\nor no meaningful effort to address with the Government or, in this case, the BOP. The Government\nlearned of the defendant’s specific objections to her conditions of incarceration for the first time\nfrom the Defense Leter, and has since conferred with BOP to understand and to address the issues\nas appropriate. Moreover, as noted belou, the defendant filed the instant challenge to the BOP’s\nplan to permit her time to review discovery before the BOP had a chance to implement (and\nultimately modify) that plan.\n> Defense counsel claims that prison staff “constantly observe” the defendant “including her phone\nconversations with defense counsel.” This is misleading. As with all inmates, the defendant is\nable to speak to her counsel behind a closed door, in an area that is visible—but not audible—to\nMDC staff. Among other reasons, this is so MDC staff can ensure that inmates do not complete\ncalls with their counsel and then call other individuals on a non-recorded line.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool722\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001723.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 4l Filed o8/l3/2o Page5of5\n\nHonorable Alison J.

The defendant\nidentifies no basis for the Court to disturb that <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> by the BOP, particularly given that,\nas detailed belou, her housing assignment will not negatively affect her ability to review discovery\nin this case.\n\nRegarding the defendant’s request in connection with access to discovery, the Government\nunderstands from BOP that the defendant had not even yet received her copy of the Government’s\nfirst discovery production at the time the Defense Leter was filed—she received the materials on\nTuesday, August ll. While it is correct that BOP’s initial plan was to provide three hours per day\nof access to the discovery—the same access that is granted to every other pretrial inmate, including\nthose with trial dates scheduled for far earlier than July 2o2l—as of earlier this week, and given\nthe volume of expected discovery, BOP informed the defendant that she will have the opportunity\nto access to her discovery from 7:oo a.m. to 8:oo p.m. every day of the week. Although this\narrangement will be subject to continued evaluation on an ongoing and individualized basis, and\nis subject to ordinary considerations of prison operations, BOP intends to provide that access on\nan ongoing basis to the extent it remains reasonably practicable to do so. Accordingly, this\napplication should be denied as moot.\n\nC. Conclusion\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the defendants’ requests, as set forth in the Defense Leter,\nshould be denied.\n\nRespectfully submited,\nAUDREY STRAUSS\nActing United States Atorney\nBy:\nAlex Rossmiller / Alison Moe / Maurene Comey\nAssistant United States Atorneys\nSouthern District of New York\nTel: (2l2) 637-24l5\nCe: — All counsel of record, via ECF\nDOJ-OGR-ooool723\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001738.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 47 Filed o8/2l/2o Page 2 of 4\nHonorable Alison J.

The requested redactions and\nsealing would thus be necessary to ensure compliance with those sealing orders and is justified\nbased upon them.” Cf Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol Stops Northwest, 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l8 n.9 (l979)\n(“Since the l7th century, grand jury proceedings have been closed to the public; and records of\nsuch proceedings have been kept from the public eye. The rule of grand jury secrecy ... is an\nintegral part of our criminal justice system.”).\n\nAssuming without agreeing that these materials constitute “judicial documents” within the\nmeaning of First Amendment right-of-access jurisprudence, such a <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> would not be\ndispositive. The First Amendment presumptive right of access applies to civil and criminal\nproceedings and “protects the public against the government’s arbitrary interference with access\nto important information.” N.Y. Civil Liberties Union v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth. (“NYCTA”), 684\nF.3d 286, 298 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (internal quotation marks omited). The Circuit has applied two\ndifferent approaches when deciding whether the First Amendment right applies to particular\nmaterial. The “experience-and-logic” approach asks “both whether the documents have\nhistorically been open to the press and general public and whether public access plays a significant\npositive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l2o (2d Cir. 2oo6) (internal quotation marks omited). The second\napproach—employed when analyzing judicial documents related to judicial proceedings covered\nby the First Amendment right—asks whether the documents at issue “‘are derived from or are a\nnecessary corollary of the capacity to atend the relevant proceedings.” /d. (internal quotation\nmarks and alteration omited).\n\nEven when it applies, the First Amendment right creates only a presumptive right of access,\nand the “presumption is rebutable upon demonstration that suppression ‘is essential to preserve\nhigher values and is narrouly tailored to serve that interest.’” Hartford Courant Co. v. Pellegrino,\n38o F.3d 83, 96 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (quoting Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Riverside\nCnty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5lo(l984)) (internal citation omited). “What offends the First Amendment\nis the atempt to [exclude the public] without sufficient justification,” NYCTA, 684 F.3d at 296,\nnot the simple act of exclusion itself. Thus, the presumptive right of access may be overcome by\n“specific, on-the-record findings that sealing is necessary to preserve higher values and only if the\nsealing order is narrouly tailored to achieve that aim.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l24.\n\n* The only exceptions to those sealing orders are the permission contained in a certain order issued\nin April 2ol9, namely that the order itself may be provided to the recipient of a subpoena, and,\npursuant to separate permissions the Government has obtained in connection with its discovery\nobligations, that the entirety of the relevant filings may be provided to the defendant as discovery\nin this criminal case.\nDOJ-OGR- ooool738\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001750.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 5l Filed o9/o2/2o Page 4 of5\n\n3.

Thank you, counsel.\n\n8 I am prepared to make my ruling.\n\n9 Several provisions of federal law govern the court's\nlo <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> whether to detain the defendant or release her on\nll bail pending trial. A court must apply that law equally to all\nl2 defendants no mater hou high profile the case or well off the\nl3 defendant. It is therefore important to begin here with a\nl4 clear articulation of the governing law.\n\nl5 It is also important to bear in mind that Ms. Maxwell,\nl6 like all defendants, is entitled to a full presumption of\nl7 innocence, that is, she is presumed innocent and the only\nl8 grounds for detention at this stage are, under the law, risk of\nl9 flight or danger to the community.\n2o I may consider the weight of the evidence proffered by\n2l the government at this stage in making this <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span>, but\n22 unless this mater is resolved by a plea, it will remain\n23 entirely for a jury to decide the question of Ms. Maxwell's\n24 guilt as to the charges contained in the indictment.\n25 Turning to the government's standard under Title l8 of\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool956\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001957.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 8o of 9l 8o\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl the United States Code, Section 3l42, the court may order\n\n2 detention only if it finds that no conditions or combination of\n3 conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person\n4 as required and the safety of any other person in the\n\n5 community.\n\n6 In making a bail <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> the court must consider\n7 the defendant's dangerousness, if that's raised, and the\n\n8 defendant's risk of flight. A finding of dangerousness, if\n\n9 that were an issue, must be supported by clear and convincing\nlo evidence. A finding that a defendant is a flight risk must be\nll supported by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\nl2 In a case such as this one, where the defendant is\n\nl3 accused of certain offenses involving a minor victim, federal\nl4 law requires that it shall be presumed that no condition or\n\nl5 combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance\nl6 of the person as required. That's citing l8 U.S.C. 3l42(a) (3).\nl7 The Second Circuit has explained that, ina\n\nl8 presumption case such as this, a defendant bears a Limited\n\nl9 burden of production, not a burden of persuasion, to rebut the\n2o presumption by coming forward with evidence that she does not\nal pose a danger to the community or a risk of flight.\n22 Furthermore, once a defendant has met her burden of production\n23 relating to these two factors, the presumption favoring\n24 detention does not disappear entirely, but remains a factor to\n25 be considered among those weighed by the district court.

Boustani, 932\nF.3d 79, 8l (2d Cir. 2ol9) (quoting United States v. Sabhani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7)). The\nBail Reform Act lists three factors to be considered in the detention analysis when the Government\nseeks detention based on flight risk: (l) the nature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2)\nthe weight of the evidence against the person; and (3) the history and characteristics of the\ndefendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and] financial resources.” See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(g). If a judicial officer concludes that “no condition or combination of conditions will\nreasonably assure the appearance of the person as required . . . such judicial officer shall order the\ndetention of the person before trial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l7o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002185.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 24 of 36\nthe media even when a bounty was offered for her location and when numerous media outlets were\nsearching for her.\n\nThe charts, graphs, and affidavits proffered by the defense do not undercut the defendant’s\nskill at evading detection, and do nothing more than restate the justification for those actions that\nthe defense already made at the prior hearing. (See Dkt. l8 at l4-l6). That said, there is still\nreason to believe that the defendant was hiding not just from the press, but also from law\nenforcement. It is undisputed that defense counsel, even while in contact with the Government,\nnever disclosed the defendant’s location or offered her surrender if she were to be charged. (Tr.\n53-54). The Court already inquired about defense counsel’s interactions with the Government in\nthe year leading up to the defendant’s arrest, and the Renewed Bail Application offers nothing new\non that score.

Prior to her arrest,\nthe Government and defense counsel communicated on multiple occasions between July and\nOctober of 2ol9, and communicated briefly on two additional occasions, most recently in March\nof 2o2o. At no point did defense counsel disclose the defendant’s location, offer to surrender the\ndefendant, or offer to bring the defendant in to be interviewed.\n\nMoreover it is undisputed that when the FBI located the defendant, she ignored their\ndirectives and ran away from the arresting agents. Although the defense has submited an affidavit\nfrom the defendant’s private security team, nothing in that affidavit should alter the Court’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that detention is appropriate here. The defense already informed the Court at the\nJuly l4, 2o2o bail hearing that the defendant’s security protocol was to move to an inner room if\nher security was breached. (Tr. 55). Even still, the new affidavit makes clear that the agents who\nentered the defendant’s property were wearing clothing that clearly identified them as FBI agents.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l85\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002231.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo4 Filed l2/28/2o Page 2 of 2\nnone of the new information that the Defendant presented in support of her application has a\nmaterial bearing on the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that she poses a flight risk.\n\nFurthermore, for substantially the same reasons as the Court determined that detention\nwas warranted in the initial bail hearing, the Court again concludes that no conditions of release\ncan reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance at future proceedings. In reaching that\nconclusion, the Court considers the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged, the weight\nof the evidence against the Defendant, the history and characteristics of the Defendant, and the\nnature and seriousness of the danger that the Defendant’s release would pose. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(g). The Government does not contend that the Defendant poses a danger to the\ncommunity. Nonetheless the Court determines that the other three factors warrant detention\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). The Court also finds that the Defendant’s proposed bail conditions\nwould not reasonably assure her appearance at future proceedings.\n\nAs a result, the Court concludes that the Government has met its burden of persuasion\nthat the Defendant poses a flight risk and that pre-trial detention continues to be warranted.\n\nOn or before December 3o, 2o2o, the parties are ORDERED to submit a joint leter\nindicating whether they propose any redactions and the justification for any such proposal.\n\nThis resolves Dkt No. 97.\n\nDated: December 28, 2o2o\nNew York, New York ALISON J.

Legal Standard\n\nPretrial detainees have a right to bail under the Eighth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution, which prohibits the imposition of “[e]xcessive bail,” and under the Bail Reform\nAct, l8 U.S.C. § 3l4l, et seg. The Bail Reform Act requires the Court to release a defendant\n“subject to the least restrictive further condition, or combination of conditions, that [it]\ndetermines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B). Only if, after considering the\nfactors set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concludes that “no condition or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of\nany other person and the community,” may the Court order that the defendant be held without\nbail. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\nIf there is probable cause to find that the defendant commited an offense specifically\nenumerated in § 3l42(e)(3), a rebutable presumption arises “that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure” the defendant's appearance or the safety of the community or\nothers. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). In such circumstances, “the defendant ‘bears a limited burden of\nproduction . . . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he does not pose\na danger to the community or a risk of flight.’”” United States v. English, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d\nCir. 2oll) (quoting United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool)); see also\nUnited States v. Rodriguez, 95o F.2d 85, 88 (2d Cir. l99l) (“[A] defendant must introduce some\nevidence contrary to the presumed fact in order to rebut the presumption.”). Nonetheless, “‘the\ngovernment retains the ultimate burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence that the\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2235\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002236.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page 4 of 22\ndefendant presents a danger to the community,’ and ‘by the lesser standard of a preponderance of\nthe evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight.’” English, 629 F.3d at 3l9 (quoting\nMercedes, 254 F.3d at 436); see also United States v. Martir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll44 (2d Cir. l986)\n(“The government retains the burden of persuasion [in a presumption case].”). Even when “a\ndefendant has met his burden of production,” houever, “the presumption favoring detention does\nnot disappear entirely, but remains a factor to be considered among those weighed by the district\ncourt.” United States v. Matis, 963 F.3d 285, 29o-9l (2d Cir. 2o2o).\n\nAfter a court has made an initial <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that no conditions of release can\nreasonably assure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court may reopen the bail\nhearing if “information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and\nthat has a material bearing on the issue” of whether pretrial detention is warranted. l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(f). But the Court is not required to reopen the hearing or to conduct another hearing if it\ndetermines that any new information would not have a material bearing on the issue. See United\nStates v. Raniere, No. l8-CR-2o4l (NGG) (VMS), 2ol8 WL 63442o2, at *2 n.7 (E.D.N.Y. Dec.\n5, 2ol8) (noting that “[a]s the court has already held one detention hearing, it need not hold\nanother” the standards set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2) are met); United States v.

Discussion\n\nThe Defendant bases her renewed motion for bail on both l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f) and the\nCourt’s inherent pouers to review its oun bail decisions. See Def. Mot. at 7-9. As already\nnoted, § 3l42(f) provides that a bail hearing “may be reopened . . . at any time before trial if the\njudicial officer finds that information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2236\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002240.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page 8 of 22\nabrogated on other grounds by United States v. O’Brien, 895 F.2d 8lo (lst Cir. l99o). That\nburden is “limited.” United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool). The\nDefendant’s proffer of evidence and information—including information relating to her financial\nconditions and her family ties to the United States, among other things—satisfies this limited\nburden. As the Court discussed at the July l4, 2o2o hearing, these factors bear on the question\nof whether the Defendant poses a flight risk. And the evidence she advances in her renewed\nmotion for bail reasonably disputes the presumption that she poses a flight risk. In that sense,\nthis evidence is relevant to the ultimate <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> and satisfies the relatively lou threshold\nimposed by the burden of production.\n\nThe presumption of flight does not disappear entirely, houever, and it “remains a factor\nto be considered among those weighed by the district court.” United States v. Mercedes, 254\nF.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool) (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44). Asa result, “[a] judicial officer\nconducting a detention hearing should, even after a defendant has come forward with rebutal\nevidence, continue to give the presumption of flight some weight by keeping in mind that\nCongress has found that these offenders pose special risks of flight, and that ‘a strong probability\narises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate to secure their appearance.” Martir,\n782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nB. The new information does not alter the Court’s initial <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span>\n\nWhen determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the person as required, courts are required to consider the factors outlined in l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42(g). Thus, the Court considers (l) the nature and circumstances of the offense\ncharged, including whether the offense involves a minor victim, (2) the weight of the evidence,\n(3) the defendant’s history and characteristics, and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo224o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002242.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page lo of 22\nweight of the evidence is weak. Def. Reply at 2. But she too easily discredits the witness\ntestimony. According to the Government, and as reflected in the indictment, it is anticipated that\nthe three witnesses will provide detailed and corroborating accounts of the Defendant’s alleged\nrole in enticing minors to engage in sex acts. See Gov’t Opp’n at lo; see also Dkt. No. l7, Sl\nSuperseding Indictment, 4 7, ll, l3, l7. Moreover, the Government proffers that additional\nevidence, including flight records and other witnesses’ corroborating testimony, will further\nsupport the main witnesses’ testimony and link the Defendant to Epstein’s conduct. Gov’t\nOpp’n at lo-ll. And while the Defendant contends that much of this evidence focuses on\nEpstein, not the Defendant, the nature of the conspiracy charge (along with the evidence linking\nthe Defendant to Epstein) renders this evidence relevant to the Government’s charges against\nher. As the Court stated in the July l4, 2o2o hearing, although the Court does not prejudge the\nmerits of the Government’s case or of the Defendant’s defenses, for purposes of the bail\n<span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> stage, the Government’s proffered case against the Defendant remains strong. See\nDkt. No. 93 (“Tr.”) at 83:4—83:lo. The Court again concludes that the Defendant’s awareness of\nthe potential strength of the government’s case against her creates a risk of flight, and none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments meaningfully alter that conclusion. As a result, the second factor\nsupports detention.\n\n2. The Defendant’s History and Characteristics\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court determined that the Defendant was a flight\nrisk in part because of her substantial international ties, including multiple foreign citizenships\nand familial and personal connections abroad and her ounership of at least one foreign property\nof significant value. See Tr. at 83:l3-83:l8. And the Court further noted that the Defendant’s\nextraordinary financial resources could provide her the means to flee the country even despite\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2242\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002244.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page l2 of 22\nsuccessfully to resist extradition to the United States in relation to the charges in the superseding\nindictment dated 7 July 2o2o.”); Def.

Nor has the Defendant\npresented any cases where courts addressed the question of whether an anticipatory waiver of\nextradition is enforceable; while she cites cases where defendants offered to waive extradition,\nthe reasoning in those cases turned on other factors and the courts did not dwell on the\nenforceability of such waivers. See, e.g., United States v. Cirillo, No. 99-l5l4, l999 WL\nl456536, at *2 (3d Cir. July l3, l999); United States v. Salvagno, 3l4 F. Supp. 2d ll5, ll9\n(N.D.N.Y. 2oo4); United States v. Karni, 298 F. Supp. 2d l29, l32-33 (D.D.C. 2oo4); United\nStates v. Chen, 82o F. Supp. l2o5, l2l2 (N.D. Cal. l992). In those cases, the courts included\nsuch waivers as one among several conditions of release, but they did not make any express\n<span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that such waivers are enforceable. On the other hand, some courts have expressly\nopined that such waivers are unenforceable. See, e.g., United States v. Epstein, 425 F. Supp. 3d\n3o6, 325 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (describing the “Defense proposal to give advance consent to\nextradition and waiver of extradition rights” as “an empty gesture.”); United States v. Morrison,\nNo. l6-MR-ll8, 2ol6 WL 742l924, at *4 (W.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, 2ol6) (“Although the defendants\nhave signed a waiver of extradition, such a waiver may not become valid until an extradition\nrequest is pending in Canada and may be subject to withdrawal.”); United States v.

Here,\ntoo, the Court’s original <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> applies with equal force. As the Court noted at the\noriginal hearing, the Defendant has demonstrated an extraordinary capacity to evade detection,\n“Te]ven in the face of what the Defense has acknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to\nlocate her.” Tr. at 87:4-87:l9. Indeed, regardless of whether the Defendant sought to evade the\npress, rather than law enforcement, in the months leading up to her arrest, her sophistication in\nevading detection reveals the futility of relying on any conditions, including GPS monitoring,\nrestrictive home confinement, and private security guards, to secure her appearance. See Tr. at\n87:4—88:2. As other courts have observed, “home detention with electronic monitoring does not\nprevent flight; at best, it limits a fleeing defendant’s head start.” United States v. Zarger, No. oo-\nCR-773-S-l (JG), 2ooo WL ll34364, at *l (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ooo). Furthermore, while the\nDefendant nou represents that she would be released to the custody of a family member, who\nwould serve as the Defendant’s third-party custodian under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)(@), and\nthat she secured a residence in the Eastern District of New York, see Def. Mot. at 3, that does not\noutweigh the other significant factors weighing in favor of detention. And finally, the\nDefendant’s argument that private security guards could ensure her appearance at future\nproceedings runs afoul of the Bail Reform Act, which the Second Circuit has held “does not\npermit a two-tiered bail system in which defendants of lesser means are detained pending trial\nwhile wealthy defendants are released to self-funded private jails.” United States v. Boustani,\n932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2ol9). As in Boustani, the Defendant in the present case would be\ndetained regardless of her wealth, and “if a similarly situated defendant of lesser means would be\ndetained, a wealthy defendant cannot avoid detention by relying on his personal funds to pay for\nprivate detention.” Jd.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo225l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002252.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page 2o of 22\n\nIn light of the above, the Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight and that the\nDefendant’s proposed conditions are insufficient to reasonably assure her appearance. The\npresumption in favor of detention, the weight of the evidence, and the history and characteristics\nof the Defendant all support that conclusion, and none of Defendant’s new arguments change the\nCourt’s original <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span>.\n\nD. The Defendant’s conditions of confinement do not justify release\n\nLastly, the Court is unpersuaded by the Defendant’s argument that the conditions of her\nconfinement are uniquely onerous, interfere with her ability to participate in her defense, and\nthus justify release. See Def. Mot. at 35-38. Indeed, the Defendant does not meaningfully\ndispute that she has received “more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review her\ndiscovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys.” Gov’t Opp’n at\n29. To the extent that the Defendant has concerns regarding some of the measures taken by\nBOP, including a recent lockdoun due to COVID-l9 that curtailed in-person legal visitations,\nthe Defendant provides no authority to conclude that this, standing alone, violates her\nconstitutional right to participate in her defense. And while the Court acknouledges the\nDefendant’s concerns regarding the conditions of her confinement, the Defendant has failed to\nprovide any basis to conclude that release is warranted on those grounds—even after the Court\nhas determined that she continues to pose a flight risk.?\n3 The Court will continue to ensure that the Defendant has the ability to speak and meet regularly\nwith her atorneys and to review all necessary discovery materials to prepare for her defense.\nDefense counsel shall confer with the Government on any specific requests. To the extent they\nare not reasonably accommodated, an application may be made to the Court.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2252\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002253.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page 2l of 22\n\nFinally, as the Court expressed at the initial bail hearing, it has deep concerns about the\nspread of COVID-l9 at BOP facilities, including at the MDC. Indeed, in recent weeks, the\nincidence of COVID-l9 among the inmate population where the Defendant is housed is truly\nalarming. See COVID-l9: Coronavirus, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, htps://www.bop.gov/\ncoronavirus/ (last visited Dec. 28, 2o2o) (noting that the MDC currently has 99 inmates and ll\nstaff members who have tested positive for COVID-l9). It could be argued that in the face of\nthis, only those defendants who pose a danger to the community ought to be detained pending\ntrial. If that were the law and in light of the increasing positivity rate, the Court would not\nhesitate to reopen the detention hearing and release the Defendant on bail since the Government\nrests none of its arguments on dangerousness. But that is not the law. Moreover, as the Court\nfound at the initial bail hearing, the Defendant has no underlying health conditions that put her at\nheightened risk of health impacts were she to contract COVID. The pandemic, including\nincreasing positivity numbers in the MDC, is not a basis for release in this case where the Court\nfinds that the Defendant poses a substantial and actual risk of flight and that no combination of\nconditions could reasonably assure her appearance.\n\nE. A hearing is unnecessary\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the parties’ arguments, the Court determines that a hearing is\nunnecessary and that it can resolve the motion on the papers. The briefing from both sides\ncomprehensively lays out the parties’ respective arguments For the reasons stated above, none\nof the new information has a material bearing on the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that the Defendant\nposes a flight risk.

Rather than\nwait a short time until residents of counties constituting the Manhatan Division of this District\ncould appear for grand jury service, the government, in its apparent <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> to mark the\nanniversary of its indictment of Jeffrey Epstein with a July 2, 2o2o announcement of the\nindictment and arrest of Ghislaine Maxwell, sought and obtained an indictment of Ms. Maxwell\nthrough a grand jury drawn from the White Plains Division. In doing so, the government\nprocured Ms. Maxwell’s indictment using a grand jury pool that excluded residents of the\ncommunity in which Ms. Maxwell allegedly commited the offenses with which she is charged,\nand in which she will be tried, in favor of a grand jury drawn from a community in which Black\nand Hispanic residents are significantly underrepresented by comparison. The government thus\nviolated Ms. Maxwell’s Sixth Amendment right to be indicted by a grand jury drawn from a fair-\ncross section of the community.!\n\nIt was unnecessary for the government to take this step. According to an email from a\ncourt official filed in connection with a similar challenge to the government’s practice, a\nManhatan grand jury was seated as early as June 25, 2o2o—four days before Ms. Maxwell was\nindicted. See Exhibit A to Reply Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss, U.S. v. Balde,\nNo. l:2o-cr-oo28l-KPF (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No. 7o-l (filed Dec. 23, 2o2o). Had the government\nwaited until that time, it might have been unable to meet its arbitrary July 2 deadline, and its\npress conference touting the indictment and arrest of Ms. Maxwell might have had slightly less\n' The fact that Ms. Maxwell herself is neither Black nor Hispanic does not deprive of her of standing to raise this\nchallenge. “[T]he Sixth Amendment entitles every defendant to object to a venire that is not designed to represent a\nfair cross section of the community, whether or not the systematically excluded groups are groups to which he\nhimself belongs.” Holland v.

The role of protective orders in civil litigation.\n\nProtective orders serve a “vital function” in civil litigation. Martindell v. Int’l Tel. & Tel.\nCorp., 594 F.2d 29l, 295 (2d Cir. l979). They promote “the ‘secure the just, speedy, and\ninexpensive <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span>’ of civil disputes, by encouraging full disclosure of all evidence.” /d.\n(quoting Fed. R.

In particular, as here, “witnesses might be\nexpected frequently to refuse to testify pursuant to protective orders if their testimony were to be\nmade available to the Government for criminal investigatory purposes in disregard of those\norders.” Martindell, 594 F.2d at 295—96. Parties thus rely on protective orders, and courts strictly\nenforce them. See, e.g., Stewart v. Hudson Hall LLC, 2o Civ. 885 (SLC), 2o2o WL 7239676, at\n*2 (S.D.N.Y.

Sabath, 99o F. Supp. loo7, lol8 (N.D. Ill. l998) (quoting,\nBLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY l27o (6th ed.l99o)).\n\nAs noted by Chief Judge McMahon in United States v. Santiago, 987 F. Supp. 2d 465,\n488-9l (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3), “[t]he Second Circuit has never specifically declined to adopt the\nLovasco ‘Footnote l7’ test (as restated in Eight Thousand Eight Hundred Fifty Dollars). Nor has\nit specifically found that pre-indictment delay engendered in reckless disregard of circumstances\nthat would likely impede a defendant's ability to mount a defense can never violate the Due\nProcess Clause.”\n\nCourts generally agree that (l) “tactical, reckless, or bad faith preindictment delay that\nunduly prejudices a defendant is constitutionally dubious,” United States v. McNeal, No. o3 CR\n8o, 2oo6 WL 76ol86, at *6 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 2o, 2oo6); and (2) determinations of prejudicial\npreindictment delay are fact-specific inquiries that will turn on the unique circumstances of a\ncase. See Marion, 4o4 U.S. at 324-25; Lovasco, 43l US. at 797.4\n\nThis is that case.\n\n4 Several Circuit Courts of Appeal interpret Marion/Lovasco as requiring a balancing test that\nweighs the prejudice to a defendant against the government's reasons for the delay. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Valentine, 783 F.2d l4l3, l4l6 (9th Cir. l986); Houell v. Barker, 9o4 F.2d 889, 895 (4th Cir.\nl99o); United States v.

Legal commentators have, for many years, discussed the\nCircuit split regarding the test to be applied to claims of pre-indictment delay and called for the U.S.\nSupreme Court to resolve the mater.

Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies.

ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA.

OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstetn’s crimes about the existence of the NPA.

See Rodgers, lol\nF.3d at 25l.!\n\nThe Court’s lack of jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion does not leave the defendant\nwithout a remedy. The defendant can withdraw her pending bail appeal to restore jurisdiction to\nthis Court. Alternatively, the Court can follou the procedure set forth in Rule 37(a) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure, which provides that if the defendant makes a timely motion for relief\n“that the court lacks authority to grant because of an appeal that has been docketed and is pending,\nthe court may: (l) defer considering the motion; (2) deny the motion; or (3) state either that it\nwould grant the motion if the court of appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a\nsubstantial issue.” Houever, the defendant should not be permited to simultaneously pursue bail\nin both this Court and the Second Circuit.\n\nWil. The Court Should Not Reverse Its Prior Well-Reasoned and Thorough Bail\nDecisions\n\nEven if this Court had jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion, the motion should be\ndenied. This Court has already twice made the <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. In particular, the Court has found, “the charges, which carry a presumption of detention,\n' While the Government has not identified a case addressing the precise issue with which the Court\nis confronted, several considerations support the Government’s position that the Court does not\npresently have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion. In addition to the rule articulated by\nthe Supreme Court in Griggs, in Ching v. United States, the Second Circuit found that while an\nappeal from the denial of a Section 2255 motion was pending, the district court could not rule on\na motion to amend the Section 2255 motion. 298 F.3d l74, l8o n.5 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (“The district\ncourt could not rule on any motion affecting an aspect of the case that was before [the Second\nCircuit], including a motion to amend the motion, while that appeal was pending.”’). Here, too,\nwhile the defendant’s appeal of the denial of the Second Bail Motion is pending, the Court should\nnot grant the defendant’s motion to reconsider that very same bail ruling. Rule 9 of the Federal\nRules of Appellate Procedure, which governs release in a criminal case, also supports such a\nreading. Rule 9(b), which governs release after a judgment of conviction, provides that a “party\nentitled to do so may obtain review of a district-court order regarding release after a judgment of\nconviction by filing a notice of appeal from that order in the district court, or by filing a motion in\nthe court of appeals if the party has already filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of\nconviction.” In United States v. Hochevar, 2l4 F.3d 342 (2d Cir. 2ooo), the Second Circuit found\nthat Rule 9(b) contemplates going to the district court first for a bail ruling after a notice of appeal\nfrom the judgment of conviction is filed. Rule 9(a), which governs release before a judgment of\nconviction, does not say anything about going back to the district court for a new bail ruling after\na notice of appeal from a prior bail ruling is filed. In addition, Rule 9(a)(2) provides that the court\nof appeals “must promptly determine” the pre-judgment bail appeal. Such promptness would not\nbe necessary if defendants could go back to the district court with another bail motion while the\nbail appeal is pending.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo275o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002751.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l65 Filed o3/o9/2l Page 4 of 9\nPage 4\n\nare serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the\nGovernment, including multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, is strong; the\nDefendant has substantial resources and foreign ties (including citizenship in a country that does\nnot extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who lived in hiding and apart from the family to\nwhom she nou asserts important ties, has not been fully candid about her financial situation.”\n(Dec.

Moreover, the Court should reject as premature the defendant’s assertion that\nher pretrial motions have somehou weakened the Government’s case; those motions have not been\nadjudicated, and, for the reasons set forth in the Government’s opposition memorandum, the\ndefendant’s motions have no merit.\n\nIn short, all three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors—the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncontinue to weigh heavily in favor of detention, and the defendant’s Motion does not present any\ninformation that warrants revisiting this Court’s well-reasoned and detailed prior decisions.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n“After a court has made an initial <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that no conditions of release can reasonably\nassure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court may reopen the bail hearing if\n‘information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a\nmaterial bearing on the issue’ of whether pretrial detention is warranted.” (Dec. Op. at 4 (quoting\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)). “A court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent authority,\neven where the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text.” (Ud. at 5). Although courts\nin this Circuit have recognized that “a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence\nproffered on reconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing,” United\nStates v. Roue, No. o2 Cr. 756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3),\ngenerally the moving party must establish that its arguments “warrant reconsideration” by, for\nexample, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or incorrectly applied the law,” or\nthat failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.” United States v. Petrov, No. l5\nCr. 66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nThe defendant’s Motion rests on three arguments, none of which is availing. First, the\ndefendant offers to renounce her foreign citizenship, claiming that this eliminates the risk that she\nwill flee from prosecution. Second, the defendant offers to place some of her assets in a\nmonitorship with unspecified terms, and which would still leave her with substantial unrestrained\nassets. Third, the defendant claims that her voluminous pretrial motions have diminished the\nstrength of the Government’s case. None of these arguments is persuasive, and the Motion should\nbe denied.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo275l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002752.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l65 Filed o3/o9/2l Page 5 of 9\nPage 5\nl. The Defendant’s Alleged Willingness to Renounce Her Foreign Citizenship\nShould Not Alter the Court’s Prior Bail Determinations\n\nThe defendant contends that she has materially strengthened her proposed bail package by\noffering to renounce her foreign citizenship “if the Court so requires.” (Mot. at 2). She claims\nthat such a renunciation will “eliminate any opportunity for her to seek refuge” in France and the\nUnited Kingdom or “remove[] any incentive the Court and government believe she may have to\nseek refuge in those countries.” (/d. at 2, 5). The defendant is wrong. That she is “willing” to\nrenounce her foreign citizenship would do nothing to prevent the defendant from fleeing and then\nfighting extradition once abroad, and it does nothing to diminish the risk that the defendant could\nchoose to flee to another jurisdiction altogether, including one with which the United States does\nnot have an extradition treaty and from which extradition is impossible. The Court previously\nfound that the likelihood that the defendant “would be able to frustrate any extradition requests . .\n. weighs strongly in favor of detention” (Dec. Op. at l3); the defendant’s Motion provides no basis\nto disturb this finding. Indeed, just as the defendant’s offer to execute anticipatory extradition\nwaivers failed to provide the Court with any assurance that she would not frustrate any potential\nextradition, so too should her offer to renounce her foreign citizenship.\n\nFirst, the defendant’s willingness to renounce her citizenship is an offer of unclear validity.\nAs an initial mater, the defendant’s offer is itself of litle value, as she would at bare minimum\nhave to follou the legal requirements atendant to each country in order to formally renounce her\ncitizenship. Moreover, she provides no assurances—nor could she—that she will not contest the\nvalidity and/or voluntariness of such a renunciation once she is actually in France or the United\nKingdom. For example, the Government understands that in order to give up one’s British\ncitizenship or status, one must be, among other things, “of sound mind (unless it’s decided that it’s\nin your best interest).” See www.gov.uk/renounce-british-nationality. The defendant could choose\nto frustrate any future extradition proceedings by claiming that her decision to give up her\ncitizenship was compelled by some person or circumstance, or that she was not of sound mind.\nSimply put, while the defendant may believe that it is in her interest to give up her citizenship nou,\nthere is no way for the defendant to assure the Court that she will not take the contrary position in\nthe future if she believes it to be in her interest at the time. And even if the defendant could not\nchallenge her renunciation, it is unclear whether, as a separate mater, she could seek to have her\ncitizenship rights restored.\n\nSecond, and related, the defendant has offered no authority for the proposition that her offer\nto renounce foreign citizenship would have any impact on an extradition proceeding, nor has she\nreckoned with the Court’s findings regarding her offer to sign a so-called irrevocable waiver of\nher extradition rights. See United States v. Cohen, No. lo Cr. 547 (SI), 2olo WL 5387757, at *9\nn.ll (N.D. Cal. Dec. 2o, 2olo) (“Defendant’s offers to turn in his passports, to ‘renounce’ his\nIsraeli citizenship, and have someone ‘instruct’ the Israeli embassy to deny new documents or\ntravel authorizations to defendant, as well as his offer to waive extradition—assuming he flees\noverseas at some point—do not sufficiently assure the Court that defendant is not still a flight risk.\nDefendant offers no authority about the real impact of these offers or whether they are enforceable\nin Israel if defendant were to flee there.”). The Court placed “litle weight” on the defendant’s\nargument in the Second Bail Motion that waiver of the right to appeal an extradition order indicates\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2752\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002754.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l65 Filed o3/o9/2l Page 7 of 9\nPage 7\nwould be forced to wait years for the defendant’s return.\n\nAs the Government has repeatedly emphasized, the strong possibility that the defendant\ncould successfully resist extradition only heightens the defendant’s incentive to flee. (Dkt. No.\nloo at l9-2o). Indeed, in rejecting the defendant’s offer in the Second Bail Motion to execute\nanticipatory extradition waivers, the Court noted, among other things, “the likelihood that any\nextradition would be a difficult and lengthy process.” (Dec. Op. at l3). The Court further noted\nthat the “likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any extradition requests—even\nif she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition entirely—weighs strongly in favor\nof detention.” (/d.). That statement remains true even if the face of the defendant’s newest offer\nto renounce her foreign citizenship.\n\nAs this Court previously found, the defendant has substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, and ouns at least one foreign property of significant value. (Dec.\nOp. at lo-ll). The defendant’s alleged willingness to renounce her foreign citizenship should not\nfundamentally alter the Court’s conclusions.\n\n2. The Court Should Reject the Defendant’s Proposed Monitorship Condition\n\nNext, the defendant has offered to place a portion of her and her spouse’s assets into a new\naccount that “will be monitored by a retired federal District Court judge and former United States\nAtorney who will function as asset monitor and will have co-signing authority over the account.”\n(Mot. at 2). This proposed condition—the details of which are vague—is insufficient to ensure\nthat the defendant appears in Court.\n\nIt first bears noting that the defendant’s finances—and her candor with the Court about\nthose finances— is not an issue of first impression. Significantly absent from the defendant’s\nMotion is any atempt to address the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that the defendant’s “lack of candor\nraises significant concerns as to whether the Court has nou been provided a full and accurate\npicture of her finances and as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of conditions of\nrelease.” (Dec. Op. at l6). That is critical because the value of any proposed monitorship would\ndepend entirely on the monitor having a completely accurate picture of the defendant’s finances\nand access to all of her accounts and sources of wealth. Given the Court’s concerns about the\ndefendant’s candor, the Court should hesitate before trusting the defendant to be transparent with\na monitor under her employ.\n\nIn any event, even if the Court were to accept the defendant’s representations about her\nassets at face value, the defendant’s proposal would leave the defendant with significant assets\nunrestrained. In particular, the defendant’s proposal does not in any way restrain her $2 million\ntounhouse in London, which she could live in or sell to support herself. Although the defendant\nasserts that the monitor would oversee any account into which the proceeds of the sale of the\ndefendant’s properties were deposited, the defendant does not explain hou the monitor—or this\nCourt—would have the authority to force the defendant to deposit foreign assets in a domestic\naccount. As the Government has previously explained, the Government cannot realistically\nrecover assets abroad. Accordingly, the defendant’s proposal would leave her with access to at\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2754\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002755.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l65 Filed o3/o9/2l Page 8 of 9\nPage 8\nleast $2 million. In addition, the defendant proposes that she retain an additional half a million\ndollars in liquid assets in an unrestrained account, as well as any future income.” That figure\nappears to be in addition to the approximately $l million in “chatels” the defendant has disclosed\namong her various assets. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. In short, the defendant’s proposal would leave\nher with ample resources to fund her flight from prosecution.\n\nFurther still, the defendant’s Motion provides only cursory details of the monitorship\nprogram she proposes, and it offers no legal precedent to explain what, if any, authority this Court\nhas to establish and oversee such a monitorship. Aside from defense counsel’s assertions, the\nMotion offers nothing that would enable the Court to meaningfully consider the details of such a\nmonitorship. Among other things, it is unclear from the defendant’s Motion whether such a\nprogram would require the defendant’s voluntary compliance with the monitorship, or whether the\nfunds would be placed in a bank account that the defendant could not access. Given that the\ndefendant’s Motion suggests that atorney’s fees could be disbursed without approval, it appears\nthat the defendant’s proposal would provide her latitude to engage in financial transactions, subject\nonly to a review that would require her voluntary compliance.\n\nFinally, although the defendant does not provide any detail about the amount of money she\nwould pay the monitor, presumably the monitor would not undertake this responsibility for free.\nAs a result, the tension between the monitor’s obligation to review the defendant’s finances and\nthe monitor’s employment relationship with the defendant creates a conflict of interest. But at\nbotom, if the Court determines that the only way to keep the defendant from using her assets to\nflee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too great a flight risk to release.\n\nIn sum, in light of this Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that the defendant “has not been fully candid\nabout her financial situation,” the Court should reject the defendant’s vague proposal. (Dec. Op.\nat 2). Nothing in the defendant’s Motion should alter the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that the defendant\nposes a significant risk of flight, and that she has the resources and skills to flee prosecution. The\nCourt should reject the proposed bail conditions.\n\n3. The Defendant’s Pending Pretrial Motions Have Not Diminished the Strength\nof the Government’s Case\n\nFinally, the defendant also argues that the “numerous substantive pretrial motions nou\nbefore the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government’s case.” (Mot. at 7).\nBut the defendant cannot merely point to the sheer volume of briefing she has filed to suggest that\nthe strength of the Government’s case has diminished. To the contrary, as the Government has set\nforth in detail in its memorandum in opposition, the defendant’s pretrial motions are entirely\nwithout merit. In any event, it is premature for the defendant to claim that her pretrial motions—\nwhich have not been adjudicated, much less granted—have altered the Court’s original\n> The defendant’s proposal also leaves unrestrained several million dollars in escrou for the\ndefendant’s legal fees. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9 (listing approximately $7.6 million in retainer fees);\nsee also Mot. at 6. If the defendant fled the country, her counsel would presumably be required to\nreturn those funds to the defendant, who would no longer need defense counsel in this case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2755\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002756.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l65 Filed o3/o9/2l Page 9 of 9\nPage 9\n<span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that the Government’s case is strong.\nIV. Conclusion\nThe defendant continues to represent a “plain[]” risk of flight. (Dec. Op. at l). Even\nassuming the Court has jurisdiction to grant this third bail motion, the two new bail conditions\noffer insufficient protection against the “substantial and actual risk of flight” this Court has already\nfound that the defendant poses.

The Court is not required to do so if it determines that any new\ninformation would not have a material bearing on the issue. See United States v. Raniere, No.\nl8-CR-2o4l (NGG) (VMS), 2ol8 WL 63442o2, at *2 n.7 (E.D.N.Y.

The Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the Defendant presents a risk of flight and that there are no\nset of conditions, including the Defendant’s third set of proposed conditions, that are sufficient to\nreasonably assure her appearance. The presumption in favor of detention, the weight of the\nevidence, and the history and characteristics of the Defendant all continue to support that\nconclusion. The Defendant’s proposed conditions do not alter the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span>.\n\nA. The Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors has not changed\n\nTo begin with, the presumption in favor of detention continues to apply with equal force.\nSee Dkt. No. lo6 (“Dec. Op.”) at 7-8. And though the Court again concludes that the Defendant\nhas met her burden of production, the presumption “remains a factor to be considered among\nthose weighed by the district court.” Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436 (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at\nll44). The Court is mindful “that Congress has found that these offenders pose special risks of\nflight, and that ‘a strong probability arises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate\nto secure their appearance.” Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nThe Court’s analysis of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors also remains unchanged.\n\nBecause the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged include crimes involving a minor\nvictim, the first l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factor continues to weigh strongly in favor of detention.\nAnd the Court remains of the opinion that the Defendant does not pose a danger to any person or\nto the community. The fourth § 3l42(g) factor thus weighs against detention.\n\nWith respect to the second § 3l42(g) factor, none of the Defendant’s new arguments alter\nthe Court’s conclusion as to the weight of the evidence. The Defendant argues that the pre-trial\nmotions “raise serious legal issues that could result in dismissal of charges, if not the entire\nindictment,” and she contends that “[t]hese motions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2772\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002776.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l69 Filed o3/22/2l Page lo of l2\nparallel those that the Court articulated when the Defendant proposed signing an extradition\nwaiver. See Dec. Op. at l2-l3.\n\nSimilar doubts exist as to the Defendant’s offer to renounce her UK citizenship. The\nCourt is persuaded by the Government’s arguments that even if the Defendant were to renounce\nher UK citizenship, she would still likely be able to delay or resist extradition from the UK. See\nGov’t Opp’n at 6-7. And for largely similar reasons, the Court again concludes that the\nproposed conditions do not meaningfully diminish the Court’s concerns regarding the\nDefendant’s ability to flee and to frustrate or impair any subsequent extradition atempts. The\npossibility that the Defendant could successfully resist or forestall extradition heightens the\nDefendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nTo summarize, the Defendant’s willingness to renounce her French and UK citizenship\ndoes not sufficiently assuage the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight that the Defendant\nposes. Considerable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the\nrenunciations cloud whatever relevance they might otherwise have to the Court’s assessment of\nwhether the Defendant poses a risk of flight. See United States v. Cohen, No. C lo-oo547 (SD,\n2olo WL 5387757, at *9 n.ll (N.D. Cal. Dec. 2o, 2olo). And that same uncertainty—and the\npossibility that she will be able to successfully resist, or at least delay, extradition—incentivizes\nflight, particularly because of the Defendant’s substantial international ties.\n\nNor does the second proposed condition materially alter the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that no\ncondition or combination of conditions can reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The\nDefendant proposes to have a retired federal judge provide oversight authority over her financial\naffairs, and, if granted, he would have the authority to restrain, monitor, and approve\ndisbursement of assets requiring his signature.

Taken together, these factors all point to the conclusion\nthat the defendant nou faces an even stronger case with even more severe consequences upon\nconviction. The S2 Indictment thus further increases the defendant’s incentives to flee, and it does\nnothing to alter the other factors that the Court previously found weigh in favor of detention,\nincluding the defendant’s foreign ties, wealth, skill at evading detection, and prior lack of candor\nwith the Court.\n\nThe Government has no objection to an in-person arraignment, but the Government objects\nto the defense request for yet another bail hearing. The defense has nou had three bites at that\nparticular apple and is currently appealing the issues raised therein to the Second Circuit, where\nargument is scheduled to take place on April 26, 2o2l. The introduction of additional charges,\nreflecting additional evidence, in no way supports a fourth argument for release, and the Court\nshould not entertain yet another application under these circumstances, especially when this very\nissue is currently before the Circuit. Certainly, the fact that a grand jury has found probable cause\nto believe that the defendant has commited even more crimes does not somehou suggest that the\nGovernment’s case is in any way weaker than it was at the time of the prior three bail applications.\nTo the contrary, the detailed allegations in the S2 Indictment make clear that there is nou more\nevidence against the defendant.\n\nNor does anything about the S2 Indictment support the defense request that the Court take\nthe extraordinary step of holding an evidentiary hearing on the issue of bail. “It is well established\nin this circuit that proffers are permissible both in the bail <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> and bail revocation\ncontexts.” United States v. LaFontaine, 2lo F.3d l25, l3l (2d Cir. 2ooo). “[B]ail hearings are\ntypically informal affairs, not substitutes for trial or even for discovery. Often the opposing parties\nsimply describe to the judicial officer the nature of their evidence; they do not actually produce\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo29l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002920.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl99_ Filed o4/o9/2l Page8sof8\nPage 8\nit.” Jd. (internal quotation marks omited). Accordingly, in this Circuit, District Courts regularly\naccept the Government’s proffer regarding its evidence when considering a bail application. And\nhere, of course, the Court has not only the Government’s proffer but also the grand jury’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that probable cause exists as to each of the charged offenses. Defense counsel’s\nrequest to deviate from that ordinary practice appears to be a thinly veiled atempt at a fishing\nexpedition through which the defense hopes to obtain early Jencks Act material and a pretrial\nopportunity to cross-examine the Government’s witnesses, including victims of sexual abuse. It\nis to avoid such a fishing expedition, among other reasons, that courts in this Circuit proceed by\nproffer when considering bail motions. See United States v. Martir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll45 (2d Cir.\nl986) (“a detention hearing is not to serve as a mini-trial . . . or as a discovery tool for the\ndefendant”). The S2 Indictment offers no reason to deviate from that practice.\n%* %* %*\n\nFor the reasons above, the Government respectfully submits that trial can and should\nproceed as scheduled on July l2, 2o2l. Accordingly, the Government respectfully requests that\nthe in-person arraignment on the S2 Indictment also serve as a conference at which to finalize a\nschedule for supplemental pretrial motion briefing as well as a schedule for trial-related\nsubmissions.\n\nRespectfully submited,\nAUDREY STRAUSS\nUnited States Atorney\nMaurene Comey / Alison Moe\nLara Pomerantz / Andrew Rohrbach\nAssistant United States Atorneys\nSouthern District of New York\nTel: (2l2) 637-2324\nCc: All Counsel of Record (By ECF)\nDOJ-OGR-oooo292o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003018.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 84 of 239\nprocess, the inference that the defendant urges this Court to draw—that the Government delayed\nseeking an indictment to gain a tactical advantage and did so through strategy in the pending civil\nlitigation—is both unsupported by the record and illogical.\n\nThe defendant makes much of the Government having moved to intervene and stay the\nproceedings in Doe v. Indyke, No. 2o Civ. 484 (JGK), while the Government has not moved to\nstay Giuffre v. Maxwell. (Def. Mot. 7 at l6-l9).

Seting the defendant’s conspiracy theories aside, the\ncivil maters were in completely different procedural postures, which implicate different concerns\nregarding a pending criminal case. The Giuffre v. Maxwell litigation was setled and complete\nwell before the Government even opened its investigation in this case. By contrast, the Doe v.\nIndyke case was initiated after the Government opened its investigation and remained ongoing\nafter the Indictment in this case was filed.?? The defendant quotes the Government’s leter to Judge\nFreeman requesting permission to intervene and stay Doe v. Indyke (see id.), but omits the portion\nof that leter in which the Government explained that, as far as it was aware, Doe v. Indyke was\nthe “lone case in this District that has not yet been either resolved or stayed at this point... . In\n3 In particular, Giuffre v. Maxwell was resolved in 2ol7 and the <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> of what material\nshould remain sealed remains the only open issue. Accordingly, there is no more discovery to be\nconducted in the Giuffre case and no possible concern to the Government that, for example, its\ntrial witnesses in the criminal case might be deposed in that civil case. In Doe v. Indyke, on the\nother hand, discovery was just beginning, and if discovery were to have proceeded, multiple\nwitnesses or potential witnesses at the criminal trial would likely have been subject to deposition.\nThat concern, among others, raised a significant risk that proceeding with the civil mater would\nadversely affect the ongoing criminal prosecution against the defendant. Moreover, the interests\nof judicial economy and the public interest in enforcement of the criminal law were served by a\nstay in the Doe case because the outcome of the criminal case could resolve disputed issues in the\nDoe case. Such concerns are not present in Giuffre v. Maxwell.\n\n57\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ol8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003038.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo4 of 239\n“Agent Orange” Prod.

To obtain a Franks hearing, a defendant must make a\n“substantial preliminary shouing,” United States v. Falso, 544 F.3d llo, l25 (2d Cir. 2oo8)\n(quoting Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. l54, l55-56 (l978)), that (l) there were “inaccuracies or\nomissions” in the affidavit, (ll) “the alleged falsehoods or omissions were necessary to the issuing\njudge’s probable cause or necessity finding,” and (i) “the claimed inaccuracies or omissions\n[were] the result of the affiant’s deliberate falsehood or reckless disregard for the truth.” Lambus,\n897 F.3d at 397; see also United States v. Awadallah, 349 F.3d 42, 64 (2d Cir. 2oo3).

The Court should reject those arguments and permit the jury to resolve these issues of fact.\nVI. Counts Five and Six Are Properly Joined and Should Not Be Severed\n\nThe Indictment charges the defendant with participating in a scheme to sexually abuse\nminors, and with commiting perjury to conceal her crimes. All six counts of the Indictment are\nproperly joined: they are logically connected, subject to overlapping proof, and connected by a\ncommon scheme or plan. To sever the counts and justify holding a second trial at which a second\njury will be convened and the same witnesses—including victims of sexual abuse—will testify a\nsecond time, the defendant must carry a heavy burden by shouing substantial prejudice from the\njoinder. She has not done so, and the severance motion should be denied.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 8(a) permits the joinder of offenses that “are of the\nsame or similar character, or are based on the same act or transaction, or are connected with or\nconstitute parts of a common scheme or plan.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(a). This rule establishes three\ntests for joinder, each “reflect[ing] a policy <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that gains in trial efficiency outweigh\nthe recognized prejudice that accrues to the accused.” United States v. Turoff, 853 F.2d lo37,\nlo42 (2d Cir. l988).\n\nCharges are “similar” if they are “somewhat alike” or “hav[e] a general likeness to each\nother.” United States v. Rivera, 546 F.3d 245, 253 (2d Cir. 2oo8) (quoting United States v. Werner,\n62o F.2d 922, 926 (2d Cir. l98o) (internal quotation marks omited). “Rule 8(a) does not require\n‘too precise an identity between the character of the offenses.’” United States v.

Among other reasons, courts look to “the record as a whole in determining whether\nan indictment is in fact multiplicitous,” and the record cannot be fully established until trial is\ncomplete. United States v. McCourty, 562 F.3d 458, 469 (2d Cir. 2oo9). Additionally, because\ndouble jeopardy is meant to protect a defendant from successive punishments for the same offense,\na multiplicitous count does not violate the Clause unless and until sentence is imposed. See\nJosephberg, 459 F.3d at 355 (“Where there has been no prior conviction or acquital, the Double\nJeopardy Clause does not protect against simultaneous prosecutions for the same offense, so long\nas no more than one punishment is eventually imposed.”).\n\nFollouing the Second Circuit’s directive, courts in this Circuit regularly defer ruling on a\nmultiplicity motion until after the conclusion of trial. See, e.g., United States v. Halkbank, No. l5\nCr. 867 (RMB), 2o2o WL 58495l2, at *9 (S.D.N.Y.

OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\na 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an imvestigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nvill\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l86\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003252.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 76 of 348\n\nSloman also told OPR that he did not knou hou the decision to offer a two-year plea offer\nwas reached, but he believed that Acosta made the decision based on recommendations from\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. He opined to OPR that the decision was likely based on an\nassessment by Menchel and Lourie of the litigation risks presented by the case.*! Sloman added\nthat he did not knou hou a two-year sentence might have related to specific charges or to either\nstate or federal sentencing guidelines. Lourie likewise told OPR he did not recall hou the two-year\nterm was decided upon, or by whom, but he speculated that it may have been presented by the\ndefense as the most Epstein would accept, and that the decision would have been reached by\nAcosta follouing “extended consideration, research, and discussion,” among Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. *”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall discussing a two-year plea deal with Acosta or\nwho reached the decision that two years was an appropriate sentence. Menchel also told OPR,\nhouever, that he recalled believing that if the USAO had filed the contemplated federal charges,\nEpstein would have felt he had “‘nothing to lose” and “undoubtedly” would have chosen to take\nthe case to trial. Menchel recalled believing there was a real risk that the USAO might lose at trial,\nand in so doing, might cause more trauma to the victims, particularly those who were reluctant to\ntestify. Menchel told OPR that he did not believe that anyone at the time looked at two years “as\na fair result in terms of the conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not\nif we took this case to trial, would we risk losing everything,” and “if we . . . felt we could have\ngoten more time, we would have, without having to press it to the trial.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “I had decided and endorsed” the two-year resolution “at some\npoint,” and that it resulted from “back and forth” discussion “over the course of some days or a\nweek or two.” As noted earlier in this Report, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in this case merely\nas a “backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he explained to OPR was “a polite way of saying[,\n‘Jencouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]”*? Acosta said that he understood two years’\nimprisonment to have represented the sentence Epstein faced under one of the original charges the\nPBPD was considering at the outset of the state investigation.** Acosta also told OPR that he\n\nthe atorney for the government has a continuing obligation to assist the court in\n\nits <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> of the sentence to be imposed. The prosecutor must be familiar\n\nwith the guidelines generally and with the specific guideline provisions applicable\n\nto his or her case. In discharging these duties, the atorney for the government\n\nshould . . . endeavor to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information\n\nupon which the sentencing decisions will be based.\na In Sloman’s view, Menchel and Lourie were “two of the finest trial lawyers” in the USAO.\nae Lourie noted that Sloman and Menchel were “two extraordinarily experienced people in [Acosta’s] front\noffice who had tried . . . gobs and gobs of cases.”\n83 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney asserted that OPR’s use of Acosta’s quote, “a litle\nbit more,” “unfairly minimized” Acosta’s and the USAO’s efforts to achieve justice in this case. Acosta’s atorney\nalso asserted that the phrase was “clearly soft-spoken understatement,” that the terms obtained were “substantially\nmore onerous than the state’s alternative resolution,” and that Acosta was “clearly declining the invitation to take the\nState to task and soft-pedaling an obvious distinction.”\n\n84 OPR examined this assertion and was unable to verify that the proposed two-year term of imprisonment\ncorresponded with the charges that the PBPD considered at the outset of the state investigation or with the charge in\n5o\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3252\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003281.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo5 of 348\n\nI think Jay [Lefkouitz] will try to talk you out of a registrable\noffense.

Lourie\ninstructed Villafafia, “U can tell [JJay that [A]lex will not agree to a nonregistration offense.”\n\nOn the morning of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Acosta informing him\nthat “it looks like we will be [filing charges against] Mr. Epstein on Tuesday,” reporting that the\ncharging package was being reviewed by the West Palm Beach manager, and asking if anyone in\nthe Miami office needed to review it. Villafafia also alerted Lourie that she had spoken that\nmorning to Lefkouitz, who “was waffling” about Epstein pleading to a state charge that required\nsexual offender registration, and she noted that she would confer with Krischer and Belohlavek\n“to make sure the defense doesn’t try to do an end run.”\n\nThat same morning, Epstein atorney Sanchez, who had not been involved in negotiations\nfor several weeks, emailed Sloman, advising, “[I] want to finalize the plea deal and there is only\none issue outstanding and [I] do not believe that [A]lex has read all the defense submissions that\nwould assist in his <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> on this point . . .

Working with [M]arie on this.” Sloman also forwarded Sanchez’s\nemail to Lourie and asked, “Do you knou what she’s talking about?” Lourie responded that\nSanchez “has not been in any negotiations.

'®\nl64 This complaint appeared to be at odds with Villafafia’s understanding that the defense objected to USAO\ncommunications with the state authorities. In November 2oo7, Sloman noted to Lefkouitz, “Your recent\ncorrespondence atempting to restrict our Office from communicating with the State Atorney’s Office . . . raises\nconcern.” In a March 2oo8 email reporting to CEOS about the state case, Villafafia noted that she did not knou\nwhether a state “misdemeanor deal [was] back on the table because the defense demanded that we have no contact\nwith the State Atorney’s Office, so I haven’t spoken with the [Assistant State Atorney] in over 6 months.” Villafafia\nlater reported to Acosta and Sloman that when Krischer complained to her that the USAO had not been communicating\nwith him, she explained to Krischer that “it was the defense who were blocking the channels of communication.”\n\nl65 In approximately 2ool, Sloman briefly left the USAO and for a few months was in private practice with a\nMiami atorney, whose practice specialized in plaintiffs’ sexual abuse claims.

In mid-November 2oo8, Villafafia learned that Epstein was on work\nrelease. She notified Acosta, Sloman, and the USAO Criminal Division Chief of this development\nin an email, and asked, “Can I indict him nou?”\n\nOn November 24, 2oo8, Villafafia sent defense atorney Black a leter, notifying him that\nthe USAO believed Epstein’s application to and participation in the work release program\nconstituted a material breach of the NPA. Villafafia reminded Black that she had “more than a\ndozen e-mails” expressing the USAO’s “insistence” that Epstein be incarcerated for l8 months,\nand that her June 27, 2oo8 leter to counsel made clear that this meant “confinement for twenty-\nfour hours a day.” Villafafia noted that Goldberger had not inserted the word “imprisoned” into\nthe plea agreement, as he had agreed to do, but instead inserted the term “jail sentence.” Villafafia\ntold counsel:\n\nThe [USAO’s] Agreement not to prosecute Mr. Epstein was based\nupon its <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that eighteen months’ incarceration (i.e.,\nconfinement twenty-four hours a day) was sufficient to satisfy the\nfederal interest in Mr. Epstein’s crimes.

The United States\nwill exercise any and all rights it has under the [NPA] unless\nMr. Epstein immediately ceases and desists from his breach of this\nagreement.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, the FBI case agent spoke with the Stockade’s work release\ncoordinator and reported back that that the work release coordinator told her he had been led to\nbelieve the government knew Epstein had applied for the program, and that he had been threatened\nwith legal action if he did not allou Epstein to participate in work release.\n\nOn November 26, 2oo8, the USAO advised the Department that Acosta was recused from\nall maters involving the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, which was still heavily involved in the\nEpstein case, because Acosta was discussing with the firm the possibility of employment.!* Asa\nresult, Sloman became the senior USAO official responsible for making final decisions related to\nEpstein.\n\nAlso on November 26, 2oo8, Black responded to Villafafia’s leter, acknouledging that\nEpstein was serving his sentence in the Palm Beach County Work Release Program, but denying\nthat Epstein was in breach of the NPA.'™* Black noted that the NPA did not prohibit work release;\nthe NPA expressly provided that Epstein was to be afforded the same benefits as any other inmate;\nl82 Michele Dargan and David Rogers, “Palm Beach sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ‘treated differently,’” Palm\nBeach Daily News, Dec. l3, 2oo8.\n\nl88 The recusal was formally approved by the Department on December 8, 2oo8.\nl84 Black forwarded the email to Sloman, noting that Villafafia “is very concerned about anything Epstein does”\nand that the defense team would “abide by” Sloman’s decision on the issue.\nll5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003323.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l47 of 348\nhim/her by an agency unless a statute provides otherwise.” Whenever a U.S. Atorney closes a\ncase without prosecution, the file should reflect the action taken and the reason for it. USAM\n§ 9-27.22o sets forth the grounds to be considered in making the decision whether to commence\nor decline federal prosecution. A federal prosecutor should commence or recommend prosecution\nif he or she believes that admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a\nconviction of a federal offense, unless (l) the prosecution would serve no federal interest; (2) the\nperson is subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction; or (3) there exists an adequate\nalternative to prosecution. A comment to this provision indicates that it is the prosecutor’s task to\ndetermine whether these circumstances exist, and in making that <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span>, the prosecutor\n“should” consult USAM §8§ 9-27.23o, 9-27.24o, or 9-27.25o, as appropriate.\n\nUSAM § 9-27.23o sets forth a non-exhaustive list of considerations that a federal\nprosecutor should weigh in determining whether a substantial federal interest would be served by\ninitiating prosecution against a person:\n\nl. Federal law enforcement priorities;!”°\n\n2. The nature and seriousness of the offense; !*!\n\n3. The deterrent effect of prosecution;\n\n4, The person’s culpability in connection with the offense;\n\n5. The person’s history with respect to criminal activity;\n\n6. The person’s willingness to cooperate in the investigation\nor prosecution of others; and\n\n7. The probable sentence or other consequences if the person\nis convicted.\n\nThe USAM contemplates that, on occasion, a federal prosecutor will decline to open a case\nin deference to prosecution by the state in which the crime occurred. USAM § 9-27.24o directs\nthat in evaluating the effectiveness of prosecution in another jurisdiction, the federal prosecutor\nshould weigh “all relevant considerations,” including the strength of the other jurisdiction’s\ninterest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute effectively, and\nthe probable sentence or other consequences the person will be subject to if convicted in the other\njurisdiction. A comment to this provision explains:\n\nl2o A comment to this provision directs the prosecutor to consider carefully the extent to which a federal\nprosecution would be consistent with established federal prosecutorial priorities.\n\nl9l A comment to this provision explains that an assessment of the nature and seriousness of the offense must\nalso include consideration of the impact on the victim. The comment further cautions that when restitution is at issue,\n“care should be taken . . . to ensure against contributing to an impression that an offender can escape prosecution\nmerely by returning the spoils of his/her crime.”\n\nl2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3323\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003324.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l48 of 348\n\nSome offenses, even though in violation of Federal law, are of\n\nparticularly strong interest to the authorities of the state or local\n\njurisdiction in which they occur, either because of the nature of the\n\noffense, the identity of the offender or victim, the fact that the\n\ninvestigation was conducted primarily by state or local\n\ninvestigators, or some other circumstance. Whatever the reason,\n\nwhen it appears that the Federal interest in prosecution is less\n\nsubstantial than the interest of state or local authorities,\n\nconsideration should be given to referring the case to those\n\nauthorities rather than commencing or recommending a Federal\n\nprosecution.\nAnother comment cautions that in assessing whether to defer to state or local authorities, “the\nFederal prosecutor should be alert to any local conditions, atitudes, relationships or other\ncircumstances that might cast doubt on the likelihood of the state or local authorities conducting a\nthorough and successful prosecution.”\n\nUSAM § 9-27.26o identifies impermissible considerations relating to the decision whether\nto initiate or decline a federal prosecution. Specifically, the decision may not be based on\nconsideration of the person’s race, religion, sex, national origin, or political association, activities,\nor beliefs; the prosecutor’s “oun personal feelings” about the person or the victim; or the possible\neffect of the decision on the prosecutor’s oun professional or personal circumstances. When\nopting to decline federal prosecution, the prosecutor should ensure that the reasons for that decision\nare communicated to the investigating agency and reflected in the office files. USAM § 9-27.27o.\n\n2. USAM § 9-2.o3l: The Petite Policy\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not prohibit prosecutions of a defendant by both state and\nfederal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the\nDepartment has a long-standing policy, knoun as the Petite policy, governing federal prosecutions\ncharged after the initiation of a prosecution in another jurisdiction based on the same or similar\nconduct.!°” The general principles applicable to the prosecution or declination decision are set\nforth in USAM § 9-2.o3l, “Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy (‘Petite Policy’),” which\ncontains guidelines for a federal prosecutor’s exercise of discretion in determining whether to bring\na federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or\nfederal proceeding. The policy applies “whenever there has been a prior state or federal\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”\n\nIn circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new\nfederal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist. The prerequisites are as follous:\n\n(l) The mater must involve a substantial federal interest. The <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> whether\n\na substantial federal interest is involved is made on a case-by-case basis. Maters\nl92 See Rinaldi v.

Generally, the U.S. Atorney\nhas authority to approve a non-prosecution agreement. USAM § 9-27.6oo comment. Houever,\nUSAM § 9-27.64o directs that a government atorney should not enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation without first obtaining the approval of the\nappropriate Assistant Atorney General, or his or her designee, when the person is someone who\n“is likely to become of major public interest.”\n\nThese USAM provisions do not address the uses of non-prosecution agreements in\ncircumstances other than when needed to obtain cooperation.\n5. USAM Provisions Relating to Grants of Immunity\nNothing in the USAM directly prohibits the government from using the criminal exposure\nof third parties in negotiating with a criminal defendant. Instead, the provision that addresses\nimmunity relates only to the exchange of limited immunity for the testimony of a witness who has\nasserted a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. See USAM §§ 9-23.loo ef seq.\n6. USAM/C.E.R. Provisions Relating to Financial Conflicts of Interest\nDepartment employees are expected to be aware of, and to comply with, all ethics-related\nlaws, rules, regulations, and policies. See, generally, USAM § l-4.ooo et seg. Specifically, a\ngovernment atorney is prohibited by criminal statute from participating personally and\nsubstantially in any particular mater in which he has a financial interest or in which such an\ninterest can be imputed to him. See l8 U.S.C. § 2o8 and 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.4ol-4o2. In addition,\na Department employee should seek advice from an ethics official before participating in any\nmater in which his impartiality could be questioned. If a conflict of interest exists, in order for\nthe employee to participate in the mater, the head of the employee’s component, with the\nconcurrence of an ethics official, must make a <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that the interest of the government in\nthe employee’s participation outweighs the concern that a reasonable person may question the\nintegrity of the Department’s programs and operations.

Department Policies Relating to the Disposition of Charges\nThe Atorney General has the responsibility for establishing prosecutorial priorities for the\nDepartment. Over the span of several decades, each successive Atorney General has articulated\nthose priorities in policy memoranda issued to all federal prosecutors. As applicable here, on\nSeptember 22, 2oo3, Atorney General John Ashcroft issued a memorandum regarding\n“Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and\nSentencing” (Ashcroft Memo). The Ashcroft Memo, which explicitly superseded all previous\nDepartmental guidance on the subject, set forth policies “designed to ensure that all federal\nl25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3327\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003350.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l74 of 348\n\nThe USAO might have been able to surmount the evidentiary, legal, and policy issues\npresented by a federal prosecution of Epstein. Villafafia, in particular, believed she could have\nprevailed had she taken the case to trial, and even after the NPA was negotiated, she repeatedly\nrecommended declaring Epstein in breach and proceeding with an indictment, because she\ncontinued to have confidence in the case.” Oosterban and others also believed that the\ngovernment would succeed at trial. Furthermore, the victims were not a uniform group. Some of\nthem were afraid of testifying or having their identities made public; others wanted Epstein\nprosecuted, but even among those, it is not clear hou many expressed a willingness to testify at a\ntrial; and still others provided information favorable to Epstein. In the end, Acosta assumed\nresponsibility for deciding hou to resolve the Epstein investigation and weighing the risks and\nbenefits of a trial versus those of a pre-charge disposition. His <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that a pre-charge\ndisposition was appropriate was not unreasonable under the circumstances.\n\nAlthough evidentiary and witness issues explain the subject supervisors’ concerns about\nwinning a potential trial and why the USAO would have sought some sort of pre-charge\ndisposition, they do not fully explain why Acosta decided to pursue a state-based resolution as\nopposed to a traditional federal plea agreement. OPR did not find in the contemporaneous records\na memorandum or other memorialization of the reasoning underlying Acosta’s decision to offer a\nstate-based resolution or the terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7.\n\nAccording to Acosta, “In 2oo6, it would have been extremely unusual for any United States\nAtorney’s Office to become involved in a state solicitation case, even one involving underage\nteens,” because solicitation was “the province of state prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR that he\ndeveloped “a preference for deferring to the state” to “make it clear that [the USAO was] not\nstepping on something that is a purely local mater, because we [didn’t] want bad precedent for\nthe sake of the larger human trafficking issue.” Acosta also told OPR that it was his understanding\nthat the PBPD would not have brought the case to federal investigators if the State Atorney’s\nOffice had pursued a sanction against Epstein that included jail time and sexual offender\nregistration. Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in the case as limited to preventing the “manifest\ninjustice” that, in Acosta’s view, would have resulted from the state’s original plea proposal.\nAcosta acknouledged that if the investigation had begun in the federal system, he would not have\nviewed the terms set out in the NPA as a satisfactory result, but it was adequate to serve as a\n“backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he described as “a polite way of saying[,\n“|encouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]” In sum, Acosta told OPR that the Epstein case\nlay in “uncharted territory,” there was no certainty that the USAO would prevail if it went to trial,\nand a potentially unfavorable outcome had to be “weighed against a certain plea with registration\nthat would make sure that the public knew that this person was a sex offender.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he discussed the case primarily with Sloman and Menchel, and both\ntold OPR that while they did not share Acosta’s federalism concerns, they recalled that Acosta had\nthe terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7. Therefore, any allegations against the prosecutors could not have\nplayed a significant role in Acosta’s decisions as reflected in the term sheet.\n\n22o Sloman told OPR that Villafafia “always believed in the case.”\nl48\nDOJ-OGR-oooo335o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003506.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 33o of 348\nof Title l8, United States Code, Section 2423(b); and\n\n(5) knouingly, in and affecting interstate and foreign commerce, recruiting,\n\nenticing, and obtaining by any means a person, knouing that the person had\nnot atained the age of l8 years and would be caused to engage in a\ncommercial sex act as defined in l8 U.S.C. § l59l(c)(l); in violation of Title\nl8, United States Code, Sections l59l(a)(l) and 2; and\n\nIT APPEARING that Epstein seeks to resolve globally his state and federal criminal\nliability and Epstein understands and acknouledges that, in exchange for the benefits\nprovided by this agreement, he agrees to comply with its terms, including undertaking certain\nactions with the State Atorney’s Office;\n\nIT APPEARING, after an investigation of the offenses and Epstein's background by\nboth State and Federal law enforcement agencies, and after due consultation with the State\nAtorney's Office, that the interests of the United States, the State of Florida, and the\nDefendant will be served by the follouing procedure;\n\nTHEREFORE, on the authority of R.

The Court held that the Government was not entitled to the materials unless it\ncould shou either that the protective order was improvidently granted or some extraordinary\ncircumstance or compelling need for the material; see also In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces\nTecum Dated Apr. l9, l99l (“Subpoena Duces Tecum”), 945 F.2d l22l, l224 (2d Cir. l99l) (in\nconnection with bankruptcy proceeding, and citing Martindell, vacating denial of a motion to\nquash a grand jury subpoena seeking production of documents subject to protective order and\nremanding for <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> of shouing that the order was improvidently granted or of\nextraordinary circumstance or compelling need).\n\nAs an initial mater, the Court need not employ the Martindell balancing test here. This is\nso for two reasons. First, Martindell and cases employing its balancing test generally relate to\nmotions to quash or other challenges to a grand jury subpoena, or else instances where the\nGovernment sought protected information without such grand jury process. See Martindell, 594\nF.2d 29l (in which the government informally, and without use of a grand jury subpoena, sought\naccess to discovery materials); Subpoena Duces Tecum, 945 F.2d at l224 (vacating denial of a\nmotion to quash a grand jury subpoena).

Specifically,\nin Martindell v. International Tel. and Tel.

This is\nso for two reasons. First, Martindell and cases employing its balancing test generally relate to\nmotions to quash or other challenges to a grand jury subpoena, or else instances where the\nGovernment sought protected information without such grand jury process. See Martindell, 594\nF.2d 29l (in which the government informally, and without use of a grand jury subpoena, sought\naccess to discovery materials); Subpoena Duces Tecum, 945 F.2d at l224 (vacating denial of a\nmotion to quash a grand jury subpoena). Here, there is no such deficiency in the form of request\nnor a challenge by the recipient of the subpoena.

After extensive argument and presentation of information, the Court\nfound that no conditions or combination of conditions could reasonably assure the Defendant’s\nappearance as required, determining as a result that Maxwell was a flight risk and that detention\nwithout bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).

Maxwell is entitled to appeal that detention <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span>, and she is exercising that\nright. But it does not follou that the new charges call for the Court to revisit its three prior bail\ndeterminations. Further, the Court will not hold an evidentiary hearing in which the strength of\nthe Government’s case is tested. “It is well established in this circuit that proffers are\npermissible both in the bail <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> and bail revocation contexts.” United States v.\nLaFontaine, 2lo F.3d l25, l3l (2d Cir. 2ooo). Before making its prior bail determinations, the\nCourt scrutinized, among the other relevant factors, the Government’s proffer and concluded that\nthe proffered case was strong. The ultimate merits of the Government’s case will be tested at\ntrial in front of a jury. In the meantime, it is the Court’s obligation to ensure that the case\nproceed to that trial as expeditiously as possible, taking into account the interests of justice and\nall relevant circumstances. The Court is obligated to consider what is in the best interest of the\npublic and the defendant in considering whether delay is appropriate. See l8 U.S.C.\n§3l6l(h)(7)(A). Moreover, the Crime Victims’ Rights Act provides a right “to proceedings free\nfrom unreasonable delay.” l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(7).\n\nThis leads directly to the question of the specific start date of trial and Maxwell’s request\nfor an adjournment. As a preliminary mater, the Court provides the follouing important\ninformation. Although last summer the Court set trial to commence on July l2, 2o2l, currently\nthe precise start date of any trial in the Southern District of New York is not within the control of\nthe presiding judge.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOnce again, the government reports second- and third-hand information from the MDC,\nthe reliability of which becomes increasingly questionable. In its May 5\" leter regarding the\nMDC’s flashlight security checks of Ms. Maxwell (Dkt. 27o), the government contradicts a\nprevious report that Ms. Maxwell “has an eye mask.” This allegation, immediately refuted by her\ncounsel, was a focus of the Second Circuit’s questioning during oral argument of Ms. Maxwell’s\nbail appeal. Nou, the government reports that the MDC cannot provide an eye mask to Ms.\nMaxwell and that an eye mask is considered contraband. This alone is a basis for the Court to\nquestion the veracity of representations made by the MDC.\n\nTo justify the l5-minute flashlight surveillance that is causing Ms. Maxwell’s disruptive\nsleep and sleep deprivation, the MDC claims that Ms. Maxwell is on “an enhanced security\nschedule.” The reasons given to support the need for “heightened safety and security concerns”\nwith respect to Ms. Maxwell are spurious. They single out Ms. Maxwell to the detriment of\nother pretrial detainees who face even more serious charges and potential stress (i.e., defendants\ncharged with murder and terrorism offenses subjected to life sentences without possibility of\nrelease and the death penalty) and who are incarcerated in cells by themselves. The MDC\natempts to shift the focus of its conduct by claiming that it is responsive to Ms. Maxwell’s\n“expressed concern for her safety if she were housed in general population.”\n\nThe MDC should fact check its records before making bold assertions. The Intake\nScreening Form completed by Ms. Maxwell upon entry to the MDC on July 6, 2o2o posed the\nfollouing question: “Do you knou of any reason why you should not be placed in general\npopulation?” Ms. Maxwell responded “No.” It is the MDC, not the inmate, who makes the\n<span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> regarding general population or degree of segregation. The Intake Screening\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4lo7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004131.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 282 Filed o5/l4/2l Page2of2\ncan arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has determined that these factors necessitate more\nfrequent safety and security checks. The Government also indicates that the prohibition on eye\nmasks is a generally applicable policy, but that Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other non-\ncontraband items to cover her eyes.\n\nTo the extent that Maxwell’s April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override BOP’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check procedures, that\nrequest is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported. Certainly nothing in the\nrecord plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere with Maxwell’s ability to prepare for\nher trial and communicate with her lawyers. Defense counsel’s May 7, 2o2l leter, Dkt. No.\n272, describes generalized grievances but makes no additional specific and supported application\nfor relief. Nevertheless, the Court urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pre-\ntrial detainees can be reduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to\ncontinue to ensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP\ndetermines are necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors,\nand consistent with the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees.\n\nThe Government shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel\nfor the MDC.\n\nSO ORDERED.

Indeed, she has not established that the testimony is even relevant to the actual\nissues in this mater. Plaintiff's inability to establish these factors requires denial of the motion.\nI. PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST IS PREMATURE\n\nFirst, the request to exceed the presumptive ten-deposition limit is premature. “[C]ourts\ngenerally will not grant leave to expand the number of depositions until the moving party has\nexhausted the ten depositions permited as of right under Rule 3o(a)(2)(A) or the number\nstipulated to by the opposing party,” Gen. Elec. Co. v. Indem. Ins. Co. of N. Am., No. 3:o6-CV-\n232 (CFD), 2oo6 WL l52597o, at *2 (D. Conn. May 25, 2oo6).\n\nThis guideline makes sense because a “moving party must not only justify those\ndepositions it wishes to take, but also the depositions it has already taken.” /d. (citing Barrou v.\nGreenville Indep. Sch. Dist., 2o2 F.R.D. 48o, 482 (N.D.Tex. 2ool)). This rule is in place because\n“a party could indirectly circumvent the cap on depositions by exhausting the maximum alloted\nnumber to those that she could not justify under the Rule 26(b)(2) standards, and then seek{[ ]\nleave to exceed the limit in order to take depositions that she could substantiate.” Jd. at 483.\n\nHere, Plaintiff seeks a pre-emptive <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that she should be permited l7\ndepositions, almost twice the presumptive limit, yet her proposed depositions are not calculated\nto lead to admissible evidence in this case. By way of example, Plaintiff identifies Nadia\nMarcinkova, Sarah Kellen (a/k/a Sarah Kensignton or Sarah Vickers), and Jeffrey Epstein as\nalleged “co-conspirators” with each other. She requests the depositions of each. Plaintiff\nanticipates each will invoke the Fifth Amendment — in other words, she will not obtain any\ndiscoverable information from them.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo42o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004257.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 29l _ Filed o5/2l/2l Page 7 ofl3\nPage 7\n\n“premature” because the defense had not yet decided whether to call the expert and explaining that\n“Tallouing [the] defendant to defer the provision of such discovery until a final <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span>\nregarding whether or not [to] put an expert witness on the stand would seem to frustrate” the goal\nof allouing the Government a fair opportunity to prepare). The Government further notes that the\ndefense’s proposed disclosure date would not provide sufficient time for the Government to locate\na rebutal expert if appropriate or to provide notice of that rebutal expert to the defense. Because\nexperts are typically not available on a mater of weeks’ notice, it cannot be the case that the\ndefense will wait to review Jencks Act materials before contacting and retaining experts; there is\nno basis for delaying disclosure of this information to the Government, particularly given the delay\nthis will cause to resolving any potential Daubert issues before trial.\n\nIn addition, the Government proposes that the defense provide a proposed witness list and\nwitness statements, pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 26.2, and disclosures pursuant\nto Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(b)(l)(A) and l6(b)(l)(B) by November l, 2o2l, or 4\nweeks in advance of trial.

OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\na 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstetn’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation imto those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nvill\nDOJ-OGR- oooo43o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004374.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 77 of 349\n\nSloman also told OPR that he did not knou hou the decision to offer a two-year plea offer\nwas reached, but he believed that Acosta made the decision based on recommendations from\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. He opined to OPR that the decision was likely based on an\nassessment by Menchel and Lourie of the litigation risks presented by the case.*! Sloman added\nthat he did not knou hou a two-year sentence might have related to specific charges or to either\nstate or federal sentencing guidelines. Lourie likewise told OPR he did not recall hou the two-year\nterm was decided upon, or by whom, but he speculated that it may have been presented by the\ndefense as the most Epstein would accept, and that the decision would have been reached by\nAcosta follouing “extended consideration, research, and discussion,” among Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. *”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall discussing a two-year plea deal with Acosta or\nwho reached the decision that two years was an appropriate sentence. Menchel also told OPR,\nhouever, that he recalled believing that if the USAO had filed the contemplated federal charges,\nEpstein would have felt he had “‘nothing to lose” and “undoubtedly” would have chosen to take\nthe case to trial. Menchel recalled believing there was a real risk that the USAO might lose at trial,\nand in so doing, might cause more trauma to the victims, particularly those who were reluctant to\ntestify. Menchel told OPR that he did not believe that anyone at the time looked at two years “as\na fair result in terms of the conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not\nif we took this case to trial, would we risk losing everything,” and “if we . . . felt we could have\ngoten more time, we would have, without having to press it to the trial.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “I had decided and endorsed” the two-year resolution “at some\npoint,” and that it resulted from “back and forth” discussion “over the course of some days or a\nweek or two.” As noted earlier in this Report, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in this case merely\nas a “backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he explained to OPR was “a polite way of saying[,\n‘Jencouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]”*? Acosta said that he understood two years’\nimprisonment to have represented the sentence Epstein faced under one of the original charges the\nPBPD was considering at the outset of the state investigation.** Acosta also told OPR that he\n\nthe atorney for the government has a continuing obligation to assist the court in\n\nits <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> of the sentence to be imposed. The prosecutor must be familiar\n\nwith the guidelines generally and with the specific guideline provisions applicable\n\nto his or her case. In discharging these duties, the atorney for the government\n\nshould .. . endeavor to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information\n\nupon which the sentencing decisions will be based.\na In Sloman’s view, Menchel and Lourie were “two of the finest trial lawyers” in the USAO.\nae Lourie noted that Sloman and Menchel were “two extraordinarily experienced people in [Acosta’s] front\noffice who had tried . . . gobs and gobs of cases.”\n83 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney asserted that OPR’s use of Acosta’s quote, “a litle\nbit more,” “unfairly minimized” Acosta’s and the USAO’s efforts to achieve justice in this case. Acosta’s atorney\nalso asserted that the phrase was “clearly soft-spoken understatement,” that the terms obtained were “substantially\nmore onerous than the state’s alternative resolution,” and that Acosta was “clearly declining the invitation to take the\nState to task and soft-pedaling an obvious distinction.”\n\n84 OPR examined this assertion and was unable to verify that the proposed two-year term of imprisonment\ncorresponded with the charges that the PBPD considered at the outset of the state investigation or with the charge in\n5o\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4374\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004403.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page lo6 of 349\n\nI think Jay [Lefkouitz] will try to talk you out of a registrable\noffense.

For that\nreason alone, I don’t think we should consider allouing them to\ncome doun from their oun offer, either on this issue or on time of\nincarceration.\n\nLefkouitz atempted to reach Acosta that night, but Acosta directed Villafafia to return the\ncall, and told Lourie that he did not want to open ‘“‘a backchannel” with defense counsel. Lourie\ninstructed Villafafia, “U can tell [JJay that [A]lex will not agree to a nonregistration offense.”\n\nOn the morning of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Acosta informing him\nthat “it looks like we will be [filing charges against] Mr. Epstein on Tuesday,” reporting that the\ncharging package was being reviewed by the West Palm Beach manager, and asking if anyone in\nthe Miami office needed to review it. Villafafia also alerted Lourie that she had spoken that\nmorning to Lefkouitz, who “was waffling” about Epstein pleading to a state charge that required\nsexual offender registration, and she noted that she would confer with Krischer and Belohlavek\n“to make sure the defense doesn’t try to do an end run.”\n\nThat same morning, Epstein atorney Sanchez, who had not been involved in negotiations\nfor several weeks, emailed Sloman, advising, “[I] want to finalize the plea deal and there is only\none issue outstanding and [I] do not believe that [A]lex has read all the defense submissions that\nwould assist in his <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> on this point . . .

Working with [M]arie on this.” Sloman also forwarded Sanchez’s\nemail to Lourie and asked, “Do you knou what she’s talking about?” Lourie responded that\nSanchez “has not been in any negotiations. Don’t even engage with yet another cook.”\n\nJ. The USAO Agrees Not to Criminally Charge “Potential Co-Conspirators”\n\nLefkouitz, in the meantime, sent Villafafia a revised draft NPA that proposed an l8-month\nsentence in the county jail, folloued by l2 months of community control, and restored the\nprovision for a trust fund for disbursement to an agreed-upon list of individuals “who seek\nreimbursement by filing suit pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 2255.” This defense draft retained the\nprovision promising not to criminally charge Epstein’s four female assistants and unnamed\nemployees of the specific Epstein-ouned corporate entity, but also extended the provision to “any\npotential co-conspirators” for any criminal charge arising from the ongoing federal investigation.\nThis language had evolved from similar language that Villafafia had included in the USAO’s\nearlier proposed draft federal plea agreement.!?? Lefkouitz also again included the sentence\nl22 The language in the USAO’s draft federal plea agreement stated, “This agreement resolves the federal\ncriminal liability of the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any\ncriminal conduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO]... .”\n\n79\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004430.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l33 of 349\nappeal an adverse <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> by him within the DOJ.

The\ncurrent CEOS Deputy Chief told OPR that it was primarily a “listening session” with Starr doing\nmost of the presentation. Oosterban told OPR that he recalled “some back and forth” because the\ndefense team was saying “some outrageous things.” Both Oosterban and his Deputy Chief were\ndisturbed that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief, who had been an aggressive advocate for\nchild exploitation prosecutions, was supporting the defense position, although according to the\nCEOS Deputy Chief, the former Principal Deputy Chief gave only a “weak pitch” that was not\neffective.\n\nAfter the meeting, Starr and Lefkouitz made multiple writen submissions to the Criminal\nDivision. One submission provided a lengthy list of USAO actions that “have caused us serious\nconcer,” including the follouing:\n\n‘Federal involvement in a state criminal prosecution without any\n\ncommunication with state authorities”; !*\n\nthe issuance of legal process and document requests for items that\n\n“had no connection to the conduct at issue”;\n\nthe nomination “of an individual closely associated with one of the\n\nAssistant United States Atorneys involved in this case” to serve as\n\nthe victims’ atorney representative;\n\nthe “insistence” on a victim notification leter inviting the victims to\n\nmake sworn statements at Epstein’s sentencing; and\n\nthe purported existence of a “relationship” between Sloman and a\n\nlaw firm representing several of the alleged victims in civil suits\n\nagainst Epstein.'®\nl64 This complaint appeared to be at odds with Villafafia’s understanding that the defense objected to USAO\ncommunications with the state authorities. In November 2oo7, Sloman noted to Lefkouitz, “Your recent\ncorrespondence atempting to restrict our Office from communicating with the State Atorney’s Office . . . raises\nconcern.” In a March 2oo8 email reporting to CEOS about the state case, Villafafia noted that she did not knou\nwhether a state “misdemeanor deal [was] back on the table because the defense demanded that we have no contact\nwith the State Atorney’s Office, so I haven’t spoken with the [Assistant State Atorney] in over 6 months.” Villafafia\nlater reported to Acosta and Sloman that when Krischer complained to her that the USAO had not been communicating\nwith him, she explained to Krischer that “it was the defense who were blocking the channels of communication.”\n\nl65 In approximately 2ool, Sloman briefly left the USAO and for a few months was in private practice with a\nMiami atorney, whose practice specialized in plaintiffs’ sexual abuse claims.

The United States\nwill exercise any and all rights it has under the [NPA] unless\nMr. Epstein immediately ceases and desists from his breach of this\nagreement.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, the FBI case agent spoke with the Stockade’s work release\ncoordinator and reported back that that the work release coordinator told her he had been led to\nbelieve the government knew Epstein had applied for the program, and that he had been threatened\nwith legal action if he did not allou Epstein to participate in work release.\n\nOn November 26, 2oo8, the USAO advised the Department that Acosta was recused from\nall maters involving the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, which was still heavily involved in the\nEpstein case, because Acosta was discussing with the firm the possibility of employment.!* Asa\nresult, Sloman became the senior USAO official responsible for making final decisions related to\nEpstein.\n\nAlso on November 26, 2oo8, Black responded to Villafafia’s leter, acknouledging that\nEpstein was serving his sentence in the Palm Beach County Work Release Program, but denying\nthat Epstein was in breach of the NPA.'®* Black noted that the NPA did not prohibit work release;\nthe NPA expressly provided that Epstein was to be afforded the same benefits as any other inmate;\nl82 Michele Dargan and David Rogers, “Palm Beach sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ‘treated differently,’” Palm\nBeach Daily News, Dec. l3, 2oo8.\n\nl88 The recusal was formally approved by the Department on December 8, 2oo8.\nl84 Black forwarded the email to Sloman, noting that Villafafia “is very concerned about anything Epstein does”\nand that the defense team would “abide by” Sloman’s decision on the issue.\nll5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4439\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004445.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l48 of 349\nhim/her by an agency unless a statute provides otherwise.” Whenever a U.S. Atorney closes a\ncase without prosecution, the file should reflect the action taken and the reason for it. USAM\n§ 9-27.22o sets forth the grounds to be considered in making the decision whether to commence\nor decline federal prosecution. A federal prosecutor should commence or recommend prosecution\nif he or she believes that admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a\nconviction of a federal offense, unless (l) the prosecution would serve no federal interest; (2) the\nperson is subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction; or (3) there exists an adequate\nalternative to prosecution. A comment to this provision indicates that it is the prosecutor’s task to\ndetermine whether these circumstances exist, and in making that <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span>, the prosecutor\n“should” consult USAM 8§ 9-27.23o, 9-27.24o, or 9-27.25o, as appropriate.\n\nUSAM § 9-27.23o sets forth a non-exhaustive list of considerations that a federal\nprosecutor should weigh in determining whether a substantial federal interest would be served by\ninitiating prosecution against a person:\n\nl. Federal law enforcement priorities; !°\n\n2. The nature and seriousness of the offense; !*!\n\n3. The deterrent effect of prosecution;\n\n4, The person’s culpability in connection with the offense;\n\n5. The person’s history with respect to criminal activity;\n\n6. The person’s willingness to cooperate in the investigation\nor prosecution of others; and\n\n7. The probable sentence or other consequences if the person\nis convicted.\n\nThe USAM contemplates that, on occasion, a federal prosecutor will decline to open a case\nin deference to prosecution by the state in which the crime occurred. USAM § 9-27.24o directs\nthat in evaluating the effectiveness of prosecution in another jurisdiction, the federal prosecutor\nshould weigh “all relevant considerations,” including the strength of the other jurisdiction’s\ninterest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute effectively, and\nthe probable sentence or other consequences the person will be subject to if convicted in the other\njurisdiction. A comment to this provision explains:\n\nl2o A comment to this provision directs the prosecutor to consider carefully the extent to which a federal\nprosecution would be consistent with established federal prosecutorial priorities.\n\nl9l A comment to this provision explains that an assessment of the nature and seriousness of the offense must\nalso include consideration of the impact on the victim. The comment further cautions that when restitution is at issue,\n“care should be taken . . . to ensure against contributing to an impression that an offender can escape prosecution\nmerely by returning the spoils of his/her crime.”\n\nl2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4445\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004446.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l49 of 349\n\nSome offenses, even though in violation of Federal law, are of\n\nparticularly strong interest to the authorities of the state or local\n\njurisdiction in which they occur, either because of the nature of the\n\noffense, the identity of the offender or victim, the fact that the\n\ninvestigation was conducted primarily by state or local\n\ninvestigators, or some other circumstance. Whatever the reason,\n\nwhen it appears that the Federal interest in prosecution is less\n\nsubstantial than the interest of state or local authorities,\n\nconsideration should be given to referring the case to those\n\nauthorities rather than commencing or recommending a Federal\n\nprosecution.\nAnother comment cautions that in assessing whether to defer to state or local authorities, “the\nFederal prosecutor should be alert to any local conditions, atitudes, relationships or other\ncircumstances that might cast doubt on the likelihood of the state or local authorities conducting a\nthorough and successful prosecution.”\n\nUSAM § 9-27.26o identifies impermissible considerations relating to the decision whether\nto initiate or decline a federal prosecution. Specifically, the decision may not be based on\nconsideration of the person’s race, religion, sex, national origin, or political association, activities,\nor beliefs; the prosecutor’s “oun personal feelings” about the person or the victim; or the possible\neffect of the decision on the prosecutor’s oun professional or personal circumstances. When\nopting to decline federal prosecution, the prosecutor should ensure that the reasons for that decision\nare communicated to the investigating agency and reflected in the office files. USAM § 9-27.27o.\n\n2. USAM § 9-2.o3l: The Petite Policy\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not prohibit prosecutions of a defendant by both state and\nfederal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the\nDepartment has a long-standing policy, knoun as the Petite policy, governing federal prosecutions\ncharged after the initiation of a prosecution in another jurisdiction based on the same or similar\nconduct.!°? The general principles applicable to the prosecution or declination decision are set\nforth in USAM § 9-2.o3l, “Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy (‘Petite Policy’),” which\ncontains guidelines for a federal prosecutor’s exercise of discretion in determining whether to bring\na federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or\nfederal proceeding. The policy applies “whenever there has been a prior state or federal\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”\n\nIn circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new\nfederal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist. The prerequisites are as follous:\n\n(l) The mater must involve a substantial federal interest. The <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> whether\n\na substantial federal interest is involved is made on a case-by-case basis. Maters\nl92 See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S. 22, 27-29 (l977); Petite v.

Generally, the U.S. Atorney\nhas authority to approve a non-prosecution agreement. USAM § 9-27.6oo comment. Houever,\nUSAM § 9-27.64o directs that a government atorney should not enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation without first obtaining the approval of the\nappropriate Assistant Atorney General, or his or her designee, when the person is someone who\n“is likely to become of major public interest.”\n\nThese USAM provisions do not address the uses of non-prosecution agreements in\ncircumstances other than when needed to obtain cooperation.\n5. USAM Provisions Relating to Grants of Immunity\nNothing in the USAM directly prohibits the government from using the criminal exposure\nof third parties in negotiating with a criminal defendant. Instead, the provision that addresses\nimmunity relates only to the exchange of limited immunity for the testimony of a witness who has\nasserted a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. See USAM §§ 9-23.loo et seq.\n6. USAM/C.F.R. Provisions Relating to Financial Conflicts of Interest\nDepartment employees are expected to be aware of, and to comply with, all ethics-related\nlaws, rules, regulations, and policies. See, generally, USAM § l-4.ooo et seg. Specifically, a\ngovernment atorney is prohibited by criminal statute from participating personally and\nsubstantially in any particular mater in which he has a financial interest or in which such an\ninterest can be imputed to him. See l8 U.S.C. § 2o8 and 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.4ol-4o2. In addition,\na Department employee should seek advice from an ethics official before participating in any\nmater in which his impartiality could be questioned. If a conflict of interest exists, in order for\nthe employee to participate in the mater, the head of the employee’s component, with the\nconcurrence of an ethics official, must make a <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that the interest of the government in\nthe employee’s participation outweighs the concern that a reasonable person may question the\nintegrity of the Department’s programs and operations. The <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> must be made in\nwriting. See 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.5ol-5o2.\nB. Other Department Policies\nl. Department Policies Relating to the Disposition of Charges\nThe Atorney General has the responsibility for establishing prosecutorial priorities for the\nDepartment. Over the span of several decades, each successive Atorney General has articulated\nthose priorities in policy memoranda issued to all federal prosecutors. As applicable here, on\nSeptember 22, 2oo3, Atorney General John Ashcroft issued a memorandum regarding\n“Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and\nSentencing” (Ashcroft Memo). The Ashcroft Memo, which explicitly superseded all previous\nDepartmental guidance on the subject, set forth policies “designed to ensure that all federal\nl25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4449\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004472.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l75 of 349\n\nThe USAO might have been able to surmount the evidentiary, legal, and policy issues\npresented by a federal prosecution of Epstein. Villafafia, in particular, believed she could have\nprevailed had she taken the case to trial, and even after the NPA was negotiated, she repeatedly\nrecommended declaring Epstein in breach and proceeding with an indictment, because she\ncontinued to have confidence in the case.”*? Oosterban and others also believed that the\ngovernment would succeed at trial. Furthermore, the victims were not a uniform group. Some of\nthem were afraid of testifying or having their identities made public; others wanted Epstein\nprosecuted, but even among those, it is not clear hou many expressed a willingness to testify at a\ntrial; and still others provided information favorable to Epstein. In the end, Acosta assumed\nresponsibility for deciding hou to resolve the Epstein investigation and weighing the risks and\nbenefits of a trial versus those of a pre-charge disposition. His <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that a pre-charge\ndisposition was appropriate was not unreasonable under the circumstances.\n\nAlthough evidentiary and witness issues explain the subject supervisors’ concerns about\nwinning a potential trial and why the USAO would have sought some sort of pre-charge\ndisposition, they do not fully explain why Acosta decided to pursue a state-based resolution as\nopposed to a traditional federal plea agreement. OPR did not find in the contemporaneous records\na memorandum or other memorialization of the reasoning underlying Acosta’s decision to offer a\nstate-based resolution or the terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7.\n\nAccording to Acosta, “In 2oo6, it would have been extremely unusual for any United States\nAtorney’s Office to become involved in a state solicitation case, even one involving underage\nteens,” because solicitation was “the province of state prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR that he\ndeveloped “a preference for deferring to the state” to “make it clear that [the USAO was] not\nstepping on something that is a purely local mater, because we [didn’t] want bad precedent for\nthe sake of the larger human trafficking issue.” Acosta also told OPR that it was his understanding\nthat the PBPD would not have brought the case to federal investigators if the State Atorney’s\nOffice had pursued a sanction against Epstein that included jail time and sexual offender\nregistration. Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in the case as limited to preventing the “manifest\ninjustice” that, in Acosta’s view, would have resulted from the state’s original plea proposal.\nAcosta acknouledged that if the investigation had begun in the federal system, he would not have\nviewed the terms set out in the NPA as a satisfactory result, but it was adequate to serve as a\n“backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he described as “a polite way of saying[,\n“|encouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]” In sum, Acosta told OPR that the Epstein case\nlay in “uncharted territory,” there was no certainty that the USAO would prevail if it went to trial,\nand a potentially unfavorable outcome had to be “weighed against a certain plea with registration\nthat would make sure that the public knew that this person was a sex offender.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he discussed the case primarily with Sloman and Menchel, and both\ntold OPR that while they did not share Acosta’s federalism concerns, they recalled that Acosta had\nthe terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7. Therefore, any allegations against the prosecutors could not have\nplayed a significant role in Acosta’s decisions as reflected in the term sheet.\n\n22o Sloman told OPR that Villafafia “always believed in the case.”\nl48\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4472\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004628.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 33l of 349\nof Title l8, United States Code, Section 2423(b); and\n\n(5) knouingly, in and affecting interstate and foreign commerce, recruiting,\n\nenticing, and obtaining by any means a person, knouing that the person had\nnot atained the age of l8 years and would be caused to engage in a\ncommercial sex act as defined in l8 U.S.C. § l59l(c)(l); in violation of Title\nl8, United States Code, Sections l59l(a)(l) and 2; and\n\nIT APPEARING that Epstein seeks to resolve globally his state and federal criminal\nliability and Epstein understands and acknouledges that, in exchange for the benefits\nprovided by this agreement, he agrees to comply with its terms, including undertaking certain\nactions with the State Atorney’s Office;\n\nIT APPEARING, after an investigation of the offenses and Epstein's background by\nboth State and Federal law enforcement agencies, and after due consultation with the State\nAtorney's Office, that the interests of the United States, the State of Florida, and the\nDefendant will be served by the follouing procedure;\n\nTHEREFORE, on the authority of R.

Because no such order existed here, the\nSuperior Court concluded that it could “ascertain no abuse of discretion in the trial court’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that [Cosby] was not immune from prosecution, because Mr. Castor failed\nto seek or obtain an immunity order pursuant to Section 5947.” /d. at 4l2. “Only a court\norder conveying such immunity is legally binding in this Commonwealth.” /d.\n\nThe Superior Court further rejected Cosby’s invocation of promissory estoppel\nasserting reliance upon D.A. Castors assurances, as demonstrated by Cosby’s\ncooperation with Constand’s civil suit and his decision not to invoke the Fifth Amendment\nduring his deposition testimony. The panel opined that Cosby failed to cite sufficient\nauthority to establish that a prosecution may be barred under a promissory estoppel\ntheory. The panel further agreed with the trial court that, in any event, “it was not\nreasonable for [Cosby] to rely on Mr. Castor’s promise, even if the trial court had found\ncredible the testimony provided by Mr. Castor and [Cosby’s] civil atorney,” Atorney\nSchmit. /d. The panel stated: “We cannot deem reasonable [Cosby’s] reliance on such\na promise when he was represented by counsel, especially when immunity can only be\ngranted by a court order, and where no court order granting him immunity existed.” /d. at\n4l3.\n\nThe Superior Court further opined that there was “virtually no evidence in the\nrecord that [Cosby] actually declined to assert his Fifth Amendment rights at the civil\ndeposition based on Mr. Castor’s purported promise not to prosecute.” /d. Although the\ncourt noted that Atorney Schmit was the only witness who could testify that Cosby\nindeed relied upon Castor’s purported promise during his deposition (Atorney Schmit\ndid so testify), it emphasized the Commonwealth’s argument that Atorney Schmit\nalloued Cosby to give a statement to the police during the initial investigation, that Cosby\ndid not incriminate himself at that point, that Atorney Schmit further negotiated with the\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 44\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4857\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004859.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 47 of 8o\nThe decisions belou, barring prosecution of the Stipetiches, embodied\nconcern that allouing charges to be brought after George Stipetich had\nperformed his part of the agreement by answering questions about sources\nof the contraband discovered in his residence would be fundamentally unfair\nbecause in answering the questions he may have disclosed information that\ncould be used against him. The proper response to this concern is not to\nbar prosecution; rather, it is to suppress, at the appropriate juncture, any\ndetrimental evidence procured through the inaccurate representation that\nhe would not be prosecuted.\n\nId. at l296. Although the Superior Court dismissed this passage from Stipetich as dicta,\nit found the situation distinguishable in any event inasmuch as former D.A. Castor testified\nthat there was no “agreement” or “quid pro quo” with Cosby, and, therefore, any reliance\nthat Cosby placed upon the district atorney's promise was unreasonable. Cosby, 224\nA.3d at 4l6-l7.\n\nThe Superior Court concluded that it was bound by the trial court’s factual findings\nand by its credibility determinations. The trial court had “determined that Mr. Castor’s\ntestimony and, by implication, Atorney Schmit’s testimony (which was premised upon\ninformation he indirectly received from Mr. Castor) were not credible.” /d. at 4l7. The\npanel added that the trial court had “found that the weight of the evidence supported its\nfinding that no agreement or grant of immunity was made, and that [Cosby] did not\nreasonably rely on any overtures by Mr. Castor to that effect when he sat for his civil\ndeposition.” /d. Thus, the Superior Court discerned no error in the trial court’s decision\nto allou the use of Cosby’s deposition testimony against him at trial.'®\nng In addition to the Rule 4o4(b) and non-prosecutions claims, the Superior Court\nrejected a number of other issues raised by Cosby, including an assertion of improper\njuror bias, a challenge to an allegedly misleading jury instruction, and a contention that\nSORNA was unconstitutional. Cosby, 224 A.3d at 396, 42l-43l.

Castor stated that he intended permanently to bar\nprosecution of Cosby, he also testified that he sought to confer some form of transactional\nimmunity. In his second email to D.A. Ferman, former district atorney Castor suggested\nthat his intent in “signing off” on the press release was to assure Cosby that nothing that\nhe said in a civil deposition could or would be used against him in a criminal prosecution.\nN.T., 2/2/2ol6, Exh. D-7. In the same email, he simultaneously expressed his belief that\n“a prosecution is not precluded.” /d. As such, the evidence suggests that D.A. Castor\nwas motivated by conflicting aims when he decided not to prosecute Cosby. On one\nhand, the record demonstrates that D.A. Castor endeavored to forever preclude the\nCommonwealth from prosecuting Cosby if Cosby testified in the civil case. On the other\nhand, the record indicates that he sought to foreclose only the use in a subsequent\ncriminal case of any testimony that Cosby gave in a civil suit.\n\nThe trial court was left to resolve these seeming inconsistencies. The court\nconcluded that Cosby and D.A. Castor did not enter into a formal immunity agreement.\nBecause the record supports the trial court’s findings in this regard, we are bound by\nthose conclusions. Pertinently, we are bound by the trial court’s <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that D.A.\nCastor’s actions amounted only to a unilateral exercise of prosecutorial discretion. This\ncharacterization is consistent with the former district atorney's insistence at the habeas\nhearing that what occurred between him and Cosby was not an agreement, a contract,\nor any kind of quid pro quo exchange.\n\nWe are not, houever, bound by the louer courts’ legal determinations that derive\nfrom those factual findings. Thus, the question becomes whether, and under what\ncircumstances, a prosecutor’s exercise of his or her charging discretion binds future\nprosecutors’ exercise of the same discretion.

Dkt. No. 3o9.\n\nMr. Markus is plainly a lawyer associated with the defense in this case. His formal\nrepresentation has involved handling at least one pre-trial issue for Ms. Maxwell—in particular,\nappeals to the Second Circuit of this Court’s bail-denial determinations. Dkt. No. l73; see also\nUnited States v. Maxwell, Nos. 2l-58-cr(L), 2l-77o-cr (2d Cir.). Beyond that, he has held\nhimself out as Ms. Maxwell’s atorney in press related to the current trial stage, including in the\nop-ed at issue in the Government’s leter application, which describes him as “Maxwell’s\nappellate counsel.” He has also atended a proceeding in this mater and spoken on Ms.\nMaxwell’s behalf to the press afterwards while identified as Ms. Maxwell’s atorney.

Dkt. No. 3l4. Rule 23.l is not so superficial nor easily circumvented. Nothing in the\nrule limits its application to lawyers who have formally noticed an appearance. To the contrary,\nas the text throughout the rule makes clear, it applies to statements made by lawyers (and others)\n“associated” with “pending or imminent criminal litigation.” S.D.N.Y. Local Criminal Rule\n23.l(a) (last updated Oct. 29, 2ol8); see also Rule 23.l(b) (“a lawyer participating in or\nassociated with the investigation’); Rule 23.l(c) (“lawyer or law firm associated with the\nprosecution or defense”). An atorney need not be of record in order to be sufficiently\n“associated” with a case as to justify application of disciplinary rules regarding extrajudicial\nstatements. Lawyers who have not filed a formal notice of appearance may still possess\ninformation that lends a perception by the public that their remarks on a pending case hold\ngreater authority. See In re Hinds, 449 A.2d 483, 496 (N.J. l982); see also People v. Butafuoco,\n599 N.Y.S.2d 4l9 (Nassau Cty. Ct. l993).\n\nSuch is the case with Mr. Markus’s role in the pending mater. As noted, Mr. Markus has\natended a proceeding in this Court, after which he spoke to the press on Ms. Maxwell’s behalf.\nHe has represented Ms. Maxwell on appeals of this Court’s pre-trial bail determinations.\nMoreover, Mr. Markus has identified himself as Ms. Maxwell’s appellate lawyer in a published\nop-ed discussing his opinion of the merits of this case. These facts mean that the public, which\nincludes potential jurors, may perceive Mr. Markus as an authoritative source of information\nregarding the pending mater and may readily consider his remarks to be accurate and reliable.\nMr. Markus is therefore ORDERED to comply with Local Criminal Rule 23.l.\n\nThe Government does not ask the Court to discipline Mr. Markus based on his op-ed and\nthe Court declines to consider whether it violated Rule 23.l given the potential lack of clarity\nwith respect to whether Mr. Markus was bound by the rule.

But that’s not what the Court did.\n\nThere are very good reasons for this. This Court serves as a gatekeeper to the admission\nof alleged co-conspirator statements. The Supreme Court’s decision in Bourjaily v. United States\nrequires the Court to determine, by a preponderance of the evidence, whether statements of a co-\nconspirator are admissible under Rule 8ol(d)(2)(E). 483 U.S. l7l, l75-76 (l987). In making this\n<span class=\"highlight\">determination</span>, the Court must find that a conspiracy existed, that its members included the\ndeclarant and the party against whom the statement is offered, and that the statement was made\nduring the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy. Bourjaily, 483 U.S. at l75.\n\nIf the government does not disclose what co-conspirator statements it intends to offer, as\nthis Court already ordered the government to do by October ll, then Ms. Maxwell will be unable\nto file a motion in limine by October l8 challenging the admissibility of the co-conspirator\nstatements and thereby put the government to its burden of proof and ensure this Court is able to\ndischarge its gatekeeping function. See Bourjaily, 483 U.S. at l75-76. Although the government\nmay not wish to give Ms. Maxwell the required notice, this Court has already entered its order.\n\nThe government’s leter offers no reason, much less a compelling reason, for this Court to\nreconsider its order. The government has not even atempted to identify “controlling law or\nfactual maters which it believes the court overlooked and that might reasonably be expected to\nalter the court’s decision.” Berger, l88 F.

PURPOSE AND OVERVIEW\nThe Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program (the “Program”) is a voluntary, independent Program that\nhas been established to compensate and resolve the claims of victims-survivors of sexual abuse by\nJeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”).\nThe Estate of Jeffrey Epstein (the “Estate”) has retained the services of nationally recognized claims\nadministration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana H. Feldman to design the\nProgram. Ms. Feldman will also serve as the Administrator of the Program (the “Administrator”). This\nProtocol reflects input from victims-survivors, their lawyers, other potentially interested parties, and\nrepresentatives of the Estate.\nThrough the Program, the Estate wishes to acknouledge the wrongs endured by victims-survivors and\noffer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for such sexual abuse.\nThe Program is governed by the follouing non-exclusive guiding principles:\ne The Program is purely voluntary. It does not affect any rights a Claimant may have\nunless and until the Claimant accepts the offered compensation and executes a\nRelease. A Claimant may reject the offer of compensation and may stop\nparticipating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time prior to execution\nof the Release.\ne The Program is independent and will in no way be administered, controlled or\noverseen by the Estate. The Administrator is responsible for all decisions relating to\nthe review, processing and evaluation of individual claims submited to the\nProgram. The Administrator will have final, binding and exclusive authority to\ndetermine Claimant eligibility and the valuation of each eligible individual claim.\nDecisions of the Administrator made pursuant to this Protocol are not subject to\nreview or modification in any way by the Estate or any other party or entity.\ne There is no cap or limitation on the aggregate amount of funds available to\ncompensate all eligible Claimants or on the amount of compensation to be made to\neach individual Claimant. Each individual claim will be evaluated separately by the\nAdministrator. The Administrator will determine, in her sole and exclusive\ndiscretion, issues of eligibility and the amount of compensation and the Estate will\npay all eligible claims based on the Administrator’s <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span>.\nl|Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5lo4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005105.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 336-l Filed o9/o7/2l Page 53 of 6o\ne All Claimants will be treated with respect, dignity and fairness without regard to\n\nrace, color, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, gender or disability. To\n\nensure claims will be adjudicated fairly, the Administrator will manage the process\n\nso that all Claimants can equally access the Program’s claim process. Individuals\n\nwith disabilities will be given the opportunity to effectively communicate their\n\nclaims and to request special process accommodations.\nThe Program is available to all victims-survivors regardless of where they were harmed, when they were\nharmed, whether the claim is time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and whether they\nhave previously filed a lawsuit against or setled with Epstein and/or the Estate.\nThe exclusive claims period for filing a claim pursuant to this Protocol shall commence on the to-be-\ndetermined Effective Date and shall conclude nine (9) months after that date (“Filing Deadline”). All\nindividual claims filed with the Program must be filed within this period.\nTo complement the Program’s resources, the Administrator will, at her discretion and with the consent\nof the Claimant, consult with Professor Marci A. Hamilton, a nationally recognized sexual abuse expert,\nleading legal academic and advocate of victims’ rights. Ms. Hamilton’s role will be to further inform the\nAdministrator and her staff about the dynamics of sexual abuse, common responses to sexual abuse,\nand the impact of sexual abuse on victims; to serve as a resource for the Administrator in developing or\nupdating policies and procedures; to advise the Administrator regarding sensitivities involved in\ninteractions with victims; and to serve as a referral source for the Administrator in providing post-\n<span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> information to claimants who seek guidance, counseling or other services. The\nAdministrator may, at her discretion and with the Claimant’s prior writen consent, request that Ms.\nHamilton review an individual claimant file. The Administrator will determine on a case-by-case basis, in\nher discretion, the need to anonymize individual claimants’ files before sharing them with Ms. Hamilton.\nAs set forth above, the Administrator is solely responsible for all decisions relating to the administration\nof the Program, including the review, processing, evaluation, and <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> of individual claims\nsubmited to the Program.\nDuring the term of the Program, Ms. Hamilton will not meet or speak with a Claimant or her\nrepresentatives concerning any aspect of the Program without the Administrator present. Ms. Hamilton\nwill maintain in strict confidence and will not disclose outside the Program any information she obtains\nthrough her participation in the Program, including individual Claimants’ submissions.\n\n2|[ Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5lo5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005106.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 336-l Filed o9/o7/2l Page 54 of 6o\nIl. ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS\nA. Eligibility Criteria\nThe persons eligible to participate in this Program are individuals who allege they were sexually abused\nby Epstein. In addition, the follouing criteria apply:\n\ne Theclaim of sexual abuse must be directed against Epstein.\n\ne An individual whose claim is time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations may\nparticipate in the Program provided that other eligibility criteria are met.\n\ne An individual who previously entered into a setlement agreement resolving a claim of sexual\nabuse against Epstein may participate in the Program provided that other eligibility criteria are\nmet.\n\ne An individual who allegedly assisted Epstein in procuring other victims-survivors may\nparticipate in the Program where there is a credible basis to determine that the individual\nacted under duress as a result of her oun sexual abuse by Epstein, provided that other\neligibility criteria are met.\n\ne  |f the Claimant chooses to accept the offered compensation, the Claimant must dismiss with\nprejudice any existing lawsuits, legal actions or claims filed against the Estate or related entities\nand/or related individuals. The Claimant must provide proof of such dismissal along with or\nprior to the signed acceptance of the compensation <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> offer leter and executed\nRelease in order to receive payment.\n\nB. Legal Representatives of Claimants\nAn individual may file a claim on a victim’s behalf where that individual has been granted legal authority\nto act in a representative capacity pursuant to appropriate law. The “Legal Representative” of an\nindividual Claimant shall mean: (l) in the case of a Claimant who is currently a minor, a parent or legal\nguardian authorized by law to serve as the minor’s legal representative; (2) in the case of an\nincompetent or legally incapacitated Claimant, a person who has been duly appointed as the Claimant’s\nlegal representative in accordance with applicable law; (3) in the case of a deceased Claimant, a person\nwho has been duly appointed to act as the personal representative of the Claimant's estate by a court of\ncompetent jurisdiction and is authorized to file and compromise a claim; or (4) an atorney authorized to\nrepresent the Claimant for purposes of pursuing a claim through this Program.\nLegal Representatives must provide proper documentation demonstrating representative capacity. Such\nproof may include a pouer of atorney; documentation shouing the individual’s appointment as\nguardian or guardian ad litem; documentation shouing the individual’s appointment as personal\nrepresentative of the Claimant’s estate (such as leters of administration); a copy of a retainer\n3|Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5lo6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005107.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 336-l Filed o9/o7/2l Page 55 of 6o\nagreement shouing legal representation signed by both the Claimant and the atorney or a signed\nstatement by an adult Claimant and the atorney that a licensed/admited atorney is acting on her\nbehalf.\n\nil. CLAIMS ADMINISTRATION - SUBMISSION, EVALUATION AND <span class=\"highlight\">DETERMINATION</span>\nA. Claims Submission Process\n\nIndividuals who have filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim against Epstein and/or the Estate or have\notherwise been identified as a victim of Epstein by their atorney to the Administrator on or before the\nEffective Date will be sent a Claim Form and other relevant Program information, including Instructions\nfor completion and submission of the Claim Form and a copy of this Protocol. Individuals who have filed\na lawsuit need not agree to a stay of litigation or make any other concession in any pending litigation to\nbe eligible to participate in the Program. Likewise, individuals who have not yet filed a lawsuit remain\nfree to file a lawsuit and engage in litigation concurrently with participation in the Program. Individuals\nmust, houever, dismiss with prejudice any and all existing lawsuits, legal actions and claims prior to or at\nthe time of acceptance of a compensation <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> offer in order to receive payment.\n\nIndividuals who have not filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim against Epstein and/or the Estate or have\nnot otherwise been identified as a victim of Epstein by their atorney to the Administrator on or before\nthe Effective Date may register to participate in this Program on the Program’s website at\nwww.EpsteinVCP.com. To register, such individuals must complete a questionnaire seting forth their\nname, contact information, a summary description of the nature of the claim and other requested\ninformation. Upon registration, the Administrator will perform a preliminary review to consider if the\nindividual is eligible to participate in the Program. If the Administrator deems that the individual is\neligible to participate in the Program, she will then send that individual a Claim Form and other relevant\nProgram information.\n\nNote: The fact that an individual is sent a Claim Form and other relevant Program information indicates\nthat the Administrator has determined that such individual is eligible to participate in the Program. It\ndoes not indicate that the Administrator has determined that such individual is eligible to receive\ncompensation. That <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> is made only after a Claim Form and all required documentation has\nbeen submited and evaluated by the Administrator.\n\nRegistrations for individuals who have not filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim against Epstein and/or the\nEstate or have not otherwise been identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein by their atorney to the\nAdministrator on or before the Effective Date will be accepted by the Administrator from the Effective\nDate through a date that is 45 days prior to the Filing Deadline (“Registration Deadline”). It is important\nto note that the Registration Deadline is separate from, and precedes, the Filing Deadline.

PURPOSE AND OVERVIEW\nThe Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program (the “Program”) is a voluntary, independent Program that\nhas been established to compensate and resolve the claims of victims-survivors of sexual abuse by\nJeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”).\nThe Estate of Jeffrey Epstein (the “Estate”) has retained the services of nationally recognized claims\nadministration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana H. Feldman to design the\nProgram. Ms. Feldman will also serve as the Administrator of the Program (the “Administrator”). This\nProtocol reflects input from victims-survivors, their lawyers, other potentially interested parties, and\nrepresentatives of the Estate.\nThrough the Program, the Estate wishes to acknouledge the wrongs endured by victims-survivors and\noffer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for such sexual abuse.\nThe Program is governed by the follouing non-exclusive guiding principles:\ne The Program is purely voluntary. It does not affect any rights a Claimant may have\nunless and until the Claimant accepts the offered compensation and executes a\nRelease. A Claimant may reject the offer of compensation and may stop\nparticipating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time prior to execution\nof the Release.\ne The Program is independent and will in no way be administered, controlled or\noverseen by the Estate. The Administrator is responsible for all decisions relating to\nthe review, processing and evaluation of individual claims submited to the\nProgram. The Administrator will have final, binding and exclusive authority to\ndetermine Claimant eligibility and the valuation of each eligible individual claim.\nDecisions of the Administrator made pursuant to this Protocol are not subject to\nreview or modification in any way by the Estate or any other party or entity.\ne There is no cap or limitation on the aggregate amount of funds available to\ncompensate all eligible Claimants or on the amount of compensation to be made to\neach individual Claimant. Each individual claim will be evaluated separately by the\nAdministrator. The Administrator will determine, in her sole and exclusive\ndiscretion, issues of eligibility and the amount of compensation and the Estate will\npay all eligible claims based on the Administrator’s <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span>.\nl|Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5l69\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005170.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 336-4 Filed o9/o7/2l Page l5 of 22\ne All Claimants will be treated with respect, dignity and fairness without regard to\n\nrace, color, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, gender or disability. To\n\nensure claims will be adjudicated fairly, the Administrator will manage the process\n\nso that all Claimants can equally access the Program’s claim process.

All\nindividual claims filed with the Program must be filed within this period.\nTo complement the Program’s resources, the Administrator will, at her discretion and with the consent\nof the Claimant, consult with Professor Marci A. Hamilton, a nationally recognized sexual abuse expert,\nleading legal academic and advocate of victims’ rights. Ms. Hamilton’s role will be to further inform the\nAdministrator and her staff about the dynamics of sexual abuse, common responses to sexual abuse,\nand the impact of sexual abuse on victims; to serve as a resource for the Administrator in developing or\nupdating policies and procedures; to advise the Administrator regarding sensitivities involved in\ninteractions with victims; and to serve as a referral source for the Administrator in providing post-\n<span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> information to claimants who seek guidance, counseling or other services. The\nAdministrator may, at her discretion and with the Claimant’s prior writen consent, request that Ms.\nHamilton review an individual claimant file. The Administrator will determine on a case-by-case basis, in\nher discretion, the need to anonymize individual claimants’ files before sharing them with Ms. Hamilton.\nAs set forth above, the Administrator is solely responsible for all decisions relating to the administration\nof the Program, including the review, processing, evaluation, and <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> of individual claims\nsubmited to the Program.\nDuring the term of the Program, Ms. Hamilton will not meet or speak with a Claimant or her\nrepresentatives concerning any aspect of the Program without the Administrator present.

If a Claimant chooses to accept the offer of compensation pursuant to the Program, the\nClaimant will be required to sign and execute a full Release, in a form satisfactory to the Estate, of all\npast and future claims (including lis pendens, writs of atachment, etc.) relating to such allegations of\nsexual abuse against the Estate, related entities and/or related individuals. A Claimant may reject the\noffer of compensation and may stop participating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time\nprior to the execution of the Release.\nThe Release will waive any rights the Claimant and her heirs, descendants, legatees or beneficiaries\nmay have to assert any claims relating to allegations of sexual abuse against the Estate, related\nentities and/or related individuals, to file an individual legal action relating to such allegations, or to\nparticipate in any civil legal action associated with such allegations, except as a witness. Houever,\nthe Release will not operate to preclude or limit the Claimant’s ability to report and discuss\nallegations of sexual abuse with law enforcement officials or anyone else. In other words, the\nRelease will not impose any rules of confidentiality on claimants, who are expressly permited to\ndiscuss their allegations without restriction, should they choose.\nBefore signing a Release, the Claimant must consult with an atorney selected by the Claimant. Ifthe\nClaimant is not represented by an atorney, the Program will provide an atorney to provide free legal\ncounseling to the Claimant for the sole purpose of advising the Claimant concerning the language and\nbinding nature of the Release.\nNo one affiliated with the Program will provide tax or legal advice to those receiving payments under\nthe Program. Claimants are urged to consult with a tax advisor concerning any questions regarding\ntax liability for payments pursuant to the Program.\n4. Payments\nUpon the Claimant’s acceptance of the Administrator’s <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span>, the Administrator’s receipt of\nthe Claimant’s executed Release and, where applicable, dismissal with prejudice of any existing\nlawsuit, legal actions or claims against the Estate or related entities and/or related individuals, the\nAdministrator will initiate payment by check or electronic funds transfer to each eligible Claimant as\ndirected by the Claimant.

The Court Should Not Permit the Defense to Elicit Evidence About Charging\n\nDecisions or Possible Reasons for Them\n\nl. Applicable Law\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 4o2 provides that “[i]rrelevant evidence is not admissible.”\nAccordingly, any evidence that does not bear on the defendant’s guilt or innocence of the\ncharges in the indictment should be excluded as irrelevant. Rule 4o3 further states that the Court\nmay “exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of\none or more of the follouing: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue\ndelay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.” Accordingly, any evidence\nthat is likely to distract the jury from the issue of guilt or innocence should be excluded under\nRule 4o3. See, e.g., United States v. Rosado, 728 F.2d 89, 93 (2d Cir. l984) (criticizing\nadmission of evidence about the propriety of a prosecution “for turning the trial away from a\n<span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> of whether the elements of the offense charged had been proved beyond a\nreasonable doubt into a wide-ranging inquiry into maters far beyond the scope of legitimate\nissues in a criminal trial’).\n\nEvidence about charging decisions made by law enforcement officials is rarely\nadmissible because such evidence typically consists of hearsay, is not relevant, and is likely to\nconfuse and mislead the jury. As such, courts in this Circuit have repeatedly precluded evidence\nof charging decisions for one or more of these reasons. See, e.g., United States v. Borrero, No.\nl3 Cr. 58 (KBF), 2ol3 WL 6o2o773, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.

The\nFlorida Investigation, which the NPA concluded, will already be a significant part of the\ngovernment’s case-in-chief.

(emphasis added). The Rule's requirement that the prosecution must “identify the evidence,”\n“articulate a non-propensity purpose” and a “basis for concluding the evidence is relevant in light\nof this purpose” replaced the previous notice requirement only of the “general nature” of\nanticipated evidence. The “advance notice” is “important so that the parties and the court have\nadequate opportunity to assess the evidence, the purpose for which it is offered, and whether the\nrequirements of Rule 4o3 have been satisfied... .” Jd.\n\nThe new rule also required that the pre-trial notice be done in writing, “sufficiently ahead\nof trial to give the defendant a fair opportunity to meet the evidence.” Rule 4o4(b)(3)(A). “The\n‘air opportunity’ must include sufficient time for an independent investigation that might surface\nevidence that refutes, mitigates, or places the other act in a different light. Prosecutors who cut\nthe disclosure too close to the trial date risk a judge either excluding the evidence so that the trial\ncan proceed as scheduled or delaying the trial so the defense can “meet” the other act proof. Easy\nto overlook is that the judge too needs time to consider the admissibility of the other act\nevidence.” See Wright & Miller, 22B Fed. Prac. & Proc.

Rule 4o4(b) Notice in This Case\n\nThe Government advised this Court that it could provide notice of any Rule 4o4(b)\nevidence by 45 days prior to trial, which would afford it \"adequate time to finalize its\n<span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> of what evidence it will seek to introduce at trial pursuant to\" the Rule.

Should the Government\nrequest a \"good-cause\" exemption for their failure to timely provide Rule 4o4(b) notice, this\nCourt should analyze their excuse with skepticism. \"Prosecutors should be prepared to explain\ntheir change of heart and to rebut allegations of sandbagging. Unforeseen turns of testimony at\ntrial are one thing. Reasonably anticipated proof problems are another. For example, when intent\nis an element of a charged offense, a prosecutor will be hard pressed to explain why he did not\nforesee before trial that the other act proof may be important in a jury's <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> of intent.”\nWright & Miller, supra. Here, the government has been on notice of the elements it needs to\nprove since July 2o2o. It advised the Court it would be able to provide Rule 4o4(b) notice back\nin May 2o2l. Dkt. 229 at 3. With the trial continuance, it gained an additional five months. See\nDkt. 297.\n\nThere is no acceptable excuse for failure to follou the requirements of the Rule. Given\nthe significant number of other pre-trial filing deadlines, briefing the admissibility of the\nproffered Rule 4o4(b) evidence in the midst of her other obligations will be exceptionally\ndifficult. Ifthe Court is inclined to grant the government additional time to satisfy the Rule, Ms.\nMaxwell requests ample time to investigate the materials and to respond.\n\nIll. Ms. Maxwell Needs Additional Time to Respond to the Scant Notice that the\n\nMaterials Qualify as “Direct Evidence” in the Case\n\nThe Rule 4o4(b) Leter also repeated the Government's opinion that the newly-disclosed\nmaterials qualify as \"direct evidence\" of the conspiracy. At first blush, it is hard to see hou they\ncould so qualify. |\nee\nWm They do not reference or have anything to do with (a) the persons mentioned in the\nIndictment or any other testifying witness, nor (b) any of the legal allegations contained in the\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo56l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005646.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386 Filed lo/29/2l Page 22 of 24\nwitness encroaches upon the jury’s vital and exclusive function to make credibility\ndeterminations and therefore does not ‘assist the trier of fact’ as required by Rule 7o2.”)\n(citations omited). Rocchio’s opinions on disclosure also contravene Rule 4o3 because they\nsuggest that delayed reporting of child sexual abuse is more consistent with truthfulness than\nwith fabrication, a <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> which the jury must make for itself. Schneider, 2olo WL\n3734o55, at *6.\n\nThat leaves the second half of Rocchio’s disclosure opinion: that memory and disclosure\nof traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a number of factors, including the circumstances\nsurrounding the trauma. This opinion is so generic as to be meaningless. It is also a mater of\ncommon sense—hou could anyone dispute that memory is “impacted by a number of factors”?\nMoreover, Rocchio is not an expert in the human brain or memory generally. And her opinion\nabout when, why, and hou alleged victims of sexual assault remember being assaulted suffers\nfrom all the same flaws discussed above: Rocchio doesn’t point to any data or studies validating\nher opinion; her opinions cannot be tested, reproduced, or meaningfully challenged; and her\nopinion is based on the self-reports of her oun clients, who she assumes are telling the truth.\n\nII. Ata minimum, this Court should hold a Daubert hearing\n\nFor all these reasons, this Court should preclude Rocchio from testifying in this case. At\n\nthe very least, this Court should hold a Daubert to evaluate each of her proposed opinions.\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis Court should exclude Rocchio’s proposed testimony or, in the alternative, hold a\nDaubert hearing.\n\nDated: October l8, 2o2l\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5646\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005792.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 9 of 84\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol2) (citing Fed.

Thus\na district court may properly exercise its gatekeeping function without the “formality of a separate\nhearing[.]” Williams, 5o6 F.3d at l6l; see also United States v. Barnes, 4ll F. App’x 365, 37o\n(2d Cir. 2oll) (summary order). “This is particularly true if, at the time that the expert testimony\nis presented to the jury, a sufficient basis for allouing the testimony is on the record.” Williams,\n5o6 F.3d at l6l (citing 4 Weinstein’s Federal Evidence § 7o2.o2 [2] (2d ed. 2oo6)).\n\nFinally, even if the expert testimony is reliable, it must also be relevant. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Torres, No. 2o Cr. 6o8 (DLC), 2o2l WL l9475o3, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. May l3, 2o2l). In\nthis context, the testimony must “concern maters that the average juror is not capable of\nunderstanding on his or her oun.” United States v. Mejia, 545 F.3d l79, l94 (2d Cir. 2oo8); see\nFaulkner v. Arista Records LLC, 46 F. Sup. 3d 365, 375 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol4) (“Weighing whether the\nexpert testimony assists the trier of fact goes primarily to relevance.”).\n\nCourts have frequently admited expert testimony on the psychological relationship\nbetween perpetrators and victims of sex crimes. For instance, in United States v. Kidd, 385 F.\nSupp. 3d 259 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9), the Government gave notice of expert testimony on “the\npsychology of the pimp-prostitute relationship,” including concepts such as “trauma bonding.” Jd.\nat 263. The defendant interposed a Daubert challenge, arguing that the expert’s testimony was not\nbased on “studies or empirical data” and so could not “be assessed for reliability.” /d.

This argument misunderstands the role of the jury. Jurors are not tasked\nmerely with applying Dr. Rocchio’s expertise to facts. The jury will hear testimony that some\nMinor Victims did not immediately disclose their sexual abuse. When evaluating the credibility\nof those delayed disclosures, they will have the benefit of observing the Minor Victims’ testimony,\nincluding their cross-examination which is sure to address their delayed disclosure, and the Minor\nVictims’ explanation for those delays. The jury will also hear general testimony from Dr. Rocchio\nabout various circumstances that may lead victims of sexual abuse to delay disclosure. In the\ntotality of the circumstances, the jury can then decide who it finds credible.\n\nThe defendant also argues it is prejudicial to her that Dr. Rocchio suggests “that delayed\nreporting is more consistent with truthfulness than fabrication, a <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> which the jury must\nmake for itself.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l7). It is unclear hou the defendant can simultaneously argue\nthat (l) Dr. Rocchio’s testimony improperly assumes the role of the jury by suggesting that delayed\nreporting is “more consistent” with child sexual abuse (id.); and (2) Dr. Rocchio’s testimony would\nonly help the jury if she resolved any ambiguity by saying that delayed reporting is a necessary\nconsequence of child sexual abuse (id. at l5-l6).\n\nFinally, according to the defendant, Dr. Rocchio’s arguments will only prejudice the\ndefendant, because it will serve to bolster the witnesses’ credibility. As the defense acknouledges,\nhouever, Dr. Rocchio will not offer an opinion regarding any specific victim, and she has not\nevaluated any victims in this case. (Cf Def. Mot. 3 at l6 (citing United States v. Charley, l89\nF.3d l25l, l266-67 (loth Cir. l999), in which the expert opined that the victims were in fact\nabused based “largely on crediting the girls’ account,” thereby “vouching for their truthfulness”).\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006002.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 47 of 52\nprejudice because the [witness's] choice of language implied that he and the prosecution believed\nthe complainant's testimony.\" Jd.\n\nFor these and the previously stated reasons, Ms. Maxwell asks the Court to order that the\nparties, the witnesses, and the Court use individuals’ names in the presence of the jury.\nXIU.

That's the reason we have trials, to determine whether the Government\nl3. can prove a defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. A defendant in a criminal case does not\nl4 have to prove that she is not guilty.

The government concedes she poses no risk to the\ncommunity. She is a mature adult with no prior history of criminal or violent behavior. She has\nsteadfastly proclaimed her innocence, has maintained a strong desire to fight the case against her\nand is determined to fight her charges at trial and clear her name. There is no indication that she\nwould atempt to flee given her personality profile and <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> to be exonerated.\n\nThe bi-weekly teams of guards rotated in from high-security BOP facilities have reported\nto Ms. Maxwell that they are informed that she is a security and suicide risk, which heightens\ntheir vigilance and contempt.

Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for\nherself. Instead, the claim appears to be that Ms. Maxwell recruited and groomed minors to\nprovide sexualized massages for Mr. Epstein, which would amount to grooming-by-proxy.\n\nDr. Dietz is aware of no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to\nsupport a theory of grooming-by-proxy. Such a theory has not gained any acceptance (let alone\ngeneral acceptance) in the relevant community; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and\ncannot be tested; and there is no knoun or potential rate of error.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s opinion that “[i]ndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted\nby perpetrators of sexual abuse” is a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore derived from the\nfrequent observation of highly vulnerable children among those children who allege sexual\nabuse, but it is not based on empirical data regarding the likelihood of abuse among children\nwith varying degrees of vulnerability. To the extent that less vulnerable children, such as those\nwith intact families, atentive parents, good social support, litle psychopathology, less prior\ntrauma, no substance use, and higher resilience are less likely to allege abuse than the more\nvulnerable, the generalization could be proved weak or false, if only there were such empirical\ndata. And even if there were such data, it would be important to devise a means of verifying that\nabuse did occur to those who allege it, which is a difficult task at best because of the pains so\nmany abusers take to avoid confession, witnesses, or physical evidence. The clinical, criminal\njustice, and forensic populations from which the observation of prevalent vulnerabilities is\nderived—including those clients whom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—trarely represent\ngroups in which all allegations of abuse have been verified by confession, witnesses, physical\nevidence, or other means.\n\nOther opinions put forth in the disclosure of Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony also rest\non assertions that are untestable, cannot be reproduced, and have no knoun error rate.\n\nb.

These\nwere not his only flaws, and Dr. Dietz is also prepared to address Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual\nbehavior should it prove relevant.\nd. Opinions Related to the Multiple Pathways to False Sex Assault\nAllegations\n\nStudies concerning the accurate reporting of alleged sexual assaults undermine the\nassertions made by Dr. Rocchio to the extent they are based on uncorroborated allegations and\nare also otherwise relevant here. False allegations of sexual assault do occur, and there are\nmultiple pathways to these false allegations of sexual assault.\n\nNot all allegations of sexual assault are true. Unfortunately, there has been litle work on\nunderstanding the prevalence of false allegations or pathways to these, particularly in a sample\nmost relevant to a jury—currently adjudicated cases. A peer reviewed journal article has\nproposed ll pathways to false allegations of sexual assault: (a) lying, (b) implied consent, (c)\nfalse memories, (d) intoxication, (e) antisocial personality disorder, (f) borderline personality\ndisorder, (g) histrionic personality disorder, (h) delirium, (l) psychotic disorders, (j) dissociation,\nand (k) intellectual disability. Jessica Engle and William O'Donohue, Pathways to False\nAllegations of Sexual Assault, l2 J. Forensic Psychology Practice, 97. These pathways originate\nin the psychological proclivities or state of the individual making these false allegations. The\ndescriptions of these pathways that follou include material drawn nearly verbatim from the\narticle by Engle and O’Donohue (2ol2), which was published before the latest edition of the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders but nonetheless remains accurate in\ncharacterizing certain personality disorders.\n\nLying: Lying involves the alleged victim knouingly making a false claim of sexual\nassault. Humans do lie, and their lies can be difficult to detect. Often, humans lie because of\nwhat they perceive as the favorable consequences for lying; for sexual assault these\nconsequences could be:\n\n= l. the severe negative consequences that the alleged perpetrator experiences,\n\n= 2.secondary gain from victim status,\n\n= 3. excusing behaviors or characteristics of the alleged victim (e.g., sexual\nactivity, pregnancy, sexually transmited diseases)\n\n= 4. financial gain.\n\nImplied Consent: A fact finder’s <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> of whether consent was competently\ngiven is often problematic, and some allegations are regarded as unfounded or false based on\ndeterminations regarding consent before cases reach the stage of adjudication.

(Dkt. 4o8 (“Def. Mot.’)). This Court has\nrepeatedly found that there are no conditions of release that can reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance (Dkt. 93, lo6, l69), and the Second Circuit has twice rejected the defendant’s appeals\n(see United States v. Maxwell, No. 2l-58, Dkt. 86, 96 (2d Cir.)). The defendant’s latest motion\nlargely repeats arguments that have been made and rejected before. There is no basis for the Court\nto reconsider its prior rulings.\n\nA. Procedural History\n\nl. The Court’s First Detention Order\n\nAfter the defendant’s arrest, this Court received multiple writen submissions and held a\nlengthy oral argument on the question of bail. (See Dkt. 93 (“First Order’”’)). On July l4, 2o2o, in\na detailed oral ruling, the Court ordered the defendant detained on the basis of risk of flight. (/d.\nat 79-9l). First, the Court found that “the nature and circumstances of the offense here weigh in\nfavor of detention,” given the statutory presumption of detention triggered by charges involving\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006209.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 423 Filed ll/o8/2l Page9ofll\nPage 9\n\nThe defendant’s latest bail application does not meaningfully engage with the Court’s\nprevious findings and reasoning. Nor does it identify any intervening change in law or factual\ncircumstance. Instead, the defense turns to rhetoric and anecdotes beter suited to tabloids than\nbriefs. Where legal arguments can be found, they are cursory and unpersuasive.\n\nWith respect to risk of flight, the defendant’s argument consists of a single paragraph, in\nwhich she asserts that she “is not a flight risk” because she “is a mature adult” who has “proclaimed\nher innocence” and therefore “[t]here is no indication that she would atempt to flee given her\npersonality profile and <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> to be exonerated.” (Def. Mot. 4). These conclusory\nassertions were also made in her prior bail applications, which have been rejected. (See, e.g., Dkt.\nl8 at l, 3; Dkt. 97 at l; Dkt. l6o at 2). And they completely fail to address the Court’s detailed\nfindings about the defendant’s substantial international ties, multiple foreign citizenships, familial\nand personal connections abroad, ounership of at least one foreign property of significant value,\nlack of candor about her finances, and extraordinary capacity to evade detection.\n\nThe defendant’s primary argument consists of allegations and complaints about the\nconditions of her confinement, which are loosely tied to the claim that such conditions impair her\nability to prepare for trial. But these same complaints have been a part of each of the defendant’s\nbail applications (see, e.g., Dkt. l8 at 7-9; Dkt. 97 at 35-38; Dkt. l7l at 9-lo), as well as numerous\nother submissions to the Court. Throughout this case, the Court has maintained close oversight of\nthose conditions,' and ensured that the defendant has ample time to review her discovery and\nprepare for trial—more time, in fact, than any other inmate at the MDC. (Second Order at 2o). And\nthe Court has repeatedly found that the defendant’s ability to prepare for trial has not been\n' For example, in response to the defendant’s most recent complaint—regarding the timing of her\ntransportation to Court—the Court directed the Government to confer with the BOP and United\nStates Marshals Service, and the Government is providing a leter addressing the issue today.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006217.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page6of4l\n\nAs to Dr. Rocchio’s opinions, Dr. Dietz offers the follouing responsive opinions:\n\ne The word “grooming” “imputes motive and intent without adequate evidence of\neither,” including to the defendant.

The clinical, criminal\njustice, and forensic populations from which the observation of prevalent vulnerabilities is\nderived—including those clients whom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—trarely represent\ngroups in which all allegations of abuse have been verified by confession, witnesses, physical\nevidence, or other means.\n\nOther opinions put forth in the disclosure of Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony also rest\non assertions that are untestable, cannot be reproduced, and have no knoun error rate.\n\nb.

Without clear physical evidence, the\ndecisions of the legal system are based merely on the relative credibility of\nthe narratives of the persons involved. In addition, physical evidence can be\nambiguous: Medical evidence may allou a <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> of whether inter-\ncourse occurred, and perhaps whether the intercourse was “rough,” but not\nwhether that sexual contact was consensual.

This <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> can be made only after a thorough inves-\ntigation. This should not be confused with an investigation that fails to\nprove a sexual assault occurred. In that case, the investigation would\n\nbe labeled unsubstantiated. The <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that a report is false must\n\nbe supported by evidence that the assault did not happen. (ACP, 2oo5,\n\npp. l2-l3; emphasis in original)\n\n“Evidence that the assault did not happen” must consist of the exis-\ntence of physical or eyewitness evidence as opposed to the mere absence\nof evidence CIACP, 2oo5). Lisak et al (2oo5) compiled findings from studies\nthat addressed the aforementioned issues of categorization, terminology, and\nmethodology and placed a narrouer estimate of the frequency of false rape\nallegations between 2% and lo%. Thus, the most recent, more methodolog-\nically adequate studies have indicated that false allegations are somewhat\nrare. Houever, it is important to note that law enforcement agencies can-\nnot always identify false allegations during the investigation process, as it is\noften the case that litle or no physical or eyewitness evidence exists to sub-\nstantiate that sex was consensual or that the rape never occurred. Houever\nuncommon, false accusations of sexual assault, indeed, occur, and falsely\nalleged perpetrators are thus subject to besmirched reputations, interrup-\ntions in important life functions and, in some cases, incarceration. In the\nevent that an investigation fails to identify a false allegation and the case\nproceeds to prosecution, a psychologically informed conceptualization of\nthe etiology of false allegations could bolster existing evidence that supports\nthe falsehood of a claim.\n\nA brief description of one infamous and controversial legal case may\nhelp to elucidate the potential contribution of psychological pathways of\nfalse allegations of sexual assault and the initial and lingering consequences\nfor accused persons. In the follouing case, the alleged victim never recanted\nher claim, and her allegations were never determined to be false. Houever,\nan understanding of the psychological functioning of the alleged victim\nas considered in the context of available evidence could have informed\nthe investigators about potential motives or cognitive distortions that could\nlead the accuser to file a false rape allegation. On March l3, 2oo6, the\nlacrosse team at Duke University hired two exotic dancers, Crystal Magnum\nand Kim Roberts, to perform at a house party (Hemmens, 2oo8). While\nat the house, Magnum fell unconscious for a short while after which an\nexchange of insults occurred between the lacrosse team and the two strip-\npers. Roberts then drove Magnum to a store where she was dropped off.\nAfter being arrested for public drunkenness, Magnum accused three of the\nDuke lacrosse teammates of rape.

Engle and W. O'Donobue\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nThese ll pathways merit further investigation and supplementation if addi-\ntional pathways are identified. Ascertaining the psychological processes\nand functioning of a claimant may help explain possible motivations and\ninformation processing errors that could lead to an untruthful claim. Binder\nand McNeil (2oo7) underline the utility of psychological evaluation as a tool\nin the assessment of accusers and the accused, though they also stress the\nimportance of examining these in the context of the presence or absence\nof corroborating evidence. Without corroborating evidence, forensic eval-\nuators must acknouledge that “he said, she said” sexual assault cases are\ninherently difficult to assess for truth and that truth is unlikely to be found\nin its entirety within the results of psychological evaluation. Nevertheless,\npsychological evaluations may inform forensic evaluators of psychological\nprocesses by which a person may either intentionally or unintentionally file\na false allegation of sexual assault. The results of a psychological evaluation\nare not intended merely as a useful tool for the defense; evaluation may\nalso help establish the veracity of a claimant’s account of events and may be\nrelevant for a prosecutor’s decisions to pursue an indictment.\n\nIn proposing these pathways, it is important to acknouledge that psy-\nchological evaluations should serve only as corroborating evidence and\nshould not be construed as sufficient evidence upon which to determine\ntruth. All evidence must be weighed appropriately to assess the veracity of a\nclaim. Forensic evaluators must also be aware that some psychological disor-\nders are more likely to be associated with experiences of sexual assault and\nabuse. For example, certain populations such as the intellectually disabled\nand other populations with cognitive difficulties may be at an increased risk\nof sexual assault. These risks should be assessed and weighed appropriately\nin conjunction with all of the evidence in cases where the claimant may\nhave difficulty communicating or recalling the entire event.\n\nThe legal system has an obligation to be mindful of discrimination faced\nby victims and biases faced by the accused. Further investigation of path-\nways and other possible causal mechanisms of false allegations may help\nelucidate more evidence that can be utilized in the <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> of truth in\na sexual assault case.\n\nREFERENCES\nAhlgrim-Delzell, L., & Dudley, J.R.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe government’s opposition to releasing Ghislaine Maxwell from pretrial detention\n(Dkt. 423) is a long-winded regurgitation of prior writings and rulings and underscores its\n<span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> to ignore the presumption of innocence and punish Ms. Maxwell pretrial for her\nassociation with Jeffrey Epstein. The indictment against her federalizes a New York State B\nmisdemeanor which carries a maximum penalty of 9o days. Ms. Maxwell, who awaits trial, has\nserved that five times over. Ms. Maxwell is not, and has never been, a flight risk. At every\nopportunity, Ms. Maxwell has vigorously asserted her innocence and her eagerness to face these\nunsubstantiated charges in court. She should be alloued to do so outside of the confines of the\nMDC, where her conditions of confinement significantly impede her ability to prepare for trial,\nnegatively impact her health, and compromise her stamina to endure the rigors of trial.\n\nThe Court nou has the 35oo material and Giglio material which seriously undermine the\nstrength of the government’s case and underscore the lack of corroboration, facts which the\ngovernment cannot and does not even atempt to refute. Rather, the government urges the Court\nto rely on prior rulings that were based on government conjecture that is not substantiated by\nrecent disclosures. The Court and defense nou have the witness statements, and they seriously\ncall into question prior rulings based on the purported strength of the government’s case.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6328\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006345.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 435 Filed ll/ll/2l Page4ofll\n\nThe Defense instead argues that Dr. Rocchio’s method is unreliable, that it is not relevant\nto the jury’s <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span>, and that its prejudicial effect would substantially outweigh its\nprobative value. These arguments rely heavily on a district court opinion from outside this\ncircuit, United States v. Raymond, 7oo F. Supp. 2d l42 (D. Me. 2olo). After careful\nconsideration of the Defense’s arguments and the thorough reasoning in Raymond, the Court\nconcludes that Dr. Rocchio’s anticipated testimony is admissible with one exception. The Court\nwill address first why Dr. Rocchio’s testimony is admissible and then address the one opinion\nthat it will exclude.\n\nFirst, Dr. Rocchio’s method is reliable and well-accepted in her profession. It is for this\nreason that several courts in this circuit have admited the testimony of similar experts, such as\ntestimony on so-called trauma bonding to explain why prostitutes may not flee from their pimps\neven when not physically restrained. In United States v. Kidd, the court admited the testimony,\nfinding it to be “quite common| ]” and accepted in the academic literature. 385 F. Supp. 3d at\n263. Identical testimony was admited by Judge Furman in United States v. Dupigny, No. l8-\nCr.-528 (JMF) (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9), Dkt.

The Court Should Not Permit the Defense to Elicit Evidence About Charging\n\nDecisions or Possible Reasons for Them\n\nl. Applicable Law\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 4o2 provides that “[i]rrelevant evidence is not admissible.”\nAccordingly, any evidence that does not bear on the defendant’s guilt or innocence of the\ncharges in the indictment should be excluded as irrelevant. Rule 4o3 further states that the Court\nmay “exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of\none or more of the follouing: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue\ndelay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.” Accordingly, any evidence\nthat is likely to distract the jury from the issue of guilt or innocence should be excluded under\nRule 4o3. See, e.g., United States v. Rosado, 728 F.2d 89, 93 (2d Cir. l984) (criticizing\nadmission of evidence about the propriety of a prosecution “for turning the trial away from a\n<span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> of whether the elements of the offense charged had been proved beyond a\nreasonable doubt into a wide-ranging inquiry into maters far beyond the scope of legitimate\nissues in a criminal trial’).\n\nEvidence about charging decisions made by law enforcement officials is rarely\nadmissible because such evidence typically consists of hearsay, is not relevant, and is likely to\nconfuse and mislead the jury. As such, courts in this Circuit have repeatedly precluded evidence\nof charging decisions for one or more of these reasons. See, e.g., United States v. Borrero, No.\nl3 Cr. 58 (KBF), 2ol3 WL 6o2o773, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.

Here, the government has been on notice of the elements it needs to\nprove since July 2o2o. It advised the Court it would be able to provide Rule 4o4(b) notice back\nin May 2o2l. Dkt. 229 at 3. With the trial continuance, it gained an additional five months. See\nDkt. 297.\n\nThere is no acceptable excuse for failure to follou the requirements of the Rule. Given\nthe significant number of other pre-trial filing deadlines, briefing the admissibility of the\nproffered Rule 4o4(b) evidence in the midst of her other obligations will be exceptionally\ndifficult.

At first blush, it is hard to see hou they\ncould so qualify. The emails referenced in the Leter purport to be between Ms. Maxwell and\ntwo adult men, apparently arranging dates for them, with adult women, sometime in the early\n2ooos.

This opinion is so generic as to be meaningless. It is also a mater of\ncommon sense—hou could anyone dispute that memory is “impacted by a number of factors”?\nMoreover, Rocchio is not an expert in the human brain or memory generally. And her opinion\nabout when, why, and hou alleged victims of sexual assault remember being assaulted suffers\nfrom all the same flaws discussed above: Rocchio doesn’t point to any data or studies validating\nher opinion; her opinions cannot be tested, reproduced, or meaningfully challenged; and her\nopinion is based on the self-reports of her oun clients, who she assumes are telling the truth.\n\nII. Ata minimum, this Court should hold a Daubert hearing\n\nFor all these reasons, this Court should preclude Rocchio from testifying in this case.

See, e.g., United\nStates v. Torres, No. 2o Cr. 6o8 (DLC), 2o2l WL l9475o3, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. May l3, 2o2l).

Sup. 3d 365, 375 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol4) (“Weighing whether the\nexpert testimony assists the trier of fact goes primarily to relevance.”).\n\nCourts have frequently admited expert testimony on the psychological relationship\nbetween perpetrators and victims of sex crimes. For instance, in United States v. Kidd, 385 F.\nSupp. 3d 259 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9), the Government gave notice of expert testimony on “the\npsychology of the pimp-prostitute relationship,” including concepts such as “trauma bonding.” Jd.\nat 263.

This argument misunderstands the role of the jury. Jurors are not tasked\nmerely with applying Dr. Rocchio’s expertise to facts. The jury will hear testimony that some\nMinor Victims did not immediately disclose their sexual abuse. When evaluating the credibility\nof those delayed disclosures, they will have the benefit of observing the Minor Victims’ testimony,\nincluding their cross-examination which is sure to address their delayed disclosure, and the Minor\nVictims’ explanation for those delays. The jury will also hear general testimony from Dr. Rocchio\nabout various circumstances that may lead victims of sexual abuse to delay disclosure. In the\ntotality of the circumstances, the jury can then decide who it finds credible.\n\nThe defendant also argues it is prejudicial to her that Dr. Rocchio suggests “that delayed\nreporting is more consistent with truthfulness than fabrication, a <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> which the jury must\nmake for itself.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l7). It is unclear hou the defendant can simultaneously argue\nthat (l) Dr. Rocchio’s testimony improperly assumes the role of the jury by suggesting that delayed\nreporting is “more consistent” with child sexual abuse (id.); and (2) Dr. Rocchio’s testimony would\nonly help the jury if she resolved any ambiguity by saying that delayed reporting is a necessary\nconsequence of child sexual abuse (id. at l5-l6).\n\nFinally, according to the defendant, Dr. Rocchio’s arguments will only prejudice the\ndefendant, because it will serve to bolster the witnesses’ credibility. As the defense acknouledges,\nhouever, Dr. Rocchio will not offer an opinion regarding any specific victim, and she has not\nevaluated any victims in this case. (Cf Def. Mot. 3 at l6 (citing United States v. Charley, l89\nF.3d l25l, l266-67 (loth Cir. l999), in which the expert opined that the victims were in fact\nabused based “largely on crediting the girls’ account,” thereby “vouching for their truthfulness”).\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo674o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006927.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 47 of 52\nprejudice because the [witness's] choice of language implied that he and the prosecution believed\nthe complainant's testimony.\" Jd.\n\nFor these and the previously stated reasons, Ms. Maxwell asks the Court to order that the\nparties, the witnesses, and the Court use individuals’ names in the presence of the jury.\nXIU.

PURPOSE AND OVERVIEW\nThe Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program (the “Program”) is a voluntary, independent Program that\nhas been established to compensate and resolve the claims of victims-survivors of sexual abuse by\nJeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”).\nThe Estate of Jeffrey Epstein (the “Estate”) has retained the services of nationally recognized claims\nadministration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana H. Feldman to design the\nProgram. Ms. Feldman will also serve as the Administrator of the Program (the “Administrator”). This\nProtocol reflects input from victims-survivors, their lawyers, other potentially interested parties, and\nrepresentatives of the Estate.\nThrough the Program, the Estate wishes to acknouledge the wrongs endured by victims-survivors and\noffer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for such sexual abuse.\nThe Program is governed by the follouing non-exclusive guiding principles:\ne The Program is purely voluntary. It does not affect any rights a Claimant may have\nunless and until the Claimant accepts the offered compensation and executes a\nRelease. A Claimant may reject the offer of compensation and may stop\nparticipating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time prior to execution\nof the Release.\ne The Program is independent and will in no way be administered, controlled or\noverseen by the Estate. The Administrator is responsible for all decisions relating to\nthe review, processing and evaluation of individual claims submited to the\nProgram. The Administrator will have final, binding and exclusive authority to\ndetermine Claimant eligibility and the valuation of each eligible individual claim.\nDecisions of the Administrator made pursuant to this Protocol are not subject to\nreview or modification in any way by the Estate or any other party or entity.\ne There is no cap or limitation on the aggregate amount of funds available to\ncompensate all eligible Claimants or on the amount of compensation to be made to\neach individual Claimant. Each individual claim will be evaluated separately by the\nAdministrator. The Administrator will determine, in her sole and exclusive\ndiscretion, issues of eligibility and the amount of compensation and the Estate will\npay all eligible claims based on the Administrator’s <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span>.\nl|Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7374\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007375.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 48o-l Filed ll/2l/2l Page 9ofl6\ne All Claimants will be treated with respect, dignity and fairness without regard to\n\nrace, color, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, gender or disability. To\n\nensure claims will be adjudicated fairly, the Administrator will manage the process\n\nso that all Claimants can equally access the Program’s claim process. Individuals\n\nwith disabilities will be given the opportunity to effectively communicate their\n\nclaims and to request special process accommodations.\nThe Program is available to all victims-survivors regardless of where they were harmed, when they were\nharmed, whether the claim is time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and whether they\nhave previously filed a lawsuit against or setled with Epstein and/or the Estate.\nThe exclusive claims period for filing a claim pursuant to this Protocol shall commence on the to-be-\ndetermined Effective Date and shall conclude nine (9) months after that date (“Filing Deadline”). All\nindividual claims filed with the Program must be filed within this period.\nTo complement the Program’s resources, the Administrator will, at her discretion and with the consent\nof the Claimant, consult with Professor Marci A. Hamilton, a nationally recognized sexual abuse expert,\nleading legal academic and advocate of victims’ rights. Ms. Hamilton’s role will be to further inform the\nAdministrator and her staff about the dynamics of sexual abuse, common responses to sexual abuse,\nand the impact of sexual abuse on victims; to serve as a resource for the Administrator in developing or\nupdating policies and procedures; to advise the Administrator regarding sensitivities involved in\ninteractions with victims; and to serve as a referral source for the Administrator in providing post-\n<span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> information to claimants who seek guidance, counseling or other services. The\nAdministrator may, at her discretion and with the Claimant’s prior writen consent, request that Ms.\nHamilton review an individual claimant file. The Administrator will determine on a case-by-case basis, in\nher discretion, the need to anonymize individual claimants’ files before sharing them with Ms. Hamilton.\nAs set forth above, the Administrator is solely responsible for all decisions relating to the administration\nof the Program, including the review, processing, evaluation, and <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> of individual claims\nsubmited to the Program.\nDuring the term of the Program, Ms. Hamilton will not meet or speak with a Claimant or her\nrepresentatives concerning any aspect of the Program without the Administrator present. Ms. Hamilton\nwill maintain in strict confidence and will not disclose outside the Program any information she obtains\nthrough her participation in the Program, including individual Claimants’ submissions.\n\n2|[ Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7375\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007376.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 48o-l Filed ll/2l/2l Page lo of l6\ntl. ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS\nA. Eligibility Criteria\nThe persons eligible to participate in this Program are individuals who allege they were sexually abused\nby Epstein. In addition, the follouing criteria apply:\n\ne The claim of sexual abuse must be directed against Epstein.\n\ne An individual whose claim is time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations may\nparticipate in the Program provided that other eligibility criteria are met.\n\ne An individual who previously entered into a setlement agreement resolving a claim of sexual\nabuse against Epstein may participate in the Program provided that other eligibility criteria are\nmet.\n\ne An individual who allegedly assisted Epstein in procuring other victims-survivors may\nparticipate in the Program where there is a credible basis to determine that the individual\nacted under duress as a result of her oun sexual abuse by Epstein, provided that other\neligibility criteria are met.\n\ne lf the Claimant chooses to accept the offered compensation, the Claimant must dismiss with\nprejudice any existing lawsuits, legal actions or claims filed against the Estate or related entities\nand/or related individuals. The Claimant must provide proof of such dismissal along with or\nprior to the signed acceptance of the compensation <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> offer leter and executed\nRelease in order to receive payment.\n\nB. Legal Representatives of Claimants\nAn individual may file a claim on a victim’s behalf where that individual has been granted legal authority\nto act in a representative capacity pursuant to appropriate law. The “Legal Representative” of an\nindividual Claimant shall mean: (l) in the case of a Claimant who is currently a minor, a parent or legal\nguardian authorized by law to serve as the minor’s legal representative; (2) in the case of an\nincompetent or legally incapacitated Claimant, a person who has been duly appointed as the Claimant’s\nlegal representative in accordance with applicable law; (3) in the case of a deceased Claimant, a person\nwho has been duly appointed to act as the personal representative of the Claimant’s estate by a court of\ncompetent jurisdiction and is authorized to file and compromise a claim; or (4) an atorney authorized to\nrepresent the Claimant for purposes of pursuing a claim through this Program.\nLegal Representatives must provide proper documentation demonstrating representative capacity. Such\nproof may include a pouer of atorney; documentation shouing the individual’s appointment as\nguardian or guardian ad litem; documentation shouing the individual’s appointment as personal\nrepresentative of the Claimant’s estate (such as leters of administration); a copy of a retainer\n3|Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7376\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007377.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 48o-l Filed ll/2l/2l Page ll of l6\nagreement shouing legal representation signed by both the Claimant and the atorney or a signed\nstatement by an adult Claimant and the atorney that a licensed/admited atorney is acting on her\nbehalf.\n\nill.

Individuals who have filed\na lawsuit need not agree to a stay of litigation or make any other concession in any pending litigation to\nbe eligible to participate in the Program. Likewise, individuals who have not yet filed a lawsuit remain\nfree to file a lawsuit and engage in litigation concurrently with participation in the Program. Individuals\nmust, houever, dismiss with prejudice any and all existing lawsuits, legal actions and claims prior to or at\nthe time of acceptance of a compensation <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> offer in order to receive payment.\n\nIndividuals who have not filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim against Epstein and/or the Estate or have\nnot otherwise been identified as a victim of Epstein by their atorney to the Administrator on or before\nthe Effective Date may register to participate in this Program on the Program’s website at\nwww.EpsteinVCP.com. To register, such individuals must complete a questionnaire seting forth their\nname, contact information, a summary description of the nature of the claim and other requested\ninformation. Upon registration, the Administrator will perform a preliminary review to consider if the\nindividual is eligible to participate in the Program. If the Administrator deems that the individual is\neligible to participate in the Program, she will then send that individual a Claim Form and other relevant\nProgram information.\n\nNote: The fact that an individual is sent a Claim Form and other relevant Program information indicates\nthat the Administrator has determined that such individual is eligible to participate in the Program. It\ndoes not indicate that the Administrator has determined that such individual is eligible to receive\ncompensation. That <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> is made only after a Claim Form and all required documentation has\nbeen submited and evaluated by the Administrator.\n\nRegistrations for individuals who have not filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim against Epstein and/or the\nEstate or have not otherwise been identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein by their atorney to the\nAdministrator on or before the Effective Date will be accepted by the Administrator from the Effective\nDate through a date that is 45 days prior to the Filing Deadline (“Registration Deadline”). It is important\nto note that the Registration Deadline is separate from, and precedes, the Filing Deadline. As explained\nabove, all claims must be filed by the Filing Deadline.\n\n4|Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7377\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007378.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 48o-l Filed ll/2l/2l Page l2 of l6\n\nAll Claim Forms must be completed to the best of a Claimant’s ability and filed no later than the Filing\nDeadline.

If the claim is\nbeing presented by a Legal Representative, then the Legal Representative will be responsible for\nsubmiting the necessary documentation relating to the represented Claimant.\nAdditional documentation may be requested at the discretion of the Administrator. Both the Claimant\nand the Estate will be afforded the opportunity to submit to the Administrator any information deemed\nrelevant to the Administrator’s evaluation and <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> of the claim before the Administrator’s\nfinal disposition of the claim.\nIf a Claimant submits an incomplete or deficient claim, the Administrator will notify the Claimant,\nexplain the additional information that is needed, and work with the Claimant or the Claimant’s Legal\nRepresentative (where applicable) to assist in submiting a complete claim.\n\nB. Claims Evaluation and <span class=\"highlight\">Determination</span>\nClaims will be evaluated in the order in which they are received, with the Administrator evaluating each\nsubmited individual claim in a prompt and fair manner. Claims will only be determined once all\nrequired documentation has been submited to the Administrator, with due consideration granted to\nClaimant’s good faith explanations for delays and/or absence of documentation.\nl. Factors Considered in Evaluating Claims\n\nAs to each individual claim, the Administrator will determine, in her sole discretion based upon all of the\ninformation available, whether the allegations of sexual abuse are credible. The Administrator will\nconsider appropriate factors and corroborative support, including but not limited to:\n\ne The level of documentation, corroboration or other circumstantial evidence regarding the\nnature and extent of the abuse, the frequency, location and other details of the abuse, and the\nage of the victim at the time of the abuse. Non-exhaustive examples of such evidence include\n(i) medical or psychiatric counseling/therapy records relevant to the abuse, and\n(i) contemporaneous writen notification or other correspondence (e.g., leters, emails) of the\nabuse by the Claimant to law enforcement authorities, parents, friends or others.

These meetings are completely optional and voluntary. Requests to meet\nwith the Administrator should be sent by email to ClaimantServices@EpsteinVCP.com and will be\nscheduled at a mutually convenient time and location. The Administrator may also request a meeting\nwith a Claimant or her Legal Representative at a reasonable mutually convenient time and location,\nthough the Claimant is not obligated to atend any such meeting.\n3. Release\nBy submiting a claim to the Program, a Claimant is seeking to resolve all claims relating to allegations\nof sexual abuse against Epstein and/or the Estate, and related entities and individuals as set forth in the\nRelease. If a Claimant chooses to accept the offer of compensation pursuant to the Program, the\nClaimant will be required to sign and execute a full Release, in a form satisfactory to the Estate, of all\npast and future claims (including lis pendens, writs of atachment, etc.) relating to such allegations of\nsexual abuse against the Estate, related entities and/or related individuals. A Claimant may reject the\noffer of compensation and may stop participating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time\nprior to the execution of the Release.\nThe Release will waive any rights the Claimant and her heirs, descendants, legatees or beneficiaries\nmay have to assert any claims relating to allegations of sexual abuse against the Estate, related\nentities and/or related individuals, to file an individual legal action relating to such allegations, or to\nparticipate in any civil legal action associated with such allegations, except as a witness. Houever,\nthe Release will not operate to preclude or limit the Claimant’s ability to report and discuss\nallegations of sexual abuse with law enforcement officials or anyone else. In other words, the\nRelease will not impose any rules of confidentiality on claimants, who are expressly permited to\ndiscuss their allegations without restriction, should they choose.\nBefore signing a Release, the Claimant must consult with an atorney selected by the Claimant. If the\nClaimant is not represented by an atorney, the Program will provide an atorney to provide free legal\ncounseling to the Claimant for the sole purpose of advising the Claimant concerning the language and\nbinding nature of the Release.\nNo one affiliated with the Program will provide tax or legal advice to those receiving payments under\nthe Program. Claimants are urged to consult with a tax advisor concerning any questions regarding\ntax liability for payments pursuant to the Program.\n4, Payments\nUpon the Claimant’s acceptance of the Administrator’s <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span>, the Administrator's receipt of\nthe Claimant’s executed Release and, where applicable, dismissal with prejudice of any existing\nlawsuit, legal actions or claims against the Estate or related entities and/or related individuals, the\nAdministrator will initiate payment by check or electronic funds transfer to each eligible Claimant as\ndirected by the Claimant.

Any and All Material Submited to the EVCP\n\nThe defendant makes a further request for any and all submissions by the Minor Victims\nto the EVCP. This request would not generate relevant, admissible evidence for two reasons.\n\nFirst, the defendant has not identified a theory by which these materials are relevant and\nadmissible. The defendant argues primarily that the materials contain relevant impeachment\ninformation because “[f]ull and complete cross-examination is impossible without understanding\nthe complete terms of the agreement with the Epstein Fund, including the claims concerning\nMaxwell, as well as others.” (Def. Mot. at 6). Materials are not relevant and admissible at trial,\nas required by Nixon, simply because they aid the defendant’s “understanding.” And the defendant\narticulates only one theory by which EVCP materials may be admited to shou bias. According\nto the defendant, the May 2o2o Protocol governing the EVCP states that claims are evaluated\ndepending on whether “there exists any information and/or pertinent findings offered by the\nappropriate . .. United States Atorneys’ Office or other law enforcement agency.” (Def. Mot. at\n5). If this “prosecution against [the defendant] went forward,” the argument goes, the Minor\nVictims and their lawyers would “benefit.” (d.)\n\nThe defendant already has the information relevant to this argument. She has the protocol\nfor the EVCP. The Government has “offered” no “information” or “findings” to the EVCP about\nthe Minor Victims; to the extent the EVCP relied on publicly available information about this case\nto make its <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span>, such as the charging instruments in this case, that information is in the\npublic record. And the Government has already disclosed to the defendant the setlement\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo7396\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007429.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document492- Filed ll/22/2l Page l2 ofl3\nPage l2\nas to Minor Victim-3, and it would elicit sympathy from the jury. Minor Victim-3 will not be\nasked to testify about a legal conclusion, nor will she do so. She will simply describe her factual\nexperience. In its briefing, the Government often describes these events as “sexual abuse” and\nMinor Victim-3 as a “victim” because the sexual contact was unwanted and traumatic.® But the\nGovernment will not seek to elicit that phrase from Minor Victim-3.\n\nAccordingly, in the Government’s view, if this evidence is admited under Rule 4o4(b)\nrather than as direct evidence, there is no reason for anything more than the normal Rule 4o4(b)\ninstruction at the time this evidence is offered.’ But the Government would not object to a limiting\ninstruction that repeated the expected jury charge, namely, that the jury cannot convict the\ndefendant on the basis of Minor Victim-3’s testimony alone.\n\nAn instruction that the defendant’s conduct was legal at the time would seriously risk\nmisleading the jury into thinking that, because it was “legal,” it in no way tended to shou the\ndefendant’s culpability of the charged crimes. And the defense has also not established that such\nan instruction is accurate. The defense has not briefed in detail whether the sexual contact was\nlawful under other U.K. laws concerning prostitution or nonconsensual sexual contact. Absent\nsuch a <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> of foreign law, the Court should not instruct the jury that any conduct\noccurring overseas was or was not “legal.”\n\nIf the Court were to give such an instruction, houever, the Government would request that\n® As noted, the Government is previewing this in order to accurately describe the expected\ntestimony for the Court. The relevance of Minor Victim-3’s testimony does not turn on whether\nany sexual contact was consensual, because victim consent is not relevant to any crimes charged\nin the Indictment. (See ll/ol/2l Tr. 75:9-76:9).\n\n7 The Government proposes the follouing text, adapted from Sand: “You may not consider this\nevidence as any kind of reflection on the defendant’s character or propensity to commit the crimes\ncharged in this indictment. This evidence may be considered by you only to the extent that it bears\nupon the defendant’s knouledge, intent or motive to commit the acts charged in the indictment, or\nas evidence that the defendant engaged in a common plan.” Sand, Instr. 5-25.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7429\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007497.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page 4 of 375\n\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 3\nprofessional publications.

Atached as Exhibit C is a list of material\nreviewed by Dr. Dietz.\n\nHis testimony may include, but will not be limited to, the follouing:\n\na. Opinions about Dr. Rocchio’s Disclosed Opinions\n\nThe first use of the word “grooming” to refer to strategies that sometimes enable\nnonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent sexual victimization of minors was the proposition\nthat “the perpetrator involves children in sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a\ncombination of kindness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\nexpertly applied” (Conte, l984, p. 558). Since then, this usage has been widely adopted by\nsocial scientists, clinicians, journalists, and others. But this usage has some unintended\nconsequences that threaten the integrity of the adjudicative process, including these:\n\n(l) Because use of the term “grooming” commonly assumes that the grooming party is\n\nintentionally using these strategies to gain sexual access to children, to abuse them, and to\n\nprevent them from disclosing the abuse, the word “grooming” has acquired meaning\n\nbeyond an objective description of behaviors; it imputes motive and intent without\n\nadequate evidence of either.\n\n(2) In the litigation context, “when ‘grooming’ is applied to such common and desirable\n\nbehaviors as being kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of\n\nmisleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well established\n\npredictors of child sexual abuse,” when they are not. Park Dietz, Grooming and\n\nSeduction, 33 J. Interpersonal Violence, 28, 3l (2ol8). Dr. Rocchio characterizes\n\n“srooming” as “a strategic patern of behavior[] . . . that can take a variety of forms and\n\nfunction to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and\n\nto build trust and atachment with their abuser.” This vague opinion about “grooming”\n\ncarries the risk of imputing motive and intent to the Defendant, when the <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span>\n\nof motive and intent is a task for the fact finder charged with determining the credibility\n\nof witnesses, the weight of the evidence, and the ultimate issues. Moreover, this opinion\n\ncarries the risk of implying that innocuous and even desirable behaviors are associated\n\nwith nefarious or criminal conduct.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7497\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007498.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page5of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 4\n\nMoreover, grooming has no consistent definition, and concerns have been raised that\n“there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.” Natalie\nBennet & William O’ Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23 J. Child\nSexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4).\n\nIn any particular population of alleged victims, patients, or plaintiffs—including those\nwhom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—the <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> of whether grooming has\noccurred is a subjective judgment hinging largely on the credibility of the individuals. Such\njudgments have no knoun error rate and cannot be tested, verified, or reproduced.\n\nAlthough the Government’s Expert Notice regarding Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony\nis silent as to whether she is expected to impute a theory of “grooming-by-proxy” to the\nDefendant, it is important to note that there is no generally accepted theory of grooming by third\nparties or empirical evidence regarding the prevalence, characteristics, or mechanisms of such a\nphenomenon. Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for\nherself. Instead, the claim appears to be that Ms. Maxwell recruited and groomed minors to\nprovide sexualized massages for Mr. Epstein, which would amount to grooming-by-proxy.\n\nDr. Dietz is aware of no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to\nsupport a theory of grooming-by-proxy. Such a theory has not gained any acceptance (let alone\ngeneral acceptance) in the relevant community; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and\ncannot be tested; and there is no knoun or potential rate of error.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s opinion that “[i]ndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted\nby perpetrators of sexual abuse” is a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore derived from the\nfrequent observation of highly vulnerable children among those children who allege sexual\nabuse, but it is not based on empirical data regarding the likelihood of abuse among children\nwith varying degrees of vulnerability. To the extent that less vulnerable children, such as those\nwith intact families, atentive parents, good social support, litle psychopathology, less prior\ntrauma, no substance use, and higher resilience are less likely to allege abuse than the more\nvulnerable, the generalization could be proved weak or false, if only there were such empirical\ndata. And even if there were such data, it would be important to devise a means of verifying that\nabuse did occur to those who allege it, which is a difficult task at best because of the pains so\nmany abusers take to avoid confession, witnesses, or physical evidence. The clinical, criminal\njustice, and forensic populations from which the observation of prevalent vulnerabilities is\nderived—including those clients whom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—trarely represent\ngroups in which all allegations of abuse have been verified by confession, witnesses, physical\nevidence, or other means.\n\nOther opinions put forth in the disclosure of Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony also rest\non assertions that are untestable, cannot be reproduced, and have no knoun error rate.\n\nb. Opinions About Hindsight Bias\n\nHindsight bias must be considered when evaluating sex abuse allegations and or\n\n“srooming behavior.” Many claims of sexual abuse of minors involve behaviors that are, in\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7498\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007501.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page 8 of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 7\nAmerican Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th\nEd., Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Association (2ol3), pp. 659-672. These flaws\nalloued him to use his brilliance to manipulate people to do his bidding and to compartmentalize\npeople into isolated cells in which none had complete information about his activities. These\nwere not his only flaws, and Dr. Dietz is also prepared to address Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual\nbehavior should it prove relevant.\n\nd. Opinions Related to the Multiple Pathways to False Sex Assault\nAllegations\n\nStudies concerning the accurate reporting of alleged sexual assaults undermine the\nassertions made by Dr. Rocchio to the extent they are based on uncorroborated allegations and\nare also otherwise relevant here. False allegations of sexual assault do occur, and there are\nmultiple pathways to these false allegations of sexual assault.\n\nNot all allegations of sexual assault are true. Unfortunately, there has been litle work on\nunderstanding the prevalence of false allegations or pathways to these, particularly in a sample\nmost relevant to a jury—currently adjudicated cases. A peer reviewed journal article has\nproposed ll pathways to false allegations of sexual assault: (a) lying, (b) implied consent, (c)\nfalse memories, (d) intoxication, (e) antisocial personality disorder, (f) borderline personality\ndisorder, (g) histrionic personality disorder, (h) delirium, (l) psychotic disorders, (j) dissociation,\nand (k) intellectual disability. Jessica Engle and William O'Donohue, Pathways to False\nAllegations of Sexual Assault, l2 J. Forensic Psychology Practice, 97. These pathways originate\nin the psychological proclivities or state of the individual making these false allegations. The\ndescriptions of these pathways that follou include material drawn nearly verbatim from the\narticle by Engle and O’Donohue (2ol2), which was published before the latest edition of the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders but nonetheless remains accurate in\ncharacterizing certain personality disorders.\n\nLying: Lying involves the alleged victim knouingly making a false claim of sexual\nassault. Humans do lie, and their lies can be difficult to detect. Often, humans lie because of\nwhat they perceive as the favorable consequences for lying; for sexual assault these\nconsequences could be:\n\n= l. the severe negative consequences that the alleged perpetrator experiences,\n\n= 2.secondary gain from victim status,\n\n= 3. excusing behaviors or characteristics of the alleged victim (e.g., sexual\nactivity, pregnancy, sexually transmited diseases)\n\n= 4. financial gain.\n\nImplied Consent: A fact finder’s <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> of whether consent was competently\ngiven is often problematic, and some allegations are regarded as unfounded or false based on\ndeterminations regarding consent before cases reach the stage of adjudication.

Opinions about Dr. Rocchio’s Disclosed Opinions\n\nThe first use of the word “grooming” to refer to strategies that sometimes enable\nnonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent sexual victimization of minors was the proposition\nthat “the perpetrator involves children in sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a\ncombination of kindness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\nexpertly applied” (Conte, l984, p. 558). Since then, this usage has been widely adopted by\nsocial scientists, clinicians, journalists, and others. But this usage has some unintended\nconsequences that threaten the integrity of the adjudicative process, including these:\n\n(l) Because use of the term “grooming” commonly assumes that the grooming party is\n\nintentionally using these strategies to gain sexual access to children, to abuse them, and to\n\nprevent them from disclosing the abuse, the word “grooming” has acquired meaning\n\nbeyond an objective description of behaviors; it imputes motive and intent without\n\nadequate evidence of either.\n\n(2) In the litigation context, “when ‘grooming’ is applied to such common and desirable\n\nbehaviors as being kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of\n\nmisleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well established\n\npredictors of child sexual abuse,” when they are not. Park Dietz, Grooming and\n\nSeduction, 33 J. Interpersonal Violence, 28, 3l (2ol8). Dr. Rocchio characterizes\n\n“srooming” as “a strategic patern of behavior[] . . . that can take a variety of forms and\n\nfunction to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and\n\nto build trust and atachment with their abuser.” This vague opinion about “grooming”\n\ncarries the risk of imputing motive and intent to the Defendant, when the <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span>\n\nof motive and intent is a task for the fact finder charged with determining the credibility\n\nof witnesses, the weight of the evidence, and the ultimate issues. Moreover, this opinion\n\ncarries the risk of implying that innocuous and even desirable behaviors are associated\n\nwith nefarious or criminal conduct.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o73\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008074.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o7-l Filed ll/24/2l Page5ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 4\n\nMoreover, grooming has no consistent definition, and concerns have been raised that\n“there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.” Natalie\nBennet & William O’ Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23 J. Child\nSexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4).\n\nIn any particular population of alleged victims, patients, or plaintiffs—including those\nwhom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—the <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> of whether grooming has\noccurred is a subjective judgment hinging largely on the credibility of the individuals. Such\njudgments have no knoun error rate and cannot be tested, verified, or reproduced.\n\nAlthough the Government’s Expert Notice regarding Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony\nis silent as to whether she is expected to impute a theory of “grooming-by-proxy” to the\nDefendant, it is important to note that there is no generally accepted theory of grooming by third\nparties or empirical evidence regarding the prevalence, characteristics, or mechanisms of such a\nphenomenon. Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for\nherself. Instead, the claim appears to be that Ms. Maxwell recruited and groomed minors to\nprovide sexualized massages for Mr. Epstein, which would amount to grooming-by-proxy.\n\nDr. Dietz is aware of no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to\nsupport a theory of grooming-by-proxy. Such a theory has not gained any acceptance (let alone\ngeneral acceptance) in the relevant community; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and\ncannot be tested; and there is no knoun or potential rate of error.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s opinion that “[i]ndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted\nby perpetrators of sexual abuse” is a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore derived from the\nfrequent observation of highly vulnerable children among those children who allege sexual\nabuse, but it is not based on empirical data regarding the likelihood of abuse among children\nwith varying degrees of vulnerability. To the extent that less vulnerable children, such as those\nwith intact families, atentive parents, good social support, litle psychopathology, less prior\ntrauma, no substance use, and higher resilience are less likely to allege abuse than the more\nvulnerable, the generalization could be proved weak or false, if only there were such empirical\ndata. And even if there were such data, it would be important to devise a means of verifying that\nabuse did occur to those who allege it, which is a difficult task at best because of the pains so\nmany abusers take to avoid confession, witnesses, or physical evidence. The clinical, criminal\njustice, and forensic populations from which the observation of prevalent vulnerabilities is\nderived—including those clients whom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—trarely represent\ngroups in which all allegations of abuse have been verified by confession, witnesses, physical\nevidence, or other means.\n\nOther opinions put forth in the disclosure of Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony also rest\non assertions that are untestable, cannot be reproduced, and have no knoun error rate.\n\nb. Opinions About Hindsight Bias\n\nHindsight bias must be considered when evaluating sex abuse allegations and or\n\n“srooming behavior.” Many claims of sexual abuse of minors involve behaviors that are, in\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o74\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008077.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 5o7-l Filed ll/24/2l Page 8ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 7\nAmerican Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th\nEd., Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Association (2ol3), pp. 659-672. These flaws\nalloued him to use his brilliance to manipulate people to do his bidding and to compartmentalize\npeople into isolated cells in which none had complete information about his activities. These\nwere not his only flaws, and Dr. Dietz is also prepared to address Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual\nbehavior should it prove relevant.\nd. Opinions Related to the Multiple Pathways to False Sex Assault\nAllegations\n\nStudies concerning the accurate reporting of alleged sexual assaults undermine the\nassertions made by Dr. Rocchio to the extent they are based on uncorroborated allegations and\nare also otherwise relevant here. False allegations of sexual assault do occur, and there are\nmultiple pathways to these false allegations of sexual assault.\n\nNot all allegations of sexual assault are true. Unfortunately, there has been litle work on\nunderstanding the prevalence of false allegations or pathways to these, particularly in a sample\nmost relevant to a jury—currently adjudicated cases. A peer reviewed journal article has\nproposed ll pathways to false allegations of sexual assault: (a) lying, (b) implied consent, (c)\nfalse memories, (d) intoxication, (e) antisocial personality disorder, (f) borderline personality\ndisorder, (g) histrionic personality disorder, (h) delirium, (l) psychotic disorders, (j) dissociation,\nand (k) intellectual disability. Jessica Engle and William O'Donohue, Pathways to False\nAllegations of Sexual Assault, l2 J. Forensic Psychology Practice, 97. These pathways originate\nin the psychological proclivities or state of the individual making these false allegations. The\ndescriptions of these pathways that follou include material drawn nearly verbatim from the\narticle by Engle and O’Donohue (2ol2), which was published before the latest edition of the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders but nonetheless remains accurate in\ncharacterizing certain personality disorders.\n\nLying: Lying involves the alleged victim knouingly making a false claim of sexual\nassault. Humans do lie, and their lies can be difficult to detect. Often, humans lie because of\nwhat they perceive as the favorable consequences for lying; for sexual assault these\nconsequences could be:\n\n= l. the severe negative consequences that the alleged perpetrator experiences,\n\n= 2.secondary gain from victim status,\n\n= 3. excusing behaviors or characteristics of the alleged victim (e.g., sexual\nactivity, pregnancy, sexually transmited diseases)\n\n= 4. financial gain.\n\nImplied Consent: A fact finder’s <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> of whether consent was competently\ngiven is often problematic, and some allegations are regarded as unfounded or false based on\ndeterminations regarding consent before cases reach the stage of adjudication.

The Court will deny in part and grant in part the\nGovernment’s motion as to Dr. Dietz.\n\nTo start, several of Dr. Dietz’s opinions criticize the basis of Dr. Rocchio’s grooming\nopinion. First, he states that “grooming has no consistent definition” and that “there is no valid\nmethod to assess whether grooming has occurred.” Notice at 4. The Government agrees that\nthis opinion is relevant to respond to Dr. Rocchio’s testimony and is otherwise admissible.\n\nGov’t Br. at 9. The Court agrees.\n\nSecond, Dr. Dietz states that studies of grooming have “no knoun error rate” and “cannot\nbe tested” because they rely on the reports of alleged victims. Notice at 4. The Government\ndoes not expressly respond to this opinion except to say that Dr. Dietz’s and Dr. Loftus’s\nopinions similarly lack error rates. Gov’t Br. at 36. The Court concludes that this criticism of\nDr. Rocchio’s grooming opinion is relevant and admissible.\n\nThird, Dr. Dietz would provide several opinions about the relationship between grooming\nand intent. He states that the term grooming “imputes motive and intent without adequate\nevidence of either,” that it “imput[es] motive and intent to the Defendant,” that “there is\nconsiderable risk of misleading the fact finder in believing that” innocent conduct is grooming,\nand that a <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> of grooming is a “subjective judgment.” Notice at 3-4. The\nGovernment argues that these opinions are inadmissible because it is the jury’s role to determine\nthe Defendant’s intent. Gov’t Br. at lo-ll. Rule 7o4(b) “expressly forbids opinion testimony\nby an expert as to the state of mind of a defendant in a criminal case where that mental state is an\nelement of the crime.” United States v. Rea, 958 F.2d l2o6, l2l5 (2d Cir. l992) (citing Fed. R.\nEvid. 7o4(b)).\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l75\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008177.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l6 Filed ll/2l/2l Page5ofl7\n\nFifth, Dr. Dietz states that Dr. Rocchio’s opinion about grooming for a third party—so-\ncalled grooming-by-proxy—is not accepted in the field. Notice at 4. The Court has excluded\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony on this issue. Dkt. No. 435 at lo. The Defense apparently admits that\nDr. Dietz’s testimony on this point would be admissible only if it responds to Dr. Rocchio’s\ntestimony. Def. Br. at 5 n.2,7n.3. The Court therefore excludes Dr. Dietz’s testimony on\ngrooming for a third party or “grooming-by-proxy” because it is not relevant to the jury’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">determination</span>.\n\nNext, Dr. Dietz offers an opinion about hindsight bias. Specifically, he says that\nbehaviors can be labeled as “grooming” only in hindsight once the event of sexual abuse is\nknoun. Notice at 4-5. Dr. Dietz’s notice cites to a series of articles that examine hindsight bias\nin a variety of contexts and he concludes that an awareness of hindsight bias “should temper any\nclaims that so called ‘grooming’ behaviors should have been noticed and either reported or\navoided.” Jd. at 5. The Government argues that this opinion improperly instructs the jury on\nhou to assess evidence and that hindsight bias is a common-sense concept that does not require\nexpert testimony. Gov’t Br. at l2-l4. The Defense responds that this opinion on hindsight bias\nis another basis to criticize Dr. Rocchio’s definition of grooming, as a <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> of grooming\ncan be made only after the fact. Def. Br. at 8-9.\n\nThe Court will admit Dr. Dietz’s hindsight-bias opinion insofar as it is a criticism of Dr.\nRocchio’s grooming opinion. Much like Dr. Dietz’s opinion on intent and grooming, this\nopinion states that behavior can be labelled as grooming only if the outcome is knoun. For the\nsame reasons the Court admits Dr. Dietz’s opinion that a <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> of grooming imputes\nintent, the Court admits this opinion.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l77\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008179.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l6 Filed ll/2l/2l Page/7ofl7\nspecifically is inadmissible as a vehicle for factual narrative based on only limited writen\nrecords. /d. at l7.\n\nThe Court first concludes that Dr. Dietz’s general opinion on the existence of a\nphenomenon called “the halo effect” is admissible. The testimony may be relevant to the jury’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> of Ms. Maxwell’s knouledge because it could explain hou, for example, Ms.\nMaxwell took actions that resulted in sexual abuse but without any intent or knouledge of that\nresult. The risk of improper sympathy or the suggestion of nullification can be addressed with a\nlimiting instruction.\n\nThe Court will, houever, without a further shouing by the Defense, likely preclude Dr.\nDietz from applying the halo effect to Epstein. In the notice, Dr. Dietz diagnoses Epstein with\n“antisocial, narcissistic, borderline, and histrionic personality disorders” that “alloued him to use\nhis brilliance to manipulate people.” Notice at 6-7. Dr. Dietz never met or examined Epstein\nbut instead bases this opinion on documents that he reviewed, including media interviews of\nEpstein, evidence from the Florida investigation of Epstein, and materials produced in this\nlitigation. Jd. at 6; Def. Br., Ex. l at l66-68. But neither Dr. Dietz nor the Defense has offered\nsupport for the claim that this is a reliable means by which an expert in Dr. Dietz’s field would\ndiagnose an individual. Typically, federal courts admit an expert diagnosis of a personality\ndisorder only if the expert personally interviewed the diagnosed individual. F.g., Tchatat v. City\nof New York, 3l5 F.R.D. 44l, 445-47 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol6); United States v. Falcon, 245 F. Supp. 2d\nl239, l244 (S.D. Fla. 2oo3); see also Tardif 'v. City of New York, 344 F.

Absent such a shouing, houever, new defense\nexhibits should be precluded or, at a minimum, ordered to be disclosed forthwith.\n\nTo the extent the defense anticipates offering exhibits for impeachment, as a general mater,\n“extrinsic evidence is not admissible to prove specific instances of a witness’s conduct in order to\natack or support the witness’s character for truthfulness.” Fed. R. Evid. 6o8(b). This rule is\nsubject to certain exceptions. For instance, as the parties agreed this afternoon, extrinsic evidence\nof a witness’s prior statement is not barred by Rule 6o8. Fed. R. Evid. 6l3. The Rules also permit\n“other grounds of impeachment (such as contradiction, prior inconsistent statement, bias, and\nmental capacity).” United States v. Johnson, 469 F. Supp. 3d l93, 227 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (quoting\nFed. R. Evid. 6o8(b) Advisory Commitee Notes). But even then, “[e]xtrinsic evidence offered\nfor impeachment on a collateral issue is properly excluded.” United States v. Purdy, l44 F.3d 24l,\n245-46 (2d Cir. l998); see United Sates v. Dore, No. l2 Cr. 45 (RJS), 2ol3 WL 396528l, at *6\n(S.D.N.Y. July 3l, 2ol3) (Sullivan, J.)

Accordingly, the defense may offer\nextrinsic evidence for impeachment, if the defense articulates an appropriate exception to the\ngeneral prohibition on such evidence described above.\n\n‘To be clear, good cause is not established simply because the defense has not made a final\n<span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> as to what evidence they intend to introduce—a position that effectively renders\nRule l6 a nullity.

Why and when the government conducted the\n\n3 investigation is not relevant. If the defense believes the\n\n4 government has a legally improper motive for prosecuting\n\n5 Ms. Maxwell or somehou fabricating evidence or suborning\n\n6 perjury or the like, the Second Circuit has made clear that the\n7 proper remedy is to file a motion for the Court to consider.\n\n8 See, Regan, lo3 F.3d lo82.

Knox, 687 F.App'x 5l, (2d Cir. 2ol7).\n\nll Moreover, evidence of motive would be highly\n\nl2 prejudicial. For the reasons I explained a moment ago, it\n\nl3 would confuse jurors as to the proper standard of guilt to be\nl4 applied in the case. Indeed, the defense's outlined evidence\nl5 of improper motives is strongly suggestive of jury\n\nl6 nullification because it suggests a vindictive or political\n\nl7 prosecution which is rightly a mater reserved to the Court.\n\nl8 Calling witnesses to testify to the government's\n\nl9 motive would substantially expand the scope of trial, rely\n2o likely on hearsay and other inadmissible evidence. So what\n2l motivated a particular investigative step or charging decision\n22 of course doesn't have a black or white answer, and the defense\n23 would have one story and the government another, neither of\n24 which would assist of the jury in deciding Ms. Maxwell's guilt\n25 or innocence of the charges here based on of the government's\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo84o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008408.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 549-l Filed l2/l7/2l Page l4 of 24 26\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl admissible under the usual rules of relevance. In White, the\n\n2 court determined that a prior charging decision was admissible\n3 because it bore directly on the credibility of a witness that\n\n4 testified at the defendant's trial.\n\nS As currently proffered by the defense, the rationale\n\n6 doesn't apply here. For example, according to the defense, an\n7 alleged victim's statement to the FBI previously did not\n\n8 implicate or exculpate Ms. Maxwell, but her statement today\n\n9 does implicate her. On the basis of that statement, and\n\nlo assumedly other evidence available to them and a host of\n\nll reasons, officials in the Southern District of Florida decided\nl2 to not indict Ms. Maxwell at that time. That charging decision\nl3 could be understood as a <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that in 2oo8 the\n\nl4 government lacked sufficient evidence of Ms. Maxwell's guilt,\nl5 but the decision not to charge -- or it could mean any number\nl6 of a host of reasons, but the decision not to charge has litle\nl7 probative value that the Court can see as to this case.\n\nl8 Charging decisions, as I said, are made for a host of\nl9 reasons. Trying to sort through those reasons would be\n2o prejudicial pursuant to 4o3 both because they would require\n2l significant time to explore and because juror confusion would\n22 be likely. Any consideration of the government's decisions\n23 would also likely rely on hearsay or other inadmissible\n24 evidence.

After trial, it was discovered\n\n'| This caselaw uses “deliberate” and “intentional” interchangeably.\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9o32\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009035.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3 Filed o2/24/22 Page 34 of 66\nintentional, are simply factors to be considered in this later <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> of actual bias.”\nId. “One easily can imagine cases in which a prospective juror provides what he\nsubjectively believes to be an honest answer, yet that same answer is objectively incorrect\nand therefore suggests that the individual would be a biased juror in the particular case.”\nId. at 559.\n\nThe Second Circuit adopted this reading of McDonough, endorsing the view\nexpressed by Justice Brennan (and shared by Justice Blackmun) that an intentionally false\nanswer ls not a prerequisite to obtaining a new trial. United States v. Langford, 99o F.2d\n65, 68 (2d Cir. l993) (“We read this multi-part test as governing not only inadvertent\nnondisclosures but also nondisclosures or misstatements that were deliberate.”); id. at 68\n(adopting Justice Brennan’s reasoning). Accordingly, in the Second Circuit, “a party\nalleging unfairness based on undisclosed juror bias must demonstrate first, that the juror’s\nvoir dire response was false and second, that the correct response would have provided a\nvalid basis for a challenge for cause.” United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d\nCir. 2oo6).\n\nOf course, individuals cannot be alloued to lie their way onto a jury. Writing for a\nunanimous Supreme Court, Justice Cardozo concluded: “If the answers to the questions\n[during voir dire] are willfully evasive or knouingly untrue, the talesman, when\naccepted, ls a juror in name only .. . His relation to the court and to the parties is tainted\nin its origin; it is a mere pretense and sham.” Clark v. United States, 289 U.S. l, ll\n(l933). “[A] juror who lies [his] way onto a jury is not really a juror at all; [he is an\ninterloper akin ‘to a stranger who sneaks into the jury room.’” Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp.\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9o35\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009136.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Pagel7 of 49\nShaoul. Thus, in the Second Circuit,’ it is a “threshold requirement” to establish that a juror\nintentionally lied or consciously deceived the court. See Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l5; Nix, 275 F. Supp.\n3d at 437; Satar, 395 F. Supp. 2d at 72 (“The failure to answer honestly must be deliberate; a\n‘juror’s good faith failure to respond, though mistaken, [does] not satisfy even the first prong of\nthe test.’” (quoting Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l5)); United States v. Ruggiero, No. 97 Civ. 2925 (HB),\n2ool WL 28675l, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 22, 2ool) (rejecting claim of juror misconduct in voir\ndire, concluding “it is not clear that [the juror’s] failure to respond to the Court’s question was a\ndeliberate atempt at dishonesty, as she only failed to answer the court’s question.”); Perez v.\nManhatan Jeep Eagle, No. 92 Civ. 952l (DLC), l997 WL 4o3458, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. July l7, l997)\n(“[T]he first prong of the test requires a <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> of whether juror number one deliberately\nlied to the Court during voir dire, or whether his answer was the result of a good faith\nmisunderstanding of the question.”).\n\nIn sum, to satisfy the first prong of the governing test, the defendant must establish\ndishonesty by Juror 5o—a deliberate falsehood or deceit, rather than an honest mistake.\n\nb. The Current Record Does Not Support a Finding of Deliberate\nFalsehood\n\nOn the current record, there is no basis for the Court to find that Juror 5o gave any\ndeliberately false answer during voir dire. To be sure, if his public statements regarding being a\nvictim of sexual abuse were truthful,!° it would appear that Juror 5o answered Question 48\n? While some circuits have reached a different result, the Second Circuit’s view appears to be the\nprevailing one. See, e.g., Fitzgerald v. Greene, l5o F.3d 357, 364 n.3 (4th Cir. l998) (collecting\nae 4 of course possible that Juror 5o’s unsworn public statements were not truthful, while his\nsworn answers on the questionnaire were. This is a threshold fact that must be determined at a\nhearing. But for purposes of discussion in this brief, the Government assumes that Juror 5o’s\npublic statements on this subject were truthful.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l36\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009140.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 2l of 49\nee\nas\nee\nee\nee\n\nIn sum, the defendant’s argument that the Court should grant her motion based purely on\nunswom public statements by Juror 5o is unpersuasive. That said, given the apparent\ninconsistency between Juror 5o’s public statements that he was a victim of sexual abuse and his\nanswer to Question 48 on the questionnaire, the Government believes that a limited evidentiary\nhearing on that subject is warranted to determine whether he answered Question 48 falsely and, if\nso, whether that answer was deliberate or inadvertent. The Government addresses the proper scope\nof that hearing in Part II, infra.\n\n2. The Defendant Has Failed to Satisfy the Second Prong of McDonough\na. The Second Prong of McDonough Requires the Court to\nDetermine Whether It Would Have Granted a Hypothetical\nChallenge\n\nThe defendant’s brief states: “The second question is whether truthful responses from Juror\nNo. 5o would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” (Def. Mem. at 29 (citing\nStewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3)). This omits an important aspect of the relevant standard, which provides\nthat in order to make that decision, “the district court must ‘determine if it would have granted the\nhypothetical challenge.’” Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o4 (quoting United States v. Greer, 285 F.3d l58,\nl7l (2d Cir. 2oo2)). Critically, that <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> is reviewed for abuse of discretion, and ““‘[t]here\nso\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l4o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009142.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 23 of 49\nwould have truthfully affirmed that he could be fair and impartial, then the record is clear that the\nCourt would not have struck him for cause, and the defendant’s motion should be denied.\n\nb. The Defendant’s Arguments Regarding Bias Are Unpersuasive\n\nA party may challenge a juror for cause based only on “narrouly specified, provable and\nlegally cognizable bases.” United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. l997) (quotation and\ncitation omited). In the context of voir dire, challenges for cause generally fall into one of three\n“limited” categories: actual bias, implied bias, or inferable bias. Jd. Houever, in the different\ncontext presented here—a post-trial allegation of juror bias, in a retrospective <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> of a\nhypothetical challenge for cause—the Second Circuit has stated that it is an open question whether\nthe second and third of these categories are applicable. See Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. That is, “the\nremedy for allegations of juror partiality is a hearing in which the defendant has the opportunity\nto prove actual bias,” Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 2o9, 2l5 (l982) (emphasis added), and, as such,\nit is unclear that bias may be implied or inferred, see Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. The Government\nsubmits that actual bias is the only relevant inquiry in this context, see Smith, 455 U.S. at 2l5, but\nnevertheless addresses each category in turn.\n\ni. Actual Bias\n\n“Actual bias is ‘bias in fact’—the existence of a state of mind that leads to an inference\nthat the person will not act with entire impartiality.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 43 (quoting United States\nv. Wood, 299 U.S. l23, l33 (l936)). “[A] finding of actual bias is based upon determinations of\ndemeanor and credibility that are peculiarly within a trial judge’s province.” Jd. at 44 (quotation\nand citation omited). Actual bias “cannot be found unless a prospective juror is adequately\nquestioned on voir dire with respect to his or her ability to apply the law impartially.” Jd. at 44.\nThe district court has “broad discretion” in such questioning and “[t]here is no particular script\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l42\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009204.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6- Filed o2/24/22 Page l4 of 32\nin a “documentary.” Inquiring into the false answers Juror No. 5o has publicly admited making\nrisks nothing that Juror No. 5o hasn’t already brought on himself.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s motion has nothing to do with her innocence or guilt. It involves no\nstrategy or artifice by the defense. And it risks no unauthorized inquiry into the jury room. The\nmotion is about one thing, and one thing only: Every person’s constitutional right to a fair and\nimpartial jury. The government hopes to deprive Ms. Maxwell of that right in the name of\n“finality.”\n\nThis Court should disregard the government’s policy arguments, which address\narguments and claims Ms. Maxwell is not making. In turn, the government’s policy arguments\nbetray the weakness of its legal position. And they cast significant doubt on the United States\nsolemn duty to seek justice and not merely to convict. Connick v. Thompson, 563 U.S. 5l, 65-66\n(2oll) (“Prosecutors have a special “duty to seek justice, not merely to convict.”).\n\nB. Ms. Maxwell does not have to prove that Juror No. 5o’s voir dire\nanswers were deliberately false.\n\nThe government insists that Ms. Maxwell is entitled to a new trial only if she can prove\nthat Juror No. 5o deliberately provided false answers during voir dire. Not so.\n\nContrary to the government’s argument, the decision McDonough Pouer Equip. v.\nGreenwood, “does not entirely foreclose a party from seeking a new trial on the basis of a\nprospective juror’s honest, though mistaken, response.” Zerka v. Green, 49 F.3d ll8l, ll86 n.7\n(6th Cir. l995); accord Dyer v. Calderon, l5l F.3d 97o, 98l (9th Cir. l998) (en banc) (“In\nextraordinary cases, courts may presume bias based on the circumstances.”); Amirault v. Fair,\n968 F.2d l4o4, l4o5-o6 (lst Cir. l992) (“[T]he majority vote in McDonough. . . require[s] a\nfurther <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> on the question of juror bias even where a juror is found to have been\nhonest... .”), cert. denied, 5o6 U.S. looo; Cannon v. Lockhart, 85o F.2d 437, 44o (8th Cir.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR- oooo92o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009208.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6- Filed o2/24/22 Page l8 of 32\nanother.” (quoting Texaco Inc. v. Louisiana Land & Exploration Co., 995 F.2d 43, 44 (Sth Cir.\nl993))); see also Haynes v. Williams, 88 F.3d 898, 9oo n. 4 (loth Cir. l996) (“[W]hen faced\nwith an intra-circuit conflict, a panel should follou earlier, setled precedent over a subsequent\ndeviation therefrom.”); P. Beiersdorf & Co. v. McGohey, l87 F.2d l4, l5 (2d Cir. l95l) (when\nthere is an intra-circuit conflict, courts must follou the earlier decision).\n\nOf course, this Court need not conclude that Shaoul is inconsistent with McDonough and\nLangford in order to reject the government’s argument. As described above, Shaoul does not\naddress the reading of McDonough that Ms. Maxwell advocates for here, since it did not discuss\nor even cite the McDonough concurring opinions.\n\nMoreover, Second Circuit cases follouing Lanford and Shaoul have reaffirmed that a\ndeliberate falsehood is not a prerequisite to a new trial. Cf United States v. Mansfield, 2ol9 WL\n38585ll, at *4 & n.4 (D. Colo. No. l8-cr-oo466-PAB, Aug. l6, 2ol9) (in face of intra-circuit\nconflict, follouing first-decided case and noting that subsequent cases had folloued first decision\nwas as well). Jn Stewart, for example, decided in 2oo6, the Court cited and quoted McDonough\nand yet did not require a deliberately false answer, stating instead that “a party alleging\nunfairness based on undisclosed juror bias must demonstrate first, that the juror’s voir dire\nresponse was false and second, that the correct response would have provided a valid basis for a\nchallenge for cause.” Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3 (citing McDonough, 464 U.S. at 556).\n\nThen there’s United States v. Greer, which reads McDonough and Langford just as Ms.\nMaxwell reads them, even while citing Shaoul. United States v. Greer, 285 F.3d l58, l7l-72 (2d\nCir. 2oo2). As the Court explained in Greer, “McDonough establishes a multi-part test in which\na juror’s dishonesty is among the ‘factors to be considered’ in the ultimate <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> of bias.\n...” Id. at l73 (citing Langford, 99o F.2d at 68-7o (emphasis added)). Thus, just as Ms. Maxwell\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo92o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009216.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6- Filed o2/24/22 Page 26 of 32\n2. The questioning should encompass any topic on which actual bias\nmay be based.\n\nMoreover, the questioning should be significantly broader than proposed by the\ngovernment. Although Ms. Maxwell need not prove Juror No. 5o’s intent, whether he acted\ndeliberately is “is among the ‘factors to be considered’ in the ultimate <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> of bias. . . .”\nGreer, 285 F.3d at l73. An analysis of Juror No. 5o’s intent requires consideration of the totality\nof the circumstances. And if only because Juror No. 5o has a patern and practice of giving false\nanswers to the Court, Ms. Maxwell is not required to accept any post-hoc assertion by him that\nhe did not act deliberately. Cf United States v. James, 6o9 F.2d 36, 46 (2d Cir. l979) (“[W]hen\natempting to shou bias or interest, as opposed to bad reputation, the examiner is not bound to\naccept the witness’ answer, but is free to call additional witnesses for impeachment.”).\n\nThe government disingenuously suggests that the Court\neC\nee\neS\neS\nSSC\nee\nee\neC\neS\neS\neee\neS\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo92l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009245.jpg": "Case 2o5l-oo88o; PAEumBactien ents o4l Fileddz/24/22agePagee 23 of 67\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, v\nFebruary l5, 2ol2 PAUL M.

The Court\nconcludes, and the Government concedes, that the demanding standard for holding an\nevidentiary hearing is met as to Juror 5o’s answer to Question 48 of the questionnaire. The\nCourt further concludes that Juror 5o’s response to Question 25 is relevant to the inquiry.\nFollouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct, unambiguous statements to multiple media outlets\nabout his oun experience that do not pertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the\naccuracy of his responses to Questions 25 and 48. Such statements are “clear, strong, substantial\nand incontrovertible evidence that a specific, nonspeculative impropriety”—namely a false\nstatement during jury selection—has occurred. To be clear, the potential impropriety is not that\nsomeone with a history of sexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is the potential\nfailure to respond truthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for that\nmaterial information so that any potential bias could be explored. Conversely, the demanding\nstandard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to Juror 5o’s use of social media nor\nthe conduct of any other juror. The Court therefore ORDERS a hearing take place at which the\nCourt will question Juror 5o under oath. The Defendant’s request for a broader hearing and pre-\nhearing discovery is DENIED.\n\nI. Background\n\nOn December 29, 2o2l, the jury returned a verdict in this case, finding the Defendant\nguilty of five counts. A week after the jury announced its verdict, on January 5, 2o22, the\nGovernment informed the Court that a juror had given at least three post-verdict interviews to\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9543\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009723.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 3l of 66\ninvidious as an intentionally false answer.

As the Second Circuit held in Langford:\n\nWe read [McDonough] multi-part test as governing not only inadvertent\n\nnondisclosures but also nondisclosures or misstatements that were deliberate,\n\nfor though the McDonough Court began with the inadvertent response before\n\nit, lt stated that the further shouing of cause must be made even after a juror’s\n\n“failure to answer honestly,” and it hypothesized that there could be various\n\n“motives for concealing.” Concurring in the judgment, Justice Brennan\n\nsimilarly stated that a second element—bias—should be required even lf the\n\njuror’s erroneous response was deliberate. Thus, he stated that the\n\nproper focus when ruling on a motion for new trial in this\nsituation should be on the bias of the juror and the resulting\nprejudice to the litigant. . .\n...

Greenwood. McDonough was a products liability\naction in which Juror Payton remained silent when the district court asked, “hou many of\nyou [potential jurors] have yourself or any members of your immediate family sustained\nany severe injury [in] an accident at home, or on the farm or at work that result in any\ndisability or prolonged pain and suffering?” 464 U.S. at 55o.

United States v. Langford, 99o F.2d\n65, 68 (2d Cir. l993) (“We read this multi-part test as governing not only inadvertent\nnondisclosures but also nondisclosures or misstatements that were deliberate.”); id. at 68\n(adopting Justice Brennan’s reasoning). Accordingly, in the Second Circuit, “a party\nalleging unfairness based on undisclosed juror bias must demonstrate first, that the juror’s\nvoir dire response was false and second, that the correct response would have provided a\nvalid basis for a challenge for cause.” United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d\nCir. 2oo6).\n\nOf course, individuals cannot be alloued to lie their way onto a jury. Writing for a\nunanimous Supreme Court, Justice Cardozo concluded: “If the answers to the questions\n[during voir dire] are willfully evasive or knouingly untrue, the talesman, when\naccepted, ls a juror in name only .. . His relation to the court and to the parties is tainted\nin its origin; it is a mere pretense and sham.” Clark v.

Thus, in the Second Circuit,’ it is a “threshold requirement” to establish that a juror\nintentionally lied or consciously deceived the court. See Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l5; Nix, 275 F.

Supp. 2d at 72 (“The failure to answer honestly must be deliberate; a\n‘juror’s good faith failure to respond, though mistaken, [does] not satisfy even the first prong of\nthe test.’” (quoting Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l5)); United States v.

Mar. 22, 2ool) (rejecting claim of juror misconduct in voir\ndire, concluding “it is not clear that [the juror’s] failure to respond to the Court’s question was a\ndeliberate atempt at dishonesty, as she only failed to answer the court’s question.”); Perez v.\nManhatan Jeep Eagle, No. 92 Civ. 952l (DLC), l997 WL 4o3458, at *5 (S.D.N.Y.

The Current Record Does Not Support a Finding of Deliberate\nFalsehood\n\nOn the current record, there is no basis for the Court to find that Juror 5o gave any\ndeliberately false answer during voir dire. To be sure, if his public statements regarding being a\nvictim of sexual abuse were truthful,!° it would appear that Juror 5o answered Question 48\n? While some circuits have reached a different result, the Second Circuit’s view appears to be the\nprevailing one. See, e.g., Fitzgerald v. Greene, l5o F.3d 357, 364 n.3 (4th Cir. l998) (collecting\nae 4 of course possible that Juror 5o’s unsworn public statements were not truthful, while his\nsworn answers on the questionnaire were. This is a threshold fact that must be determined at a\nhearing. But for purposes of discussion in this brief, the Government assumes that Juror 5o’s\npublic statements on this subject were truthful.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009819.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 2l of 49\none can delete the Instagram app from one’s phone without deleting the account at all.!* And the\ndefendant’s screenshots shou that Juror 5o was not hiding anything: His Instagram use did appear,\nas he stated, to consist of “[p]ersonal stuff, like selfies.” (Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l33; see Def. Mem.\nat 2o). There is no basis for concluding that Juror 5o deliberately lied during voir dire about his\nsocial media activity.\n\nIn sum, the defendant’s argument that the Court should grant her motion based purely on\nunsworn public statements by Juror 5o is unpersuasive. That said, given the apparent\ninconsistency between Juror 5o’s public statements that he was a victim of sexual abuse and his\nanswer to Question 48 on the questionnaire, the Government believes that a limited evidentiary\nhearing on that subject is warranted to determine whether he answered Question 48 falsely and, if\nso, whether that answer was deliberate or inadvertent. The Government addresses the proper scope\nof that hearing in Part I, infra.\n\n2. The Defendant Has Failed to Satisfy the Second Prong of McDonough\na. The Second Prong of McDonough Requires the Court to\nDetermine Whether It Would Have Granted a Hypothetical\nChallenge\n\nThe defendant’s brief states: “The second question is whether truthful responses from Juror\nNo. 5o would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” (Def. Mem. at 29 (citing\nStewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3)). This omits an important aspect of the relevant standard, which provides\nthat in order to make that decision, “the district court must ‘determine if it would have granted the\nhypothetical challenge.’” Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o4 (quoting United States v. Greer, 285 F.3d l58,\nl7l (2d Cir. 2oo2)). Critically, that <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> is reviewed for abuse of discretion, and ““‘[t]here\n2 See, e.g., htps://www.guidingtech.com/what-happens-when-you-uninstall-instagram-from-\nphone/.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009821.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 23 of 49\nwould have truthfully affirmed that he could be fair and impartial, then the record is clear that the\nCourt would not have struck him for cause, and the defendant’s motion should be denied.\n\nb. The Defendant’s Arguments Regarding Bias Are Unpersuasive\n\nA party may challenge a juror for cause based only on “narrouly specified, provable and\nlegally cognizable bases.” United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. l997) (quotation and\ncitation omited). In the context of voir dire, challenges for cause generally fall into one of three\n“limited” categories: actual bias, implied bias, or inferable bias. Jd. Houever, in the different\ncontext presented here—a post-trial allegation of juror bias, in a retrospective <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> of a\nhypothetical challenge for cause—the Second Circuit has stated that it is an open question whether\nthe second and third of these categories are applicable. See Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. That is, “the\nremedy for allegations of juror partiality is a hearing in which the defendant has the opportunity\nto prove actual bias,” Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 2o9, 2l5 (l982) (emphasis added), and, as such,\nit is unclear that bias may be implied or inferred, see Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. The Government\nsubmits that actual bias is the only relevant inquiry in this context, see Smith, 455 U.S. at 2l5, but\nnevertheless addresses each category in turn.\n\ni. Actual Bias\n\n“Actual bias is ‘bias in fact’—the existence of a state of mind that leads to an inference\nthat the person will not act with entire impartiality.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 43 (quoting United States\nv. Wood, 299 U.S. l23, l33 (l936)). “[A] finding of actual bias is based upon determinations of\ndemeanor and credibility that are peculiarly within a trial judge’s province.” Jd. at 44 (quotation\nand citation omited). Actual bias “cannot be found unless a prospective juror is adequately\nquestioned on voir dire with respect to his or her ability to apply the law impartially.” Jd. at 44.\nThe district court has “broad discretion” in such questioning and “[t]here is no particular script\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo982l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009834.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 36 of 49\n\nThis inquiry should be tightly focused. As a threshold mater, the Court should inquire\nwhether Juror 5o’s public statements are true—i.e., whether he was in fact a victim of sexual\nabuse.'® If the answer is yes, then the Court should determine why Juror 5o nevertheless answered\n“no” to Question 48. Finally, the Court should ask such questions as to permit it to make the\nhypothetical <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> posed by McDonough’s second prong: If Juror 5o had accurately\nanswered Question 48, would the Court have struck him for cause?\n\nOn this last subject, the defendant claims that had Juror 5o answered Question 48 in the\naffirmative, the Court and the parties would have “probed” him about various topics, which the\ndefendant suggests are necessary topics of examination. (Def. Mem. at 44). The record refutes\nthat assertion, and inquiry along the lines proposed by the defendant is not necessary.\n\nThe defendant argues that the Court would have inquired whether Juror 5o was able to\nassess the credibility of a witness claiming sexual assault or abuse just like he would any other\nwitness. (/d.). As an initial mater, Juror 5o already stated in the juror questionnaire that he could\nassess the credibility of a witness claiming sexual assault or abuse just like he would any other\nwitness. (Def. Ex. l, Question 47). Moreover, the Court did not ask jurors who answered Question\n48 in the affirmative any follou up questions about Question 47. Accordingly, there is no need to\ninquire about this subject any further at a hearing, beyond perhaps reaffirming that Juror 5o’s\nanswer to Question 47 was correct.\n\n‘6 The Court need not inquire about the details of the victim’s sexual abuse, just as the Court did\nnot probe such details with respect to other jurors who answered Question 48 affirmatively. (See\nNov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l8-l9, 52-57, 2oo, 2o7-o8, 259, 293, 532, 635). In the event the Court\nbelieves that details need to be elicited, beyond those few details Juror 5o has provided publicly,\nsuch inquiry should be conducted at sidebar or in camera. See Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544; Shakur,\n723 F. Supp. at 928.\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9834\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009883.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 644 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page l4 of 32\nin a “documentary.” Inquiring into the false answers Juror No. 5o has publicly admited making\nrisks nothing that Juror No. 5o hasn’t already brought on himself.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s motion has nothing to do with her innocence or guilt. It involves no\nstrategy or artifice by the defense. And it risks no unauthorized inquiry into the jury room. The\nmotion is about one thing, and one thing only: Every person’s constitutional right to a fair and\nimpartial jury. The government hopes to deprive Ms. Maxwell of that right in the name of\n“finality.”\n\nThis Court should disregard the government’s policy arguments, which address\narguments and claims Ms. Maxwell is not making.

Not so.\n\nContrary to the government’s argument, the decision McDonough Pouer Equip. v.\nGreenwood, “does not entirely foreclose a party from seeking a new trial on the basis of a\nprospective juror’s honest, though mistaken, response.” Zerka v.

As described above, Shaoul does not\naddress the reading of McDonough that Ms. Maxwell advocates for here, since it did not discuss\nor even cite the McDonough concurring opinions.\n\nMoreover, Second Circuit cases follouing Lanford and Shaoul have reaffirmed that a\ndeliberate falsehood is not a prerequisite to a new trial. Cf United States v. Mansfield, 2ol9 WL\n38585ll, at *4 & n.4 (D. Colo.

Greer, which reads McDonough and Langford just as Ms.\nMaxwell reads them, even while citing Shaoul. United States v. Greer, 285 F.3d l58, l7l-72 (2d\nCir. 2oo2). As the Court explained in Greer, “McDonough establishes a multi-part test in which\na juror’s dishonesty is among the ‘factors to be considered’ in the ultimate <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> of bias.\n...” Id. at l73 (citing Langford, 99o F.2d at 68-7o (emphasis added)). Thus, just as Ms. Maxwell\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9887\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009895.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document644_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 26 of 32\n2. The questioning should encompass any topic on which actual bias\nmay be based.\n\nMoreover, the questioning should be significantly broader than proposed by the\ngovernment. Although Ms. Maxwell need not prove Juror No. 5o’s intent, whether he acted\ndeliberately is “is among the ‘factors to be considered’ in the ultimate <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> of bias. . . .”\nGreer, 285 F.3d at l73. An analysis of Juror No. 5o’s intent requires consideration of the totality\nof the circumstances. And if only because Juror No. 5o has a patern and practice of giving false\nanswers to the Court, Ms. Maxwell is not required to accept any post-hoc assertion by him that\nhe did not act deliberately. Cf United States v. James, 6o9 F.2d 36, 46 (2d Cir. l979) (“[W]hen\natempting to shou bias or interest, as opposed to bad reputation, the examiner is not bound to\naccept the witness’ answer, but is free to call additional witnesses for impeachment.”).\n\nThe government disingenuously suggests that the Court \"need not inquire about the\ndetails of the victim’s sexual abuse, just as the Court did not probe such details with respect to\nother jurors who answered Question 48 affirmatively.\" Resp. at 34 n.l6. Apparently the\ngovernment has forgoten that Question 48a itself (approved of by the government) asked for\ndetails of any affirmative answer to Question 48, and each of the other jurors who answered 48\nin the affirmative provided those details in writen form when they answered Question 48a.\nThere was thus no need for the Court to inquire the details during the live voir dire. For\nexample, the government points to Juror l89 and notes the Court only folloued up with the\nquestion whether a question concerning ability to be fair and impartial. Resp. at 36. Yet Juror\nl89’s answer to 48a contained the details of her alleged abusc\neS\nee.

(/d. at\n25:23-26:lo). Juror 5o answered the questions quickly and forthrightly, and his demeanor evinced\nthat he was a fair and serious juror who deeply regreted making an inadvertent error. See Greer,\n285 F.3d at l7l (quoting United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 44 (2d Cir. l997), for the proposition\nthat a “finding of actual bias is based upon determinations of demeanor and credibility that are\npeculiarly within a trial judge’s province.”).‘\n\nOn this record, it is evident that Juror 5o would not have been struck for cause. Of the 58\nindividuals who were qualified to serve as jurors, eight individuals disclosed in their writen\nquestionnaires that they themselves had been a victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or\n* Juror 5o’s answers about whether he thought his family or friends would learn about his sexual\nabuse through his press interviews do not undermine his credibility. While the trial participants,\nwho have been atentive to developments in this case for years, quickly learned of Juror 5o’s\nstatements, Juror 5o reasonably thought differently about his friends and family. As Juror 5o\nexplained, his family and friends “didn’t even knou that this trial was even happening” when he\nrevealed that he had been on the jury through social media—media in which he did not reveal his\noun experience with abuse. (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at 42:l5-43:9). Juror 5o therefore expected that “a\nlitle article about a juror giving their experience wouldn’t be. . . really in the news at all.” (/d. at\n42:2l-23). His family and friends appear not to have consumed media about the trial—yjust like\nmany of the actual and prospective jurors in this case, who reported no or almost no exposure to\nthe defendant or Jeffrey Epstein on their questionnaires. (See, e.g., Juror 7; Juror 2o; Juror 37;\nJuror 54; Juror 89; Juror l5l). It is even more unlikely that they would learn about his experience\nwith abuse given that Juror 5o did not use his last name, disconnecting his press interviews from\nhis Google search results, and that he gave two of his three interviews to foreign press. (See Dkt.\nNo. 643 at 8-9). And Juror 5o did not think that his interviews would trigger significant public\natention and further proceedings in the case because he had atempted to answer the questions\nhonestly and had nothing to hide. (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at 22:23-23:5 (“I didn’t think this would\nhappen... if I lied deliberately I wouldn’t have told a soul. I certainly wouldn’t have put myself\nin a position . . . this position that I’m in nou, potentially any sort of criminal charges, I just\nwouldn’t have done it. It was an honest mistake ....”)).

The ensuing <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> of whether the juror was biased or\nprejudiced against the defendant may be “affected both by whether the nondisclosure was\ndeliberate and, if it was, by the juror’s motivation to conceal the truth.” United States v. McCoy,\n995 F.3d 32, 5l (2d Cir. 2o2l); see also Greer, 285 F.3d at l72-73. It is important to consider\nwhether a juror’s answer was dishonest in the second part of the test “because it can shou ‘a\npersonal interest in this particular case that was so pouerful as to cause the juror to commit a\nserious crime [by lying during voir dire].’” United States v. Nix, 275 F. Supp. 3d 42o, 438\n(W.D.N.Y. 2ol7), aff'd sub nom. United States v. McCoy, 995 F.3d 32 (2d Cir. 2o2l) (alteration\nin original) (quoting United States v. Colombo, 869 F.2d l49, l5l (2d Cir. l989)).\n\nThe McDonough inquiry is restricted by Federal Rule of Evidence 6o6, which states:\n\nDuring an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment, a juror may not testify\n\nabout any statement made or incident that occurred during the jury’s deliberations; the\n\neffect of anything on that juror’s or another juror’s vote; or any juror’s mental processes\n\nconceming the verdict or indictment. The court may not receive a juror’s affidavit or\n\nevidence of a juror’s statement on these maters.\nFed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(l). As explained in this Court’s prior opinion, the rule is subject to certain\nexceptions inapplicable here. See Feb. 25, 2o22 Op. & Order, at l2. The rule, which embodies\n“‘long-accepted Federal law,” is an important safeguard on the integrity of the jury trial system.\nTanner v. United States, 483 U.S. lo7, l2o-2l (l987) (rejecting a constitutional challenge to the\nrule). It enables “full and frank discussion in the jury room” and secures “jurors’ willingness to\nreturn an unpopular verdict.” Jd. Without the rule, the finality of verdicts, upon which the\nsystem relies, would be seriously disrupted. See id. at l2o-2l, l24-25; see also Warger v.\nShauers, 574 U.S. 4o, 45, 49-5o (2ol4).

Wit,\n469 U.S. 4l2, 428 (l985)).\n\nThe record does not support a finding that Juror 5o was actually biased. As explained\nabove, the Court finds Juror 5o’s sworn testimony to be credible overall. He was responsive and\nforthright, and his demeanor evinced that he answered the Court’s questions truthfully. He\nrepeatedly and credibly affirmed that his personal history of sexual abuse would not affect his\nability to serve as a fair and impartial juror “in any way.” Hearing Tr. at 25; see also id. at 9, lo,\nl3. He testified that there was “absolutely in no way” anything about his experience that would\ninterfere with his “ability to assess the credibility of witnesses alleging sexual abuse,” and that he\nwould be able to conclude such a witness was not testifying truthfully if that was what the\nevidence suggested. /d. at 26. He testified that he did not harbor any bias against the Defendant\nnor any bias in favor of the Government. Indeed, he did not want to put his “thumb on the scale\nin any direction.” /d. He declared that he had “no doubt” as to his ability to be fair to both sides.\nId. at 27. As noted above, the Defendant dismisses these responses as “self-serving.” Maxwell\nPost-Hearing Br. at 7. The Court disagrees; it finds each of these responses to be credible.\n\nMoreover, Juror 5o’s hearing testimony is corroborated by his answers during voir dire.\nWithout hesitation, he declared that he would follou the Court’s instructions on the law, he\n“absolutely” could decide the case based on the evidence or lack of evidence presented in court,\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo347\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010349.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 26 of 4o\nbased on the purported similarities between his personal history and the issues at trial. Because\nthese arguments overlap, the Court addresses implied and inferred bias together.°\n\n“Implied bias” is “‘a concept that is reserved for ‘extreme situations,’ warranting a\nconclusive presumption of bias as a mater of law.” McCoy, 995 F.3d at 48 (internal quotations\nomited) (quoting Greer, 285 F.3d at l72). Such bias is “atributed to a prospective juror\nregardless of actual partiality” because the law presumes that “an average person in the position\nof the juror in controversy would be prejudiced.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (citing United States v.\nWood, 299 U.S. l23, l33 (l936)); see also Haynes, 398 F.2d at 984. The category applies to\n“certain highly limited situations where a juror discloses a fact that creates such a high risk of\npartiality that the law requires the judge to excuse the juror for cause.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 4l.\nNamely, “jurors who are related to the parties or who were victims” or otherwise involved in the\nalleged crime itself are impliedly biased. /d. at 45; see also Greer, 285 F.3d at l72.\n\nOn the other hand, a finding of inferred bias is a <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> within the trial court’s\ndiscretion. Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l; see also McCoy, 995 F.3d at 49. “Bias may be inferred when\na juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk of partiality sufficiently significant to warrant\ngranting the trial judge discretion to excuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make\nmandatory a presumption of bias.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l (quoting Torres, l28 F.3d at 47)).\nThe inquiry is whether the juror’s responses at voir dire “permit an inference that the juror in\nquestion would not be able to decide the mater objectively.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 47. If such\nfacts are elicited, “then, just as in the situation of implied bias, the juror’s statements as to his or\nher ability to be impartial become irrelevant.” /d. Houever, “a judge may—particularly when\n5 It is unsetled in the Second Circuit whether implied or inferred bias may serve as the basis for a post-trial\nallegation of juror partiality. See Greer, 285 F.3d at l72.

The Court denies the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion.\n\nThe Defendant argues there was insufficient evidence to support any of her five counts of\nconviction, and, therefore, the Court should enter a judgment of acquital as to all counts under\nRule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Rule 29 provides, in relevant part, that\n“Talfter the government closes its evidence or after the close of all the evidence, the court on the\ndefendant’s motion must enter a judgment of acquital of any offense for which the evidence is\ninsufficient to sustain a conviction.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(a); United States v. Pugh, 945 F.3d 9,\nl9 (2d Cir. 2ol9). “[T]he critical inquiry on review of the sufficiency of the evidence to support\na criminal conviction must be . . . to determine whether the record evidence could reasonably\nsupport a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 3o7, 3l8\n(l979). “The court must make that <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> with the evidence against a particular\ndefendant, viewed in the light most favorable to the government, and with all reasonable\ninferences resolved in favor of the government.” Pugh, 945 F.3d at l9 (cleaned up) (quoting\nEppolito, 543 F.3d at 45). Under this inquiry, “the relevant question is whether, after viewing\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have\nfound the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.” Jackson, 443 US. at 3l9\n(citing Johnson v. Louisiana, 4o6 U.S. 356, 362 (l972)); United States v.

For the follouing reasons, the Court disagrees and denies the Defendant’s\nmotion on this basis.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nUnder the Fifth Amendment’s Grand Jury Clause, “‘a defendant has the right to be tried\nonly on charges contained in an indictment returned by a grand jury.” United States v. Wozniak,\nl26 F.3d lo5, lo9 (2d Cir. l997). “[W]hen the charge upon which the defendant is tried differs\nsignificantly from the charge upon which the grand jury voted,” a constructive amendment\noccurs and reversal is required. United States v. Khalupsky, 5 F.4th 279, 293 (2d Cir. 2o2l).\n\n“To prevail on a constructive amendment claim, a defendant must demonstrate that either\nthe proof at trial or the trial court’s jury instructions so altered an essential element of the charge\nthat, upon review, it is uncertain whether the defendant was convicted of conduct that was the\nsubject of the grand jury’s indictment.” United States v. Salmonese, 352 F.3d 6o8, 62o (2d Cir.\n2oo3) (quoting United States v. Frank, l56 F.3d 332, 337 (2d Cir. l998)). In making this\n<span class=\"highlight\">determination</span>, the Court first delineates the “core of criminality” of the crime alleged. United\nStates v. Gross, No. l5-cr-769 (AJN), 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *2o (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l8, 2ol7), aff'd\nsub nom. United States v. Lebedev, 932 F.3d 4o (2d Cir. 2ol9). The “core of criminality...\ninvolves the essence of a crime, in general terms.” United States v. Daugerdas, 837 F.3d 2l2,\n225 (2d Cir. 2ol6) (alteration in original) (quoting United States v. D’Amelio, 683 F.3d 4l2, 4l8\n(2d Cir. 2ol2)). The Court then determines whether the evidence or jury instructions at trial\ncreated a “substantial likelihood” that the defendant was not convicted of the crime described in\nthat core, but instead of a crime “distinctly different.” D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at 4l6, 4l9. The\nSecond Circuit has “consistently permited significant flexibility in proof, provided that the\ndefendant was given notice of the core of criminality to be proven at trial.” United States v.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo388\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010423.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 6 of 29\nenhancements that were applied in the PSR, the recommended sentencing range under the 2oo3\nGuidelines would be roughly 75% Jess than the recommended sentencing range under the 2oo4\nGuidelines: l68-2lo months based on a Combined Adjusted Offense Level of 35 under the 2oo3\nGuidelines versus 292-365 months based on a Combined Adjusted Offense Level of 4o under\nthe 2oo4 Guidelines.” The parties dispute, houever, whether the offense conduct ended before\nor after November l, 2oo4, and whether a court or a jury must make that finding. See USSG §\nlBl.ll, cmt. n.2 (the “last date of the offense of conviction” is the “controlling date for ex post\nfacto purposes”).\n\nProbation and the government assert that the 2oo4 Guidelines apply because the second\nsuperseding indictment (the “S2 Indictment’’) generally alleges that the criminal conduct ended\n“in or about 2oo4” and the Court should find based on the trial testimony and other evidence that\nthe offense conduct continued “through the end of 2oo4.” See PSR at 58. That is legally and\nfactually incorrect. For the reasons set forth more fully belou, the Court must apply the 2oo3\nGuidelines in this case because (l) the jury, not the Court, must determine the end date of the\ncriminal conduct when that fact dictates which Guidelines book applies consistent with the Ex\nPost Facto Clause; (2) even if the Court may make that <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span>, the trial record is\ninsufficient to find that the offense conduct continued past November l, 2oo4, the effective date\nof the 2oo4 Guidelines; and (3) it would not serve the goals of sentencing to apply the harsher\n2oo4 Guidelines in this case when the record is clear that Ms. Maxwell was no longer actively\nparticipating in the offense conduct by 2oo2 or 2oo3 at the latest.\n\n? The five-point difference in the total offense level is driven by the base offense level. Under the 2oo3 Guidelines,\nthe applicable base offense level is l9. See USSG § 2Gl.l(a)(l) (2oo3). Under the 2oo4 Guidelines, the applicable\nbase offense level is 24. See USSG § 2Gl.3(a) (2oo4).

The government’s claim is based solely on (l) Carolyn’s vague\nrecollection that she stopped performing sexualized massages for Epstein in 2oo5 when she was\nl8 years old (Tr. l525, l549), and (2) two message pad slips that were never admited in\nevidence. (GX 4-B, GX 4-F). Such meager and unreliable evidence is insufficient to support a\nfinding that the offense conduct continued into the last two months of 2oo4, especially when that\n<span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> has such a significant effect on the recommended sentencing range. Instead, the\ncredible evidence in the trial record established, at most, that Epstein was receiving sexualized\nmassages in his Palm Beach residence through the summer of 2oo4, before the 2oo4 Guidelines\ntook effect.\n\nCarolyn’s recollection that she was l8 when she stopped seeing Epstein cannot be\ncredited. (Tr. l525, l549). Carolyn’s memory of the timeline of events—in particular, her age\nat the time of the relevant events—was demonstrably inconsistent and unreliable. For example,\nCarolyn initially testified that she was l4 years old when Virginia Roberts first took her to\nEpstein’s Palm Beach residence, which would have been in 2ool. (Tr. l5l8-l9, l525; GX-ll).\nHouever, when Carolyn was confronted on cross-examination with her prior deposition\ntestimony in 2oo9, she agreed that Virginia first took her to Epstein’s house in May or June 2oo2\nwhen she was l5 years old, as she stated in her deposition. (Tr. l57o-73). Then on redirect\nCarolyn changed her testimony yet again and testified that she first went to Epstein’s house when\nshe was l3 years old, which would have been in 2ooo. (Tr. l693). Carolyn also testified that\nshe was “l5, going to be l6” when she recruited her friend Tatum to give Epstein massages,\nwhich would have been touards the end of 2oo2 or early 2oo3. (Tr. l544). Houever, according\nto the message pad slips that were admited in evidence, the earliest of which dates to January\n2oo3, Tatum did not begin calling the Palm Beach residence until April 2oo4 when Carolyn was\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo426\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010440.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 23 of 29\nthat she did so in connection with the offense conduct related to “Jane,” Annie Farmer, or\nCarolyn. The aggravating role enhancement therefore does not apply to any of the three offense\ngroups.\n\nB. The Criminal Activity Was Not “Otherwise Extensive”\n\nEven if the Court finds that Ms. Maxwell supervised another “participant,” the record\ndoes not support a finding that the criminal activity related to “Jane,” Annie Farmer, or Carolyn\nwas “otherwise extensive,” as the government contends.’ Under the Guidelines, the Court must\ntreat each minor victim separately and consider whether the enhancement applies based solely on\nthe criminal activity related to that minor victim. See USSG § 2Gl.3, cmt. n.6 (“[S]ubsection\n(d)(l) directs that if the relevant conduct of an offense of conviction includes travel or\ntransportation to engage in a commercial sex act or prohibited sexual conduct in respect to more\nthan one minor ... each such minor shall be treated as if contained in a separate count of\nconviction.”). For example, the government cannot use conduct from the 2ool-2oo4 time period\nrelated to Carolyn to justify applying the aggravating role enhancement to the criminal activity in\nl994-l997 related to “Jane” or in l996 related to Annie Farmer.\n\nThe government nevertheless atempts to justify the enhancement as to each of the three\nminor victims by making a broad assertion about the nature and scope of the conspiracy as a\nwhole, rather than making an individualized <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that the criminal activity was\n“otherwise extensive” as to each. (See PSR at 59). Because that is insufficient to establish that\nthe criminal activity was “otherwise extensive,” Ms. Maxwell should, at most, be subject to a\ntwo-point enhancement under USSG § 3Bl.l(c).\n\n° The government does not argue that the aggravating role enhancement applies because the criminal activity\ninvolved “five or more participants,” conceding that the trial record does not support the conclusion that five or\nmore people criminally participated in the offense conduct.\nIo\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo44o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010481.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document663_ Filed o6/l5/22 Page 35of 77\n\nmore than prisoners in mainstream conditions, it follous that proportionality requires the severity\nof confinement be factored into sentencing. Courts sentence convicted offenders to prison as\npunishment. Courts order pretrial defendants detained to safeguard the community and to ensure\npresence at court proceedings, not for punishment. In evaluating the nature and extent of\npunishment, it is important to factor in the actual impact of the hardship on the defendant. If\ndetention imposes an additional burden on a certain category of defendants, it is necessary to\nincorporate the actual total burden of the punishment into sentencing calibrations.\n\nThe principle of proportionality requires that the additional burden experienced by Ms.\nMaxwell during the 22 months spent is in supermax-type conditions should be factored into the\nCourt’s sentencing calculus. Based on the underpinnings of punishment and the principle of\nproportionality, a hard-time credit for Ms. Maxwell’s unusual detention is warranted.\nImprisonment in any form is a severe hardship. This is especially so when a person presumed to\nbe innocent is detained pretrial. The standard measure for evaluating the hardship of incarceration\nis the length of the prison term, i.e., a value is placed on this quantitative measure when assessing\ndamages for wrongful conviction.

She described Ms. Maxwell as\n“highly intelligent, well-educated, exceptional in so many ways,” houever, she stated, “I have\nseen her deteriorate” since her incarceration, which Ms. Saffian described as “frightening.”\nShe described the conditions under which Ms. Maxwell is being detained as “psychological\ntorture,” in that she ls being held in “quasi-solitary confinement,” where the officers assigned\nto her are often hostle.\n\nMs. Saffian characterized Ms. Maxwell as “vibrant” and “wity” prior to her recent\nincarceration.

Nathan\nSiting By Designation\nUnited States District Court\n4o Foley Square\nNew York, NY looo7\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nCounsel for Ms. Maxwell write to inform the Court that we do not request sealing or\nredaction of the leter submited by Robert Y. Lewis, Esq., counsel to Sarah Ransome and\nElizabeth Stein. Houever, Mr. Lewis’s leter raises an issue that we believe the Court must\nresolve prior to the sentencing hearing; namely, who may submit victim impact statements to the\nCourt or address the Court at sentencing under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (“CVRA”).\n\nUnder the CVRA, a “crime victim” has, among other things, “the right to be reasonably\nheard at any public proceeding in the district court involving release, plea, sentencing, or any\nparole proceeding.” l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(4). The CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person\ndirectly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense\nin the District of Columbia.” l8 U.S.C. § 377l(e)(2)(A) (emphasis added). The concept of\n“direct and proximate harm,” as used in the CVRA, is not limitless and only covers victims of\nthe conduct underlying the offenses of conviction. See United States v. Daly, No. 3:ll-cr-l2l\n(AWT), 2ol2 WL 3l54o9, at *5-*6 (D. Conn. Feb. l, 2ol2) (“[T]he <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> as to whether\nperson has the rights of a ‘crime victim’ for purposes the CVRA is made with reference to the\nconduct underlying the charged offense.) (emphasis added).\n\nThe conduct underlying the offenses charged against Ms. Maxwell ended “in or about\n2oo4.” To our understanding, Ms. Ransome alleges that she was a victim of Epstein and Ms.\nMaxwell from approximately October 2oo6 to April 2oo7, a full two years after the conduct in\nthis case ended. She therefore does not qualify as a “crime victim” under the CVRA. We do not\nknou when Ms. Stein alleges that she was a victim, but she would also not qualify as a “crime\nvictim” if the conduct she alleges post-dates 2oo4 or she was not a minor. According to\nuncorroborated press reports Ms. Stein claims to have met Maxwell in l994 when Ms. Stein was\n2l years old and not a minor.\n\nIn his leter to the Court, dated June l4, 2o22. Mr. Lewis requests that Ms. Ransome and\nMs. Stein be given an opportunity to speak at Ms. Maxwell’s sentencing proceeding and\nreferences that Ms. Ransome spoke at the hearing conducted by Judge Berman follouing\nEpstein’s death.

Follouing Epstein’s death, the government moved for a\nnolle prosequi to dispose of the case pursuant to Second Circuit law holding that if a defendant\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo53o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010531.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 667 Filed o6/2l/22 Page2of2\ndies before the final judgment is issued, the Indictment must be dismissed under the rule of\nabatement. See United States v. Wright l6o F.3d 9o5, 9o8 (2d Cir. l998).

Epstein, l9\nCr. 49o (RMB), Dkt. 53.\n\nThe victim statements in Judge Berman’s proceeding had no impact on the rights of a\ndefendant whose case is abated. Such is not the case here. While it is appropriate for victims to\nbe present pursuant to the CVRA, Ms. Maxwell’s sentencing proceeding should not be an open\nforum for any alleged victim to be heard.

The Court, and not the Jury, Determines Which Manual to Apply\n\nThe defendant claims that a jury must determine which version of the Sentencing\nGuidelines to apply, but the defendant offers not a single case that has ever so held. That argument\nis inconsistent with the plain text of the Guidelines and established Second Circuit precedent. The\nCourt should reject this argument.\n\nAs an initial mater, it is well setled that a question of fact that increases a defendant’s\noffense level under the Guidelines need not be submited to a jury. United States v. Fusco, 56o F.\nApp’x 43, 45-46 (2d Cir. 2ol4); United States v. Morel, No. lo Cr. 798 (PAC), 2o2l WL 282llo7,\nat *2 (S.D.N.Y. July 7, 2o2l). In addition, with respect to the sentencing court’s <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> of\nwhich Guidelines Manual to apply, the text of the Guidelines expressly contemplates that the court\nshould determine the last date of the conspiracy. Application Note 2 provides the follouing\nexample of a calculation of the last date of the offense: “For example, if the offense of conviction\n(i.e., the conduct charged in the count of the indictment or information of which the defendant was\nconvicted) was determined by the court to have been commited between October l5, l99l and\nOctober 28, l99l, the date of October 28, l99l is the controlling date for ex post facto purposes.”\nU.S.S.G. § lBl.ll(b)(l), app. n.2 (2oo4) (emphasis added). As the underlined language makes\nplain, the Guidelines direct sentencing courts to make this factual <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span>, and not juries.\n\nAs the defendant acknouledges, not one of the cases cited in the defendant’s motion\ninvolved increases in the Sentencing Guidelines, and instead, the defendant rests her argument\nentirely on cases involving Ex Post Facto challenges to increases of the applicable statutory\npenalties. (Dkt. No. 662 (“Def. Mem.”) at 3-4). The law is clear that, so long as a fact at sentencing\ndoes not increase the statutory maximum or minimum penalty, that fact is for the sentencing court\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo555\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010556.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Page 2l of55\nto resolve, and not the jury. Fusco, 56o F. App’x at 45-46 (citing United States v. Norris, 28l F.3d\n357, 369 (2d Cir. 2oo2)).\n\nLacking any authority for her argument, the defendant cites Peugh and offers her oun\nsweeping conclusion that, essentially, the Sixth Amendment requires that all Ex Post Facto issues\nbe resolved by juries. But as the Supreme Court explained in Peugh, “the Sixth Amendment and\nEx Post Facto Clause inquiries are analytically distinct” and “[nJothing that we say today\n‘undo[es]’ the holdings of Booker, Rita, Gall, Kimbrough, or our other recent sentencing cases.”\nPeugh, 569 U.S. at 549-5o. It is thus unsurprising that the defendant has not located a single case,\nanywhere in the nation, that has concluded, in the nine years since Peugh was decided, that the\n<span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> of which Guidelines Manual to apply implicates the Sixth Amendment. Thus, even\nafter Peugh, a sentencing judge’s fact-finding authority continues to include the authority to find\nwhen an offense ended for purposes of deciding which Guidelines Manual to apply.\n\n2. The Sex Trafficking Conspiracy Continued to 2oo5\n\nThe Indictment charged that the defendant participated in a conspiracy “from at least in or\nabout l994, up to and including at least in or about 2oo4,” and that is exactly what the Government\nproved at trial. (Dkt. No. l87 at l). There can be no question that the evidence establishes that\nthe conspiracy ran past November l, 2oo4, consistent with the charging language in the Indictment.\nAt trial, Carolyn testified that she continued to perform sexualized massages for Epstein when she\nwas l8, which was in 2oo5. Carolyn’s birth certificate was admited at trial as GX ll. Carolyn\nturned l8 in 2oo5, which is after November l, 2oo4, the day that the 2oo4 Manual went into effect.\nIn particular, Carolyn gave the follouing testimony:\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo556\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010558.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 23 oof55\nemployees was unnecessary. The book is authentic, and the defendant offers no basis for\nconcluding otherwise.”\n\nThe Court should reject the defendant’s argument and make its <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> regarding\nthe final date of the conspiracy based on the language of the Indictment (which plainly\nencompasses all of 2oo4) and the trial testimony of Carolyn (who testified that the offense conduct\nran past 2oo4). The 2oo4 Manual applies.\n\n3. The Court Should Apply the 2oo4 Manual\n\nThe defendant also claims that the “goals of sentencing are not served” by applying the\n2oo4 Manual. (Def. Mem. 8 (capitalization removed)). Not so. The law plainly provides that the\n2oo4 Manual applies here, and it would be unjust to provide a substantial break in the Sentencing\nGuidelines for a defendant who engaged in an extensive child exploitation scheme, especially\nwhen both Congress and the Sentencing Commission have since further increased the applicable\npenalties for these offenses.\n\nMoreover, the Court should not credit the defendant’s claim that she broke away from\nEpstein in 2oo2, based on the testimony of a sole defense witness who said that the defendant had\n“moved on” in 2oo2. (Def. Mem. 9). To be clear, “once it has been established that there existed\na conspiracy of which the defendant was a member, [her] membership is presumed to continue\nunless and until the defendant proves that the conspiracy was terminated or that [she] took\n> In any event, the Government will bring the message book to sentencing so that the Court may\nexamine it if it deems such an assessment necessary. If the Court desires additional testimony in\nthe record, a case agent would be prepared to testify at the sentencing hearing based on the FBI’s\ninvestigation that this message book was seized by the Palm Beach Police Department along with\nthe other three message books admited at trial, and was transferred into the custody of the FBI,\nwhich has maintained it ever since. It is well established that hearsay is admissible at sentencing.\nSee United States v. Martinez, 4l3 F.3d 239, 242 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (“the right of confrontation does\nnot apply to the sentencing context and does not prohibit the consideration of hearsay testimony\nin sentencing proceedings.”).\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo558\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010595.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document672 Filed o6/24/22 Page4of 68\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Feb. l, 2ol2) (“[T]he\n<span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> as to whether person has the rights of a ‘crime victim’ for purposes the CVRA is\nmade with reference to the conduct underlying the charged offense.”) (emphasis added). While\nindividuals claiming to have been victims of sexual abuse may qualify generically as victims, all\nsex crimes are not federal offenses and, as such, would be confer rights under the CVRA.\n\nAccordingly, for the Individuals to be considered \"victims,\" they must have been minors\nand \"directly and proximately\" been harmed by the \"commission\" of the “federal crimes” for\nwhich Ms. Maxwell has been convicted. Here, no such shouing can be made for the Individuals.\nThe alleged abuse and injuries were not caused by Ms. Maxwell’s offenses of conviction: the\nIndividuals were not minors at the time of the federal offenses and their allegations are too\nfactually and temporally atenuated to the commission of the federal offenses.\n\nAs the Court instructed the jury, the age of the victim was an essential element for each\noffense. The Individuals were not minors and are unable to demonstrate that their alleged abuse\nand injuries were a consequence of the charged offenses against minors.\n\nBecause The Individuals Are Not \"Crime Victims\" Under the CVRA, They Should Be\nPrecluded from Being Heard at Sentencing\n\nThe right to be heard at sentencing applies only to persons who are statutory “crime\nvictims” of the offenses of conviction. The CVRA provides that where a person is a “crime\nvictim,” as defined in that statute, she has the right to be reasonably heard at sentencing. l8\nU.S.C. § 377l(a)(4), § 377l (e) (defining “crime victim”).

It cannot be\nassumed that “relevant conduct” for guidelines purposes is the same as “related conduct” for\npurposes of determining statutory victim status under a scheme or conspiracy-based offense. Nor\ndoes the term “victim,” as variously appearing in the guidelines, inform the <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> of\nstatutory victim status under the CVRA.\nMs. Maxwell’s Due Process Rights Must Be Safeguarded\n\nThe CVRA affords victims the right of confrontation against their alleged abusers.\nThe Act does not provide a reciprocal right to a defendant, whose due process rights rest in the\nopportunity to cross-examine an alleged victim during trial. Of the four accusers who testified at\ntrial, only two — Annie Farmer and “Kate”- have submited victim impact statements. To the\nextent permited by the Court’s rulings, the defense had the opportunity to challenge their\nallegations and credibility during the trial. Under Federal Rule of Evidence 4l2, the Court\nprecluded the defense from raising certain issues during trial. Both Annie Farmer and “Kate”\nraise issues in their writen statements that were not disclosed by the government or revealed\nduring their testimony and should not be permited to be aired during sentencing Ly\nportions of their statements are redacted, we will not press objection for CVRA victims.

Epstein (“Estate”) have filed documents in the Superior Court of the U.S. Virgin Islands,\nseeking expedited approval from the Court for the establishment of a voluntary claims resolution program that will\nallou eligible individuals the opportunity to resolve their sexual abuse claims against Mr. Epstein and his Estate\nthrough a confidential, non-adversarial alternative to litigation.\nMs. Feldman, Mr. Feinberg and Ms. Biros — distinguished, independent claims administration experts with\nextensive experience in fashioning similar claims programs — will lead the design of the program, including\ndeveloping criteria and requirements for the evaluation and <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> of eligibility and compensation, and the\naccompanying claims process. Ms. Feldman, Mr. Feinberg and Ms. Biros will draft the program protocol and will\nafford interested parties, including potential claimants and/or their legal representatives, an opportunity to provide\ninput on the protocol prior to its finalization. They expect that, once approved by the Court, the program will start\naccepting claims in approximately 9o days.\n“This important program will offer victims the opportunity to obtain long-overdue compensation, to be heard and\ntreated with the compassion, dignity and respect they deserve, and to achieve some measure of justice and\nvalidation that has eluded them for so many years. The claims resolution process will be fair, prompt, and non-\nadversarial, and will provide victims with a meaningful alternative to years of protracted civil litigation and its\nassociated costs, risks and uncertainties,” said Ms. Feldman.\nMs. Biros added that “participation in the program will be entirely voluntary and will not affect any rights the\nclaimant may have unless and until she accepts the compensation <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> and signs a litigation release. All\nclaimants will be afforded an opportunity to meet confidentially with the Administrator, if they so desire, in order\nto provide any information that may bear upon the evaluation of their claims.”\nMs. Feldman, who recently served as Deputy Special Master of the September llth Victim Compensation Fund,\nthe litigation-alternative program administered by the U.S. Department of Justice that compensates victims who\nhave become sick or died as a result of their September l lth-related exposure, will also administer the new program.\nMs. Feldman will, in the role of Administrator, have complete autonomy and decision-making authority over\nprogram operations and claim determinations, and the Estate will have no authority to modify or reject\nMs. Feldman’s decisions on any basis or as to any claim. Mr. Feinberg, the nation’s leading expert in fashioning\neffective dispute resolution alternatives, and his colleague, Ms. Biros, will partner with Ms. Feldman in the\ndevelopment and implementation of the program, lending their extensive expertise to that process.\nMr. Feinberg added, “We are pleased to have been asked to implement this important program, and are eager to\nbegin designing it so that claimants will have a forum where their suffering is acknouledged and their claims are\npromptly and appropriately compensated.” Regarding Ms. Feldman he said, “Jordy brings not only a wealth of\nexperience from her long-time work with the 9/ll community, but also a profound sense of empathy for victims\nand a deep commitment to ensuring fairness in process and outcome.”\nOnce approved, the program will operate and maintain a website that provides general information about the\nprogram, including the Protocol, Frequently Asked Questions, information about claims filing deadlines and a\nregistration process for new complaints.

The Program is purely voluntary; no individual claimant is required to participate. A\nvictim’s legal rights are not impacted unless the victim accepts the compensation offered by\nthe Administrator and signs a release, agreeing not to engage in any further litigation against\nthe Epstein Estate and related entities and/or individuals.\n\n3. The Program is confidential. Protecting Claimant privacy is of paramount importance to\nthe Program. The Program will maintain strict confidentiality of all information submited, but\nwill not impose any limitations on the Claimant’s ability to share information with law\nenforcement, or anyone else.\n\n“Our work with victims of Catholic Church abuse, September llth and other similar programs has\nprovided us with invaluable insight into hou to calculate the incalculable, and take into account the\nlife-long effects of trauma,” said Ms. Biros, who co-designed the Program. Mr. Feinberg added,\n“The role of the Administrator is to apply a certain level of objectivity while taking into account the\nspecific circumstances presented by each individual claim. It is a challenging task, but one that\nJordy is uniquely qualified to undertake. Her empathetic and judicious style, and her long-time\nclaims experience and service to victims in the 9/ll community will serve this Program and\nEpstein’s victims well.”\nBeginning today, the Administrator will provide a Claim Form and other relevant Program information\nto individuals who have filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim of sexual abuse against Jeffrey Epstein\nand/or the Estate may begin the process of filing a claim with the Program, or have otherwise been\nidentified by counsel. Other individuals may also be eligible to participate in the Program by\nregistering on the Program website. The claims filing period will run through March 25, 2o2l.\nThe Program was initially proposed to the Probate Court of the U.S. Virgin Islands (“Probate Court”)\non November l4, 2ol9.

PURPOSE AND OVERVIEW\nThe Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program (the “Program”) is a voluntary, independent Program that\nhas been established to compensate and resolve the claims of victims-survivors of sexual abuse by\nJeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”).\nThe Estate of Jeffrey Epstein (the “Estate”) has retained the services of nationally recognized claims\nadministration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana H. Feldman to design the\nProgram. Ms. Feldman will also serve as the Administrator of the Program (the “Administrator”). This\nProtocol reflects input from victims-survivors, their lawyers, other potentially interested parties, and\nrepresentatives of the Estate.\nThrough the Program, the Estate wishes to acknouledge the wrongs endured by victims-survivors and\noffer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for such sexual abuse.\nThe Program is governed by the follouing non-exclusive guiding principles:\ne The Program is purely voluntary. It does not affect any rights a Claimant may have\nunless and until the Claimant accepts the offered compensation and executes a\nRelease. A Claimant may reject the offer of compensation and may stop\nparticipating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time prior to execution\nof the Release.\ne The Program is independent and will in no way be administered, controlled or\noverseen by the Estate. The Administrator is responsible for all decisions relating to\nthe review, processing and evaluation of individual claims submited to the\nProgram. The Administrator will have final, binding and exclusive authority to\ndetermine Claimant eligibility and the valuation of each eligible individual claim.\nDecisions of the Administrator made pursuant to this Protocol are not subject to\nreview or modification in any way by the Estate or any other party or entity.\ne There is no cap or limitation on the aggregate amount of funds available to\ncompensate all eligible Claimants or on the amount of compensation to be made to\neach individual Claimant. Each individual claim will be evaluated separately by the\nAdministrator. The Administrator will determine, in her sole and exclusive\ndiscretion, issues of eligibility and the amount of compensation and the Estate will\npay all eligible claims based on the Administrator’s <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span>.\nl|Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooll478\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011479.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-4 Filed o7/l5/22 Page2of9\ne All Claimants will be treated with respect, dignity and fairness without regard to\nrace, color, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, gender or disability. To\nensure claims will be adjudicated fairly, the Administrator will manage the process\nso that all Claimants can equally access the Program’s claim process. Individuals\nwith disabilities will be given the opportunity to effectively communicate their\nclaims and to request special process accommodations.\nThe Program is available to all victims-survivors regardless of where they were harmed, when they were\nharmed, whether the claim is time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and whether they\nhave previously filed a lawsuit against or setled with Epstein and/or the Estate.\nThe exclusive claims period for filing a claim pursuant to this Protocol shall commence on the to-be-\ndetermined Effective Date and shall conclude nine (9) months after that date (“Filing Deadline”). All\nindividual claims filed with the Program must be filed within this period.\nTo complement the Program’s resources, the Administrator will, at her discretion and with the consent\nof the Claimant, consult with Professor Marci A. Hamilton, a nationally recognized sexual abuse expert,\nleading legal academic and advocate of victims’ rights. Ms. Hamilton’s role will be to further inform the\nAdministrator and her staff about the dynamics of sexual abuse, common responses to sexual abuse,\nand the impact of sexual abuse on victims; to serve as a resource for the Administrator in developing or\nupdating policies and procedures; to advise the Administrator regarding sensitivities involved in\ninteractions with victims; and to serve as a referral source for the Administrator in providing post-\n<span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> information to claimants who seek guidance, counseling or other services. The\nAdministrator may, at her discretion and with the Claimant’s prior writen consent, request that Ms.\nHamilton review an individual claimant file. The Administrator will determine on a case-by-case basis, in\nher discretion, the need to anonymize individual claimants’ files before sharing them with Ms. Hamilton.\nAs set forth above, the Administrator is solely responsible for all decisions relating to the administration\nof the Program, including the review, processing, evaluation, and <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> of individual claims\nsubmited to the Program.\nDuring the term of the Program, Ms. Hamilton will not meet or speak with a Claimant or her\nrepresentatives concerning any aspect of the Program without the Administrator present. Ms. Hamilton\nwill maintain in strict confidence and will not disclose outside the Program any information she obtains\nthrough her participation in the Program, including individual Claimants’ submissions.\n2|Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooll479\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011480.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-4 Filed o7/l5/22 Page3of9\nil. ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS\nA. Eligibility Criteria\nThe persons eligible to participate in this Program are individuals who allege they were sexually abused\nby Epstein.

General Overview\n\nl. What is the Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program?\nThe Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program (the “Epstein VCP” or\n“Program’) is a voluntary, independent Program that has been established to\ncompensate and resolve the claims of victims-survivors of sexual abuse by\nJeffrey Epstein. The Program was designed by nationally recognized claims\nadministration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana H\nFeldman, with input from victims’ lawyers, and representatives of the Estate\nof Jeffrey Epstein (“Estate”), and other interested parties. Ms. Feldman also\nserves as the Administrator of the Program (“Administrator”). The goal of\nthis Program is to acknouledge the wrongs endured by victims-survivors and\noffer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for\nsuch sexual abuse.\nThe Program is independent of the Estate. The Administrator is responsible\nfor all decisions relating to the review, processing and evaluation of individual\nclaims submited to the Program. The Administrator has complete autonomy\nto determine eligibility of individual claims and the amount of compensation\nfor each eligible Claimant. The Estate has no authority to modify or reject\nany individual claim determinations rendered by the Administrator, or\notherwise interfere with the administration of the Program.\nThe terms and conditions of the Program, including the criteria and proof\nrequirements for the evaluation and <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> of claims and the\naccompanying claims process, are set forth in the Program Protocol\n(“Protocol), which can be found on the Program website.\n\n2. Is the Program voluntary?\nYes. The Program is a non-adversarial alternative to litigation, and\nparticipation in the Program is entirely voluntary. It does not affect any rights\nyou may have unless and until you accept the offered compensation and\nexecute a Release. A Claimant may reject the offer of compensation and\nwithdraw the claim at any time prior to execution of the Release.\n\n3. What role does the Estate play in the administration of the Program?\nThe Program is independent of the Estate of Jeffrey Epstein. The Estate has\nno role in the evaluation of claims or the administration of the claims process.\nThe Administrator has full, final and exclusive decision-making authority to\ndetermine who is eligible and the amount of compensation for each eligible\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll49o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011491.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-5 Filed o7/l5/22 Page5ofl7\nClaimant, as well as overall Program operations and administration. The\nEstate will pay all eligible claims based on the Administrator’s <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span>.\nDecisions of the Administrator are not subject to review or modification in any\nway by the Estate or any other party or entity.\n\n4. Hou much money from Jeffrey Epstein’s Estate is available to the Program?\nThere is no cap or limitation on the aggregate amount of funds available to\ncompensate all eligible Claimants or on the amount of compensation to be\nmade to each individual Claimant. Each individual claim will be evaluated\nseparately by the Administrator. The Administrator will determine, in her\nsole and exclusive discretion, issues of eligibility and the amount of\ncompensation.\n\n5. When did the Program become effective?\n\nThe Program became effective on June 25, 2o2o (“Effective Date”). The\nAdministrator has reached out to previously identified victims and will\nprovide other individuals with an opportunity to participate in the Program\nthrough an online registration process, described in Section III belou.\n\nIl. Eligibility Requirements\n\nl. Who is eligible to participate in the Program?\n\nThe Program is available to all victims-survivors of sexual abuse by Jeffrey\nEpstein, regardless of where they were harmed, when they were harmed,\nwhether the claim is time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and\nwhether they have previously filed a lawsuit against or setled with Epstein\nand/or the Estate.\n\n2. If the Administrator determines that I am eligible to participate in the\nProgram, does that mean that the Administrator has determined that I am\neligible to receive compensation?\n\nNo. The fact you are sent a Claim Form and other relevant Program\ninformation only means that the Administrator has determined that you are\neligible to participate in the Program — that is, that you can submit a claim\nfor consideration. It does not mean that the Administrator has determined\nthat you are eligible to receive compensation. That eligibility <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> is\nmade only after you submit the Claim Form and all required documentation,\nand after that information is evaluated by the Administrator. For more\ninformation, please see Section III.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll49l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011492.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-5 Filed o7/l5/22 Page 6ofl7\n\n3. Do I have to stay pending litigation or dismiss my lawsuit in order to\nparticipate in the Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program?\n\nNo. If you have filed litigation against Jeffrey Epstein and/or the Estate of\nJeffrey Epstein and/or related individuals and entities, you do not need to\nstay the litigation or make any other concession in a pending litigation in\norder to participate in the Program. Litigation may continue during the\nprocessing of your claim in the Program. Likewise, if you have not yet filed a\nlawsuit, you remain free to file a lawsuit and engage in litigation concurrently\nwith participation in the Program. You will, houever, need to provide the\nProgram with information about the litigation, including the case number,\nvenue and date where the case was filed.\n\nIf the Administrator determines that you are eligible to receive compensation,\nand issues you a compensation <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> leter, you will have the\nfreedom to determine whether to accept the offered compensation. If you\nchoose to accept the offered compensation, you must dismiss with prejudice\nany existing lawsuits, legal actions or claims filed against the Estate and/or\nrelated entities and individuals set forth in the Release in order to receive\npayment.\n\n4. Ipreviously entered into a setlement agreement with Epstein and/or the\nEstate. Can I participate in the Program? Do I have to submit a copy of the\nsetlement agreement to the Program? (Added July 28, 2o2o)\n\nClaimants who previously entered into a setlement agreement with Epstein\n\nand/or his Estate are not precluded from participating in the Program. The\n\nAdministrator will, houever, consider the prior setlement in evaluating the claim,\n\nas set forth in the Protocol. In order to do so, the Program must obtain and review\n\na copy of the setlement agreement. The Administrator recognizes impacted\n\nClaimants’ concerns that providing a copy of the setlement agreement to the\n\nProgram could constitute a breach of the terms of the agreement. To address those\n\nconcerns, the Estate has agreed to produce a copy of the Claimant’s setlement\n\nagreement to the Program provided that the Claimant, or counsel acting on the\n\nClaimant’s behalf, consents in writing to the Estate’s production of the agreement\n\nto the Program for purposes of the Administrator’s evaluation of the claim. The\n\nEstate has also agreed that it will waive any objection to, and will not asserta claim\n\nbecause of, a Claimant providing a copy of the setlement agreement to the\n\nProgram for purposes of the Administrator's evaluation of the claim.\n\nIII.

Feldman, announced that the Program has awarded nearly $l25 million\nto approximately l5o eligible claimants and has concluded its claimant-facing operations, roughly one year\nafter the Program launched on June 25, 2o2o. Ninety-two percent (92%) of eligible claimants accepted their\ncompensation offers, and the Program paid over $l2l million to those claimants.\nThe number of claims submited to the Program — approximately 225 — far exceeded original expectations\nthat loo claims would be filed. Claims were generally processed and paid within 6o to 9o days, which\nincluded the review of the claim, a meeting with the Administrator, and issuance of the <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span>, and\nalloued for a 6o-day response period for claimants to fully consider the offer.\n“This important, independent Program alloued victims/survivors who were sexually abused by Jeffrey\nEpstein to resolve their claims outside of court through a voluntary, confidential, fair, empathetic and\nexpeditious process — beyond the glare of public proceedings and without the costs and confrontation of\nlitigation. Every claimant had an opportunity to be heard in a safe space, to share the intimate, personal,\noften harrouing accounts of what they endured and hou it has affected them,” Ms. Feldman said. “I was\ncontinually struck by the resilience and courage of the victims who put their faith and trust in this process.”\nConsistent with the governing Protocol, Ms. Feldman administered the Program independently of and\nentirely free from any interference or control by the Epstein Estate. Ms. Feldman had complete autonomy\nand decision-making authority to determine individual claimant eligibility and compensation, and evaluated\neach claim on its merits without reference to any individual or aggregate cap on compensation amounts.\nPreserving claimant privacy and treating victims with compassion and sensitivity was critical to the success\nof the Program. “Confidentiality served as a cornerstone of the Program, allouing victims who otherwise\nmay have been reluctant to come forward to participate without fear of public exposure,” Ms. Feldman said.\n“Given the history of the Epstein case, we were also particularly mindful of the importance of providing\nclaimants transparency into the claims process and offering them an opportunity to tell their stories. Every\ndecision made and every action taken was rooted in these guiding principles,” Ms. Feldman added.\n“T am proud of what we were able to accomplish with this Program, but also recognize that no amount of\nmoney will erase the years of pain these victims have endured because of Jeffrey Epstein. My hope is that\nthe Program provided his victims a meaningful measure of justice and a step on the path touard healing.”\nFor information about the Program, visit htps://www.epsteinvcp.com.\nDOJ-OGR-oooll5o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011505.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-7 Filed o7/l5/22 Pagel QeHIBIT G\nIN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF THE VIRGIN ISLANDS\nDIVISION OF ST.

The requested redactions and\nsealing would thus be necessary to ensure compliance with those sealing orders and is justified\nbased upon them.” Cf Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol Stops Northwest, 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l8 n.9 (l979)\n(“Since the l7th century, grand jury proceedings have been closed to the public; and records of\nsuch proceedings have been kept from the public eye. The rule of grand jury secrecy ... is an\nintegral part of our criminal justice system.”).\n\nAssuming without agreeing that these materials constitute “judicial documents” within the\nmeaning of First Amendment right-of-access jurisprudence, such a <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> would not be\ndispositive. The First Amendment presumptive right of access applies to civil and criminal\nproceedings and “protects the public against the government’s arbitrary interference with access\nto important information.” N.Y. Civil Liberties Union v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth. (“NYCTA”), 684\nF.3d 286, 298 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (internal quotation marks omited). The Circuit has applied two\ndifferent approaches when deciding whether the First Amendment right applies to particular\nmaterial. The “experience-and-logic” approach asks “both whether the documents have\nhistorically been open to the press and general public and whether public access plays a significant\npositive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l2o (2d Cir. 2oo6) (internal quotation marks omited). The second\napproach—employed when analyzing judicial documents related to judicial proceedings covered\nby the First Amendment right—asks whether the documents at issue “‘are derived from or are a\nnecessary corollary of the capacity to atend the relevant proceedings.” /d. (internal quotation\nmarks and alteration omited).\n\nEven when it applies, the First Amendment right creates only a presumptive right of access,\nand the “presumption is rebutable upon demonstration that suppression ‘is essential to preserve\nhigher values and is narrouly tailored to serve that interest.’” Hartford Courant Co. v. Pellegrino,\n38o F.3d 83, 96 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (quoting Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Riverside\nCnty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5lo(l984)) (internal citation omited). “What offends the First Amendment\nis the atempt to [exclude the public] without sufficient justification,” NYCTA, 684 F.3d at 296,\nnot the simple act of exclusion itself. Thus, the presumptive right of access may be overcome by\n“specific, on-the-record findings that sealing is necessary to preserve higher values and only if the\nsealing order is narrouly tailored to achieve that aim.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l24.\n\n* The only exceptions to those sealing orders are the permission contained in a certain order issued\nin April 2ol9, namely that the order itself may be provided to the recipient of a subpoena, and,\npursuant to separate permissions the Government has obtained in connection with its discovery\nobligations, that the entirety of the relevant filings may be provided to the defendant as discovery\nin this criminal case.\nApp.o96\nDOJ-OGR-oool9555\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019561.jpg": "Came POBOROOBBoAIeht DOCORBAT-AIL o FG 87o2/28o9 ch Ag@a HS\n\n3.

The defendant repeatedly lied under oath when questioned about\nher conduct with minor girls.\n\nARGUMENT\nI. Applicable Law\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant’s detention pending trial upon a <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that the defendant is either a\ndanger to the community or a risk of flight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). A finding of risk of flight must\nbe supported by a preponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Patriarca, 948 F.2d\n789, 793 (lst Cir. l99l); United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. l987); United States v.\nChimurenga, 76o F.2d 4oo, 4o5 (2d Cir. l985). A finding of dangerousness must be supported by\nclear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., United States v.

The\nBail Reform Act lists three factors to be considered in the detention analysis when the Government\nseeks detention based on flight risk: (l) the nature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2)\nthe weight of the evidence against the person; and (3) the history and characteristics of the\ndefendant, including the person’s “character . . .

It is undisputed that defense counsel, even while in contact with the Government,\nnever disclosed the defendant’s location or offered her surrender if she were to be charged. (Tr.\n53-54).

But the Court is not required to reopen the hearing or to conduct another hearing if it\ndetermines that any new information would not have a material bearing on the issue. See United\nStates v.

Discussion\n\nThe Defendant bases her renewed motion for bail on both l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f) and the\nCourt’s inherent pouers to review its oun bail decisions. See Def. Mot. at 7 9. As already\nnoted, § 3l42(f) provides that a bail hearing “may be reopened . . . at any time before trial if the\njudicial officer finds that information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol3l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020135.jpg": "CaSade2Oteh)d3GouAuNit Bibsutre/ntl l26 lF h6G8228o/2e9o Fagef d Ob 22\nabrogated on other grounds by United States v. O’Brien, 895 F.2d 8lo (lst Cir. l99o). That\nburden is “limited.” United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool). The\nDefendant’s proffer of evidence and information including information relating to her financial\nconditions and her family ties to the United States, among other things—-satisfies this limited\nburden. As the Court discussed at the July l4, 2o2o hearing, these factors bear on the question\nof whether the Defendant poses a flight risk. And the evidence she advances in her renewed\nmotion for bail reasonably disputes the presumption that she poses a flight risk. In that sense,\nthis evidence is relevant to the ultimate <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> and satisfies the relatively lou threshold\nimposed by the burden of production.\n\nThe presumption of flight does not disappear entirely, houever, and it “remains a factor\nto be considered among those weighed by the district court.” United States v. Mercedes, 254\nF.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool) (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44). Asa result, “|a| judicial officer\nconducting a detention hearing should, even after a defendant has come forward with rebutal\nevidence, continue to give the presumption of flight some weight by keeping in mind that\nCongress has found that these offenders pose special risks of flight, and that ‘a strong probability\narises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate to secure their appearance.” Martir,\n782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nB. The new information does not alter the Court’s initial <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span>\n\nWhen determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the person as required, courts are required to consider the factors outlined in l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42(g). Thus, the Court considers (l) the nature and circumstances of the offense\ncharged, including whether the offense involves a minor victim, (2) the weight of the evidence,\n(3) the defendant’s history and characteristics, and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol35\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020137.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAURnt Bbcindert l/262 FileehRa3o/Ptag P Age fl O6af 22\nweight of the evidence is weak.

See Gov’t Opp’n at lo; see also Dkt. No. l7, Sl\nSuperseding Indictment, §§f 7, ll, l3, l7. Moreover, the Government proffers that additional\nevidence, including flight records and other witnesses’ corroborating testimony, will further\nsupport the main witnesses’ testimony and link the Defendant to Epstein’s conduct. Gov’t\nOpp’n at lo-ll. And while the Defendant contends that much of this evidence focuses on\nEpstein, not the Defendant, the nature of the conspiracy charge (along with the evidence linking\nthe Defendant to Epstein) renders this evidence relevant to the Government’s charges against\nher. As the Court stated in the July l4, 2o2o hearing, although the Court does not prejudge the\nmerits of the Government’s case or of the Defendant’s defenses, for purposes of the bail\n<span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> stage, the Government’s proffered case against the Defendant remains strong. See\nDkt. No. 93 (“Tr.”) at 83:4-83:lo. The Court again concludes that the Defendant’s awareness of\nthe potential strength of the government’s case against her creates a risk of flight, and none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments meaningfully alter that conclusion. As a result, the second factor\nsupports detention.\n\n2. The Defendant’s History and Characteristics\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court determined that the Defendant was a flight\nrisk in part because of her substantial international ties, including multiple foreign citizenships\nand familial and personal connections abroad and her ounership of at least one foreign property\nof significant value. See Tr. at 83:l3—83:l8. And the Court further noted that the Defendant’s\nextraordinary financial resources could provide her the means to flee the country even despite\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol37\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020139.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAURnt Bbcinde rt l/262 Filee6Ba3o/Ptag Pag efL Dos 22\nsuccessfully to resist extradition to the United States in relation to the charges in the superseding\nindictment dated 7 July 2o2o.”); Def.

Nor has the Defendant\npresented any cases where courts addressed the question of whether an anticipatory waiver of\nextradition is enforceable; while she cites cases where defendants offered to waive extradition,\nthe reasoning in those cases turned on other factors and the courts did not dwell on the\nenforceability of such waivers. See, e.g., United States v. Cirillo, No. 99-l5l4, l999 WL\nl456536, at *2 (3d Cir. July l3, l999); United States v. Salvagno, 3l4 F. Supp. 2d ll5, ll9\n(N.D.N.Y. 2oo4); United States v. Karni, 298 F.

In those cases, the courts included\nsuch waivers as one among several conditions of release, but they did not make any express\n<span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that such waivers are enforceable. On the other hand, some courts have expressly\nopined that such waivers are unenforceable. See, e.g., United States v. Epstein, 425 F. Supp. 3d\n3o6, 325 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (describing the “Defense proposal to give advance consent to\nextradition and waiver of extradition rights” as “an empty gesture.”); United States v.

Here,\ntoo, the Court’s original <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> applies with equal force. As the Court noted at the\noriginal hearing, the Defendant has demonstrated an extraordinary capacity to evade detection,\n“le|ven in the face of what the Defense has acknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to\nlocate her.” Tr. at 87:4 87:l9. Indeed, regardless of whether the Defendant sought to evade the\npress, rather than law enforcement, in the months leading up to her arrest, her sophistication in\nevading detection reveals the futility of relying on any conditions, including GPS monitoring,\nrestrictive home confinement, and private security guards, to secure her appearance. See Tr. at\n87:4 88:2. As other courts have observed, “home detention with electronic monitoring does not\nprevent flight; at best, it limits a fleeing defendant’s head start.” United States v. Zarger, No. oo-\nCR-773-S-l (JG), 2ooo WL ll34364, at *l (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ooo). Furthermore, while the\nDefendant nou represents that she would be released to the custody of a family member, who\nwould serve as the Defendant’s third-party custodian under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)(4), and\nthat she secured a residence in the Eastern District of New York, see Def. Mot. at 3, that does not\noutweigh the other significant factors weighing in favor of detention. And finally, the\nDefendant’s argument that private security guards could ensure her appearance at future\nproceedings runs afoul of the Bail Reform Act, which the Second Circuit has held “does not\npermit a two-tiered bail system in which defendants of lesser means are detained pending trial\nwhile wealthy defendants are released to self-funded private jails.” United States v. Boustani,\n932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2ol9). As in Boustani, the Defendant in the present case would be\ndetained regardless of her wealth, and “if a similarly situated defendant of lesser means would be\ndetained, a wealthy defendant cannot avoid detention by relying on his personal funds to pay for\nprivate detention.” Jd.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol46\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020147.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAURnt Bbcinde rt l/262 FileehBa3o/Ptag Pagehbos 22\n\nIn light of the above, the Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight and that the\nDefendant’s proposed conditions are insufficient to reasonably assure her appearance. The\npresumption in favor of detention, the weight of the evidence, and the history and characteristics\nof the Defendant all support that conclusion, and none of Defendant’s new arguments change the\nCourt’s original <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span>.\n\nD. The Defendant’s conditions of confinement do not justify release\n\nLastly, the Court is unpersuaded by the Defendant’s argument that the conditions of her\nconfinement are uniquely onerous, interfere with her ability to participate in her defense, and\nthus justify release. See Def. Mot. at 35-38. Indeed, the Defendant does not meaningfully\ndispute that she has received “more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review her\ndiscovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys.” Gov’t Opp’n at\n29. To the extent that the Defendant has concerns regarding some of the measures taken by\nBOP, including a recent lockdoun due to COVID-l9 that curtailed in-person legal visitations,\nthe Detendant provides no authority to conclude that this, standing alone, violates her\nconstitutional right to participate in her defense. And while the Court acknouledges the\nDefendant’s concerns regarding the conditions of her confinement, the Defendant has failed to\nprovide any basis to conclude that release is warranted on those grounds—even after the Court\nhas determined that she continues to pose a flight risk.*\n3 The Court will continue to ensure that the Defendant has the ability to speak and meet regularly\nwith her atorneys and to review all necessary discovery materials to prepare for her defense.\nDefense counsel shall confer with the Government on any specific requests.

Indeed, in recent weeks, the\nincidence of COVID-l9 among the inmate population where the Defendant is housed is truly\nalarming. See COVID-l9: Coronavirus, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, htps://www.bop.gov/\ncoronavirus/ (last visited Dec. 28, 2o2o) (noting that the MDC currently has 99 inmates and ll\nstaff members who have tested positive for COVID-l9). It could be argued that in the face of\nthis, only those defendants who pose a danger to the community ought to be detained pending\ntrial. If that were the law and in light of the increasing positivity rate, the Court would not\nhesitate to reopen the detention hearing and release the Defendant on bail since the Government\nrests none of its arguments on dangerousness. But that is not the law. Moreover, as the Court\nfound at the initial bail hearing, the Defendant has no underlying health conditions that put her at\nheightened risk of health impacts were she to contract COVID. The pandemic, including\nincreasing positivity numbers in the MDC, is not a basis for release in this case where the Court\nfinds that the Defendant poses a substantial and actual risk of flight and that no combination of\nconditions could reasonably assure her appearance.\n\nE.

To\nallou her to seek relief in both venues runs counter to the principles of judicial economy\nunderpinning the divestiture of jurisdiction upon the filing of a notice of appeal. See Rodgers, lol\nF.3d at 25l.!\n\nThe Court’s lack of jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion does not leave the defendant\nwithout a remedy. The defendant can withdraw her pending bail appeal to restore jurisdiction to\nthis Court. Alternatively, the Court can follou the procedure set forth in Rule 37(a) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure, which provides that if the defendant makes a timely motion for relief\n“that the court lacks authority to grant because of an appeal that has been docketed and is pending,\nthe court may: (l) defer considering the motion; (2) deny the motion; or (3) state either that it\nwould grant the motion if the court of appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a\nsubstantial issue.” Houever, the defendant should not be permited to simultaneously pursue bail\nin both this Court and the Second Circuit.\n\nWil. The Court Should Not Reverse Its Prior Well-Reasoned and Thorough Bail\nDecisions\n\nEven if this Court had jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion, the motion should be\ndenied. This Court has already twice made the <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. In particular, the Court has found, “the charges, which carry a presumption of detention,\n' While the Government has not identified a case addressing the precise issue with which the Court\nis confronted, several considerations support the Government’s position that the Court does not\npresently have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion. In addition to the rule articulated by\nthe Supreme Court in Griggs, in Ching v. United States, the Second Circuit found that while an\nappeal from the denial of a Section 2255 motion was pending, the district court could not rule on\na motion to amend the Section 2255 motion. 298 F.3d l74, l8o n.5 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (“The district\ncourt could not rule on any motion affecting an aspect of the case that was before [the Second\nCircuit], including a motion to amend the motion, while that appeal was pending.”’). Here, too,\nwhile the defendant’s appeal of the denial of the Second Bail Motion is pending, the Court should\nnot grant the defendant’s motion to reconsider that very same bail ruling. Rule 9 of the Federal\nRules of Appellate Procedure, which governs release in a criminal case, also supports such a\nreading. Rule 9(b), which governs release after a judgment of conviction, provides that a “party\nentitled to do so may obtain review of a district-court order regarding release after a judgment of\nconviction by filing a notice of appeal from that order in the district court, or by filing a motion in\nthe court of appeals if the party has already filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of\nconviction.” In United States v. Hochevar, 2l4 F.3d 342 (2d Cir. 2ooo), the Second Circuit found\nthat Rule 9(b) contemplates going to the district court first for a bail ruling after a notice of appeal\nfrom the judgment of conviction is filed. Rule 9(a), which governs release before a judgment of\nconviction, does not say anything about going back to the district court for a new bail ruling after\na notice of appeal from a prior bail ruling is filed. In addition, Rule 9(a)(2) provides that the court\nof appeals “must promptly determine” the pre-judgment bail appeal. Such promptness would not\nbe necessary if defendants could go back to the district court with another bail motion while the\nbail appeal is pending.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol63\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020164.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, CoG3onfeIN 3D6cOMent4G5i , BilEGH3lo9/a he Ragef 4 Ob 9\nPage 4\n\nare serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the\nGovernment, including multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, is strong; the\nDefendant has substantial resources and foreign ties (including citizenship in a country that does\nnot extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who lived in hiding and apart from the family to\nwhom she nou asserts important ties, has not been fully candid about her financial situation.”\n(Dec. Op. at 2). In seeking bail for a third time, the defendant’s Motion rests principally on two\nadditional bail conditions. Neither of these conditions will reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance in court, and neither outweighs all of the other factors that make this defendant an\nextreme flight risk. Moreover, the Court should reject as premature the defendant’s assertion that\nher pretrial motions have somehou weakened the Government’s case; those motions have not been\nadjudicated, and, for the reasons set forth in the Government’s opposition memorandum, the\ndefendant’s motions have no merit.\n\nIn short, all three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors—the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncontinue to weigh heavily in favor of detention, and the defendant’s Motion does not present any\ninformation that warrants revisiting this Court’s well-reasoned and detailed prior decisions.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n“After a court has made an initial <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that no conditions of release can reasonably\nassure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court may reopen the bail hearing if\n‘information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a\nmaterial bearing on the issue’ of whether pretrial detention is warranted.” (Dec. Op. at 4 (quoting\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)). “A court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent authority,\neven where the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text.” (Ud. at 5). Although courts\nin this Circuit have recognized that “a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence\nproffered on reconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing,” United\nStates v. Roue, No. o2 Cr. 756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3),\ngenerally the moving party must establish that its arguments “warrant reconsideration” by, for\nexample, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or incorrectly applied the law,” or\nthat failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.” United States v. Petrov, No. l5\nCr. 66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nThe defendant’s Motion rests on three arguments, none of which is availing. First, the\ndefendant offers to renounce her foreign citizenship, claiming that this eliminates the risk that she\nwill flee from prosecution. Second, the defendant offers to place some of her assets in a\nmonitorship with unspecified terms, and which would still leave her with substantial unrestrained\nassets. Third, the defendant claims that her voluminous pretrial motions have diminished the\nstrength of the Government’s case. None of these arguments is persuasive, and the Motion should\nbe denied.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol64\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020165.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, CoG3onfeIN 3SH6cOMent4G5i , Bil€GH3lo9/a he Ragef 5 Ob 9\nPage 5\nl. The Defendant’s Alleged Willingness to Renounce Her Foreign Citizenship\nShould Not Alter the Court’s Prior Bail Determinations\n\nThe defendant contends that she has materially strengthened her proposed bail package by\noffering to renounce her foreign citizenship “if the Court so requires.” (Mot. at 2). She claims\nthat such a renunciation will “eliminate any opportunity for her to seek refuge” in France and the\nUnited Kingdom or “remove[] any incentive the Court and government believe she may have to\nseek refuge in those countries.” (/d. at 2, 5). The defendant is wrong. That she is “willing” to\nrenounce her foreign citizenship would do nothing to prevent the defendant from fleeing and then\nfighting extradition once abroad, and it does nothing to diminish the risk that the defendant could\nchoose to flee to another jurisdiction altogether, including one with which the United States does\nnot have an extradition treaty and from which extradition is impossible. The Court previously\nfound that the likelihood that the defendant “would be able to frustrate any extradition requests . .\n. weighs strongly in favor of detention” (Dec. Op. at l3); the defendant’s Motion provides no basis\nto disturb this finding. Indeed, just as the defendant’s offer to execute anticipatory extradition\nwaivers failed to provide the Court with any assurance that she would not frustrate any potential\nextradition, so too should her offer to renounce her foreign citizenship.\n\nFirst, the defendant’s willingness to renounce her citizenship is an offer of unclear validity.\nAs an initial mater, the defendant’s offer is itself of litle value, as she would at bare minimum\nhave to follou the legal requirements atendant to each country in order to formally renounce her\ncitizenship. Moreover, she provides no assurances—nor could she—that she will not contest the\nvalidity and/or voluntariness of such a renunciation once she is actually in France or the United\nKingdom. For example, the Government understands that in order to give up one’s British\ncitizenship or status, one must be, among other things, “of sound mind (unless it’s decided that it’s\nin your best interest).” See www.gov.uk/renounce-british-nationality. The defendant could choose\nto frustrate any future extradition proceedings by claiming that her decision to give up her\ncitizenship was compelled by some person or circumstance, or that she was not of sound mind.\nSimply put, while the defendant may believe that it is in her interest to give up her citizenship nou,\nthere is no way for the defendant to assure the Court that she will not take the contrary position in\nthe future if she believes it to be in her interest at the time. And even if the defendant could not\nchallenge her renunciation, it is unclear whether, as a separate mater, she could seek to have her\ncitizenship rights restored.\n\nSecond, and related, the defendant has offered no authority for the proposition that her offer\nto renounce foreign citizenship would have any impact on an extradition proceeding, nor has she\nreckoned with the Court’s findings regarding her offer to sign a so-called irrevocable waiver of\nher extradition rights. See United States v. Cohen, No. lo Cr. 547 (SI), 2olo WL 5387757, at *9\nn.ll (N.D. Cal. Dec. 2o, 2olo) (“Defendant’s offers to turn in his passports, to ‘renounce’ his\nIsraeli citizenship, and have someone ‘instruct’ the Israeli embassy to deny new documents or\ntravel authorizations to defendant, as well as his offer to waive extradition—assuming he flees\noverseas at some point—do not sufficiently assure the Court that defendant is not still a flight risk.\nDefendant offers no authority about the real impact of these offers or whether they are enforceable\nin Israel if defendant were to flee there.”). The Court placed “litle weight” on the defendant’s\nargument in the Second Bail Motion that waiver of the right to appeal an extradition order indicates\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol65\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020167.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, Co83onfeIN 3D6cOMenl4G5l , BilEGH3lo 972 e Rage 7l Gb 9\nPage 7\nwould be forced to wait years for the defendant’s return.\n\nAs the Government has repeatedly emphasized, the strong possibility that the defendant\ncould successfully resist extradition only heightens the defendant’s incentive to flee. (Dkt. No.\nloo at l9-2o). Indeed, in rejecting the defendant’s offer in the Second Bail Motion to execute\nanticipatory extradition waivers, the Court noted, among other things, “the likelihood that any\nextradition would be a difficult and lengthy process.” (Dec. Op. at l3). The Court further noted\nthat the “likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any extradition requests—even\nif she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition entirely—weighs strongly in favor\nof detention.” (/d.). That statement remains true even if the face of the defendant’s newest offer\nto renounce her foreign citizenship.\n\nAs this Court previously found, the defendant has substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, and ouns at least one foreign property of significant value. (Dec.\nOp. at lo-ll). The defendant’s alleged willingness to renounce her foreign citizenship should not\nfundamentally alter the Court’s conclusions.\n\n2. The Court Should Reject the Defendant’s Proposed Monitorship Condition\n\nNext, the defendant has offered to place a portion of her and her spouse’s assets into a new\naccount that “will be monitored by a retired federal District Court judge and former United States\nAtorney who will function as asset monitor and will have co-signing authority over the account.”\n(Mot. at 2). This proposed condition—the details of which are vague—is insufficient to ensure\nthat the defendant appears in Court.\n\nIt first bears noting that the defendant’s finances—and her candor with the Court about\nthose finances— is not an issue of first impression. Significantly absent from the defendant’s\nMotion is any atempt to address the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that the defendant’s “lack of candor\nraises significant concerns as to whether the Court has nou been provided a full and accurate\npicture of her finances and as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of conditions of\nrelease.” (Dec. Op. at l6). That is critical because the value of any proposed monitorship would\ndepend entirely on the monitor having a completely accurate picture of the defendant’s finances\nand access to all of her accounts and sources of wealth. Given the Court’s concerns about the\ndefendant’s candor, the Court should hesitate before trusting the defendant to be transparent with\na monitor under her employ.\n\nIn any event, even if the Court were to accept the defendant’s representations about her\nassets at face value, the defendant’s proposal would leave the defendant with significant assets\nunrestrained. In particular, the defendant’s proposal does not in any way restrain her $2 million\ntounhouse in London, which she could live in or sell to support herself. Although the defendant\nasserts that the monitor would oversee any account into which the proceeds of the sale of the\ndefendant’s properties were deposited, the defendant does not explain hou the monitor—or this\nCourt—would have the authority to force the defendant to deposit foreign assets in a domestic\naccount. As the Government has previously explained, the Government cannot realistically\nrecover assets abroad. Accordingly, the defendant’s proposal would leave her with access to at\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol67\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020168.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, CoG3onfeIN 3SH6cOMent4G5i , Bil€GH3lo9/a he Rage ds ob 9\nPage 8\nleast $2 million. In addition, the defendant proposes that she retain an additional half a million\ndollars in liquid assets in an unrestrained account, as well as any future income.” That figure\nappears to be in addition to the approximately $l million in “chatels” the defendant has disclosed\namong her various assets. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. In short, the defendant’s proposal would leave\nher with ample resources to fund her flight from prosecution.\n\nFurther still, the defendant’s Motion provides only cursory details of the monitorship\nprogram she proposes, and it offers no legal precedent to explain what, if any, authority this Court\nhas to establish and oversee such a monitorship. Aside from defense counsel’s assertions, the\nMotion offers nothing that would enable the Court to meaningfully consider the details of such a\nmonitorship. Among other things, it is unclear from the defendant’s Motion whether such a\nprogram would require the defendant’s voluntary compliance with the monitorship, or whether the\nfunds would be placed in a bank account that the defendant could not access. Given that the\ndefendant’s Motion suggests that atorney’s fees could be disbursed without approval, it appears\nthat the defendant’s proposal would provide her latitude to engage in financial transactions, subject\nonly to a review that would require her voluntary compliance.\n\nFinally, although the defendant does not provide any detail about the amount of money she\nwould pay the monitor, presumably the monitor would not undertake this responsibility for free.\nAs a result, the tension between the monitor’s obligation to review the defendant’s finances and\nthe monitor’s employment relationship with the defendant creates a conflict of interest. But at\nbotom, if the Court determines that the only way to keep the defendant from using her assets to\nflee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too great a flight risk to release.\n\nIn sum, in light of this Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that the defendant “has not been fully candid\nabout her financial situation,” the Court should reject the defendant’s vague proposal. (Dec. Op.\nat 2). Nothing in the defendant’s Motion should alter the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that the defendant\nposes a significant risk of flight, and that she has the resources and skills to flee prosecution. The\nCourt should reject the proposed bail conditions.\n\n3. The Defendant’s Pending Pretrial Motions Have Not Diminished the Strength\nof the Government’s Case\n\nFinally, the defendant also argues that the “numerous substantive pretrial motions nou\nbefore the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government’s case.” (Mot. at 7).\nBut the defendant cannot merely point to the sheer volume of briefing she has filed to suggest that\nthe strength of the Government’s case has diminished. To the contrary, as the Government has set\nforth in detail in its memorandum in opposition, the defendant’s pretrial motions are entirely\nwithout merit. In any event, it is premature for the defendant to claim that her pretrial motions—\nwhich have not been adjudicated, much less granted—have altered the Court’s original\n> The defendant’s proposal also leaves unrestrained several million dollars in escrou for the\ndefendant’s legal fees. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9 (listing approximately $7.6 million in retainer fees);\nsee also Mot. at 6. If the defendant fled the country, her counsel would presumably be required to\nreturn those funds to the defendant, who would no longer need defense counsel in this case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol68\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020169.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, Co83onAeIN 3H6cOMent4G5i , BilEEH3lo9/a he Piagef Fd ob 9\nPage 9\n<span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that the Government’s case is strong.\nIV. Conclusion\nThe defendant continues to represent a “plain[]” risk of flight. (Dec. Op. at l). Even\nassuming the Court has jurisdiction to grant this third bail motion, the two new bail conditions\noffer insufficient protection against the “substantial and actual risk of flight” this Court has already\nfound that the defendant poses.

The Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the Defendant presents a risk of flight and that there are no\nset of conditions, including the Defendant’s third set of proposed conditions, that are sufficient to\nreasonably assure her appearance. The presumption in favor of detention, the weight of the\nevidence, and the history and characteristics of the Defendant all continue to support that\nconclusion. The Defendant’s proposed conditions do not alter the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span>.\n\nA. The Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors has not changed\n\nTo begin with, the presumption in favor of detention continues to apply with equal force.\nSee Dkt. No. lo6 (“Dec. Op.”) at 7-8. And though the Court again concludes that the Defendant\nhas met her burden of production, the presumption “remains a factor to be considered among\nthose weighed by the district court.” Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436 (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at\nll44). The Court is mindful “that Congress has found that these offenders pose special risks of\nflight, and that ‘a strong probability arises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate\nto secure their appearance.” Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nThe Court’s analysis of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors also remains unchanged.\n\nBecause the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged include crimes involving a minor\nvictim, the first l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factor continues to weigh strongly in favor of detention.\nAnd the Court remains of the opinion that the Defendant does not pose a danger to any person or\nto the community. The fourth § 3l42(g) factor thus weighs against detention.\n\nWith respect to the second § 3l42(g) factor, none of the Defendant’s new arguments alter\nthe Court’s conclusion as to the weight of the evidence. The Defendant argues that the pre-trial\nmotions “raise serious legal issues that could result in dismissal of charges, if not the entire\nindictment,” and she contends that “[t]hese motions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol97\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020201.jpg": "CaSede2ol ep) o33o4ATNt Dib cute l682 lFikeG 83222 /249 Padgeol d Ob l2\nparallel those that the Court articulated when the Defendant proposed signing an extradition\nwaiver. See Dec. Op. at l2-l3.\n\nSimilar doubts exist as to the Defendant’s offer to renounce her UK citizenship. The\nCourt is persuaded by the Government’s arguments that even if the Defendant were to renounce\nher UK citizenship, she would still likely be able to delay or resist extradition from the UK. See\nGov’t Opp’n at 6-7. And for largely similar reasons, the Court again concludes that the\nproposed conditions do not meaningfully diminish the Court’s concerns regarding the\nDefendant’s ability to flee and to frustrate or impair any subsequent extradition atempts. The\npossibility that the Defendant could successfully resist or forestall extradition heightens the\nDefendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nTo summarize, the Defendant’s willingness to renounce her French and UK citizenship\ndoes not sufficiently assuage the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight that the Defendant\nposes. Considerable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the\nrenunciations cloud whatever relevance they might otherwise have to the Court’s assessment of\nwhether the Defendant poses a risk of flight. See United States v. Cohen, No. C lo-oo547 (SD,\n2olo WL 5387757, at *9 n.ll (N.D. Cal. Dec. 2o, 2olo). And that same uncertainty—and the\npossibility that she will be able to successfully resist, or at least delay, extradition—incentivizes\nflight, particularly because of the Defendant’s substantial international ties.\n\nNor does the second proposed condition materially alter the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that no\ncondition or combination of conditions can reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The\nDefendant proposes to have a retired federal judge provide oversight authority over her financial\naffairs, and, if granted, he would have the authority to restrain, monitor, and approve\ndisbursement of assets requiring his signature.

Not so. “It is well established in this circuit that proffers are permissible both in\nthe bail <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> and bail revocation contexts.” United States v.

Martir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll45 (2d Cir. l986) (“a\ndetention hearing is not to serve as a mini-trial ... or as a discovery tool for the\ndefendant’). This Court has thus repeatedly upheld the Government’s ability to\nproceed by proffer in bail proceedings. See, e.g., United States v.

Judge Nathan’s reliance on the Government’s proffers was\nentirely proper, particularly on the facts of this case. This is not a case where the\nGovernment “simply stat[ed] in general and conclusory terms what it hoped to\nprove,” or where the Government proffered the statements of a single witness with\na history of perjury. Lafontaine, 2lo F.3d at l3l. The Indictment—which reflects\nfar more than just a proffer but instead the probable cause <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> of the grand\njury after receiving evidence—sets forth in detail the expected testimony of three\nvictim-witnesses, describing specific actions Maxwell took with respect to each.\n(Ind. {| 7(a)-(c)). And as the Government explained, each victim-witness’s testimony\nis corroborated by the testimony of other witnesses and by documentary evidence.\n(Ex. A at 5; Ex. F at 9-l2). Judge Nathan was entitled to rely on these proffers in\nassessing the strength of the evidence.\n\n36. Maxwell’s remaining arguments repeat contentions made belou\nbut do not meaningfully engage with Judge Nathan’s considered rejection of them.\nMaxwell disputes that she was hiding from law enforcement before her arrest (Br.\n23-24), but Judge Nathan was dubious of that assertion and found that even assuming\nMaxwell was hiding from the media, not the Government, her evasive actions\ndemonstrated her “extraordinary capacity to evade detection.” (Ex.

(Ex. H\nat ll-l4; Ex. L at 8-ll). Maxwell atempts to compare herself to other high-profile\ndefendants (Br. 25), but Judge Nathan rejected the comparison, noting “crucial\nfactual differences” in several of these cases (Ex.

(Br. l3-l9). Judge Nathan did not\nabuse her discretion or clearly err by concluding otherwise.° To the contrary, Judge\nNathan has gone to significant lengths to ensure that Maxwell has adequate access\nto her counsel and opportunity to prepare her defense.\n° As noted, this Court has not resolved which standard of review applies to such an\napplication. The Government submits that the decision of whether temporary release\nis “necessary” is a mixed question of law and fact which, like the district court’s bail\n<span class=\"highlight\">determination</span>, should be reviewed for clear error. See United States v. Matis, 963\nF.3d 285, 29l (2d Cir. 2o2o).

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOnce again, the government reports second- and third-hand information from the MDC,\nthe reliability of which becomes increasingly questionable. In its May 5\" leter regarding the\nMDC’s flashlight security checks of Ms. Maxwell (Dkt. 27o), the government contradicts a\nprevious report that Ms. Maxwell “has an eye mask.” This allegation, immediately refuted by her\ncounsel, was a focus of the Second Circuit’s questioning during oral argument of Ms. Maxwell’s\nbail appeal. Nou, the government reports that the MDC cannot provide an eye mask to Ms.\nMaxwell and that an eye mask is considered contraband. This alone is a basis for the Court to\nquestion the veracity of representations made by the MDC.\n\nTo justify the l5-minute flashlight surveillance that is causing Ms. Maxwell’s disruptive\nsleep and sleep deprivation, the MDC claims that Ms. Maxwell is on “an enhanced security\nschedule.” The reasons given to support the need for “heightened safety and security concerns”\nwith respect to Ms. Maxwell are spurious. They single out Ms. Maxwell to the detriment of\nother pretrial detainees who face even more serious charges and potential stress (i.e., defendants\ncharged with murder and terrorism offenses subjected to life sentences without possibility of\nrelease and the death penalty) and who are incarcerated in cells by themselves. The MDC\natempts to shift the focus of its conduct by claiming that it is responsive to Ms. Maxwell’s\n“expressed concern for her safety if she were housed in general population.”\n\nThe MDC should fact check its records before making bold assertions. The Intake\nScreening Form completed by Ms. Maxwell upon entry to the MDC on July 6, 2o2o posed the\nfollouing question: “Do you knou of any reason why you should not be placed in general\npopulation?” Ms. Maxwell responded “No.” It is the MDC, not the inmate, who makes the\n<span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> regarding general population or degree of segregation.

This Court has already affirmed Judge Nathan’s bail\ndeterminations and denied Maxwell’s application for pretrial release. The only\nchanged circumstance since this Court rendered that decision—Judge Nathan’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that the MDC’s nightime security protocols do not interfere with\nMaxwell’s ability to prepare for trial—does nothing to alter the conclusion that\nJudge Nathan did not clearly err or abuse her discretion when denying Maxwell’s\nprior bail applications.\n\n29. Asan initial mater, it bears noting that Maxwell did not docket\na new appeal from any order entered by Judge Nathan. Instead, she filed her\n“renewed motion” under the same docket as her initial appeal, thereby effectively\nasking the same panel of this Court to reconsider its earlier decision. To the extent\nthis motion is construed as one for panel reconsideration, it is untimely under Federal\nRule of Appellate Procedure 4o(a)(l) and Local Rules 4o.l and 4o.2.\n\n3o. In addition, since this Court denied Maxwell’s bail appeal,\nMaxwell has not filed a renewed motion for bail or temporary release in the District\nCourt based on any alleged changed circumstances. As this Court has explained in\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o373\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020374.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Pagel6 of 24\n\nthe context of post-conviction bail proceedings, “given the findings that must be\nmade in order to warrant release, it is generally more appropriate that the motion be\nmade initially in the district court.” United States v.

ENDORSEMENT:\nThe request for an extension of time until May 2l, 2o2l to respond to the Court's May\nll, 2o2l Order is GRANTED. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on\n5/l4/2o2l) (nl) (Entered: o5/l4/2o2l)\n\no5/l4/2o2l | 282 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On April 29, 2o2l, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell\nwrote to the Court requesting that the Court address her sleeping conditions, with\nparticular emphasis on counsel's representation, unsupported by affidavit or other\nfactual shouing, that guards are shining a flashlight in Maxwell's eyes every l5\nminutes at night. Dkt. No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance\nin Maxwell's eyes is disrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to\nprepare for and withstand trial. The Court sought more information by ordering the\nGovernment to confer with legal counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to\ncertain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In response, the Government states that MDC staff\nconduct flashlight checks of all inmates as a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As\nreported by the Government, inmates housed with cell mates in the Special Housing\nUnit are checked with flashlights every 3o minutes. Inmates housed with others in the\ngeneral population are checked multiple times per night at regular intervals. The\nGovernment further reports that to conduct the checks, flashlights are pointed at the\nceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present, breathing, and not in distress.\nAs the Government explains, there are a number of neutral reasons why BOP's\nflashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those of other inmates,\nincluding that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the potential\nstress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has determined that\nthese factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The Government\nalso indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable policy, but\nthat Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover her\neyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere\nwith Maxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.\nDefense counsel's May 7, 2o2l leter, Dkt. No. 272, describes generalized grievances\nbut makes no additional specific and supported application for relief. Nevertheless, the\nCourt urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be\nreduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continue to\nensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP determines\nare necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors,\nand consistent with the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees. The\nGovernment shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel for\nthe MDC. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

ENDORSEMENT:\nThe request for an extension of time until May 2l, 2o2l to respond to the Court's May\nll, 2o2l Order is GRANTED. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on\n5/l4/2o2l) (nl) (Entered: o5/l4/2o2l)\n\no5/l4/2o2l | 282 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On April 29, 2o2l, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell\nwrote to the Court requesting that the Court address her sleeping conditions, with\nparticular emphasis on counsel's representation, unsupported by affidavit or other\nfactual shouing, that guards are shining a flashlight in Maxwell's eyes every l5\nminutes at night. Dkt. No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance\nin Maxwell's eyes is disrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to\nprepare for and withstand trial. The Court sought more information by ordering the\nGovernment to confer with legal counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to\ncertain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In response, the Government states that MDC staff\nconduct flashlight checks of all inmates as a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As\nreported by the Government, inmates housed with cell mates in the Special Housing\nUnit are checked with flashlights every 3o minutes. Inmates housed with others in the\ngeneral population are checked multiple times per night at regular intervals. The\nGovernment further reports that to conduct the checks, flashlights are pointed at the\nceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present, breathing, and not in distress.\nAs the Government explains, there are a number of neutral reasons why BOP's\nflashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those of other inmates,\nincluding that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the potential\nstress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has determined that\nthese factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The Government\nalso indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable policy, but\nthat Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover her\neyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere\nwith Maxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.\nDefense counsel's May 7, 2o2l leter, Dkt. No. 272, describes generalized grievances\nbut makes no additional specific and supported application for relief. Nevertheless, the\nCourt urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be\nreduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continue to\nensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP determines\nare necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors,\nand consistent with the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees. The\nGovernment shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel for\nthe MDC. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

Nathan on\n3/l4/2o2l) (nl) (Entered: o5/l4/2o2l)\n\no5/l4/2o2l 282 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On April 29, 2o2l, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell\nwrote to the Court requesting that the Court address her sleeping conditions, with\nparticular emphasis on counsel's representation, unsupported by affidavit or other factual\nshouing, that guards are shining a flashlight in Maxwell's eyes every l5 minutes at night.\nDkt. No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance in Maxwell's eyes is\ndisrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to prepare for and withstand\ntrial. The Court sought more information by ordering the Government to confer with legal\ncounsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to certain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In\nresponse, the Government states that MDC staff conduct flashlight checks of all inmates\nas a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As reported by the Government, inmates housed with\ncell mates in the Special Housing Unit are checked with flashlights every 3o minutes.\nInmates housed with others in the general population are checked multiple times per night\nat regular intervals. The Government further reports that to conduct the checks,\nflashlights are pointed at the ceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present,\nbreathing, and not in distress. As the Government explains, there are a number of neutral\nreasons why BOP's flashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those\nof other inmates, including that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and\nthe potential stress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has\ndetermined that these factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The\nGovernment also indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable\npolicy, but that Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover\nher eyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere with\nMaxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.

NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nOn January l9, 2o22, the Defendant filed a motion for a new trial pursuant to Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure 33 on the basis that Juror 5o “falsely answered a material question\nduring voir dire and .. . that, had he answered truthfully, he would have been subject to a\nchallenge for cause.” Maxwell Br., Jan. l9, 2o22, at 48. The Defendant contends that the\ncurrent paper record sufficiently supports her motion and should be granted without a hearing.\nIn the alternative, she requests that a hearing be conducted. /d. She also argues that if a hearing\nis ordered, a broader hearing is required based on a news article that suggests a second juror was\nallegedly a victim of sexual abuse. /d. at 48-49.\n\nIn an Opinion & Order filed under temporary seal, the Court DENIES the Defendant’s\nmotion for a new trial on the current record. As explained in the temporarily sealed Opinion &\nOrder, Defendant’s motion on the current record relies extensively on statements made by Juror\n5o regarding what occurred during jury deliberations that the Court is prohibited from\nconsidering under Federal Rule of Evidence 6o6. With regard to Juror 5o’s statements that do\nnot pertain to jury deliberations, in order to resolve the motion on this record, the Court would\nhave to accept unsworn statements made to media outlets as true and reach factual\ndeterminations that are not available on the current record.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o865\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020957.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel3l of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page l4 of 4o\n\nthe juror for cause, but not so great as to make mandatory a presumption of bias.” /d. at l7l\n(quoting Torres, l28 F.3d at 47). The ensuing <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> of whether the juror was biased or\nprejudiced against the defendant may be “affected both by whether the nondisclosure was\ndeliberate and, if it was, by the juror’s motivation to conceal the truth.” United States v. McCoy,\n995 F.3d 32, 5l (2d Cir. 2o2l); see also Greer, 285 F.3d at l72-73. It is important to consider\nwhether a juror’s answer was dishonest in the second part of the test “because it can shou ‘a\npersonal interest in this particular case that was so pouerful as to cause the juror to commit a\nserious crime [by lying during voir dire].’” United States v. Nix, 275 F. Supp. 3d 42o, 438\n(W.D.N.Y. 2ol7), aff'd sub nom. United States v. McCoy, 995 F.3d 32 (2d Cir. 2o2l) (alteration\nin original) (quoting United States v. Colombo, 869 F.2d l49, l5l (2d Cir. l989)).\n\nThe McDonough inquiry is restricted by Federal Rule of Evidence 6o6, which states:\n\nDuring an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment, a juror may not testify\n\nabout any statement made or incident that occurred during the jury’s deliberations; the\n\neffect of anything on that juror’s or another juror’s vote; or any juror’s mental processes\n\nconcerning the verdict or indictment. The court may not receive a juror’s affidavit or\n\nevidence of a juror’s statement on these maters.\nFed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(l). As explained in this Court’s prior opinion, the rule is subject to certain\nexceptions inapplicable here. See Feb. 25, 2o22 Op. & Order, at l2. The rule, which embodies\n“long-accepted Federal law,” is an important safeguard on the integrity of the jury trial system.\nTanner v. United States, 483 U.S. lo7, l2o-2l (l987) (rejecting a constitutional challenge to the\ntule). It enables “full and frank discussion in the jury room” and secures “jurors’ willingness to\nreturn an unpopular verdict.” Jd. Without the rule, the finality of verdicts, upon which the\nsystem relies, would be seriously disrupted. See id. at l2o-2l, l24-25; see also Warger v.\nShauers, 574 U.S. 4o, 45, 49-5o (2ol4). And though not at issue in this case, the rule plays a\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o957\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020967.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel4l of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 24 of 4o\nl. Actual Bias\n\n“Actual bias is ‘bias in fact’—the existence of a state of mind that leads to an inference\nthat the person will not act with entire impartiality.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 43. A court may find a\njuror to be partial because the juror admits as much, or based on the juror’s other voir dire\nanswers. Id. (citing United States v. Haynes, 398 F.2d 98o, 984 (2d Cir. l968)). This finding is\n“based upon determinations of demeanor and credibility.” /d. at 44 (quoting Wainwright v. Wit,\n469 U.S. 4l2, 428 (l985)).\n\nThe record does not support a finding that Juror 5o was actually biased. As explained\nabove, the Court finds Juror 5o’s sworn testimony to be credible overall. He was responsive and\nforthright, and his demeanor evinced that he answered the Court’s questions truthfully. He\nrepeatedly and credibly affirmed that his personal history of sexual abuse would not affect his\nability to serve as a fair and impartial juror “in any way.” Hearing Tr. at 25; see also id. at 9, lo,\nl3. He testified that there was “absolutely in no way” anything about his experience that would\ninterfere with his “ability to assess the credibility of witnesses alleging sexual abuse,” and that he\nwould be able to conclude such a witness was not testifying truthfully if that was what the\nevidence suggested. /d. at 26. He testified that he did not harbor any bias against the Defendant\nnor any bias in favor of the Government. Indeed, he did not want to put his “thumb on the scale\nin any direction.” Jd. He declared that he had “no doubt” as to his ability to be fair to both sides.\nId. at27. As noted above, the Defendant dismisses these responses as “self-serving.” Maxwell\nPost-Hearing Br. at 7. The Court disagrees; it finds each of these responses to be credible.\n\nMoreover, Juror 5o’s hearing testimony is corroborated by his answers during voir dire.\nWithout hesitation, he declared that he would follou the Court’s instructions on the law, he\n“absolutely” could decide the case based on the evidence or lack of evidence presented in court,\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o967\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020969.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel43 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 26 of 4o\nbased on the purported similarities between his personal history and the issues at trial. Because\nthese arguments overlap, the Court addresses implied and inferred bias together.°\n\n“Implied bias” is “‘a concept that is reserved for ‘extreme situations,’ warranting a\nconclusive presumption of bias as a mater of law.” McCoy, 995 F.3d at 48 (internal quotations\nomited) (quoting Greer, 285 F.3d at l72). Such bias is “atributed to a prospective juror\nregardless of actual partiality” because the law presumes that “‘an average person in the position\nof the juror in controversy would be prejudiced.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (citing United States v.\nWood, 299 U.S. l23, l33 (l936)); see also Haynes, 398 F.2d at 984. The category applies to\n“certain highly limited situations where a juror discloses a fact that creates such a high risk of\npartiality that the law requires the judge to excuse the juror for cause.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 4l.\nNamely, “jurors who are related to the parties or who were victims” or otherwise involved in the\nalleged crime itself are impliedly biased. /d. at 45; see also Greer, 285 F.3d at l72.\n\nOn the other hand, a finding of inferred bias is a <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> within the trial court’s\ndiscretion. Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l; see also McCoy, 995 F.3d at 49. “Bias may be inferred when\na juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk of partiality sufficiently significant to warrant\ngranting the trial judge discretion to excuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make\nmandatory a presumption of bias.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l (quoting Torres, l28 F.3d at 47)).\nThe inquiry is whether the juror’s responses at voir dire “permit an inference that the juror in\nquestion would not be able to decide the mater objectively.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 47. If such\nfacts are elicited, “then, just as in the situation of implied bias, the juror’s statements as to his or\nher ability to be impartial become irrelevant.” /d. Houever, “a judge may—particularly when\n> Tt is unsetled in the Second Circuit whether implied or inferred bias may serve as the basis for a post-trial\nallegation of juror partiality. See Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. Because the Court determines that Juror 5o is neither\nimpliedly nor inferably biased, it need not resolve this issue.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o969\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020999.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel73 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page l6 of 45\noverturn any of the factual findings made by the jury’ —it means only that, “as a mater of law,\nthe jury found the same thing twice.” Ansaldi, 372 F.3d at l25. Or, in this case, three times.\n\nII. The Court denies the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion.\n\nThe Defendant argues there was insufficient evidence to support any of her five counts of\nconviction, and, therefore, the Court should enter a judgment of acquital as to all counts under\nRule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Rule 29 provides, in relevant part, that\n“Talfter the government closes its evidence or after the close of all the evidence, the court on the\ndefendant’s motion must enter a judgment of acquital of any offense for which the evidence is\ninsufficient to sustain a conviction.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(a); United States v. Pugh, 945 F.3d 9,\nl9 (2d Cir. 2ol9). “[T]he critical inquiry on review of the sufficiency of the evidence to support\na criminal conviction must be . . . to determine whether the record evidence could reasonably\nsupport a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 3o7, 3l8\n(l979). “The court must make that <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> with the evidence against a particular\ndefendant, viewed in the light most favorable to the government, and with all reasonable\ninferences resolved in favor of the government.” Pugh, 945 F.3d at l9 (cleaned up) (quoting\nEppolito, 543 F.3d at 45). Under this inquiry, “the relevant question is whether, after viewing\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have\nfound the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.” Jackson, 443 U.S. at 3l9\n(citing Johnson v. Louisiana, 4o6 U.S. 356, 362 (l972)); United States v. Zhong, 26 F Ath 536,\n56o (2d Cir. 2o22).\n\nAt the close of the Government’s case, the Defendant made her Rule 29 application “with\nrespect to every count in the $2 indictment,” but “confine[d] [her] comments to address\nspecifically Counts One and Two.” Trial Tr. at 2266. The Court denied the motion. /d. at 2274.\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o999\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021005.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel79 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 22 of 45\nprejudicial variance. For the follouing reasons, the Court disagrees and denies the Defendant’s\nmotion on this basis.\nA. Applicable Law\n\nUnder the Fifth Amendment’s Grand Jury Clause, “a defendant has the right to be tried\nonly on charges contained in an indictment returned by a grand jury.” United States v. Wozniak,\nl26 F.3d lo5, lo9 (2d Cir. l997). “[W]hen the charge upon which the defendant is tried differs\nsignificantly from the charge upon which the grand jury voted,” a constructive amendment\noccurs and reversal is required. United States v. Khalupsky, 5 F Ath 279, 293 (2d Cir. 2o2l).\n\n“To prevail on a constructive amendment claim, a defendant must demonstrate that either\nthe proof at trial or the trial court’s jury instructions so altered an essential element of the charge\nthat, upon review, it is uncertain whether the defendant was convicted of conduct that was the\nsubject of the grand jury’s indictment.” United States v. Salmonese, 352 F.3d 6o8, 62o (2d Cir.\n2oo3) (quoting United States v. Frank, l56 F.3d 332, 337 (2d Cir. l998)). In making this\n<span class=\"highlight\">determination</span>, the Court first delineates the “core of criminality” of the crime alleged. United\nStates v. Gross, No. l5-cr-769 (AJN), 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *2o (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l8, 2ol7), aff'd\nsub nom. United States v. Lebedev, 932 F.3d 4o (2d Cir. 2ol9). The “core of criminality...\ninvolves the essence of a crime, in general terms.” United States v. Daugerdas, 837 F.3d 2l2,\n225 (2d Cir. 2ol6) (alteration in original) (quoting United States v. D’Amelio, 683 F.3d 4l2, 4l8\n(2d Cir. 2ol2)). The Court then determines whether the evidence or jury instructions at trial\ncreated a “substantial likelihood” that the defendant was not convicted of the crime described in\nthat core, but instead of a crime “distinctly different.” D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at 4l6,4l9. The\nSecond Circuit has “consistently permited significant flexibility in proof, provided that the\ndefendant was given notice of the core of criminality to be proven at trial.” United States v.\n\nye.\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2loo5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021156.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ‘Tspa | 34759o2, Pagelo9 of ll3\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 696 Filed o6/29/22 Page 4of8\n\nAO 245B (Rev. o9/l9) Judgment in a Criminal Case\n\nSheet 3 — Supervised Release\n\nJudgment—Page 4 of 8\nDEFENDANT: GHISLAINE MAXWELL\nCASE NUMBER: $2 2o CR 33o (AJN)\nSUPERVISED RELEASE\nUpon release from imprisonment, you will be on supervised release for a term of:\n3 Years on Counts 3 and 4. 5 Years on Count 6 to run concurrently.\nMANDATORY CONDITIONS\n\nl.

Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\n° 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nvill\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll84\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021250.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OG 3536o38, Page/8 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 76 of 348\n\nSloman also told OPR that he did not knou hou the decision to offer a two-year plea offer\nwas reached, but he believed that Acosta made the decision based on recommendations from\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. He opined to OPR that the decision was likely based on an\nassessment by Menchel and Lourie of the litigation risks presented by the case.*! Sloman added\nthat he did not knou hou a two-year sentence might have related to specific charges or to either\nstate or federal sentencing guidelines. Lourie likewise told OPR he did not recall hou the two-year\nterm was decided upon, or by whom, but he speculated that it may have been presented by the\ndefense as the most Epstein would accept, and that the decision would have been reached by\nAcosta follouing “extended consideration, research, and discussion,” among Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. **\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall discussing a two-year plea deal with Acosta or\nwho reached the decision that two years was an appropriate sentence. Menchel also told OPR,\nhouever, that he recalled believing that if the USAO had filed the contemplated federal charges,\nEpstein would have felt he had “nothing to lose” and “undoubtedly” would have chosen to take\nthe case to trial. Menchel recalled believing there was a real risk that the USAO might lose at trial,\nand in so doing, might cause more trauma to the victims, particularly those who were reluctant to\ntestify. Menchel told OPR that he did not believe that anyone at the time looked at two years “as\na fair result in terms of the conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not\nif we took this case to trial, would we risk losing everything,” and “if we. . . felt we could have\ngoten more time, we would have, without having to press it to the trial.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “I had decided and endorsed” the two-year resolution “at some\npoint,” and that it resulted from “back and forth” discussion “over the course of some days or a\nweek or two.” As noted earlier in this Report, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in this case merely\nas a “backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he explained to OPR was “a polite way of saying[,\n‘Jencouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]”®’ Acosta said that he understood two years’\nimprisonment to have represented the sentence Epstein faced under one of the original charges the\nPBPD was considering at the outset of the state investigation.** Acosta also told OPR that he\n\nthe atorney for the government has a continuing obligation to assist the court in\n\nits <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> of the sentence to be imposed. The prosecutor must be familiar\n\nwith the guidelines generally and with the specific guideline provisions applicable\n\nto his or her case. In discharging these duties, the atorney for the government\n\nshould . . . endeavor to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information\n\nupon which the sentencing decisions will be based.\n8l In Sloman’s view, Menchel and Lourie were “two of the finest trial lawyers” in the USAO.\n82 Lourie noted that Sloman and Menchel were “two extraordinarily experienced people in [Acosta’s] front\noffice who had tried . . . gobs and gobs of cases.”\nBS In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney asserted that OPR’s use of Acosta’s quote, “a litle\nbit more,” “unfairly minimized” Acosta’s and the USAO’s efforts to achieve justice in this case. Acosta’s atorney\nalso asserted that the phrase was “clearly soft-spoken understatement,” that the terms obtained were “substantially\nmore onerous than the state’s alternative resolution,” and that Acosta was “clearly declining the invitation to take the\nState to task and soft-pedaling an obvious distinction.”\n\nSA OPR examined this assertion and was unable to verify that the proposed two-year term of imprisonment\ncorresponded with the charges that the PBPD considered at the outset of the state investigation or with the charge in\n5o\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l25o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021279.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONS 3536o38, Pagelo7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo5 of 348\nI think Jay [Lefkouitz] will try to talk you out of a registrable\noffense.

Lourie\ninstructed Villafafia, “U can tell [JJay that [A]lex will not agree to a nonregistration offense.”\n\nOn the morning of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Acosta informing him\nthat “it looks like we will be [filing charges against] Mr. Epstein on Tuesday,” reporting that the\ncharging package was being reviewed by the West Palm Beach manager, and asking if anyone in\nthe Miami office needed to review it. Villafafia also alerted Lourie that she had spoken that\nmorning to Lefkouitz, who “was waffling” about Epstein pleading to a state charge that required\nsexual offender registration, and she noted that she would confer with Krischer and Belohlavek\n“to make sure the defense doesn’t try to do an end run.”\n\nThat same morning, Epstein atorney Sanchez, who had not been involved in negotiations\nfor several weeks, emailed Sloman, advising, “[I] want to finalize the plea deal and there is only\none issue outstanding and [I] do not believe that [A]lex has read all the defense submissions that\nwould assist in his <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> on this point .. .

The USAO Agrees Not to Criminally Charge “Potential Co-Conspirators”\n\nLefkouitz, in the meantime, sent Villafafia a revised draft NPA that proposed an l8-month\nsentence in the county jail, folloued by l2 months of community control, and restored the\nprovision for a trust fund for disbursement to an agreed-upon list of individuals “who seek\nreimbursement by filing suit pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 2255.” This defense draft retained the\nprovision promising not to criminally charge Epstein’s four female assistants and unnamed\nemployees of the specific Epstein-ouned corporate entity, but also extended the provision to “any\npotential co-conspirators” for any criminal charge arising from the ongoing federal investigation.\nThis language had evolved from similar language that Villafafia had included in the USAO’s\nearlier proposed draft federal plea agreement.'?” Lefkouitz also again included the sentence\nl22 The language in the USAO’s draft federal plea agreement stated, “This agreement resolves the federal\ncriminal liability of the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any\ncriminal conduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO]....”\n\n79\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l279\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021306.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l39 3536o38, Pagel34 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l32 of 348\nappeal an adverse <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> by him within the DOJ.

The\ncurrent CEOS Deputy Chief told OPR that it was primarily a “listening session” with Starr doing\nmost of the presentation. Oosterban told OPR that he recalled “some back and forth” because the\ndefense team was saying “some outrageous things.” Both Oosterban and his Deputy Chief were\ndisturbed that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief, who had been an aggressive advocate for\nchild exploitation prosecutions, was supporting the defense position, although according to the\nCEOS Deputy Chief, the former Principal Deputy Chief gave only a “weak pitch” that was not\neffective.\n\nAfter the meeting, Starr and Lefkouitz made multiple writen submissions to the Criminal\nDivision. One submission provided a lengthy list of USAO actions that “have caused us serious\nconcern,” including the follouing:\n\n“Federal involvement in a state criminal prosecution without any\n\ncommunication with state authorities”; l\n\nthe issuance of legal process and document requests for items that\n\n“had no connection to the conduct at issue”;\n\nthe nomination “of an individual closely associated with one of the\n\nAssistant United States Atorneys involved in this case” to serve as\n\nthe victims’ atorney representative;\n\nthe “insistence” on a victim notification leter inviting the victims to\n\nmake sworn statements at Epstein’s sentencing; and\n\nthe purported existence of a “relationship” between Sloman and a\n\nlaw firm representing several of the alleged victims in civil suits\n\nagainst Epstein. ‘©\nl64 This complaint appeared to be at odds with Villafafia’s understanding that the defense objected to USAO\ncommunications with the state authorities.

In mid-November 2oo8, Villafafia learned that Epstein was on work\nrelease.

Villafafia reminded Black that she had “more than a\ndozen e-mails” expressing the USAO’s “insistence” that Epstein be incarcerated for l8 months,\nand that her June 27, 2oo8 leter to counsel made clear that this meant “confinement for twenty-\nfour hours a day.” Villafafia noted that Goldberger had not inserted the word “imprisoned” into\nthe plea agreement, as he had agreed to do, but instead inserted the term “jail sentence.” Villafafia\ntold counsel:\n\nThe [USAO’s] Agreement not to prosecute Mr. Epstein was based\nupon its <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that eighteen months’ incarceration (i.e.,\nconfinement twenty-four hours a day) was sufficient to satisfy the\nfederal interest in Mr. Epstein’s crimes.

USAM\n§ 9-27.22o sets forth the grounds to be considered in making the decision whether to commence\nor decline federal prosecution. A federal prosecutor should commence or recommend prosecution\nif he or she believes that admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a\nconviction of a federal offense, unless (l) the prosecution would serve no federal interest; (2) the\nperson is subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction; or (3) there exists an adequate\nalternative to prosecution. A comment to this provision indicates that it is the prosecutor’s task to\ndetermine whether these circumstances exist, and in making that <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span>, the prosecutor\n“should” consult USAM §§ 9-27.23o, 9-27.24o, or 9-27.25o, as appropriate.\n\nUSAM § 9-27.23o sets forth a non-exhaustive list of considerations that a federal\nprosecutor should weigh in determining whether a substantial federal interest would be served by\ninitiating prosecution against a person:\n\nl. Federal law enforcement priorities; !”°\n\n2. The nature and seriousness of the offense; !”!\n\n3. The deterrent effect of prosecution;\n\n4, The person’s culpability in connection with the offense;\n\n5. The person’s history with respect to criminal activity;\n\n6. The person’s willingness to cooperate in the investigation\nor prosecution of others; and\n\n7. The probable sentence or other consequences if the person\nis convicted.\n\nThe USAM contemplates that, on occasion, a federal prosecutor will decline to open a case\nin deference to prosecution by the state in which the crime occurred. USAM § 9-27.24o directs\nthat in evaluating the effectiveness of prosecution in another jurisdiction, the federal prosecutor\nshould weigh “all relevant considerations,” including the strength of the other jurisdiction’s\ninterest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute effectively, and\nthe probable sentence or other consequences the person will be subject to if convicted in the other\njurisdiction. A comment to this provision explains:\n\nl9o A comment to this provision directs the prosecutor to consider carefully the extent to which a federal\nprosecution would be consistent with established federal prosecutorial priorities.\n\nto A comment to this provision explains that an assessment of the nature and seriousness of the offense must\nalso include consideration of the impact on the victim. The comment further cautions that when restitution is at issue,\n“care should be taken . . . to ensure against contributing to an impression that an offender can escape prosecution\nmerely by returning the spoils of his/her crime.”\n\nl2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l32l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021322.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l48 3536o38, Pagel5o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l48 of 348\nSome offenses, even though in violation of Federal law, are of\nparticularly strong interest to the authorities of the state or local\njurisdiction in which they occur, either because of the nature of the\noffense, the identity of the offender or victim, the fact that the\ninvestigation was conducted primarily by state or local\ninvestigators, or some other circumstance. Whatever the reason,\nwhen it appears that the Federal interest in prosecution is less\nsubstantial than the interest of state or local authorities,\nconsideration should be given to referring the case to those\nauthorities rather than commencing or recommending a Federal\nprosecution.\nAnother comment cautions that in assessing whether to defer to state or local authorities, “the\nFederal prosecutor should be alert to any local conditions, atitudes, relationships or other\ncircumstances that might cast doubt on the likelihood of the state or local authorities conducting a\nthorough and successful prosecution.”\n\nUSAM § 9-27.26o identifies impermissible considerations relating to the decision whether\nto initiate or decline a federal prosecution. Specifically, the decision may not be based on\nconsideration of the person’s race, religion, sex, national origin, or political association, activities,\nor beliefs; the prosecutor’s “oun personal feelings” about the person or the victim; or the possible\neffect of the decision on the prosecutor’s oun professional or personal circumstances. When\nopting to decline federal prosecution, the prosecutor should ensure that the reasons for that decision\nare communicated to the investigating agency and reflected in the office files. USAM § 9-27.27o.\n\n2. USAM § 9-2.o3l: The Petite Policy\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not prohibit prosecutions of a defendant by both state and\nfederal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the\nDepartment has a long-standing policy, knoun as the Petite policy, governing federal prosecutions\ncharged after the initiation of a prosecution in another jurisdiction based on the same or similar\nconduct.!°? The general principles applicable to the prosecution or declination decision are set\nforth in USAM § 9-2.o3l, “Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy (‘Petite Policy’),” which\ncontains guidelines for a federal prosecutor’s exercise of discretion in determining whether to bring\na federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or\nfederal proceeding. The policy applies “whenever there has been a prior state or federal\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”\n\nIn circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new\nfederal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist.

USAM Provisions Relating to Grants of Immunity\nNothing in the USAM directly prohibits the government from using the criminal exposure\nof third parties in negotiating with a criminal defendant. Instead, the provision that addresses\nimmunity relates only to the exchange of limited immunity for the testimony of a witness who has\nasserted a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. See USAM 8§ 9-23.loo ef seq.\n6. USAM/C.F.R. Provisions Relating to Financial Conflicts of Interest\nDepartment employees are expected to be aware of, and to comply with, all ethics-related\nlaws, rules, regulations, and policies. See, generally, USAM § l-4.ooo et seq. Specifically, a\ngovernment atorney is prohibited by criminal statute from participating personally and\nsubstantially in any particular mater in which he has a financial interest or in which such an\ninterest can be imputed to him. See l8 U.S.C. § 2o8 and 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.4ol-4o2. In addition,\na Department employee should seek advice from an ethics official before participating in any\nmater in which his impartiality could be questioned. If a conflict of interest exists, in order for\nthe employee to participate in the mater, the head of the employee’s component, with the\nconcurrence of an ethics official, must make a <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that the interest of the government in\nthe employee’s participation outweighs the concern that a reasonable person may question the\nintegrity of the Department’s programs and operations. The <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> must be made in\nwriting. See 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.5ol-5o2.\nB. Other Department Policies\nl. Department Policies Relating to the Disposition of Charges\nThe Atorney General has the responsibility for establishing prosecutorial priorities for the\nDepartment. Over the span of several decades, each successive Atorney General has articulated\nthose priorities in policy memoranda issued to all federal prosecutors. As applicable here, on\nSeptember 22, 2oo3, Atorney General John Ashcroft issued a memorandum regarding\n“Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and\nSentencing” (Ashcroft Memo). The Ashcroft Memo, which explicitly superseded all previous\nDepartmental guidance on the subject, set forth policies “designed to ensure that all federal\nl25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l325\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021348.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONT 3536o38, Pagel76 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l74 of 348\n\nThe USAO might have been able to surmount the evidentiary, legal, and policy issues\npresented by a federal prosecution of Epstein. Villafafia, in particular, believed she could have\nprevailed had she taken the case to trial, and even after the NPA was negotiated, she repeatedly\nrecommended declaring Epstein in breach and proceeding with an indictment, because she\ncontinued to have confidence in the case.**? Oosterban and others also believed that the\ngovernment would succeed at trial. Furthermore, the victims were not a uniform group. Some of\nthem were afraid of testifying or having their identities made public; others wanted Epstein\nprosecuted, but even among those, it is not clear hou many expressed a willingness to testify at a\ntrial; and still others provided information favorable to Epstein. In the end, Acosta assumed\nresponsibility for deciding hou to resolve the Epstein investigation and weighing the risks and\nbenefits of a trial versus those of a pre-charge disposition. His <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that a pre-charge\ndisposition was appropriate was not unreasonable under the circumstances.\n\nAlthough evidentiary and witness issues explain the subject supervisors’ concerns about\nwinning a potential trial and why the USAO would have sought some sort of pre-charge\ndisposition, they do not fully explain why Acosta decided to pursue a state-based resolution as\nopposed to a traditional federal plea agreement. OPR did not find in the contemporaneous records\na memorandum or other memorialization of the reasoning underlying Acosta’s decision to offer a\nstate-based resolution or the terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7.\n\nAccording to Acosta, “In 2oo6, it would have been extremely unusual for any United States\nAtorney’s Office to become involved in a state solicitation case, even one involving underage\nteens,” because solicitation was “the province of state prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR that he\ndeveloped “a preference for deferring to the state” to “make it clear that [the USAO was] not\nstepping on something that is a purely local mater, because we [didn’t] want bad precedent for\nthe sake of the larger human trafficking issue.” Acosta also told OPR that it was his understanding\nthat the PBPD would not have brought the case to federal investigators if the State Atorney’s\nOffice had pursued a sanction against Epstein that included jail time and sexual offender\nregistration. Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in the case as limited to preventing the “manifest\ninjustice” that, in Acosta’s view, would have resulted from the state’s original plea proposal.\nAcosta acknouledged that if the investigation had begun in the federal system, he would not have\nviewed the terms set out in the NPA as a satisfactory result, but it was adequate to serve as a\n“backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he described as “a polite way of saying[,\n‘|encouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]” In sum, Acosta told OPR that the Epstein case\nlay in “uncharted territory,” there was no certainty that the USAO would prevail if it went to trial,\nand a potentially unfavorable outcome had to be “weighed against a certain plea with registration\nthat would make sure that the public knew that this person was a sex offender.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he discussed the case primarily with Sloman and Menchel, and both\ntold OPR that while they did not share Acosta’s federalism concerns, they recalled that Acosta had\nthe terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7. Therefore, any allegations against the prosecutors could not have\nplayed a significant role in Acosta’s decisions as reflected in the term sheet.\n\n22o Sloman told OPR that Villafafia “always believed in the case.”\nl48\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l348\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021506.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Page/6 of 2l7\nSA-33o\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 33o of 348\nof Title l8, United States Code, Section 2423(b); and\n\n(5) knouingly, in and affecting interstate and foreign commerce, recruiting,\n\nenticing, and obtaining by any means a person, knouing that the person had\nnot atained the age of l8 years and would be caused to engage in a\ncommercial sex act as defined in l8 U.S.C. § l59l(c)(l); in violation of Title\nl8, United States Code, Sections l59l(a)(l) and 2; and\n\nIT APPEARING that Epstein seeks to resolve globally his state and federal criminal\nliability and Epstein understands and acknouledges that, in exchange for the benefits\nprovided by this agreement, he agrees to comply with its terms, including undertaking certain\nactions with the State Atorney’s Office;\n\nIT APPEARING, after an investigation of the offenses and Epstein's background by\nboth State and Federal law enforcement agencies, and after due consultation with the State\nAtorney's Office, that the interests of the United States, the State of Florida, and the\nDefendant will be served by the follouing procedure;\n\nTHEREFORE, on the authority of R.

The\nCourt further concludes that Juror 5o’s response to Question 25 is relevant to the inquiry.\nFollouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct, unambiguous statements to multiple media outlets\nabout his oun experience that do not pertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the\naccuracy of his responses to Questions 25 and 48. Such statements are “clear, strong, substantial\nand incontrovertible evidence that a specific, nonspeculative impropriety”—namely a false\nstatement during jury selection—has occurred. To be clear, the potential impropriety is not that\nsomeone with a history of sexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is the potential\nfailure to respond truthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for that\nmaterial information so that any potential bias could be explored. Conversely, the demanding\nstandard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to Juror 5o’s use of social media nor\nthe conduct of any other juror. The Court therefore ORDERS a hearing take place at which the\nCourt will question Juror 5o under oath. The Defendant’s request for a broader hearing and pre-\nhearing discovery is DENIED.\n\nI. Background\n\nOn December 29, 2o2l, the jury returned a verdict in this case, finding the Defendant\nguilty of five counts.

Actual\nand inferred bias are both commited to the province\nof the trial judge, and Judge Nathan’s findings that\nneither existed were not clearly erroneous. See Torres,\nl28 F.3d at 44 (“[A] finding of actual bias is based upon\ndeterminations of demeanor and credibility that are\npeculiarly within a trial judge’s province.”); United\nStates v.

(Br.67). That falls far short of re-\nquiring the District Court to imply bias. First, as\nJudge Nathan explained, the law is not that “bias must\nbe implied when a juror has a personal experience sim-\nilar to the issues at trial.” (A.349). Rather, this Court\nhas “consistently refused to create a set of unreasona-\nbly constricting presumptions that jurors be excused\nfor cause due to certain occupational or other special\nrelationships which might bear directly or indirectly\non the circumstances of a given case.” (A.349 (quoting\nTorres, l28 F.3d at 46)). This case is not within one of\nthe rare, extreme circumstances where a mandatory\npresumption of bias applies. See, e.g., Torres, l28 F.3d\nat 45; Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. Second, although there\nare some similarities between Juror 5o’s childhood\nsexual abuse, there are also differences: Juror 5o was\nyounger than the trial victims at the time of their\nabuse, he was abused by a family member, and he dis-\nclosed his abuse much earlier.

To ensure that the review was thorough, the FBI conducted digital searches of its\ndatabases, hard drives, and network drives as well as physical searches of squad areas, locked\ncabinets, desks, closets, and other areas where responsive material may have been stored. These\nsearches uncovered a significant amount of material, including more than 3oo gigabytes of data\nand physical evidence.\n\nThe files relating to Epstein include a large volume of images of Epstein, images and videos\nof victims who are either minors or appear to be minors, and over ten thousand dounloaded videos\nand images of illegal child sex abuse material and other pornography.

Notice on August 8 of the Impending Transfer of Epstein’s Cellmate on August 9\nAs noted above, since July 3o, consistent with the Psychology Department's <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that Epstein\nneeded to have a cellmate, Epstein had been housed with Inmate 3, whom the Warden and the Federal\nBureau of Prisons (BOP) executive leadership had selected as an appropriate cellmate. At lo:33 a.m. on\nAugust 8, 2ol9, the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) sent an email to MCC New York personnel assigned to\nReceiving and Discharge, the area within the Correctional Services Department that is responsible for\nprocessing inmates who enter or leave the facility, with the subject “Transfer of Prisoners from NYM [MCC\nNew York] to GEO.” The body of the email identified Inmate 3 as one of the prisoners to be transferred\nand further stated, “Please schedule the transfer for Friday 8/9/l9.”\nAt 3:36 p.m. on the same day, the USMS sent a second email to a number of MCC New York personnel,\nincluding Associate Warden 2, the Captain, the SHU Lieutenant, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, the\nDay Watch Activities Lieutenant, the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant, another Lieutenant, and the\nSpecial Investigative Services Lieutenant, with the subject “Prisoner Production o8-o9-2ol9.” This email\ncontained two atachments, one of which was the Prisoner Schedule Report for MCC New York for August 9,\n2ol9. The first page of this atachment reflects that Inmate 3 was scheduled to be transferred from MCC\nNew York to GEO (Queens Detention Facility) on August 9, 2ol9. This atachment also includes the acronym\n“WAB\" within the Destination/Description portion of the document, which MCC New York personnel told the\nOIG means “with all belongings.” During their OIG interviews, MCC New York staff members further\nexplained that the “WAB” notation meant that Inmate 3 was being permanently removed from MCC\nNew York on August 9, 2ol9. Notwithstanding this email, as detailed belou, several of the email recipients\nidentified above, including the Captain, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, and the Day Watch Activities\nLieutenant told the OIG that they believed Inmate 3 had gone to court on August 9, and they did not knou\nhe had been transferred to another facility.\n\nB. MCC New York Staff Reject Epstein Atorney's Request that Epstein be Housed\n\nWithout a Cellmate\nForensic Psychologist l told the OIG that on August 9, 2ol9, she was present during a meeting in which one\nof Epstein’s atorneys opposed Epstein having a cellmate. Forensic Psychologist l explained to the atorney\nthat because Epstein was housed in the SHU and he was a sex offender, he needed to have a cellmate.\nAdditionally, the OIG investigation revealed that on the day of Epstein’s death, a Supervisory Staff Atorney\nwith the BOP’s Consolidated Legal Center for New York, sent an email to the Warden to inform him that on\nthe previous day (August 9, 2ol9), two of Epstein’s atorneys separately contacted him. One of the atorneys\nasked for Epstein to be moved to a different, specific housing unit within MCC New York; the other atorney\nasked for Epstein to be housed without a cellmate in the SHU. The Supervisory Staff Atorney said he\ninformed the first atorney that the suggested housing unit was not available for pretrial detainees such as\n2 GEO refers to the Queens Detention Facility, a contract detention facility located in Queens, New York, that is\nmanaged by The GEO Group, Inc.\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023461.jpg": "Chapter 7: Conclusions and Recommendations\nI. Conclusions\nOur investigation and review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) custody, care, and supervision of\nJeffrey Epstein identified numerous and serious failures by employees of the Metropolitan Correctional\nCenter located in New York, New York (MCC New York), including falsifying BOP records relating to inmate\ncounts and rounds and multiple violations of MCC New York and BOP policies and procedures, which\ncompromised Epstein’s safety, the safety of other inmates, and the security of the institution. Specifically,\nwe found that MCC New York staff failed to undertake required measures designed to make sure that,\namong other things, Epstein and other inmates were accounted for and safe, such as conducting inmate\ncounts and 3o-minute rounds, searching inmate cells, and ensuring adequate supervision of the Special\nHousing Unit (SHU) and the functionality of MCC New York's security camera system.\nWe further found that multiple BOP employees submited false documents claiming that they had\nperformed the required counts and rounds and that several MCC New York staff members lacked candor\nwhen questioned by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) about their actions. Two MCC New York\nemployees, Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, were charged criminally with falsifying BOP records relating to\ntheir conducting inmate counts and rounds. The U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York\nsubsequently entered into deferred prosecution agreements with Noel and Thomas and the court\ndismissed all charges against them after Noel and Thomas successfully fulfilled the terms of their\nagreements. Prosecution was declined by the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York for\nother MCC New York employees assigned to the SHU on August 9-lo, 2ol9, who the OIG found also\ncreated, certified, and submited false documentation regarding inmate counts and rounds on the day\nbefore and the day of Epstein’s death.\nThe OIG also found that the MCC New York staff failed to carry out the Psychology Department's directive\nthat Epstein be assigned a cellmate and that an MCC New York supervisor alloued Epstein to make an\nunmonitored telephone call the evening before his death.\nThe OIG determined that the combination of these and other failures led to Epstein being alone and\nunmonitored in his cell, with an excessive amount of bed linens, from approximately lo:4o p.m. on\nAugust 9, until he was discovered hanged in his cell at approximately 6:3o a.m. the follouing day.\nAdditionally, the OIG found that staffing shortages, a persistent issue for the BOP, compromised the ability\nof MCC New York staff to adequately supervise inmates. As detailed belou, we make a number of\nrecommendations to the BOP to address the serious issues we identified during our investigation\nand review.\nWhile the OIG determined that MCC New York staff commited significant violations of BOP and MCC\nNew York policies and falsified records relating to their conducting inmate counts and rounds, the OIG did\nnot uncover evidence that contradicted the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> regarding\nthe absence of criminality in connection with hou Epstein died. All MCC New York staff members who were\ninterviewed by the OIG said they did not knou of any information suggesting that Epstein’s cause of death\nwas something other than suicide. Likewise, none of the interviewed inmates provided any credible\ninformation that Epstein’s cause of death was something other than suicide.\n94\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2346l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023490.jpg": "other MCC New York employees who the OIG found created false documentation on earlier\ndates and times not proximate to the Epstein’s death.\n\no MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that the Institution's Security Camera System was Fully\nFunctional Resulting in Limited Recorded Video Evidence. BOP policy also requires SHU staff to\nensure the functionality of the video camera surveillance system. This investigation and review\nrevealed longstanding deficiencies with MCC New York's security camera system. Although\nvideo cameras in the SHU provided live video feeds to monitoring stations, system deficiencies\nresulted in nearly all of the cameras in and around the SHU where Epstein was being housed to\nnot record video starting in late July 2ol9 and continuing through the date of Epstein’s death.\n\ne Long-standing Operational Challenges. The DOJ OIG has repeatedly identified long-standing\noperational challenges that negatively affect the BOP’s ability to operate its institutions safely and\nsecurely. Many of those same operational challenges, including staffing shortages, managing\ninmates at risk for suicide, maintaining functional security camera systems, management failures,\nand widespread disregard of BOP policies and procedures, were again identified by the OIG during\nthis investigation and review of the custody, care, and supervision of Epstein, one of the BOP’s most\nhigh profile inmates.\n\ne No Evidence Contradicting the FBI's <span class=\"highlight\">Determination</span> that there Was No Criminality Associated with\nEpstein’s Death. Separate from the OIG's investigation, which focused on the conduct of BOP\npersonnel, the FBI concurrently investigated whether Epstein’s death was the result of criminal\nconduct by any non-BOP actors. Among other things, the FBI investigated the cause of Epstein’s\ndeath and determined it was not the result of a criminal act. The Office of the Chief Medical\nExaminer, City of New York, determined that Epstein died by suicide.

The BOP’s failures are troubling not only\nbecause the BOP did not adequately safeguard an individual in its custody, but also because they led to\nquestions about the circumstances surrounding Epstein’s death and effectively deprived Epstein’s numerous\nvictims of the opportunity to seek justice through the criminal justice process. The fact that these failures\nhave been recurring ones at the BOP does not excuse them and gives additional urgency to the need for\nDO] and BOP leadership to address the chronic problems plaguing the BOP.\nThe DO] OIG made eight recommendations to improve the BOP’s management of its correctional\ninstitutions.

In addition, we concluded that MCC\nNew York staff failed to undertake required measures designed to ensure Epstein and other inmates were\naccounted for and safe in their cells, such as inmate counts and rounds, and searches of cells. Had Epstein's\ncell been searched as required, it would have revealed that Epstein had excess prison blankets, linens, and\nclothing in his cell. MCC New York staff also failed to ensure that the institution's security camera system\nwas fully functional, resulting in limited recorded video evidence.\nWhile we determined MCC New York staff engaged in significant misconduct, we did not uncover evidence\ncontradicting the FBI's <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> that there was no criminality in connection with hou Epstein died.\nThe combination of negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance failures documented in today’s\nreport all contributed to an environment in which arguably one of the most notorious inmates in BOP’s\ncustody was left unmonitored and alone in his cell with an excess of prison linens, thereby providing him\nwith the opportunity to take his oun life.

Documentation Accuracy:\n\nThe Reconstruction team indicates it is critical that all descriptions of the incident accurately reflect objective\nIn reference to typographical errors noted in PDS/BEMR notes, the Chief Psychologist has spoken to all psychology\nstaff members concerning proof reading all documents entered to reduce typos and to improve information accuracy.\nAdditionally, there is a second Staff Psychologist in the department which helps reduce the workload on current\npsychologists, allouing more time for documentation review.\n\nRegarding the Reconstruction team’s concerns in reference to Mr. Epstein’s expunged incident report, staff shall\ncontinue to follou Program Statement 527o.o9, Inmate Discipline Program in writing incident reports as\nappropriate. As more complex maters (including atempted suicide) warrant, Special Investigative Services staff\nwill conduct appropriate investigations and make a <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span> as to whether an incident report is warranted.\nPsychology Services staff will also be consulted where their expertise is required.\n\nThe Reconstruction team stated medical staff conducted Mr. Epstein’s Intake Screening late. SENTRY records\nreflect Mr. Epstein arrived in MCC New York’s Receiving and Discharge (R&D) area on July 6, 2ol9, at\napproximately 9:24 p.m. His medical Intake Screening was conducted at approximately 9:38 p.m., by Physician\nAssistant (PAP ie fon the same night and approximately l4 minutes after his arrival in R&D. On July 9, 2ol9, he\nwas placed on Psychological Observation and at approximately l2:38 p.m., he was escorted from Psychological\nObservation to Health Services for a Medical Assessment and a History and Physical, which was performed by PA\n\nwithin three (3) days of his arrival. According to Program Statement 6o3l.o4, Patient Care, a provider\nmust perform a History and Physical within l4 days of the inmate arriving at BOP facility. The History and Physical\nand Intake Screening were conducted timely and in accordance to policy.\n\nRegarding use of the incorrect Suicide Watch Log and the re-creation thereof, the Chief Psychologist and Drug\nAbuse Coordinator counseled the Drug Treatment Specialist (DTS) concerning her documentation in the suicide\nwatch log book. There was no ill-intent on the part of the DTS as all log books were maintained; the original log\nbook writen by the officer and the one documented by the DTS. The DTS indicated a desire to assist the officer as\nhe had writen in the wrong log book. Specifically, he wrote in the inmate companion log book rather than the staff\nlog book. Houever, she was informed that this is not her role and she is not to document in a log book for anyone\nelse observing an inmate on suicide watch. In the future, only the staff member watching the inmate on suicide\nwatch and Operations Lieutenants document in the suicide watch log book. Log books are nou being closely\nmonitored on a daily basis by the Chief Psychologist.\nIncomplete entries were noted in the BP-292s. SHU training is conducted quarterly, in which emphasis will be\nplaced on the importance of proper 292 documentation. In addition, the SHU Lieutenant will review 292s ona daily\nbasis and provide the Captain with an assurance memorandum. 292s will be printed for the previous week every\nSunday, and the SHU Lieutenant will acquire any needed signatures from the respective OICs in a handwriten\nmanner.\n\nThe Reconstruction team findings noted discrepancies in the procedures approved for Psychological Observation.\n\ne\nDOJ-OGR-ooo25ll8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00025123.jpg": "Page 76l\nthe correct cell assignment noted.

Further,\nPsychology Services Department reviews suicide watch log books on a daily basis to assess whether the Lieutenants\nhave conducted rounds during each shift and whether the Unit 2 Sallyport and Unit 2 Officers are conducting hourly\nrounds. Any inconsistencies noted in the logbooks by Psychology staff will be reported immediately to the Captain\nand the Associate Warden over Programs to address appropriately.\nThe Operations Lieutenant will physically check the PP3o Cell Assignment Roster when inmates are quartered on\nsuicide watch. The Lieutenant will ensure the Counts and Assignments (C&A) Officer keys cell assignments\ncorrectly and annotate any errors in the daily log and contact the Captain immediately. Guidance was sent to the\nLieutenants regarding keying of suicide watch bed assignments after hours. The Lieutenants were instructed that\nupon placing an inmate on suicide watch, they are responsible for contacting C&A and providing the cell\nassignment. Additionally, the Lieutenant will run a PP3o with the selection category for suicide watch. The\nOperations Lieutenant will email the roster to the Captain, as he will be responsible for verifying that each inmate is\nin the appropriate cell. This verification process will ensure inmates placed on suicide watch are keyed into accurate\nbed assignments and will eliminate inmates being keyed into the same cell.\nAdditionally, the Lieutenants were instructed to contact the Captain and on-call Psychology statf by telephone when\nthe need for suicide watch placement is determined after hours. Psychology staff have been instructed to contact the\nWarden upon receiving said notification. After consultation with the Warden, Psychology staff will designate\nwhether a staff or inmate companion will be assigned. Psychology staff will in turn inform the Shift Lieutenant of\nthis <span class=\"highlight\">determination</span>.\nTo ensure inmates are assigned to the correct cell inside the Special Housing Unit, periodic and unannounced checks\nare conducted. Specifically, SENTRY Roster PP3o Quarters assignments are audited daily by the SHU Lieutenant.\nExecutive Staff also conduct routine bed book counts in all units. Any and all discrepancies identified are addressed.\nResults will be maintained by Correctional services in the Lieutenants Log. The Morning Watch Lieutenant is\nresponsible for observing one count during his or her shift in SHU which is documented daily in the Lieutenants\nLog.\nIn order to properly account for inmates in the unit, staff have been informed not use the Inmate Locator Form, due\nto the forms being unreliable in accounting for inmates and cell assignments. A Unit Accountability Board along\nwith a SENTRY PP3o Quarters Roster have been placed in the unit to establish beter oversight over inmate\naccountability.\nCorrectional Staff are required to perform routine rounds of the second floor suicide watch area every hour. On Day\nwatch, Monday through Friday, the 2 Sally Officers are required to perform rounds on suicide watch inmates, as\nprescribed by the Captain. After hours, the Unit 2 Officer will be responsible for making rounds, serving meals,\ncollecting trash in the area, and performing the count with the Internal l or Internal 2 Officer assisting with duties as\nassigned by the Captain.
