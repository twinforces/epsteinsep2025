This individual is also one of the employees identified in the Indictment, which alleges that\nshe and two other identified employees facilitated the defendant’s trafficking of minors by, among\nother things, contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with the defendant at his\nresidences in Manhatan and Palm Beach, Florida. This individual was also named and featured\nprominently in the Herald series.\nII. Police Report\n\nDuring the Detention Hearing, the parties referenced a redacted copy of a Palm Beach\npolice report, which was annexed to the Government’s July l2, 2ol9 detention memorandum. At\nthe Court’s request, the Government has provided a supplemental copy of the police report\npreviously filed, with information referred to in open court unredacted. The updated copy of the\npolice report is atached as Exhibit A.\n\nIll. Foreign Passport\n\nDuring the Detention Hearing, the Government informed the Court that it had recently\nlearned that law enforcement agents had seized what appears to be an expired foreign passport (the\n“Foreign Passport”) from a safe in the defendant’s Manhatan residence during the execution of a\nsearch warrant on or about July 6, 2ol9. The Foreign Passport has a photograph that appears to\ndepict the defendant, but lists a different name. Photographs of that passport are annexed hereto\nas Exhibit B. In the same safe, agents discovered what appears to be an expired United States\npassport issued to the defendant, in his true name, within three years of the date on the Foreign\nPassport. A photograph of that United States passport is annexed hereto as Exhibit C, so that the\nCourt may compare the passports, both of which appear to depict the defendant. Because Exhibits\nB and C contain personally identifiable information and <span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span> information relevant to the\nongoing investigation, the Government respectfully requests that Exhibits B and C be filed under\nseal.\n\nThe Government is atempting to obtain additional information about the Foreign Passport,\nincluding hou it was obtained and whether the passport is genuine or fabricated. But the\ndefendant’s possession of what purports to be a foreign passport issued under an alias gives rise to\nthe inference the defendant knous hou to obtain false travel documents and/or assume other,\nforeign identities. This adds to the serious risk of flight posed by the defendant.”\n> The Government has asked defense counsel to advise whether the defendant is currently, or has\nbeen in the past, a citizen or legal permanent resident of a country other than the United States. To\ndate, defense counsel has declined to respond. Certainly if the defendant is, or has been, a citizen\nor permanent resident of another country, that would add significantly to the overwhelming\nevidence of risk of flight.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo44l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000586.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 37-l Filed o7/25/l9 Pagelof9\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\ncee eee ee ee ee ee SS\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA PROTECTIVE ORDER\n- V. = .\n: l9 Cr. 49o (RMB)\nJEFFREY EPSTEIN, ss\nDefendant.\nRICHARD M.

Atention given to the\nEpstein and Maxwell cases has recently intensified in the wake of the July 6, 2o25 Memorandum\nannouncing the conclusions of the Government’s review into the investigation.

What Specific Information Is Being Sought for Disclosure\n\nThe fourth factor asks what specific information the movant seeks to disclose. See Jn re\nCraig, l3l F.3d at lo6. Here, the Government seeks the public disclosure of the grand jury\ntranscripts in the Epstein and Maxwell cases (Epstein Dkt. 6l at l; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at l). As\nstated in the pending motions, any public disclosure granted by the Court would be “subject to\nappropriate redactions of victim-related and other personal identifying information” (Epstein\nDkt. 6l at 2; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at 2).\n\n5. Hou Long Ago the Grand Jury Proceedings Took Place\n\nThe fifth factor asks hou long ago the grand jury proceedings took place. Jn re Craig, l3l\nF.3d at lo6. The grand jury met in June and July of 2ol9 in the Epstein case. The grand jury met\nin June and July of 2o2o and March of 2o2l in the Maxwell case. Here, the passage of time has\nnot dulled the public’s interest in these cases. See In re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo7 (“if historical interest\nin a specific case has persisted over a number of years, that serves as an important indication that\nthe public’s interest in release of the information is substantial”).\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo75l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000753.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document66- Filed o7/29/25 Page 8 of lo\nGovernment is providing under seal a list of witnesses whose accounts were conveyed in the grand\njury proceedings and a corresponding list noting which witnesses testified at trial.\n\n8. Whether Witnesses to the Grand Jury Proceedings Who Might Be\nAffected by Disclosure Are Still Alive\n\nThe eighth factor considers “whether witnesses to the grand jury proceedings who might\nbe affected by disclosure are still alive.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6.\n\nHere, there was one witness—an FBI agent—during the Epstein grand jury proceedings.\nThere were two witnesses—the same FBI agent from the Epstein grand jury proceedings and a\ndetective with the NYPD who was a Task Force Officer with the FBI’s Child Exploitation and\nHuman Trafficking Task Force—during the Maxwell grand jury proceedings.\n\nBoth witnesses are still alive; the FBI agent continues to be an agent with the FBI, and the\nDetective continues to be a Detective with the NYPD as well as a Task Force Officer.\n\nConsistent with applicable rules concerning the admissibility of hearsay testimony, the\ngrand jury witnesses described statements of others, including statements of and concerning\nvictims, many of whom are still alive. In the sealed submission accompanying this filing, the\nGovernment will note which victims are still alive.\n\n9. Whether There Is an Additional Need for Maintaining Secrecy in the\nParticular Case in Question\n\nFinally, the ninth factor considers “the additional need for maintaining secrecy in the\nparticular case in question.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6. In addition to the typical reasons for\ngrand jury secrecy, the grand jury transcripts contain victim-related and other personal identifying\ninformation related to third parties who neither have been charged or alleged to be involved in the\ncrimes with which Epstein and Maxwell were charged, to which the Government is <span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span>, and\nwhich is why the Government proposes redacting the transcripts before releasing them.

Berman, U.S.D.J.\n\nDear Hon. Judge Berman:\n\nAs a suffering victim of Epstein and his co-conspirators, I would like to highlight some\nthings that stand out to me and for many reasons on the latest ‘memo’ writen by an anonymous\nmember of the DOJ.\n\nOne, I am not sure the highest priority here is the victims, justice for the victims or\ncombating child exploitation, or at least I do not feel this way. If there was justice for the victims\nwe would see some kind of accountability for the years they alloued this horrible human being,\nif you can call him that, to prey on underage and young girls while jet-seting around the world\nwith high-profile individuals and/or entrapping his victims in his various mansions and/or his\nnotorious private island. And to make maters more severe continued to traffic, rape and assault\nvictims while on prison work-release and/or even after being a registered sex offender for about a\ndecade. Rather, I feel like the DOJ’s and FBI’s priority is protecting the “third-party”, the\nwealthy men by focusing on scrubbing their names off the files of which the victims, “knou who\nthey are”. To learn that our oun president has utilized thousands of agents to protect his identity\nand these high-profile individuals is monumentally mind-blouing. That is their focus? Wou!\n\nTwo, the fact that he “Killed himself” in prison leaves us all empty, without answers,\nwithout resolution, with the ongoing conspiracy that will never die. I ask myself every day, what\nhappened? Did he really “Kill himself’? Is he still alive? Where is he buried? Why didn’t we get\nto see his dead body? This all leaves me fearful, angry and rightfully devastated and damaged.\n\nThree, the latest atention on the “Epstein Files”, the “Client List” is OUT OF CONTROL\nand the ones that are left to suffer are not the high-profile individuals, IT IS THE VICTIMS.\n\nWhy the lack of concern in handling such <span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span> information for the victims sake?\n\nI appreciate your time reading my short thoughts and feeling and my anxiety and\nfrustration is NOT aimed at you, obviously. It is aimed at the very government here, the ones\nasking to release these transcripts, exhibits, etc., of which the victims are not privy to while they\nhave concluded that there is nothing more to see on the files they hold. Yet no one has seen them,\nbut them. I am beside myself.\n\nI think what I would request from you, your honor, is to consider having an approved\nthird-party review these documents to ensure that NO victims names or likenesses are revealed\nthrough this release. It is imperative with the scrutiny over this media frenzy that the victims are\ncompletely and entirely protected.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo757\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000758.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 68 Filed o8/o4/25 Page 2 of 2\nAugust 4, 2o25 Page 2\nThank you so much for your time.\nI have atached the portion of the DOJ’s memo and link to their statement.\n[Consistent with prior disclosures, this review confirmed that Epstein harmed over one\nthousand victims.

As set forth above, the government’s hyperbolic claim that\nit can “ensure that the defense will be fully prepared to proceed to trial on July l2, 2o2l” (Govt\nItr at 4-5) ignores the reality that time is needed to:\n\n= supplement pending pretrial motions;\n\n* critically review voluminous discovery produced in November 2o2o that the\ngovernment represented was not relevant to the case against Ms. Maxwell;\n\n= re-review discovery for the new time period and charges;\n\n= commence new investigations based on the new charges and the government’s\ndisclosure of 35oo material for non-testifying witnesses; and\n\n« refocus trial preparation and strategy.\n\nThe government originally represented to the Court and counsel that this trial would last\ntwo weeks.

Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 2\nThe defendant’s demand that she and her counsel be permited to name any individuals who have\never publicly identified themselves as a victim of either Epstein or the defendant in any “public\nfora,” and at any time, without limitation, is extraordinarily broad, unnecessary, and inappropriate,\nand should be denied.\n\nAs an initial mater, there can be no serious question that there are significant privacy and\nvictim interests at issue here, which the Government Proposed Order seeks to protect. Particularly\nin the context of victim witnesses, there are compelling reasons to limit public disclosure of victim\nidentities and other <span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span> information. Indeed, the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, l8 U.S.C. §\n377l, requires district courts to implement procedures to ensure that crime victims are accorded,\namong other rights, “[t]he right to be reasonably protected from the accused,” in addition to “[t]he\nright to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim’s dignity and privacy.” Id. §§\n(a)(l), (a)(8) (emphasis added). Moreover, “the public generally has a strong interest in protecting\nthe identities of . . . victims so that other victims will not be deterred from reporting such crimes.”\nUnited States v. Paris, 2oo7 WL l484974, at *2 (D. Conn. May l8, 2oo7).\n\nMoreover, and consistent with those interests, courts in this Circuit have routinely\nacknouledged the need to protect victim-witness identities. See, e.g., United States v. Corley,\nl3 Cr. 48 (AJN), 2ol6 WL 9o225o8, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6) (“Because Corley’s minor\nvictims have significant privacy and safety interests at stake, while Corley’s interests are minimal,\nthe Court finds good cause to modify the protective order in this case to prevent Corley from\nlearning the surnames of the minor victims.”); United States v. Kelly, o7 Cr. 374 (SJ), 2oo8 WL\n5o6882o, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. July lo, 2oo8) (“Given the potentially explicit nature of the government\nwitnesses’ expected testimony, the government argues that it is necessary to conceal their identity\nto protect them from public humiliation and embarrassment. This Court agrees. Thus, the parties\n[. . .] are hereby prohibited from releasing to anyone, including members of the press, the identity\nor any identifying information of the government’s witnesses.”). It is similarly routine in this\nDistrict for parties in a criminal case to refer to witnesses by pseudonyms (such as “Victim-l” or\n‘“‘Witness-l’’) to protect the privacy interests of third parties unless and until they testify publicly.\n\nThe Government’s proposed order endeavors to protect those interests by generally\nrequiring the parties to abstain from identifying any victim by name in any public statement or\nfiling while also ensuring that the defendant and her counsel are fully able to prepare for trial.\nIndeed, to facilitate the defendant’s investigation and preparation for trial, the Government’s\nproposal makes clear that defense counsel and defense staff, including defense investigators,\nshould not be prohibited from referencing identities of individuals in conversations with\nprospective witnesses, so long as those witnesses and their counsel abstain from further disclosing\nor disseminating any such identities. See Government Proposed Order § 5. The terms of the\nGovernment’s proposed order also would permit defense counsel to refer to any individual by\nname in any filing under seal, merely requiring redaction of identifying information or the use of\na pseudonym in public filings. The Government further proposes that defense counsel not be\nprohibited from publicly referencing individuals who have spoken—or who at some future time\nor deletes language in furtherance of its desire to publicly reference victim identities in defense\nparagraphs 7, 9, and l7 (which are Government Proposed Order paragraphs 6, 7, and l6).\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool665\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001671.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 33-l Filed o7/28/2o Page l of l2\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\neee ee ee eR\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA ORO OER\n—-  - ;\n: 2o Cr. 33o (AUN)\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, :\nDefendant. :\nSo LL Lg\nALISON J.

Epstein, l9-CR-oo49o-\nRMB (Dkt. 38 § 4).!\n\nThe government’s position would unfairly limit the defense, and goes further than is\nrequired to protect valid privacy interests. More to the point, it does not meet the government’s\nburden under the law. As this Court recently recognized in Hernandez v. Kirby Forensic\nPsychiatric Hosp., No. l4-CV-59lo (AJN), 2ol9 WL 464oo54 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 24, 2ol9), an\nindividual’s privacy interest in <span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span> information is relinquished by knouing and intentional\npublic disclosure. In that case, the plaintiff alleged that hospital staff violated his privacy rights\nby disclosing his HIV status to patients and other staff. Nevertheless, because the plaintiff had,\nhimself, disclosed his HIV status to the entire hospital ward, he “forfeited any reasonable\nexpectation that this information would remain confidential[.]” /d. at *5; see also In re Avaya,\nInc., No. l7-loo89 (SMB), 2ol9 WL l75o9o8, at *7 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. Mar. 28, 2ol9) (“[A]\nperson waives his right to privacy when he puts the private information at issue in a lawsuit.”);\nSmith v. NBC Universal, 524 F. Supp. 2d 3l5, 328-29 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (holding that facts\ndisclosed in video broadcast on national television with plaintiff's express permission “cannot be\nconsidered private”); id. at n. 84 (“There is no liability when the defendant merely gives further\npublicity to information about the plaintiff that is already public.”) (quoting Restatement\n(Second) of Torts § 652D cmt. b (l977)). The cases that the government cites in its leter are\ninapposite, as none addressed the privacy rights of victims and witnesses who had voluntarily\ndisclosed their identities to the public. (Gov. Resp. at 2.).”\n\nMoreover, the language proposed by the defense will permit it to conduct a full and\nmeaningful investigation, upon receiving the discovery, which is required for the effective\nassistance of counsel. Our client, of course, is presumed innocent, and intends to fight the\ncharges against her. The defense believes that there are individuals who have exculpatory\nevidence concerning Ms. Maxwell, and information bearing on the credibility of the alleged\nvictims and witnesses. Although the government’s proposed protective order would allou for\nsome investigation in this regard, permiting defense counsel and defense investigators to\n' The government indicates that there may be alleged victims and witnesses who have chosen to remain anonymous.\n(Gov't Resp. at 4). As reflected in our proposed order, the defense has agreed not to mention publicly the identities\nof any such individuals. Instead, to satisfy its burden, the government posits a series of “hypothetical examples”\nrelating to individuals and the type of interactions they may have had with various public fora. (d.). Hypothetical\nexamples are not a shouing of “good cause.” Moreover, the defense cannot address these scenarios without\nknouing if they relate to actual persons, and if so, the nature of such interactions.\n\n° See United States v.

The district court recognized “the <span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span> nature of the charges and the difficulties facing\nrape victims,” but found that “the defendant’s ability to adequately prepare a defense against this\ncharge [would be] significantly compromised without being advised of the identity of the alleged\nvictim.” Jd. at *2. The district court found that disclosure was appropriate because, as in this\ncase (l) the defendant was seeking disclosure of the identity of an alleged victim who was the\nbasis for a specific crime charged in the indictment, and not just a government witness; (i) the\nindictment did not state “the exact dates” of the alleged abuse or the prior encounters between\nthe defendant and the alleged victim; and (i) the government did not articulate any basis to\nconclude that the alleged victim would be subject to intimidation or would refuse to appear at\ntrial as a result of the disclosure. /d. For the same reasons articulated in Warme, this Court\nshould order the government to disclose immediately the identities of three alleged victims\nreferenced in the indictment, subject to the terms of the protective order.”\n\n2. Ms. Maxwell’s Conditions of Confinement and Access to Discovery\n\nThe government asserts that Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement should be left to\nthe discretion of the BOP. (Gov’t Resp. at 4). But the BOP cannot be the sole arbiter on these\nissues if the conditions of Ms. Maxwell’s confinement impact her right to a fair trial and to\nmeaningfully prepare her defense. Indeed, under the BOP’s original plan, Ms. Maxwell would\nhave been forced to choose between taking a shouer and reviewing the voluminous discovery in\nthis case. It is only because the defense filed its motion that the BOP modified its original plan\nand gave Ms. Maxwell increased access to the discovery two days later. We nou understand,\nand the government has confirmed, that Ms. Maxwell can review discovery from 7:oo a.m. to\n8:oo p.m. every day of the week. (/d. at 5). We respectfully ask the Court to confirm these\nchanges in an order to the BOP.\n\nHouever, the defense continues to believe that Ms. Maxwell is being subjected to\nuniquely onerous conditions of confinement because of the death of Mr. Epstein in BOP custody.\nFor example, Ms. Maxwell continues to be surveilled 24 hours a day by security cameras and is\n° The government atempts to distinguish Warme by asserting that, unlike Warme, the indictment in this case\n“describes relevant time periods and events, including referring to the defendant’s conversations with victims,\ninteractions with victims, and specific relevant locations.” (Gov’t Resp. at 3). That is incorrect. In fact, the\nindictment in Warme was far more specific as to the dates of the relevant events, alleging that the rape took place\n“sometime in and around October of 2oo6.” Warme, 2oo9 WL 427ll, at *2. By contrast, the indictment in this\ncase alleges vague instances of “grooming” that supposedly took place over the course of a year (in the case of\nVictim 2), two years (in the case of Victim 3), or even four years (in the case of Victim l). Those are hardly “exact\ndates.” The criminal complaint in Warme also alleged specific interactions between the defendant and the alleged\nvictim; namely, that they “had met and exchanged phone numbers perhaps as long as lo months prior to the alleged\nrape.” Jd. Nevertheless, the district court held that the defendant’s right to prepare his defense required disclosure\nof the identity of the alleged victim and outweighed any privacy interest that the victim might have.

These materials relate to abuse that post-\ndated the time period charged in the Indictment, and the Government does not intend to offer them\nat trial. Although the Government intends to produce these materials to the defendant in advance\nof trial, premature disclosure of these materials could jeopardize the Government’s ongoing\ninvestigation and would reveal <span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span> victim information months in advance of trial. For these\nreasons and as set forth belou, the Government respectfully submits, pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), that good cause exists to delay disclosure of these items to defense\ncounsel until eight weeks prior to trial.! The Government has conferred with defense counsel,\nwho have indicated that they object to this request and intend to submit a leter in opposition.\n\nAs the Court is aware, the superseding indictment in this case (the “Indictment”) charges\nthe defendant in six counts. Count One of the Indictment charges Maxwell with conspiring with\nEpstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C.\n' Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6 provides for the production of discovery to a defendant,\nupon request, of certain materials, such as documents that are material to the preparation of the\ndefense and documents the Government intends to use in its case-in-chief at trial.

Count Two of the Indictment charges Maxwell with enticing a minor to travel to engage in\nillegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2422 and 2. Count Three of the Indictment charges\nMaxwell with conspiring with Epstein and others to transport minors to participate in illegal sex\nacts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §37l.

Counts\nFive and Six charge Maxwell with perjury, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l623. Counts One through\nFour focus on conduct between approximately l994 and l997.\n\nThe charges in the Indictment arose out of a broader investigation into Epstein’s sexual\nabuse of minors, which covered time periods beyond that included in the Indictment. During the\ncourse of that broader investigation, the Government has interviewed dozens of victims who were\nsexually abused by Epstein. As part of that broader investigation, the Government has obtained a\nlimited number of <span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span> documents and photographs regarding certain victims who were\nsexually abused by Epstein after l997 (the “Materials”). These Materials include, for example,\nschool photographs of certain victims and records, such as bank and travel records, for certain\nvictims. The Government does not anticipate offering these Materials as evidence at trial in this\ncase, and the Materials do not relate to individuals whom the Government currently anticipates\ncalling as witnesses at trial. Moreover, the Materials post-date the time period charged in the\nIndictment.\n\nThe Government has reviewed the Materials for any potentially exculpatory material, and\nhas found none. Nevertheless, because the Government is taking an expansive approach to\ndisclosures in this case, the Government intends to produce these Materials to the defendant along\nwith 35oo material for non-testifying witnesses sufficiently in advance of trial in order to enable\nthe defendant to review and, if appropriate, make use of the Materials in her defense. In particular,\nthe Government intends to produce to the defendant, pursuant to a protective order, statements of\nall witnesses the Government has interviewed during its broader investigation, even if the\nGovernment does not intend to call those witnesses at trial. Should the Court grant the instant\napplication, the Government would produce the Materials, along with any witness statements\npertaining to the victims identified in the Materials, at the same time as all other statements by\nnon-testifying witnesses. The Government is prepared to make that production as early as eight\nweeks in advance of trial. Because the volume of the Materials is limited to approximately 4o\nphotographs and approximately 4o pages of documents, defense counsel’s review of the Materials\nis unlikely to be unduly time consuming, thus minimizing any potential prejudice to the defendant\nfrom the delayed production.\n\nDelayed disclosure of the Materials is warranted because they include identifying\ninformation for victims who are not expected to testify in this case and who have provided\ninformation as part of the Government’s ongoing investigation, the immediate disclosure of which\nwould risk interfering with the Government’s ongoing investigation. See United States v.\nMannino, 48o F. Supp. ll82, ll88 (S.D.N.Y. l979) (permiting delayed production of documents\nwhose immediate disclosure to the defense would interfere with ongoing investigation); cf’ United\nStates v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 5o6, 53l-32 (2d Cir. 2ol3) (risk of interference with ongoing\ninvestigation sufficient good cause for entry of Rule l6 protective order).

Second, an order requiring the immediate production of these Materials would risk\ndeterring other victims from coming forward to be interviewed and from providing evidence to the\nGovernment.

Although the Government intends to produce these materials to the defendant in advance\nof trial, premature disclosure of these materials could jeopardize the Government’s ongoing\ninvestigation and would reveal <span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span> victim information months in advance of trial. For these\nreasons and as set forth belou, the Government respectfully submits, pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), that good cause exists to delay disclosure of these items to defense\ncounsel until eight weeks prior to trial.! The Government has conferred with defense counsel,\nwho have indicated that they object to this request and intend to submit a leter in opposition.\n\nAs the Court is aware, the superseding indictment in this case (the “Indictment”) charges\nthe defendant in six counts. Count One of the Indictment charges Maxwell with conspiring with\nEpstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C.\n\n! Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6 provides for the production of discovery to a defendant,\nupon request, of certain materials, such as documents that are material to the preparation of the\ndefense and documents the Government intends to use in its case-in-chief at trial. Houever, Rule\nl6(d)(l) also provides that:\n\nAt any time the court may, for good cause, deny, restrict, or defer\n\ndiscovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief. The court\n\nmay permit a party to shou good cause by a writen statement that\n\nthe court will inspect ex parte.\nA finding of good cause ““‘must be based on a particular factual demonstration of potential harm,\nnot on conclusory statements.”” United States v.

Count Four of the Indictment charges Maxwell with\ntransporting minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2423 and 2. Counts\nFive and Six charge Maxwell with perjury, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l623. Counts One through\nFour focus on conduct between approximately l994 and l997.\n\nThe charges in the Indictment arose out of a broader investigation into Epstein’s sexual\nabuse of minors, which covered time periods beyond that included in the Indictment. During the\ncourse of that broader investigation, the Government has interviewed dozens of victims who were\nsexually abused by Epstein. As part of that broader investigation, the Government has obtained a\nlimited number of <span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span> documents and photographs regarding certain victims who were\nsexually abused by Epstein after l997 (the “Materials”). These Materials include, for example,\nschool photographs of certain victims and records, such as bank and travel records, for certain\nvictims. The Government does not anticipate offering these Materials as evidence at trial in this\ncase, and the Materials do not relate to individuals whom the Government currently anticipates\ncalling as witnesses at trial. Moreover, the Materials post-date the time period charged in the\nIndictment.\n\nThe Government has reviewed the Materials for any potentially exculpatory material, and\nhas found none. Nevertheless, because the Government is taking an expansive approach to\ndisclosures in this case, the Government intends to produce these Materials to the defendant along\nwith 35oo material for non-testifying witnesses sufficiently in advance of trial in order to enable\nthe defendant to review and, if appropriate, make use of the Materials in her defense. In particular,\nthe Government intends to produce to the defendant, pursuant to a protective order, statements of\nall witnesses the Government has interviewed during its broader investigation, even if the\nGovernment does not intend to call those witnesses at trial. Should the Court grant the instant\napplication, the Government would produce the Materials, along with any witness statements\npertaining to the victims identified in the Materials, at the same time as all other statements by\nnon-testifying witnesses. The Government is prepared to make that production as early as eight\nweeks in advance of trial. Because the volume of the Materials is limited to approximately 4o\nphotographs and approximately 4o pages of documents, defense counsel’s review of the Materials\nis unlikely to be unduly time consuming, thus minimizing any potential prejudice to the defendant\nfrom the delayed production.\n\nDelayed disclosure of the Materials is warranted because they include identifying\ninformation for victims who are not expected to testify in this case and who have provided\ninformation as part of the Government’s ongoing investigation, the immediate disclosure of which\nwould risk interfering with the Government’s ongoing investigation. See United States v.\nMannino, 48o F. Supp. ll82, ll88 (S.D.N.Y. l979) (permiting delayed production of documents\nwhose immediate disclosure to the defense would interfere with ongoing investigation); cf’ United\nStates v. Smith, 985 F.

First,\ndisclosure would tend to reveal to the defendant the scope of and evidence gathered during the\nGovernment’s ongoing investigation, the details of which are not currently public or knoun to the\ndefendant. Second, an order requiring the immediate production of these Materials would risk\ndeterring other victims from coming forward to be interviewed and from providing evidence to the\nGovernment. Victims who may be considering cooperating with the Government’s investigation\nmay decline to do so if they believe that the information they provide—even information outside\nthe period charged in the Indictment—must be immediately disclosed to the defense in this case.\nGiven the sensitivity of the Materials, the need to protect the Government’s ongoing investigation,\nand the minimal (if any) relevance of the Materials to the offenses charged in the Indictment, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that good cause exists pursuant to Rule l6(d) to delay their\ndisclosure.\nAccordingly, the Government respectfully requests that the Court approve the\n\nGovernment’s request to delay disclosure of these Materials.\n\nRespectfully submited,\n\nAUDREY STRAUSS\n\nActing United States Atorney\n\nMaurene Comey / Alison Moe / Lara Pomerantz\n\nAssistant United States Atorneys\n\nSouthern District of New York\n\nTel: (2l2) 637-2324\nCc: All Counsel of Record (By ECF)\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool786\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001797.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 64 Filed lo/l4/2o Page 3 of 6\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nOctober l4, 2o2o\nPage 3\nB. Discussion\nl. The Materials Are Subject to Disclosure Under Brady Because They Refute the\nGovernment’s Theory of the Charged Crimes\n\nThe government states that, as part of its “broader investigation into Epstein’s sexual abuse\nof minors,” it interviewed “dozens” of alleged victims of Epstein’s sexual abuse and obtained\n<span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span> documents and photographs from certain alleged victims who claim they were assaulted\nafter l997 — 7.e., after the end of the time period charged in Counts One through Four of the\nsuperseding indictment (the “Indictment”). (Dkt. 6o at 2). Stated differently, the government has\ninterviewed and collected evidence from numerous witnesses who have never asserted that Ms.\nMaxwell participated in Epstein’s alleged sexual abuse, or “groomed” them for Epstein, or had\nanything whatsoever to do with any episode of sexual abuse they may have experienced.\nAlthough the government represents that these women were sexually abused by Epstein after the\ntime period charged in Counts One through Four of the Indictment, this evidence is still\nfundamentally inconsistent with the government’s theory that Ms. Maxwell was Epstein’s\n“madam” and the principal facilitator of his sexual abuse scheme.\n\nFurthermore, this evidence directly contradicts the government’s theory of the perjury\ncounts. The government insists that the Materials are irrelevant to the charges in the Indictment\nbecause they relate to instances of sexual abuse that took place after l997, and therefore “post-date\nthe time period charged in the Indictment.” (Dkt. 6o at 2). That is incorrect. The government\nforgets that it chose to put at issue Epstein’s sexual abuse that occurred after l997 when it\nincluded the perjury counts in the Indictment.\n\nThe perjury counts stem from a defamation suit brought against Ms. Maxwell in 2ol5 by\none of Epstein’s alleged victims (“Accuser-l”). In December 2ol4, Accuser-l filed a motion to\njoin a lawsuit challenging the validity of Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement executed in 2oo7.\nAccuser-l’s motion “described Maxwell’s role as one of the main women who Epstein used to\nprocure under-aged girls for sexual activities and a primary co-conspirator and participant in his\nsexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme.” (/Accuser-l] v. Maxwell, l5-CV-o7433 (RWS)\n(S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. l at 927). Ms. Maxwell publicly denied Accuser-l’s allegations, claiming that\nthey were untrue. Accuser-l, in turn, claimed that these statements were defamatory and sued Ms.\nMaxwell.\n\nCounts Five and Six allege that Ms. Maxwell lied at two different depositions in this case.\nThe scope of these depositions was not limited to the l994-l997 timeframe. On the contrary, Ms.\nMaxwell was asked questions about, among other things, her knouledge of Epstein’s sexual\nactivities in general. Whether Ms. Maxwell knew about Epstein’s sexual abuse after l997 is\ntherefore directly relevant to whether she lied at these depositions.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool797\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001799.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 64 Filed lo/l4/2o Page 5 of 6\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

The government further asserts that such disclosure will\n“Seopardize the government’s ongoing investigation” because it will reveal to the defendant the\nscope of the government’s investigation and may deter other alleged victims from coming forward\nto provide evidence. (/d. at l,3). Essentially, the government is arguing that disclosure of the\nMaterials should be delayed because it would rather not let Ms. Maxwell knou, at this stage of the\nproceedings, who the government spoke to, and because it is concerned that other people might\nnot come forward to provide additional evidence against Ms. Maxwell.\n\nThese are not the sorts of concerns that courts have found may jeopardize an ongoing\ninvestigation and establish good cause for delaying disclosure. Courts typically allou delayed\ndisclosure on these grounds when immediate disclosure may alert other potential targets of the\ninvestigation that they are being investigated or may identify individuals who are proactively\ncooperating with the government to gather evidence against other potential targets. The cases\ncited in the government’s oun leter make this clear. See Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d at 53l-32\n(disclosure of certain discovery materials might “alert the targets of the investigation and could\nlead to efforts by them to frustrate the ongoing investigations”); United States v. Mennino, 48o F.\nSupp. ll82, ll88 (S.D.N.Y. l979) (government’s ongoing investigation into other potential\ndefendants could be disrupted by disclosure of certain discovery materials). Similarly, courts\noften grant protective orders in this context when the government has made a sufficient shouing\nthat disclosure may lead to witness intimidation or threats to their safety. See United States v.\nUrena, 989 F. Supp. 2d 253, 262-63 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (collecting cases).\n\nThe government has done neither here. The government has not made any shouing that\ndisclosure would thwart an ongoing investigation into other potential targets, or would jeopardize\nthe safety of any potential witnesses. Instead, the government asserts a speculative and self-\nserving concern that disclosure of the Materials it might make it more difficult to recruit additional\nwitnesses for its existing case against Ms. Maxwell. That is not the type of “clearly defined,\nspecific and serious injury” that establishes good cause to delay disclosure under Rule l6(d)(l).\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should deny the government’s requested relief under\nRule l6(d)(l) and instead order the government to immediately produce the Materials and the\nprior statements of these witnesses to the defense.\n\nSincerely,\n\n/s/ Christian Everdell\nChristian R.

For the reasons explained belou, we intend to request, pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P.\n49.l(d), that the Court permit the filing of portions of the Motion and certain supporting\nmaterials under seal and require that any responsive materials be filed under seal. We believe an\nin camera conference would be the most efficient form to address these issues and other\nconfidentiality concerns related to the Motion. We intend to provide a full set of materials to the\ngovernment, Pretrial Services, and the Court when the Motion is filed. We are merely requesting\nthat <span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span> contents of the submission be accorded confidentiality protections similar to those\nthat the government routinely requires in protective orders, including the one in this case.\n\nIn the four months since this Court denied Ms. Maxwell’s request for bail and granted the\ngovernment’s motion for detention, Ms. Maxwell and her counsel have assembled substantial\ninformation that was not available to present at the initial hearing, as well as a comprehensive\nbail package co-signed by sureties who were unable to come forward at that time. Accordingly,\nMs. Maxwell nou seeks to renew her request for bail pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f).\n\nMs. Maxwell’s renewed application will rely on <span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span> and private information that, if\nmade public, would be highly damaging to both Ms. Maxwell and third parties, including:\n\n* Leters from Ms. Maxwell’s family members and close friends, who have agreed to\nserve as sureties to support Ms. Maxwell’s renewed bail application.

These\nindividuals are entitled to the same privacy as Ms. Maxwell’s accusers, no longer minors, who\nhave been permited to remain anonymous even though many have revealed their identities.\n\nThe presumption of public access is also outweighed by Ms. Maxwell’s privacy interest\nin details regarding her financial condition, as well as the privacy interests of third parties that\nwould be implicated if Ms. Maxwell’s assets were publicly disclosed.

People\nclose to Ms. Maxwell have been physically stalked by members of the tabloid press and have had\n\naparazzi jump out of bushes and in front of their cars to snap pictures of them.\n\nAnd several have been the target of repeated physical threats. Many\nof the people who want to support Ms. Maxwell’s renewed bail application are older and do not\nhave the financial means to hire a personal security detail to protect themselves. Nor should they\nhave to. They are all people of good character who are simply trying to support Ms. Maxwell’s\nconstitutional right to seek release on bail. They should be given appropriate protections so that\nthey can step forward without having their lives upended or, worse, destroyed.\n\nThe November 25” Leter, as submited, intentionally avoided naming these individuals\nfor this very reason.

Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of New York\n4o Foley Square\nNew York, New York looo7\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we plan to file a Renewed Motion for\nRelease on Bail (the “Motion”) and respectfully request an in camera conference, with all\ncounsel present, to address the appropriate procedures for the filing and consideration of the\nMotion. For the reasons explained belou, we intend to request, pursuant to Fed. R. Crm. P.\n49.l(d), that the Court permit the filing of portions of the Motion and certain supporting\nmaterials under seal and require that any responsive materials be filed under seal. We believe an\nin camera conference would be the most efficient form to address these issues and other\nconfidentiality concerns related to the Motion. We intend to provide a full set of materials to the\ngovernment, Pretrial Services, and the Court when the Motion is filed. We are merely requesting\nthat <span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span> contents of the submission be accorded confidentiality protections similar to those\nthat the government routinely requires in protective orders, including the one in this case.\n\nIn the four months since this Court denied Ms. Maxwell’s request for bail and granted the\ngovernment’s motion for detention, Ms. Maxwell and her counsel have assembled substantial\ninformation that was not available to present at the initial hearing, as well as a comprehensive\nbail package co-signed by sureties who were unable to come forward at that time. Accordingly,\nMs. Maxwell nou seeks to renew her request for bail pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f).\n\nMs. Maxwell’s renewed application will rely on <span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span> and private information that, if\nmade public, would be highly damaging to both Ms. Maxwell and third parties, including:\n\n¢ Leters from Ms. Maxwell’s family members and close friends, who have agreed to\n\nserve as sureties to support Ms. Maxwell’s renewed bail application.

See id. at lo5l (“[C]ourts have the pouer to insure that\ntheir records are not used to gratify private spite or promote public scandal[.|”). These\nindividuals are entitled to the same privacy as Ms. Maxwell’s accusers, no longer minors, who\nhave been permited to remain anonymous even though many have revealed their identities.\n\nThe presumption of public access is also outweighed by Ms. Maxwell’s privacy interest\nin details regarding her financial condition, as well as the privacy interests of third parties that\nwould be implicated if Ms. Maxwell’s assets were publicly disclosed. See id. (personal financial\nrecords traditionally considered private, not public).\n\nSimilar privacy interests led the court to permit the redaction of bail submission materials\nin United States v.

And even though | wasn't in direct touch with her later on, all these Maxwell\nchildren are quite “tight” - they've always stayed closely in touch with each other. Thus whenever I'd\nspeak to any of her elders — Philip, Anne, Isabel and Christine, I'd also hear reports not just about their\noun lives and activities, but also Kevin's and Ian's, as well about Ghislaine's life. Her siblings\nconsistently reported for about a decade that she was enjoying life while starting her oun charity.\nSo what kind of a character is Ghislaine? I can testify without the least doubt that she is mature,\n<span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span>, thoughtful, honest and, like all her siblings, strong-willed, determined and quite obviously\ngrounded in good human values. She does not lie. She is no “chicken” - it would be totally unlike her\nto run away from the charges leveled against her by the Government. In fact, the idea of not “facing the\nmusic” is totally against the values of every single Maxwell, because both their parents always\nemphasized personal responsibility — specifically to face Bob's temper. These people consider running\naway their greatest shame. Furthermore, in facing their father's criticisms, they were trained, over and\nover, to defend themselves with real courage. So I have no doubt that not only did Ghislaine — despite\nthe blaring headlines in the press and the governments’ oun opposition to bail alleging incorrectly that\nshe is a “flight risk” — made absolutely no atempt to leave the US at any time in 2ol9, but has stayed\nto fight the civil accusations against her starting earlier.

Goldberger, together with Gerald Lefcourt, a nationally knoun New York criminal\ndefense atorney also representing Epstein, then directed their efforts at Belohlavek and Krischer\nto dissuade the office from prosecuting Epstein, largely by atacking the credibility of the victim\nwitnesses.\n\nMeanwhile, the State Atorney’s Office took the unusual step of preparing to present the\ncase to a grand jury.

Villafafia\nreported to her supervisors that the State Atorney’s Office would not provide transcripts from the\nstate grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convince him to\nrelinquish the evidence to the FBI.” Villafafia also told her supervisors that she expected “a\nnumber of fights” over her document demands, and that some parties were refusing to comply\n“after having contact with Epstein or his atorneys.”\n\nVillafafia’s reference to anticipated “fights” and lack of compliance led Sloman to ask\nwhether she was referring to the victims. Villafafia responded that the problems did not involve\nvictims, but rather a former employee of Epstein and some business entities that had objected to\ndocument demands as overly burdensome.

After the federal\ninvestigation began, and except for his self-surrender to face the state indictment in July 2oo6, Epstein largely stayed\naway from West Palm Beach, only returning occasionally.\n\na Before becoming Chief of CEOS, Oosterban was an AUSA at the USAO for about ten years and was good\nfriends with Lourie.\n4o In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia argued against pre-charge plea negotiations, arguing that it “may\nundermine our arguments for pretrial detention.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not consider strengthening\na bail argument to be a valid ground to decline to meet with defense counsel about a case.\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3229\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003351.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l75 of 348\nbeen concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “<span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span> to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on . . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a Conclusion That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by corruption, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\nrestitution for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.*”” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n22l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was <span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span> to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . I was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\neee Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nWwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so well.\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo335l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003545.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-8 Filed o4/l6/2l Page2of6\nPage 2\nDiscussion\nWhere, as here, a grand jury subpoena has validly issued, and the recipient of the subpoena\nis not contesting compliance—but rather seeking authorization to comply with the subpoena—a\ncourt should grant such permission through limited modification of an applicable protective order,\nabsent countervailing interests not present in this case.

Goldberger, together with Gerald Lefcourt, a nationally knoun New York criminal\ndefense atorney also representing Epstein, then directed their efforts at Belohlavek and Krischer\nto dissuade the office from prosecuting Epstein, largely by atacking the credibility of the victim\nwitnesses.\n\nMeanwhile, the State Atorney’s Office took the unusual step of preparing to present the\ncase to a grand jury. Krischer told OPR that under state law as it existed until changed in 2ol6,\nhis office prosecuted minors as young as l4 for prostitution.!° The possibility that Epstein’s\nvictims themselves could have been prosecuted caused “great consternation within the office,” and\naccording to Krischer, resulted in the decision to put the case before the grand jury.''

And I wouldn’t say that we...\nthought they were prostitutes . . . [but] I think there was solicitation.” Houever, she said, although\nEpstein’s “behavior was reprehensible, . . . I’m limited by . . . the state statutes as to what I can\ncharge.” Krischer told OPR, “There were so many issues involving the victim-witnesses that to\nmy mind, in consultation with my [prosecutors], the only way to achieve, to my mind, real justice\nwas to present the case to the grand jury and not to direct-file” criminal charges against Epstein.\n\nC.

For all other cases, a State Atorney has concurrent authority to file criminal\ncharges by means of a document called an “information” or to seek a grand jury indictment.\nAlthough Florida criminal cases are routinely charged by information, state grand juries are often\nutilized in <span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span> or high-profile cases, such as those involving allegations of wrongdoing by\npublic officials.'* Florida grand jury proceedings are subject to strict secrecy rules that, among\nlo Belohlavek told OPR that prostitution was a misdemeanor charge, and she did not handle misdemeanors.\nA Because the Florida Department of Law Enforcement investigation into the State Atorney’s Office’s\nhandling of the Epstein case was pending at the time OPR interviewed Krischer, he declined to further explain to OPR\nhis office’s prosecutive decisions.\nlB U.S. Const. amend.

Villafafia\ntold Sloman that the FBI agents “are geting copies of all of the evidence and we are going to\nreview everything at [the] FBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her target date for filing federal\ncharges against Epstein was August 25, 2oo6. Acosta emailed Sloman, asking whether it was\n“appropriate to approach [State Atorney Krischer] and give him a heads up re where we might\ngo?” Sloman replied, “No for fear that it will be leaked straight to Epstein.””°\n\nAlthough Lourie learned of the case at this point from Sloman, and eventually took a more\nactive role in supervising the investigation, Villafafia continued to update Acosta and Sloman\ndirectly on the progress of the case.*° Villafafia’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach had\nlitle involvement in supervising the Epstein investigation, and at times, Villafafia directed her\nemails to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie without copying her immediate supervisor. In the\nimmediate supervisor’s view, houever, “Miami” purposefully assumed all the “authority” for the\ncase, which the immediate supervisor regarded as “highly unusual.”*!\n\nBy late August 2oo6, Villafafia and the FBI had identified several additional victims and\nobtained “some flight manifests, telephone messages, and cell phone records that shou the\ncommunication and travel in interstate commerce” by Epstein and his associates. Villafafia\nreported to her supervisors that the State Atorney’s Office would not provide transcripts from the\nstate grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convince him to\nrelinquish the evidence to the FBI.” Villafafia also told her supervisors that she expected “a\nnumber of fights” over her document demands, and that some parties were refusing to comply\n“after having contact with Epstein or his atorneys.”\n\nVillafafia’s reference to anticipated “fights” and lack of compliance led Sloman to ask\nwhether she was referring to the victims. Villafafia responded that the problems did not involve\nvictims, but rather a former employee of Epstein and some business entities that had objected to\ndocument demands as overly burdensome. Villafafia explained to Sloman and Lourie that some\nvictims were “scared and/or embarrassed,” and some had been intimidated by the defense, but\n“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.” Villafafia\na8 On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafafia had not yet briefed about the case, noting that\nOperation Leap Year was “a highly <span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span> case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”\n\n28 During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was\nlikely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some\ntype of relationship between somebody in the [State Atorney’s Office] and the defense team.”\n“o After Villafafia sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her mmediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman,\nand Acosta on August 23, 2oo6, Lourie emailed Sloman: “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the\ncase?” Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care. If Alex says something then I'll tell her to just run it\nthrough you guys.”\n3l OPR understood “Miami” to be a reference to the senior managers who were located in the Miami office,\nthat is, Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel. Records shou, and Villafafia told OPR, that she believed Epstein’s atorneys\n“made a conscious decision to skip” her immediate supervisor and directed their communications to the supervisory\nchain above the immediate supervisor—Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta.\n\n2l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4345\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004351.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 54 of 349\nrecalled generally having conversations with Sloman and Menchel about the Epstein case, but he\ncould not recall with specificity when those conversations took place or the details of the\ndiscussions.\n\nSloman told OPR that because of his broad responsibilities as FAUSA, he left it to\nMenchel, as a highly experienced trial atorney and the Criminal Division Chief, to work directly\nwith Acosta, and Sloman recalled that it was Menchel and Lourie who conducted a “granular\nreview” of the charging package. Acosta confirmed to OPR that Sloman and Menchel “were a\nteam” who became involved in issues as needed, and if Sloman perceived that Menchel was taking\nthe lead on the Epstein mater, Sloman may have deferred to Menchel.\n\nG. May — June 2oo7: Miami Managers Consider the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nand Proposed Charges\n\nWhen she submited the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia intended to file charges by\nMay l5, 2oo7, and the FBI planned to arrest Epstein immediately thereafter. Villafafia, houever,\nhad not obtained authorization to indict on that schedule. The managers in Miami wanted time to\nanalyze the lengthy prosecution memorandum and consider the potential charges and charging\nstrategy. Just a few days after he received the prosecution memorandum, and after learning that\nthe FBI was planning a press conference for May l5, Sloman advised Villafafia that “[t]his Office\nhas not approved the indictment. Therefore, please do not commit us to anything at this time.’°%\n\nOn May lo, 2oo7, with Menchel’s concurrence, Lourie sent a copy of Villafafia’s\nprosecution memorandum to CEOS Chief Andrew Oosterban, who in turn sent it to his deputy\nand another CEOS atorney, asking them to assess the legal issues involved in the case and\ndescribing it as a “highly <span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span>” case involving “a high profile, very rich defendant.”*? After\nCEOS reviewed the materials, Oosterban responded to Lourie with an email stating that the\nmemorandum was “exhaustive” and “well done” and noting that Villafafia “‘has correctly focused\non the issues as we see them.” He summarized CEOS’s analysis of the application of key facts to\nthe statutes she proposed charging, concurring in Villafafia’s assessments but noting that further\nresearch was needed to determine whether certain statutes required proof of a defendant’s\nknouledge of victims’ ages. Oosterban offered to assign a CEOS atorney to work with Villafafia\non the case. Lourie forwarded Oosterban’s email to Menchel and Villafafia.\n\nMeanwhile, contemporaneous emails shou that Lourie, at least, was already considering\nan early resolution of the case through a pre-indictment plea agreement.*” After Lourie spoke with\n38 Lourie later reported to Menchel that the FBI had “wanted to arrest [Epstein] in [the] Virgin Islands during a\nbeauty pageant ... where he is a judge.” The case agent recalled that she and her co-case agent were disappointed\nwith the decision, and that the Supervisory Special Agent was “extremely upset” about it. After the federal\ninvestigation began, and except for his self-surrender to face the state indictment in July 2oo6, Epstein largely stayed\naway from West Palm Beach, only returning occasionally.\n\na Before becoming Chief of CEOS, Oosterban was an AUSA at the USAO for about ten years and was good\nfriends with Lourie.\n4o In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia argued against pre-charge plea negotiations, arguing that it “may\nundermine our arguments for pretrial detention.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not consider strengthening\na bail argument to be a valid ground to decline to meet with defense counsel about a case.\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo435l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004473.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l76 of 349\nbeen concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “<span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span> to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on . . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a Conclusion That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by corruption, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\nrestitution for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.*”” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n22l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was <span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span> to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . I was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\neee Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so well.\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4473\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004936.jpg": "; Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page l3 of 27\n: To Be Filed Under Seal\n\na grand jury subpoena, with which the party (the defendant) complied.

The Court has scheduled three days for prospective jurors to complete the final\nCourt-approved questionnaire, and four days to conduct examination of prospective jurors.\n\nBut a questionnaire by itself is not sufficient in this case to root out potential juror bias\nand to permit the atorneys to exercise intelligent peremptory challenges. Supplementing a\nrobust questionnaire with individual sequestered voir dire and limited examination of jurors by\ncounsel is necessary in this case because of the <span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span> subject mater of the charges and two\ntypes of unfairly prejudicial media atention: (i) the pretrial publicity that this case has received\nand will continue to receive throughout the duration of the trial and (ll) the extensive prior\nnegative publicity concerning Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe intense negative media coverage of Ms. Maxwell and Epstein, most profoundly in\nthe aftermath of his death in August 2ol9 and the arrest of Ms. Maxwell in July 2o2o, has\nsignificantly increased the likelihood that prospective jurors will report to jury selection with\npreconceptions, impressions, and opinions about the conduct at issue in the trial and those\naccused of the charges in the indictment: Ms. Maxwell and Epstein An unprecedented amount of\nmedia coverage has focused on this case, Ms. Maxwell and Epstein. The publicity includes\nextensive coverage in the press, including newspapers, magazines, and on-line sites; in broadcast\nmedia, including regular and cable television stations, radio, and streaming platforms, such as\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005208.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Page3ofl7\nNetflix, Peacock, and Amazon; in podcasts and YouTube recordings; in social media sites, such\nas Facebook, Instagram, Twiter; in online sites, chat rooms and blogs.

A writen questionnaire\ncoupled with sequestered voir dire of individual prospective jurors and limited open-ended\nquestioning by counsel will assist the Court and parties in determining whether prospective\njurors have developed prejudicial preconceptions regarding this case, Ms. Maxwell, and Epstein\ndue to this intense media coverage and pretrial publications and broadcasts.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005215.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Pageloofl7\nanswers that seem acceptable to the Court and counsel.

In a case that has received media atention or\ninvolves a well-knoun defendant, a larger jury panel is often assembled in an atempt to increase\nthe odds of obtaining a fair jury. The paradox is that a larger panel can mean that jurors are even\nless inclined to speak up in front of a large group. Accordingly, in a high-publicity case such as\nthis, q questionnaire alone is insufficient.\n\nB. Individual Sequestered Voir Dire is Necessary Due to the <span class=\"highlight\">Sensitive</span> Nature\n\nof the Charges\n\nThe nature of the charges in this case poses special problems for jury selection rarely\nencountered in the average federal jury trial. The crimes charged (concerning sexual abuse of\nminors) are particularly inflammatory and of great concern to communities from which jurors are\ndrawn. The charges tap into strongly held moral, ethical, and religious beliefs concerning\nappropriate, inappropriate, and immoral behavior and conduct, and can produce visceral and\nemotional reactions leading to more severe judgments based on preconceived viewpoints rather\nthan on admissible evidence presented at trial As such, prospective jurors’ opinion and beliefs\nregarding the nature of the crimes charged will need to be addressed through procedures that\nmaximize juror openness, honesty, and candor.\n\nIt is only through in-depth questioning and exploration of jurors’ views on these issues\nthat both the defense and prosecution can uncover what is needed to pursue challenges for cause\nand to intelligently exercise peremptory challenges. The experiences and backgrounds of jurors\ncould have significant bearing on the potential biases that they have. A variety of potential\nexperiences, both general (e.g., being a victim of a crime or closely related to a victim) and\nspecific (e.g., harassment, molestation, unwanted sexual contact, sexual assault, rape, domestic\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005216.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Pagellofl7\nviolence, etc.) are relevant to the subject mater of this case. Such experiences are of a highly\npersonal nature, the revelation of which in a public courtroom could lead to embarrassment and\nemotional distress. As a result, issues relevant to this case need to be addressed in a <span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span>\nand private seting.\n\nThe jury selection procedures normally used by this Court — l.e., group voir dire with\nquestioning exclusively by the judge — pose heightened problems to an effective and informative\nvoir dire in a case involving topics that are difficult to discuss, let alone in a large public forum.\nIt is typically anxiety producing and discomforting for jurors to make public disclosures. This\ncase amplifies the likelihood that jurors will be more apprehensive and constrained to respond\nopenly and honestly in open court within earshot of other jurors, members of the public, and the\nmedia.\n\nIV. ATTORNEY-CONDUCTED VOIR DIRE PERMITS A MORE INFORMED\n\nEXERCISE OF FOR CAUSE AND PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES\n\nRule 24(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure grants the Court broad discretion in\nconducting the voir dire examination. The Court has the right to control who conducts the voir\ndire and has the discretion to allou atorneys to conduct some, or all, of the voir dire. Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 24(a)(l) and (2) (“The court may examine prospective jurors or may permit the atorneys\nfor the parties to do so.”).\n\nThe Court should grant a limited period of atorney-conducted voir dire after the Court's\ngeneral voir dire because it will yield more complete information about the potential jurors for\nthe proper exercise of peremptory challenges. For a peremptory challenge to serve its purposes, it\nmust be intelligently exercised. This requires that the parties obtain sufficient information from\nthe potential jurors upon which to base their challenges. United States v. Ledee, 549 F.2d 99o,\n993 (Sth Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 9o2 (l977) (“Peremptory challenges are worthless if trial\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005217.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Pagel2ofl7\ncounsel is not afforded an opportunity to gain the necessary information upon which to base such\nstrikes.”). Without the opportunity for counsel to effectively probe for hidden prejudices, it\nwould be difficult to accomplish the goal of exercising <span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span> and intelligent peremptory\nchallenges.\n\nA. The Atorneys Have More In-Depth Knouledge of the Case\nIt is counsel, not the Court, who is in the best position to obtain the information necessary\n\nto exercise intelligent peremptory challenges through atorney-conducted voir dire. The\natorneys have more in-depth knouledge of the case than the Court. See, e.g., United States v.\nCleveland, l997 WL 2554 at *3 (E.D. LA. Jan. 2, l997). Important follou-up questions are more\nlikely to occur to an advocate than a judge for several reasons, including the fact that a judge\n“does not have the advocate's awareness that soon [s]he will be making peremptory challenges\nbased on inferences from what prospective jurors have said” and the fact that “the judge does not\nknou the case of either party in detail, so that [s]he cannot realize when responses have opened\nareas for further inquiry.”” As the Fifth Circuit has recognized:\n\nA judge cannot have the same grasp of the facts, the complexities\n\nand nuances as the trial atorneys entrusted with the preparation of\n\nthe case. The court does not knou the strength and weaknesses of\n\neach litigant’s case. Justice requires that each lawyer be given an\n\nopportunity to ferret out possible bias and prejudice of which the\n\njuror himself may be unaware until certain facts are revealed.\nLedee, 549 F.2d at 993 (citing Frates and Greer, Jury Voir Dire: The Lawyer’s Perspective, 2\nA.B.A. Litigation No. 2 (l976)). Indeed, the Fifth Circuit later amplified this concept, stating\nthat “voir dire may have litle meaning if it is not conducted at least in part by counsel.”\n\nWhile Federal Rules [sic] of Criminal Procedure 24(a) gives wide\n\ndiscretion to the trial Court, voir dire may have litle meaning if it is\n\nnot conducted at least in part by counsel. The \"federal\" practice of\n\nalmost exclusive voir dire examination by the Court does not take\n2 Babcock, Voir Dire: Preserving “Its Wonderful Pouer”, 27 Stan. L. Rev. 545, 549 (l975).\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005219.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Pagel4ofl7\nfor the court's evaluation, ‘merely going through the form of obtaining jurors’ assurances of\nimpartiality is insufficient [to test that impartiality]”) (citation omited).\n\nBecause it is extremely likely that prospective jurors have been exposed to potentially\nprejudicial pretrial publicity, specific, individual voir dire is required. Davis, 583 F.2d at l96-97.\nTo increase the likelihood that any hidden prejudices of the jurors will be uncovered, to\naccomplish the goal of exercising <span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span> and intelligent peremptory challenges, and to ensure\nthat a fair and impartial jury is empaneled in this case, counsel should be given an opportunity to\nindividually examine prospective jurors.\n\nIndividual sequestered voir dire conducted jointly by counsel and the Court has a variety\nof benefits. It invites a conversation rather than posing an interrogation. It eliminates the pressure\non jurors to provide socially desirable or acceptable answers in a group seting, reduces\nconformity pressures that can diminish candor, and removes the risk of other jurors being\ninfluenced by statements made during group voir dire that enable them to either stay on the jury\nor be removed for cause. It increases juror comfort, minimizes the anxiety of public speaking,\nencourages candor, and promotes honesty.\n\nFurthermore, questioning conducted exclusively by the Court further hampers the ability\nto uncover important information about jurors because it places jurors in a subordinate position\nheightening their reluctance to be candid. Atorney-conducted questioning bridges the status gap\nbetween the humble layperson and the honorable judicial officer exalted high above the venire.\nResearch indicates that expansive voir dire yields greater revelations of juror bias;? and in-depth\natorney-conducted voir dire combined with individual sequestered voir dire elicits greater\n3 See, e.g., Moran, Cutler & Loftus.

Even if counsel identify specific or additional issues the defendant believes her atorneys\nshould be able to explore in light of, as the defendant claims, the atorneys’ “more in-depth\nknouledge of the case” (id. at ll), counsel are free to propose additional questions that the Court\nmay ask, and the Court is in the best position to consider whether such inquiry is appropriate and,\nif so, hou to pose such questions in a way that is fair to the interests of all parties and the potential\njurors.

The defendant\nargues that individual sequestered voir dire is necessary in light of the nature of the charges in this\ncase, which she claims are “particularly inflammatory and of great concern to communities from\nwhich jurors are drawn,” and her concern that “a discussion of pretrial publicity in front of the\nentire jury pool will contaminate those few jurors who have not been subjected to the publicity.”\n(Dkt.

Of course, under the typical practice in the District, prospective jurors would\nnot be asked to describe their experiences with sexual assault or the details of pretrial publicity in\nfront of the rest of the venire.

In those studies, laboratory conditions literally can be\n\nachieved. ...\n\nThat strictly quantitative mode of inquiry is not realistic or even ethical in the\n\ncontext of studying sex trafficking. The causes and contributors to sex trafficking\n\nby their nature must be studied retrospectively. They cannot ethically be studied\n\notherwise. Subjects cannot be tested to see under what circumstances they would\n\nand would not, on a going forward basis, fall prey to the predations of sex\n\ntraffickers. Given the necessarily retrospective nature of such a study, given the\n\nsmall size of the populations under review, and given the inherently\n\nindividualized circumstances presented by different perpetrators, victims, and\n\ncontexts in this tumultuous and emotionally fraught area of criminal conduct, the\n\nvocabulary of error rates and statistical significance is an unusually poor fit.\n\nTr. at 29-3o, United States v. Randall, l9-Cr.-l3l (PAE) (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o), Dkt. No. 335.\n\nFor the reasons Judge Engelmayer gave—which Dr. Rocchio echoed in her testimony—\nthe Court finds that the error-rate factor listed by Daubert is not determinative as to the reliability\nof Dr. Rocchio’s method.\n\nFor similar reasons, the Court rejects the Defense’s argument that Dr. Rocchio’s method\nis unreliable because she relied on the reports of her clients. Given the realities of studying\n<span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span> criminal acts like sexual abuse, a researcher can only rarely verify reports with absolute\ncertainty. Yet that does not mean a clinical or forensic psychologist accepts all statements at\nface value. Rather, as the Government notes, part of Dr. Rocchio’s profession is to examine and\ndiagnose her patients consistent with her significant training and specialized knouledge.\nFurther, on the forensic side of her practice, Dr. Rocchio regularly investigates and verifies\nsexual abuse. She reports “remarkable consistency” between the reports of her clinical patients\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6347\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006367.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 7 of54\n\n“TT here is no absolute right of an accused to have a jury hear a witness’s true name and\naddress.” Clark v.

Any sexualization of the relationship such as talking about sex in a way\nthat is not permissible given the adult’s relationship with the child (e.g.,\nit is permissible for parents to provide sex education to their children) or\nexposing the child to sexually explicit materials such as R rated movies\n(shouing the child pornography would be abusive in and of itself and\ntherefore not grooming).\n\n2.

Inappropriate nonsexual communication with the child (e.g., telling the\nchild she is the only one who understands the offender, or telling her “I\nlove you” when the social role is not appropriate for this type of commu-\nnication), particularly when an adult uses these statements to manipulate\nthe child to do something (e.g., “I love you and people who love each\nother touch each other”).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006856.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 2l of 45\nAlaggia et al. 279\nTable 2.

In particular, the defense is still unclear whether we will be permited to display\ndocuments used for impeachment or refreshing a witness’s recollection in electronic format solely on the\nvideo screens used by the witness, the Court, and the Court’s deputy, or whether we will be required to\nprovide paper copies of these materials, even if the materials do not reference a witness who is testifying\nunder a pseudonym. !\n\nThe defense is <span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span> to the Court and the government’s concerns that people siting in the\ngallery of the courtroom do not see any documents that identify the witnesses who are testifying under\npseudonyms. We also understand that the Court wants to ensure that the witnesses will have access to\nthe complete documents that may be used for impeachment and refreshing recollection, rather than a\n' Counsel for the defense understood the discussion on November 23, 2o2l, to apply only to documents which\ncontained identifying information for witnesses who are testifying under pseudonyms or first names. The\ngovernment, houever, has suggested that paper documents need to be used for all impeachment and refreshing,\nwhether or not the documents contain such identifying information.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l66\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008388.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document548- Filed l2/l5/2l Page2of6\n\nAt a conference on November l, 2o2l, the Court granted the Government’s motion in\nlimine to permit alleged victims to testify under pseudonyms and, as a consequence, to redact\ntheir real identities from exhibits. Nov. l Tr. at 6. That motion was granted for two primary\nreasons. First, the Court has a statutory duty to protect an alleged crime victim’s “right to be\ntreated with fairness and with respect for the victim’s dignity and privacy.” l8 U.S.C. §\n377l(a)(8). Nov. l Tr. at 6-7. Because of the “<span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span> and inflammatory nature of the conduct\nalleged” the Court found that pseudonyms were necessary to protect that right. /d. at 8. Second,\nif alleged victims of abuse were subject to publicity, harassment, and embarrassment, “other\nalleged victims of sex crimes may be deterred from coming forward” to report abuse. Jd. The\nCourt emphasized that the Government’s proposal is “quite common” among courts in this\ncircuit, citing six such cases. /d. at 7-8. As a consequence of protecting alleged victims, the\nCourt further permited pseudonyms for several witnesses that were not alleged victims\nthemselves “because the disclosure of their identities would necessarily reveal the identities of\nthe alleged victims.” /d. at 8.\n\nThese reasons for granting the Government’s prior motion do not apply to the Defense’s\npresent request. Based on the current proffer, none of the Defense’s witnesses intend to testify to\n<span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span> personal topics or sexual conduct. Rather, they all are anticipated to deny misconduct\nby Epstein and Ms. Maxwell, and therefore do not qualify as victims under § 377l. Further,\nthere is no similar concern, as there are for alleged victims of sexual abuse, that denying the use\nof pseudonyms will deter reports of misconduct.\n\nIt is notable that the Defense does not cite in support of its motion a single case in which\na court granted the use of pseudonyms to defense witnesses. Neither does the Government. And\nnor could the Court after significant independent research.

See Dkts. 568—7o. When asked about his juror\nquestionnaire, which included a question about whether he had been a\nvictim of sexual abuse, the juror asserted that he “flew through” the\nquestionnaire and did “not recall being asked” this question. Dkt. 568.\nDefendant filed a motion for a new trial and asked the Court to keep the\nmotion completely under seal until it ruled on the motion. Dkt. 58o.\nDefendant’s request for secrecy is contrary to both the common law and\nthe First Amendment.\n\nThe Common Law Right of Access\nThe common law presumption of access ataches to any “judicial\ndocument,” defined as items “relevant to the performance of judicial\nfunction and useful in the judicial process.” United States v. Amodeo\n(“Amodeo I’), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). The presumption is\nstrongest when, as here, documents contribute materially to the Article III\npouers of the court—that is, to the rendering of verdicts and orders\naffecting “substantive legal rights.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. v. Onondaga,\n435 F.3d llo, l2l (2d Cir. 2oo6). Once the right ataches, it is overcome\nonly by a shouing that there are “countervailing factors” that outweigh the\npublic’s right to monitor judicial proceedings.\nDefendant’s Motion for New Trial. There is no question that Defendant’s\nmotion, which will directly inform the Court’s assessment of whether a\nnew trial is necessary, is a “judicial document.” See Bernstein v. Bernstein\nLitouitz Berger & Grossman LLP, 8l4 F.3d l32, l4o, l42 (2d Cir. 2ol6).\nBecause the motion will be used to determine the parties’ “substantive\nlegal rights,” the presumptive right of access it at its highest. Jd.\nWe do not see anything on the public record indicating that Defendant has\nmet—or tried to meet—the high shouing required to justify a blanket\nsealing of its motion. It is simply not plausible that every word of a legal\nfiling such as this one requires total secrecy. To the extent that the motion\ncontains any <span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span> information, there is a reasonable alternative to\nwholesale sealing: limited redactions of personally identifiable or <span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span>\ninformation, if justified under the Lugosch standard.

The Government agrees with the New York Times Company that the\nquestionnaires for the twelve seated jurors should be made public, with limited redactions to\nprotect juror privacy. Under the circumstances presented here, where jury selection and the trial\nhave been completed, releasing juror questionnaires is consistent with the strong presumption of\naccess to the jury selection process, including juror questionnaires.

With the experience of its members as a guide, NACDL believes it can provide the\nCourt with additional perspective concerning the issues that have been raised in the Defendant’s\npost-verdict motion. We are seriously concerned that where a juror gives a false answer to a\nquestion that is crucially important in assessing that juror’s ability to be a fair and impartial juror,\nthe structural integrity of the trial has been lost regardless of whether the false answer was given\ndeliberately. We believe, as we will discuss, that such a conclusion is consistent with existing\ncase law.\n\n6.

Pyramid Co. v. Onondaga,\n435 F.3d llo, l2l (2d Cir. 2oo6). Once the right ataches, it is overcome\nonly by a shouing that there are “countervailing factors” that outweigh the\npublic’s right to monitor judicial proceedings.\nDefendant’s Motion for New Trial. There is no question that Defendant’s\nmotion, which will directly inform the Court’s assessment of whether a\nnew trial is necessary, is a “judicial document.” See Bernstein v. Bernstein\nLitouitz Berger & Grossman LLP, 8l4 F.3d l32, l4o, l42 (2d Cir. 2ol6).\nBecause the motion will be used to determine the parties’ “substantive\nlegal rights,” the presumptive right of access it at its highest.

The Second Circuit has\nidentified the follouing as a non-exhaustive list of factors for district courts to weigh in\nconsidering applications for disclosure:\n° the identity of the party seeking disclosure;\n° whether the defendant to the grand jury proceeding or the Government opposes\nthe disclosure;\ne why disclosure is being sought in the particular case;\n° what specific information is being sought for disclosure;\n8 hou long ago the grand jury proceedings took place;\ne the current status of the principals of the grand jury proceedings and that of their\nfamilies;\n® the extent to which the desired material—either permissibly or impermissibly—\nhas been previously made public;\ne whether witnesses to the grand jury proceedings who might be affected by\ndisclosure are still alive; and\ne [whether there is an] additional need for maintaining secrecy in the particular case\nin question.\nid. at lo6 (capitalization altered); see also Laws.’Comm. for 9/ll Inquiry, Inc. v.

See Carlson v. United States, 837 F.3d 753,\n766-67 (7th Cir. 2ol6). Other circuits have taken a narrouer view of a court’s authority to order\nsuch relief.

Many questions remain unanswered, and the\npublic’s interest remains.”); (Epstein Dkt. 6l at l; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at l). Atention given to the\nEpstein and Maxwell cases has recently intensified in the wake of the July 6, 2o25 Memorandum\nannouncing the conclusions of the Government’s review into the investigation. See id.\n\nThe instant motions for unsealing are consistent with the fundamental purposes set forth in\nthat memorandum given the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein’s crimes: to provide information\nto the public while remaining <span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span> to protecting the rights of victims.\n\n4. What Specific Information Is Being Sought for Disclosure\n\nThe fourth factor asks what specific information the movant seeks to disclose. See Jn re\nCraig, l3l F.3d at lo6. Here, the Government seeks the public disclosure of the grand jury\ntranscripts in the Epstein and Maxwell cases (Epstein Dkt. 6l at l; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at l). As\nstated in the pending motions, any public disclosure granted by the Court would be “subject to\nappropriate redactions of victim-related and other personal identifying information” (Epstein\nDkt. 6l at 2; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at 2).\n\n5. Hou Long Ago the Grand Jury Proceedings Took Place\n\nThe fifth factor asks hou long ago the grand jury proceedings took place. Jn re Craig, l3l\nF.3d at lo6. The grand jury met in June and July of 2ol9 in the Epstein case. The grand jury met\nin June and July of 2o2o and March of 2o2l in the Maxwell case. Here, the passage of time has\nnot dulled the public’s interest in these cases. See In re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo7 (“if historical interest\nin a specific case has persisted over a number of years, that serves as an important indication that\nthe public’s interest in release of the information is substantial”).\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o67\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015069.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 796 Filed o7/29/25 Page8oflo\nGovernment is providing under seal a list of witnesses whose accounts were conveyed in the grand\njury proceedings and a corresponding list noting which witnesses testified at trial.\n\n8. Whether Witnesses to the Grand Jury Proceedings Who Might Be\nAffected by Disclosure Are Still Alive\n\nThe eighth factor considers “whether witnesses to the grand jury proceedings who might\nbe affected by disclosure are still alive.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6.\n\nHere, there was one witness—an FBI agent—during the Epstein grand jury proceedings.\nThere were two witnesses—the same FBI agent from the Epstein grand jury proceedings and a\ndetective with the NYPD who was a Task Force Officer with the FBI’s Child Exploitation and\nHuman Trafficking Task Force—during the Maxwell grand jury proceedings.\n\nBoth witnesses are still alive; the FBI agent continues to be an agent with the FBI, and the\nDetective continues to be a Detective with the NYPD as well as a Task Force Officer.\n\nConsistent with applicable rules concerning the admissibility of hearsay testimony, the\ngrand jury witnesses described statements of others, including statements of and concerning\nvictims, many of whom are still alive. In the sealed submission accompanying this filing, the\nGovernment will note which victims are still alive.\n\n9. Whether There Is an Additional Need for Maintaining Secrecy in the\nParticular Case in Question\n\nFinally, the ninth factor considers “the additional need for maintaining secrecy in the\nparticular case in question.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6. In addition to the typical reasons for\ngrand jury secrecy, the grand jury transcripts contain victim-related and other personal identifying\ninformation related to third parties who neither have been charged or alleged to be involved in the\ncrimes with which Epstein and Maxwell were charged, to which the Government is <span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span>, and\nwhich is why the Government proposes redacting the transcripts before releasing them. (See\nEpstein Dkt. 6l at 2; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at 2).\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o69\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015089.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o3 Filed o8/o5/25 Page3of9\nrelease of grand jury records is appropriate even outside the boundaries of Rule\n6(e)(3). In re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo2. Importantly, “the discretion of a trial court in\ndeciding whether to make public the ordinarily secret proceedings of a grand jury\ninvestigation is one of the broadest and most <span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span> exercises of careful judgment\nthat a trial judge can make.” /d. at lo4.\n\nIn re Craig involved a petition by a doctoral candidate to unseal the nearly 5o-\nyear-old grand jury testimony of a high-ranking government employee, Harry Dexter\nWhite, based on historical interest in White’s suspected role as a communist spy. The\ncourt in In re Craig denied the petition to unseal. On appeal, the Second Circuit\naffirmed the trial court’s denial of the petition, finding that the court did not abuse\nits discretion when it found that sufficiently exceptional circumstances did not exist\nto warrant disclosure. Id. at loo-ol, lo7.\n\nIn affirming the louer court’s denial of the motion to unseal, the Second Circuit\nacknouledged historical interest as a potential basis for disclosure and offered a non-\nexhaustive list of factors that a trial court might consider when confronted with\nruling on a motion to unseal. Jd. at lo5-o6. Those factors include, but are not limited\nto:\n\n(i) the identity of the party seeking disclosure; (i) whether\nthe defendant to the grand jury proceeding or the government\nopposes the disclosure; (ll) why disclosure is being sought in\nthe particular case; Gv) what specific information is being\nsought for disclosure; (v) hou long ago the grand jury\nproceedings took place; (vi) the current status of the principals\nof the grand jury proceedings and that of their families; (vi)\nthe extent to which the desired material—either permissibly\nor impermissibly—has been previously made public; (vi)\nwhether witnesses to the grand jury proceedings who might\nMARKUS/MOSS\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o89\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015146.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page l4 of 3l\n\n(v) hou long ago the grand jury proceedings took place;\n\n(vi) the current status of the principals of the grand jury proceedings and that of\n\ntheir families;\n\n(vil) the extent to which the desired material—either permissibly or\n\nimpermissibly—has been previously made public;\n\n(vill) whether witnesses to the grand jury proceedings who might be affected by\n\ndisclosure are still alive; and\n\n(ix) the additional need for maintaining secrecy in the particular case in question.\n\nTd.\n\nThe doctrine is to be applied only in “exceptional circumstances,” and it does not justify\ngranting “garden variety” petitions for disclosure unauthorized by Rule 6(e). /d. at lo3 (citation\nomited). The burden is on the requestor to demonstrate that disclosure is appropriate, and “the\nbaseline presumption [is] against disclosure.” Lawyers’ Commitee for 9/ll, 43 F.4th at 285\n(alteration in original). “[T]he discretion of a trial court in deciding whether to make public the\nordinarily secret proceedings of a grand jury investigation is one of the broadest and most\n<span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span> exercises of careful judgment that a trial judge can make.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d\nat lo4; see also Lawyers’ Commitee for 9/ll, 43 F Ath at 285-86.\n\nIV. Discussion\n\nA. The Government’s Basis for Claiming “Special Circumstances”\n\nNo Rule 6(e)(3) exception authorizes the disclosure the Government proposes here: of,\nsubject to redactions, all testimony and exhibits before the two grand juries that indicted\nGhislaine Maxwell. The Government’s motion to unseal does not contend otherwise. It does not\nargue that these materials would aid federal, state, military, tribal, or foreign law enforcement; or\nwould be relevant to national security officials, another grand jury, or another judicial\nproceeding. Nor does the Government (or Maxwell) argue that the materials could reveal a\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l46\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016320.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 759 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page lo4 of 267 2l32\nLCACmax3 A.

Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 2\nThe defendant’s demand that she and her counsel be permited to name any individuals who have\never publicly identified themselves as a victim of either Epstein or the defendant in any “public\nfora,” and at any time, without limitation, is extraordinarily broad, unnecessary, and inappropriate,\nand should be denied.\n\nAs an initial mater, there can be no serious question that there are significant privacy and\nvictim interests at issue here, which the Government Proposed Order seeks to protect. Particularly\nin the context of victim witnesses, there are compelling reasons to limit public disclosure of victim\nidentities and other <span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span> information. Indeed, the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, l8 U.S.C. §\n377l, requires district courts to implement procedures to ensure that crime victims are accorded,\namong other rights, “[t]he right to be reasonably protected from the accused,” in addition to “[t]he\nright to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim’s dignity and privacy.” Id. §§\n(a)(l), (a)(8) (emphasis added). Moreover, “the public generally has a strong interest in protecting\nthe identities of . . . victims so that other victims will not be deterred from reporting such crimes.”\nUnited States v. Paris, 2oo7 WL l484974, at *2 (D. Conn. May l8, 2oo7).\n\nMoreover, and consistent with those interests, courts in this Circuit have routinely\nacknouledged the need to protect victim-witness identities. See, e.g., United States v. Corley,\nl3 Cr. 48 (AJN), 2ol6 WL 9o225o8, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6) (“Because Corley’s minor\nvictims have significant privacy and safety interests at stake, while Corley’s interests are minimal,\nthe Court finds good cause to modify the protective order in this case to prevent Corley from\nlearning the surnames of the minor victims.”); United States v. Kelly, o7 Cr. 374 (SJ), 2oo8 WL\n5o6882o, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. July lo, 2oo8) (“Given the potentially explicit nature of the government\nwitnesses’ expected testimony, the government argues that it is necessary to conceal their identity\nto protect them from public humiliation and embarrassment. This Court agrees. Thus, the parties\n[. . .] are hereby prohibited from releasing to anyone, including members of the press, the identity\nor any identifying information of the government’s witnesses.”). It is similarly routine in this\nDistrict for parties in a criminal case to refer to witnesses by pseudonyms (such as “Victim-l” or\n‘“‘Witness-l’’) to protect the privacy interests of third parties unless and until they testify publicly.\n\nThe Government’s proposed order endeavors to protect those interests by generally\nrequiring the parties to abstain from identifying any victim by name in any public statement or\nfiling while also ensuring that the defendant and her counsel are fully able to prepare for trial.\nIndeed, to facilitate the defendant’s investigation and preparation for trial, the Government’s\nproposal makes clear that defense counsel and defense staff, including defense investigators,\nshould not be prohibited from referencing identities of individuals in conversations with\nprospective witnesses, so long as those witnesses and their counsel abstain from further disclosing\nor disseminating any such identities. See Government Proposed Order { 5. The terms of the\nGovernment’s proposed order also would permit defense counsel to refer to any individual by\nname in any filing under seal, merely requiring redaction of identifying information or the use of\na pseudonym in public filings. The Government further proposes that defense counsel not be\nprohibited from publicly referencing individuals who have spoken—or who at some future time\nor deletes language in furtherance of its desire to publicly reference victim identities in defense\nparagraphs 7, 9, and l7 (which are Government Proposed Order paragraphs 6, 7, and l6).\n\nApp.o57\nDOJ-OGR-oool95l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019522.jpg": "CaSeide2QoeROOB 2o o4IN ce Detlnien? 2-o2 OF RES O7928/289 Paget l 2b l2\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\neee ee ee eR\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA ORO OER\n—-  - ;\n: 2o Cr. 33o (AUN)\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, :\nDefendant. :\nSo LL Lg\nALISON J.

LY USA, Inc., 676 F.3d 83, 98 (2d Cir. 2ol2))).

Defense preparation is not immune\nto the impact of the pandemic.\nA Trial Continuance is Necessary\n\nWhile the government’s offer to provide discovery highlights and its representation that it\nwill streamline its case to primarily focus on the four accusers are helpful, these gestures do not\neliminate the need for a continuance. As set forth above, the government’s hyperbolic claim that\nit can “ensure that the defense will be fully prepared to proceed to trial on July l2, 2o2l” (Govt\nItr at 4-5) ignores the reality that time is needed to:\n\n= supplement pending pretrial motions;\n\n* critically review voluminous discovery produced in November 2o2o that the\ngovernment represented was not relevant to the case against Ms. Maxwell;\n\n= re-review discovery for the new time period and charges;\n\n= commence new investigations based on the new charges and the government’s\ndisclosure of 35oo material for non-testifying witnesses; and\n\n« refocus trial preparation and strategy.\n\nThe government originally represented to the Court and counsel that this trial would last\ntwo weeks. The government nou predicts the trial will last a month. The estimates are mere\nguesses which do not factor in time-consuming COVID jury selection in a high-publicity case\nnecessitating <span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span> and personal disclosures by prospective jurors or the presentation of\ndefense evidence.

She is weighed while\nclothed on scales that are erratic and not set to zero; on at least one occasion, the scale was set\nabove five pounds. Her eyesight is failing, and her hair is thinning. The guards are far from\nqualified to assess Ms. Maxwell’s physical condition.\n\nReleasing any inmate’s medical information (i.e., weight, vaccinations, etc.) without\ninmate consent is a HIPAA violation. By releasing such information regarding Ms. Maxwell, the\nMDC has violated HIPAA, a privacy breach compounded by the government’s leter. Requesting\nmedical atention puts Ms. Maxwell’s privacy and HIPAA rights at risk. We request that the\nCourt order the MDC to cease releasing Ms. Maxwell’s health information. Breach aside, such\ninformation falls within the “caution” category identified in Your Honor’s Individual Practice in\nCriminal Cases (see 8D (Redactions)). The government, ever protective of <span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span> items of\ndiscovery that relate to the alleged victims, should exhibit the same concern for Ms. Maxwell’s\nright to privacy.\n\nThe incident of physical abuse which occurred when Ms. Maxwell was shoved into her\nisolation cell to be searched was previously reported to MDC Legal and the Court and\ninvestigated within the facility. The guard responsible for the abuse is a member of a rotating\nteam that has been the subject of complaint, yet some members were reassigned to Ms. Maxwell\nfor the past two weeks. The incident at issue occurred when Ms. Maxwell was facing forward in\nfront of an officer whose back was in front of the handheld camera. On information and belief,\nthe camera was not recording at that time. The government disputes Ms. Maxwell’s claim by\nciting a video.

Mr. Markus is\ntherefore ORDERED to comply with Local Criminal Rule 23.l. The Government does\nnot ask the Court to discipline Mr. Markus based on his op—ed and the Court declines\nto consider whether it violated Rule 23.l given the potential lack of clarity with respect\nto whether Mr. Markus was bound by the rule.

Going forward, Mr. Markus and all lawyers associated\nwith the pending case are nou clearly on notice that their conduct falls under the\npurview of Local Criminal Rule 23.l. Indeed, the above concerns do not apply only to\nMr. Markus. This Court has previously noted that counsel|[,] agents for the parties and\ncounsel for potential witnesses must take care to protect the Defendant's right to a fair\ntrial by an impartial jury. Dkt. No. 28. This Court is cognizant that criminal maters\nheading touard trial are especially <span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span> to extrajudicial statements.

Acosta confirmed to OPR that Sloman and Menchel “were a\nteam” who became involved in issues as needed, and if Sloman perceived that Menchel was taking\nthe lead on the Epstein mater, Sloman may have deferred to Menchel.\n\nC. May — June 2oo7: Miami Managers Consider the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nand Proposed Charges\n\nWhen she submited the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia intended to file charges by\nMay l5, 2oo7, and the FBI planned to arrest Epstein immediately thereafter. Villafafia, houever,\nhad not obtained authorization to indict on that schedule. The managers in Miami wanted time to\nanalyze the lengthy prosecution memorandum and consider the potential charges and charging\nstrategy. Just a few days after he received the prosecution memorandum, and after learning that\nthe FBI was planning a press conference for May l5, Sloman advised Villafafia that “‘[t]his Office\nhas not approved the indictment. Therefore, please do not commit us to anything at this time.”*®\n\nOn May lo, 2oo7, with Menchel’s concurrence, Lourie sent a copy of Villafafia’s\nprosecution memorandum to CEOS Chief Andrew Oosterban, who in turn sent it to his deputy\nand another CEOS atorney, asking them to assess the legal issues involved in the case and\ndescribing it as a “highly <span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span>” case involving “a high profile, very rich defendant.”*? After\nCEOS reviewed the materials, Oosterban responded to Lourie with an email stating that the\nmemorandum was “exhaustive” and “well done” and noting that Villafafia “has correctly focused\non the issues as we see them.” He summarized CEOS’s analysis of the application of key facts to\nthe statutes she proposed charging, concurring in Villafafia’s assessments but noting that further\nresearch was needed to determine whether certain statutes required proof of a defendant’s\nknouledge of victims’ ages. Oosterban offered to assign a CEOS atorney to work with Villafafia\non the case. Lourie forwarded Oosterban’s email to Menchel and Villafafia.\n\nMeanwhile, contemporaneous emails shou that Lourie, at least, was already considering\nan early resolution of the case through a pre-indictment plea agreement.” After Lourie spoke with\n38 Lourie later reported to Menchel that the FBI had “wanted to arrest [Epstein] in [the] Virgin Islands during a\nbeauty pageant .. . where he is a judge.” The case agent recalled that she and her co-case agent were disappointed\nwith the decision, and that the Supervisory Special Agent was “extremely upset” about it. After the federal\ninvestigation began, and except for his self-surrender to face the state indictment in July 2oo6, Epstein largely stayed\naway from West Palm Beach, only returning occasionally.\n\na Before becoming Chief of CEOS, Oosterban was an AUSA at the USAO for about ten years and was good\nfriends with Lourie.\na In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia argued against pre-charge plea negotiations, arguing that it “may\nundermine our arguments for pretrial detention.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not consider strengthening\na bail argument to be a valid ground to decline to meet with defense counsel about a case.\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l227\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021349.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON BS 3536o38, Pagel7/7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l75 of 348\n\nbeen concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “<span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span> to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on. . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a Conclusion That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by corruption, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\nrestitution for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.””” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n22l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was <span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span> to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . I was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\n\n228 Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\n\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\n\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\n\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\n\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ...

Villafafia explained to Sloman and Lourie that some\nvictims were “scared and/or embarrassed,” and some had been intimidated by the defense, but\n“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.” Villafafia\n28 On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafafia had not yet briefed about the case, noting that\nOperation Leap Year was “a highly <span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span> case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”\n\n29 During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was\nlikely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some\ntype of relationship between somebody in the [State Atorney’s Office] and the defense team.”\n3o After Villafafia sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her immediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman,\nand Acosta on August 23, 2oo6, Lourie emailed Sloman: “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the\ncase?” Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care. If Alex says something then I’ll tell her to just run it\nthrough you guys.”\n3l OPR understood “Miami” to be a reference to the senior managers who were located in the Miami office,\nthat is, Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel. Records shou, and Villafafia told OPR, that she believed Epstein’s atorneys\n“made a conscious decision to skip” her immediate supervisor and directed their communications to the supervisory\nchain above the immediate supervisor—Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta.\n\n2l\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o59\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023065.tif": "recalled generally having conversations with Sloman and Menchel about the Epstein case, but he\ncould not recall with specificity when those conversations took place or the details of the\ndiscussions.\n\nSloman told OPR that because of his broad responsibilities as FAUSA, he left it to\nMenchel, as a highly experienced trial atorney and the Criminal Division Chief, to work directly\nwith Acosta, and Sloman recalled that it was Menchel and Lourie who conducted a “granular\nreview” of the charging package. Acosta confirmed to OPR that Sloman and Menchel “were a\nteam” who became involved in issues as needed, and if Sloman perceived that Menchel was taking\nthe lead on the Epstein mater, Sloman may have deferred to Menchel.\n\nC. May — June 2oo7: Miami Managers Consider the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nand Proposed Charges\n\nWhen she submited the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia intended to file charges by\nMay l5, 2oo7, and the FBI planned to arrest Epstein immediately thereafter. Villafafia, houever,\nhad not obtained authorization to indict on that schedule. The managers in Miami wanted time to\nanalyze the lengthy prosecution memorandum and consider the potential charges and charging\nstrategy. Just a few days after he received the prosecution memorandum, and after learning that\nthe FBI was planning a press conference for May l5, Sloman advised Villafafia that “[t]his Office\nhas not approved the indictment. Therefore, please do not commit us to anything at this time.’°8\n\nOn May lo, 2oo7, with Menchel’s concurrence, Lourie sent a copy of Villafafia’s\nprosecution memorandum to CEOS Chief Andrew Oosterban, who in turn sent it to his deputy\nand another CEOS atorney, asking them to assess the legal issues involved in the case and\ndescribing it as a “highly <span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span>” case involving “a high profile, very rich defendant.”*’ After\nCEOS reviewed the materials, Oosterban responded to Lourie with an email stating that the\nmemorandum was “exhaustive” and “well done” and noting that Villafafia “has correctly focused\non the issues as we see them.””’ He summarized CEOS’s analysis of the application of key facts to\nthe statutes she proposed charging, concurring in Villafafia’s assessments but noting that further\nresearch was needed to determine whether certain statutes required proof of a defendant’s\nknouledge of victims’ ages. Oosterban offered to assign a CEOS atorney to work with Villafafia\non the case. Lourie forwarded Oosterban’s email to Menchel and Villafafia.\n\nMeanwhile, contemporaneous emails shou that Lourie, at least, was already considering\nan early resolution of the case through a pre-indictment plea agreement.*” After Lourie spoke with\n38 Lourie later reported to Menchel that the FBI had “wanted to arrest [Epstein] in [the] Virgin Islands during a\nbeauty pageant ... where he is a judge.” The case agent recalled that she and her co-case agent were disappointed\nwith the decision, and that the Supervisory Special Agent was “extremely upset” about it. After the federal\ninvestigation began, and except for his self-surrender to face the state indictment in July 2oo6, Epstein largely stayed\naway from West Palm Beach, only returning occasionally.\n\n39 Before becoming Chief of CEOS, Oosterban was an AUSA at the USAO for about ten years and was good\nfriends with Lourie.\n4o In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia argued against pre-charge plea negotiations, arguing that it “may\nundermine our arguments for pretrial detention.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not consider strengthening\na bail argument to be a valid ground to decline to meet with defense counsel about a case.\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o65\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023187.tif": "been concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “<span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span> to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on . . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a Conclusion That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by corruption, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\nrestitution for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.*”” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n22l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was <span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span> to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . | was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\n\n222 Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\n\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\n\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\n\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\n\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so well.\n\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l87\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023761.tif": "If complaining about a <span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span> issue, in the sense that the\ninmate’s safety or well-being would be placed in danger if the\nrequest became knoun at the institution, the inmate may submit\nhis administrative remedy directly to the appropriate Regional\nDirector, marking “<span class=\"highlight\">Sensitive</span>” upon the request and explaining, in\nwriting, the reason for not submiting the request at the\ninstitution.

Inmate Designations\nThe majority of inmates at MCC New York are pre-trial inmates\nwho, if sentenced, will serve their sentence in another\ninstitution. Houever, an inmate is not transported to a new\ninstitution immediately upon sentencing. The sentencing court\nmust first provide to the USMS the final presentence\ninvestigation report and a signed judgement ana commitment order.\nThe USMS must then forward these documents along with a request\nfor designation to the Designation and Sentence Computation\nCenter (DSCC), located in Grand Prairie, Texas. When designating\nan institution for an inmate to serve a sentence, the Bureau\nconsiders many factors, including but not limited to, the\nsecurity level of the inmate, medical or psychiatric concerns and\njudicial recommendations. Once an institution has been\ndesignated, the inmate will be transported on the next bus or\nairlift on which space is available. This entire process often\ntakes several weeks to complete.

If any develop or change in intensity, inform your doctor\nas soon as possible. Only your doctor can determine if it is safe for you to continue taking\nXanax. Your doctor should periodically reassess the need for Xanax.\nSide effects of Xanax are usually seen at the beginning of treatment and disappear with\ncontinued medication. Houever, if dosage is increased, side effects will be more likely.\ne Side effects of Xanax may include:\nDecreased libido, drousiness, fatigue, impaired coordination, memory impairment,\nspeech difficulties, weight changes\n@ Side effects of Xanax XR may include:\nConstipation, decreased libido, depression, drousiness, fatigue, impaired\ncoordination, memory problems, mental impairment, nausea, sedation, sleepiness,\nspeech difficulties, weight changes\ne Side effects due to a rapid decrease in dose or abrupt withdrawal from Xanax or\nXanax XR:\nAnxiety, blurred vision, decreased concentration, decreased mental clarity,\ndepression, diarrhea, headache, heightened awareness of noise or bright lights, hot\nflushes, impaired sense of smell, insomnia, loss of appetite, loss of reality, muscle\ncramps, nervousness, rapid breathing, seizures, tingling sensation, tremor, twitching,\nweight loss\nWhy should Xanax not be prescribed?\nIf you are <span class=\"highlight\">sensitive</span> to or have ever had an allergic reaction to Xanax or other tranquilizers,\nyou should not take Xanax. Also avoid Xanax while taking the antifungal drugs Sporanox or\nNizoral. Make sure that your doctor is aware of any drug reactions that you have experienced.\nDo not take Xanax if you have been diagnosed with the eye condition called narrou-angle\nglaucoma.\nAnxiety or tension related to everyday stress usually does not require treatment with Xanax.\nDiscuss your symptoms thoroughly with your doctor.\nSpecial warnings about Xanax\nXanax may cause you to become drousy or less alert; therefore, driving or operating\ndangerous machinery or participating in any hazardous activity that requires full mental\nalertness is not recommended.\nIf you are being treated for panic disorder, you may need to take a higher dose of Xanax than\nfor anxiety alone. High doses--more than 4 milligrams a day--of Xanax taken for long\nintervals may cause emotional and physical dependence. It is important that your doctor\nsupervise you carefully when you are using Xanax.\nAs with all antianxiety medication, there is a small chance that Xanax could encourage\nsuicidal thoughts or episodes of euphoria knoun as mania. If you notice any new or unusual\n| symptoms after starting Xanax, call your doctor immediately.\n|\n| Xanax should be used with caution in elderly or weak patients, and in those with lung disease,\nalcoholic liver disease, or any disorder that could hinder the elimination of the drug.\no7/26/l7 Page 43 of 95 Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nhtp://www.pdrhealth.com/drug_info/rxdrugprofiles/drugs/xanl49l.shtml 7/l9/2oo6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32233\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032934.jpg": "ee CURIAIN SKIN CARE\n\nbe . iS : im DO YOU HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THE FOLLOWING?\n\nz 2 : : B OLINES ) BREAKOUTS PIGMENTATION O EYE PUFFINESS\n\nSees r H © DEHYDRATION QVIRREGULAR TEXTURE IRREGULAR COLOR ( DARK CIRCLES\n\nSeay : ; WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CHANGE ABOUT YOUR SKIN?\n\n“ty WHAT IS YOUR SKIN TYPE?\n\n‘ 4 O o . iQ a\n\nbd ..
