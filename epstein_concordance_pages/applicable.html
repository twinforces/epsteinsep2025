It is\nfrankly outrageous for the defendant to suggest that preventing him from using his vast wealth to\nduplicate a private prison that cannot control, monitor, and contain him consistent with the\nrequirements of the Bail Act would cause him to somehou “bear a special disadvantage.” Release\nMotion at l2 n.9.

Danger to the Community\n\nIn the first instance, the defendant’s argument that l4 years without a criminal conviction\neliminates “any danger presumption” should be rejected. Were that the case—which is certainly\nis not—a lack of criminal record for any defendant would automatically rebut the presumption\n<span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> to crimes such as sex trafficking. That is manifestly incorrect. See United States v.\nArtis, 6o7 F.

Moreover, here, the defendant not only has a criminal\nrecord, but has been convicted of a sex crime involving a minor.\n\nBut the ongoing and forward-looking danger posed by the defendant is further\ndemonstrated by the defendant’s maintenance of a substantial collection of photographic trophies\nof his victims and other young females in his mansion, as discovered by the Government through\nits search warrants. As indicated in the Detention Memo, the many discs found in the defendant’s\nresidence included those with hand-writen labels including the follouing: “Young [Name] +\n[Name],” “Misc nudes l,” and “Girl pics nude.” Not surprisingly, the Government has found that\nsuch discs contain photographs of sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-nude\nfemales appearing to be underage.\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo338\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000346.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page4oflo\nHonorable Henry Pitman\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nJuly 8, 2ol9\nPage 4\nARGUMENT\nI. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant’s detention pending trial upon a determination that the defendant is either a\ndanger to the community or a risk of flight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e) (“no condition or combination of\nconditions would reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community”). A finding of risk of flight must be supported by a\npreponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. l987);\nUnited States v. Chimurenga, 76o F.2d 4oo, 4o5 (2d Cir. l985). A finding of dangerousness must\nbe supported by clear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 54o,\n542 (2d Cir. l995); Chimurenga, 76o F.2d at 4o5. In addition, a court may also order detention if\nthere is “‘a serious risk that the [defendant] will . . . atempt to obstruct justice, or . . . to threaten,\ninjure, or intimidate, a prospective witness or juror.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2)(B); see also United\nStates v. Friedman, 837 F.2d 48 (2d Cir. l988).\n\nThe Bail Reform Act lists four factors to be considered in the detention analysis: (l) the\nnature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person;\n(3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and]\nfinancial resources”; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the defendant’s release. See\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g). Evidentiary rules do not apply at detention hearings and the government is\nentitled to present evidence by way of proffer, among other means. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2);\nsee also United States v. LaFontaine, 2lo F.3d l25, l3o-3l (2d Cir. 2ooo) (government entitled\nto proceed by proffer in detention hearings); Ferranti, 66 F.3d at 542 (same); United States v.\nMartir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll45 (2d Cir. l986) (same).\n\nWhere a judicial officer concludes after a hearing that “no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community, such judicial officer shall order the detention of the person before\ntrial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). Additionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with\ncommiting an offense involving a minor victim under l8 U.S.C. § l59l, it shall be presumed,\nsubject to rebutal, that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the community. l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(e)(3)(E).\n\nII. Discussion\n\nThe defendant should be detained pending trial. For the reasons set forth belou, it is\ndifficult to overstate the risk of flight and danger to the community if the defendant is released,\nand for those reasons, the defendant cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of\ndetention in this case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo346\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000531.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 36 Filed o7/24/l9 Page 2l of 74 Pam\n\nl government is not aware of any at this time, your Honor.\n\n2 Nou, turning just very briefly to some of the legal\n\n5 arguments that defense counsel raised in their submission, the\n4 defendant raised legal arguments that he says he intends to\n\n5 argue later.\n\n6 The Court should have no confidence whatsoever that\n\n7 the defendant would stick around to pursue long-shot, dubious\n\n8 legal arguments at some future time.

The Treaty between the USA and France gives the French\ngovernment discretion as to whether or not to extradite its oun citizens to the USA.\nIt is noted that the leter of the French Minister does not provide any answer on this issue.\n2 The DOJ Memorandum and the Peterson Case\nIn support of its argument that the French government would not extradite Ms Ghislaine\nMaxwell to the USA, the government relies on the case of Mr Hans Peterson, a dual French\nAmerican citizen whose extradition to the US was denied by France in 2oo7.\nThe Peterson precedent should only be cited with great caution. First, | am not aware that this\ncase has given rise to a published judicial decision, therefore it should not be interpreted as the\nsupport of any legal rule or principle. In addition, in regards to the documents that the DOJ has\nreferred to in its memorandum, | doubt that a judicial decision has ever occurred in this case:\nas mentioned by the 2oo7 leter of US Senators Richard J. Durbin and Barack Obama to the\nFrench Minister of Foreign Affairs, the French Minister of Justice communicated its decision\nrefusing extradition on August 22\" 2oo7, only a few days after the suspect was arrested (at the\nbeginning of August 2oo7). This decision is not a Court decision but a discretionary decision\nfrom the French Ministry of Justice. It actually seems very unlikely that a court decision could\nhave been rendered in this timeframe. This indicates that the case must not have been handed\non to the court by the Ministry of Justice in the earliest stage of the extradition process.\nA refusal to extradite may possibly be challenged by the requesting government before the\nFrench Conseil d’Etat, which is the French Supreme Court for administrative maters, as for\nexample the United Kingdom and Hong Kong successfully challenged a decision from the\nFrench authorities not to extradite an individual whose extradition they had requested (Conseil\nd’Etat, l5 Octoberl993, no. l42578).

Durbin and Barack Obama in their\naforementioned leter to the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, which the government cites in\nits memorandum:\n\n“Article 3 of the Extradition Treaty between the United States and France provides in\n\npertinent part that “There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the\n\nextradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State”. While this Article\n\ndoes not require the extradition of a national to a requesting state, it also does not\n\nappear to preclude extradition. To the extent there is discretion available in such\n\nextradition decisions, we urge the French government to exercise that discretion in\n\nfavor of extradition ”.\nI am satisfied that this is the right interpretation of Article 3, as this is exactly the conclusion I\ncame to in my first report. To the extent that there is a discretion, there can be no absolute rule\nagainst the extradition of nationals under French law. A discretionary pouer ls not a legal rule.\nIndeed, there is no constitutional principle against the extradition of nationals. For these\nreasons, the Peterson case does not alter my view that under the specific and unique facts of\nthis case, it is highly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an\nextradition decree against Ms. Maxwell, particularly if Ms. Maxwell has signed an irrevocable\nwaiver in the USA.\nFinally, if an extradition request were to be issued against a French citizen today, the obligations\nof the French government under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France would\nalso need to be read in light of the Agreement on extradition between the European Union and\nthe United States of America, which came into force on February l*', 2olo, several years after\nthe Peterson case. Article l of this Agreement, which enhances cooperation between\nContracting Parties, provides that: “The Contracting Parties undertake, in accordance with the\nprovisions of this Agreement, to provide for enhancements to cooperation in the context of\n<span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> extradition relations between the Member States and the United States of America\ngoverning extradition of offenders”. The existence of this Agreement would need to be taken\ninto account by the French government in the exercise of its discretion as to whether or not to\ngrant the extradition of a French national to the USA.\n\nWilliam JULIE\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

Quite apart from the other factors rendering those bars\nunavailable to Ms Maxwell, as set out in the Opinion, it is difficult to\nconceive of circumstances in which a finding of oppression could be made\nin relation to the serious charges faced by Ms Maxwell in circumstances\nwhere she had absconded from the United States and was contesting her\nextradition in breach of good faith undertakings relied upon to secure her\nbail.

Second, it is not correct that section 93 of the Extradition Act 2oo3 (‘the 2oo3 Act’)\nconfers a general discretion on the Secretary of State to refuse extradition if a case is\nsent to her by the extradition judge’. The ambit of the pouer in section 93 is\ndescribed at paragraph 8 of the Opinion. The Secretary of State may only refuse\nextradition on the grounds provided for in that section, namely: (a) if an <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span>\nbar to extradition® is found to exist; (b) the Secretary of State is informed that the\nrequest has been withdrawn’; (c) there is a competing claim for extradition from\n\n> Opinion, para. 26.

Moreover, the Court should reject as premature the defendant’s assertion that\nher pretrial motions have somehou weakened the Government’s case; those motions have not been\nadjudicated, and, for the reasons set forth in the Government’s opposition memorandum, the\ndefendant’s motions have no merit.\n\nIn short, all three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors—the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncontinue to weigh heavily in favor of detention, and the defendant’s Motion does not present any\ninformation that warrants revisiting this Court’s well-reasoned and detailed prior decisions.\n\nA. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\n\n“After a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can reasonably\nassure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court may reopen the bail hearing if\n‘information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a\nmaterial bearing on the issue’ of whether pretrial detention is warranted.” (Dec.

First, the\ndefendant offers to renounce her foreign citizenship, claiming that this eliminates the risk that she\nwill flee from prosecution. Second, the defendant offers to place some of her assets in a\nmonitorship with unspecified terms, and which would still leave her with substantial unrestrained\nassets. Third, the defendant claims that her voluminous pretrial motions have diminished the\nstrength of the Government’s case. None of these arguments is persuasive, and the Motion should\nbe denied.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool246\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001259.jpg": "Cased 2o-CrOd3souAdNit DibCutrent l7o2 lFiKOS3i2e8/2agPidge& 66l8\n\nThe language of the extradition treaty between the United States and France and the\n<span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> French statues are clear that anyone seeking to contest extradition on the basis of\nFrench citizenship must be a French national at the time of the extradition request.

While we\nmaintain that Ms. Maxwell’s writen waivers of the right to challenge extradition should\nsuffice, her willingness to forfeit citizenship birthrights exceeds what is necessary and\nprofoundly demonstrates her commitment to abide by conditions of release and appear at\ntrial.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool259\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001296.jpg": "CGaseel2l\\7/oroo 2artauivent Documdil B62 Fileeh662o6/PhgPage & 6656\nRobertson release in September of last year, it believed that he would only remain in pretrial\ndetention for three additional months until a December 7, 2o2o trial date.

Pretrial detention is appropriate only where “no condition or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the [defendant].” United States v.\nSabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (quoting l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)). The Bail Reform Act\nprovides that a court “shail order the pretrial release” of the defendant (l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(b))\n(emphasis added), but may impose bail conditions if “such release will not reasonably assure the\nappearance” of the defendant in court. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c). Where conditions are necessary,\nsuch release shall be “subject to the /east restrictive .. . set of conditions that [the court]\ndetermines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.” l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(c)(l)(B) (emphasis added).

First, the government\nmust shou “by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant . . . presents an actual risk of\nflight.” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75 (emphasis added). If the government is able to satisfy this\nburden, it must then “demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that no condition or\ncombination of conditions could be imposed on the defendant that would reasonably assure his\npresence in court.” Jd.\n\nIn determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the defendant, the court must consider (l) the nature and circumstances of the\noffense charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person; (3) the history and\ncharacteristics of the person; and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or\nthe community that would be posed by the person’s release. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nIn this case, unlike in the Epstein case, the government does not contend that Ms.\nMaxwell poses any danger to the community, and therefore the fourth factor does not apply.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act contains a rebutable presumption, <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> based on certain of\nthe crimes charged here, that no conditions will reasonably assure against flight. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(e)(3)(E). In cases where this presumption applies, the “defendant bears a limited burden of\nproduction—not a burden of persuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward with\nevidence that [she] does not pose. . . a risk of flight.” See United States v. English, 629 F.3d\n3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quotation omited). This rebutable presumption can be readily\nsatisfied, United States v. Conway, No. 4-ll-7o756 MAG (DMR), 2oll WL 342l32l, at *2\n(N.D.

This Court should follou\nother courts in this Circuit and elsewhere that have found that defendants rebuted the\npresumption and imposed appropriately strict bail conditions in cases involving alleged\noffenses against minors.

Mar. 4, 2o2o); Conway,\n2oll WL 342l32l, at *4-5.\n\nThe Impact of the Potential Penalties Is Overstated. The government asserts that\ndetention is warranted because of the potential for a long sentence in this case. (Gov. Mem.\nat 4-5.) This oversimplifies the governing standard. Although the severity of potential\npunishment is a relevant consideration, the Second Circuit “require[s] more than evidence of\nthe commission of a serious crime and the fact of a potentially long sentence to support a\nfinding of risk of flight.” Friedman, 837 F.2d at 49-5o (district court’s finding that\ndefendant posed a risk of flight was clearly erroneous, despite potential for “long sentence\nof incarceration”); see also Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 65, 76-77 (reversing detention order\nwhere defendants agreed to significant physical and financial restrictions, despite the fact\nthat they faced a “lengthy term of incarceration”). Accordingly, the asserted potential for a\nlong sentence does not meet the government’s burden of persuasion. '*\n\n“ The government relies on United States v. Alindato-Perez, 627 F. Supp. 2d 58, 66 (D.P.R. 2oo9), cited\napprovingly by United States v. Moscaritolo, No. lo Cr. 4 JL), 2olo WL 3o9679, at *2 (D.N.H. Jan. 26, 2olo) for\nthe proposition that “[t]he steeper the potential sentence, the more probable the flight risk is, especially considering\nthe strong case of the government... .” (Gov. Mem. at 5.) But Alindato-Perez is easily distinguished on its facts\nfrom Ms. Maxwell’s case. Alindato-Perez was a narcotics case that did not involve 2o-year old conduct as here, but\ninstead involved a conspiracy that “continu[ed] until the date of the indictment.” 627 F. Supp. 2d at 6o-6l. The\nevidence included eleven “clearly incriminating video tapes” and testimony from various cooperating witnesses, and\nthe defendant faced a lo-year mandatory minimum sentence. /d. at 6l-64.

Houever, the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”’)\nis taking very significant steps to address that concern, and the defendant has offered no reason\nwhy she should be treated any differently from the many defendants who are currently detained at\nthe Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) pending trial, including defendants who have medical\nconditions that place them at heightened risk. Inmates at the MDC are able to assist in their oun\ndefense, especially long before trial, through established policies and procedures <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> to\nevery pretrial detainee. This defendant should not be granted the special treatment she requests.\n\nThe defendant faces a presumption of detention, she has significant assets and foreign ties,\nshe has demonstrated her ability to evade detection, and the victims of the defendant’s crimes seek\nher detention. Because there is no set of conditions short of incarceration that can reasonably\nassure the defendant’s appearance, the Government urges the Court to detain her.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nEach of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant —\nweigh strongly in favor of detention, and the defendant’s proposed package would do absolutely\nnothing to mitigate those risks.\n\nI. The Defendant’s Victims Seek Detention\n\nAs the Court is aware, pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (“CVRA”), a crime\nvictim has the right to be reasonably heard at certain public proceedings in the district court,\nincluding proceedings involving release. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(4).

This Court should reach\nthe same conclusion based on the extraordinary risk of flight described in detail above.\n\nThe defendant’s argument that bail is required for her to prepare her defense is equally\nunpersuasive.

Just last week, a district judge in the Eastern District of New York denied bail to a\ndefendant who argued that restricted access to his counsel at the MDC required his release, while\nnoting the volume of decisions reaching the same conclusion.

Annabi, No. lo Cr. 7 (CM), 2olo WL l25322l, at *l\n(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2olo). To establish that good cause exists for proposed restrictions in a\nprotective order, the government must shou that disclosure will cause “a clearly defined and\nserious injury.” United States v. Wecht, 484 F.3d l94, 2ll (3d Cir. 2oo7). A finding of harm\n“must be based on a particular factual demonstration of potential harm, not on conclusory\nstatements.” United States v. Gangi, l998 WL 226l96, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 4, l998) (citations\nand internal quotations omited). “Broad allegations of harm, unsubstantiated by specific\nexamples or articulated reasoning, do not support a good cause shouing.” Wecht, 484 F.3d at\n2ll.\n\nCourts must be careful not to impose a protective order that is “broader than is necessary”\nto accomplish its goals. United States v. Lindh, l98 F. Supp. 2d 739, 742 (E.D. Va. 2oo2)\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited). Thus, courts are instructed to “weigh the\nimpact” of requested protections and their extent against a defendant’s “due process right to\nprepare and present a full defense at trial.” Jd.\n\nDiscussion\n\nl. Restrictions on Use of Discovery Materials\n\nThe government and the defense agree that the protective order should include a\nrestriction prohibiting Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel from (i) using discovery materials “for\nany civil proceeding or any purpose” other than defending or preparing for this criminal action;\nor (i) posting discovery materials on the Internet. See Ex. A ff l(a), 5. The defense’s proposed\nprotective order would make those same restrictions <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> to potential government\nwitnesses and their counsel so that they are on equal footing with the defense. See Ex. A {¥ 3, 5.\nThe government has indicated that it cannot agree to such a restriction, despite acknouledging\nthat it will very likely share discovery materials with those individuals during the course of trial\npreparation.\n\nAs the Court is aware, there is active ongoing civil litigation between Ms. Maxwell and\nmany of the government’s potential witnesses. Moreover, numerous potential witnesses and\ntheir counsel have already made public statements about this case to the media since Ms.\nMaxwell’s arrest. There is a substantial concern that these individuals will seek to use discovery\nmaterials to support their civil cases and future public statements. It is therefore vital that the\ngovernment’s potential witnesses and their counsel be subject to the same restrictions as Ms.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool644\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001658.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 29-l Filed o7/27/2o Page l2 of l3\nincluding but not limited to Confidential Information, within 3o\ndays of the expiration of the period for direct appeal from any\nverdict in the above-captioned case; the period of direct appeal\nfrom any order dismissing any of the charges in the above-\ncaptioned case; the expiration of the period for a petition\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255; any period of time required by the\nfederal or state ethics rules <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> to any atorney of\nrecord in this case; or the granting of any motion made on\nbehalf of the Government dismissing any charges in the above-\ncaptioned case, whichever date is later.\n\nl9.

Jd. 74. Here, defense\ncounsel seeks permission to publicly identify any individuals who have self-identified as victims\nof either the defendant or Epstein “to the media or in public fora, or in litigation”—a vastly broader\nallouance. Indeed, as a comparison, none of the hypothetical examples described above would\nhave been subject to public naming and identification under the Epstein protective order, but every\nsingle one would be under the defendant’s proposed order in this case.\n\nAdditionally, beyond the differences in the language itself, there are two significant\ndifferences between the circumstances of the Epstein prosecution and this case. First, at the time\nthe Epstein protective order was entered, there were exceptionally few victims who had identified\nthemselves by name in litigation. Accordingly, the practical application of that provision was\nextremely limited. Second, and related, in the time between when the Epstein protective order was\nentered and the indictment in this case, many more victims have made public statements about\ntheir victimization at the hands of Epstein, and the defendant, on their oun terms and in their oun\nways, including by exercising their rights under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act in the context of\nthe dismissal of the indictment against Jeffrey Epstein follouing his suicide. Those victims could\nnot possibly have predicted, much less chosen, that their names would be publicly broadcast by\ndefense counsel in connection with a subsequent criminal case. Victims should be able to continue\nto come forward, in the ways and in the venues they themselves choose, without fear of reprisal,\nshaming, or other consequence arising from having their identities broadcast by defense counsel\nin this case.\n\nIn sum, the requested modification to the Government’s proposed order sought by the\ndefendant is contrary to precedent and the compelling privacy interests of victims. Moreover, it is\nwithout basis in fact or law, and, despite the Government’s repeated requests for clarity, the\ndefendant and defense counsel have offered no legitimate reason for their desire to be able to\npublicly identify any number of victims, in the context of this criminal case and elsewhere, other\nthan a minimal, conclusory statement, without factual examples or legal support.? At botom, the\ndefendant and her counsel seek an unlimited ability to name victims and witnesses publicly, for no\ndiscernible reason, and without justification or legal basis. The victims of Ghislaine Maxwell and\nJeffrey Epstein have suffered enough, and the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> law, and\ncommon decency compel far more protection of their privacy interests here than the defense\nproposal would afford.\n\nB.

The Government’s Plan for Obtaining and Reviewing Certain Files from the\nFlorida Investigation\n\nAs an initial mater, beginning during the course of its investigation, the Government has\nobtained the entirety of the FBI Florida Office’s case file from the Florida Investigation. The\nGovernment has already made productions from that file, is continuing to review that file, and\nintends to produce at the appropriate point any additional material in that file warranting disclosure\nin this case. That file includes, among other things, any FBI-3o2 of any relevant witness interview;\nany relevant materials obtained pursuant to federal grand jury subpoena as part of that\ninvestigation; and any relevant material seized during a search of Epstein’s Palm Beach residence\nconducted as part of that investigation. The Government believes the FBI file contains\nsubstantially all of the prior witness statements made during the Florida Investigation, including,\nif <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span>, any prior statements made by witnesses the Government intends to call at trial in this\ncase,\n\nIn total, the Government has identified six potential sources of material related to the\nFlorida Investigation, and has been requesting and reviewing materials from those sources as\nfollous:\n\nFirst, the Palm Beach Police Department (“PBPD”) opened its investigation into Jeffrey\nEpstein in or about 2oo5. During the course of that investigation, the PBPD, among other things,\nconducted numerous witness interviews, issued multiple subpoenas for documents,* and executed\na search warrant at Epstein’s Palm Beach Residence. In or about 2oo6, the PBPD referred its\ninvestigation to the FBI Florida Office. It is the Government’s understanding that the PBPD\nprovided its entire investigative file to the FBI Florida Office. As discussed above, the Prosecution\nTeam already has a copy of the full FBI Florida Office file and, as such, has been reviewing and\nwill continue to review the PBPD file for any material that warrants disclosure in this case.\nAdditionally, the Government has contacted the Records Specialist at the PBPD, who informed\nthe Government that the PBPD has no additional investigative files beyond what it already\nprovided to the FBI Florida Office. Out of an abundance of caution, houever, the Government\nasked the Records Specialist to provide the Prosecution Team with a copy of the files still in\nPBPD’s possession related to the Florida Investigation. In response, the PBPD Records Specialist\nprovided the Government with 6o pages of documents, which the Prosecution Team reviewed for\nany material that is non-duplicative and warrants disclosure in this case. The Prosecution Team\nhas identified five of those pages as non-duplicative and intends to produce those five pages as\npart of its next discovery production to the defense.\n\nSecond, the Palm Beach State’s Atorney’s Office (the “PBSA”), working with the PBPD,\namong other agencies, handled the Florida state investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein\nbetween approximately 2oo5 and 2olo (when Epstein completed his sentence). As a result of that\ninvestigation and prosecution, Epstein pled guilty to procuring an underage girl for prostitution\nand soliciting a prostitute. Prior to September l4, 2o2o, the Prosecution Team had never received\nany documents directly from the PBSA and did not have the PBSA’s full investigative file.\n* As detailed belou, these subpoenas were issued by the Palm Beach State’s Atorney’s Office.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool79l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001796.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 64 Filed lo/l4/2o Page 2 of 6\nThe Honorable Alison J.

In 2oll and 2ol2, Mr. Perry was part of a select team appointed by the U.K. government\nto conduct a review of the United Kingdom’s extradition arrangements, a review that formed the\nbasis of changes to the 2oo3 Extradition Act. (/d. Annex B § 3.l).\n\nIn Mr. Perry’s opinion, it is “highly unlikely that Ghislaine Maxwell would be able\nsuccessfully to resist extradition to the United States” in connection with this case. (Perry Rep.\n4 2(e)). After concluding that none of the potentially <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> bars to extradition or human\nrights objections would prevent Ms. Maxwell’s extradition, Mr. Perry explains that Ms.\nMaxwell’s waiver of her extradition rights “would be admissible in any extradition proceedings\nand, in cases, such as this one, where the requested person consents to their extradition, the\nextradition process is likely to take between one and three months to complete.” (/d. JJ] 24-39).\nMr. Perry’s report also undercuts the government’s representation at the initial hearing regarding\nlikelihood of bail (see Tr. 27), opining that “a person who absconded from [a] US criminal\nproceeding in breach of bail . . . is extremely unlikely to be granted bail” in a subsequent U.K.\nextradition proceeding. (Perry Rep. § 23).\n\nFrance. The accompanying report of William Julie (“Julie Rep.”) reviews the French\nextradition process as it would likely be applied to Ms. Maxwell. Mr. Julie is an expert on\nFrench extradition law who has handled extradition cases both within and outside the European\nUnion and regularly appears as an extradition expert in French courts.

The United States of America has been designated as a ‘Part 2 territory’ (also referred to as a\n‘Category 2 territory’) for the purposes of the 2oo3 Act®. The effect of this designation is that\nextradition requests from the United States fall to be considered under Part 2 of the 2oo3 Act’, and the\nUnited States is exempted from the requirement to provide evidence sufficient to make a case to\nanswer against the requested person (‘the prima facie case requirement’).\n\n5. Once a valid’ request for extradition is made by a Part 2 territory, the Secretary of State must, subject\nto very limited exceptions’ not <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> here, issue a certificate under section 7o. Once a certificate\nis issued, the Secretary of State must send the request and certificate to the appropriate judge. In\npractice, it is extremely rare for the Secretary of State to refuse to issue a certificate under section 7o.\n\n6. Under Part 2 of the 2oo3 Act, a requested person may be arrested pursuant to either a full extradition\nrequest'’, or a provisional request pending the service of a full extradition request'”.

In order to determine whether the French government may grant an extradition request\nrelating to a French citizen under the Extradition Treaty between France and the USA, it\nis thus necessary to evaluate the strength and status of the prohibition of the extradition\nof nationals under (i) <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> international law, (i) European law, and (i) French\nconstitutional law.\n\n7) International law\n\n65. As outlined, international treaties pertaining to extradition generally leave Contracting\nStates a right not to extradite their nationals, and State practice largely varies in this\nregard. Some States are strongly commited to the rule against the extradition of nationals\nand have conferred the principle constitutional status (Germany, Poland, Greece,\nPortugal, Estonia, Austria). Others have codified the principle in their national legislation\n(France, Lebanon, Chili, Qatar, Slovenia). By contrast, many States - in particular,\nCommon law jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, Australia, and the USA,\nextradite their oun citizens.\n\n66. Thus, there is no uniform rule regarding the extradition of nationals under international\nlaw.\n\n(i) European law\n\n67. European law does not prohibit the extradition of nationals either. As mentioned, Article\n6 of the European Convention on Extradition l957 provides States with a discretionary\nright on whether or not to extradite their oun citizens.\n\n68. More interestingly, the European Arrest Warrant Framework Decision of l3 June 2oo2\n(hereafter, “EAW FD”), which governs extradition maters between Member States of\nthe European Union, does not allou Member States the possibility to refuse the surrender\nof their nationals when the EAW is issued for the purpose of conducting a criminal\nprosecution. In fact, the surrender of a national who is the subject of criminal proceedings\nin another Member State of the European Union is at the cornerstone of the EAW FD.\n\n5l, rue Ampere - 75ol7 paris - tel. ol 88 33 5l 8o — fax. ol 88 33 5l 8l wj@wjavocats.com - l9\nwww.wjavocats.com - palais Cl652\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l44\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002147.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-22 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 23 of 3o\nWilliam JULIE\navocat a la cour — atorney at law\na United States citizen. Thus, there is no precedent to draw from in that\nregard. Houever, it is our view that under the specific and unique facts of this case, it is\nhighly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an\nextradition decree against Ms Maxwell because of several critical factors.\n\n78. First, under the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> Extradition Treaty between the USA and France, a State party\nmay refuse extradition on the basis of nationality, houever if it does so, it is obliged to\nprosecute the requested person itself, on the basis of the conduct and the allegations\ncontained in the request. In the case of Ms Ghislaine Maxwell, it is highly unlikely that the\nFrench government would be inclined to conducting such prosecution, considering that all\nthe relevant facts were commited in the USA, a long time ago, and that witnesses are also\nlocated in the USA.\n\n79. Secondly, France is mindful to preserve its good extradition relations with the United\nStates, as evidenced by a number of recent cases we reviewed or conducted in which\nFrench competent authorities proved highly cooperative with US authorities. If Ms\nGhislaine Maxwell were to flee to France, and the USA decided to issue an extradition\nrequest, it would be difficult for French authorities — from a diplomatic point of view — to\ndeny such an extradition request, considering that no legal bar applies.?”\n\n8o. Thirdly, the fact that Ms Ghislaine Maxwell also holds American nationality, and has\nsubstantial ties to the USA, would, in all likelihood, be taken into account by the French\ngovernment as one more element weighing in favor of extradition.\n\n8l. Similarly, and fourthly, the fact that Ms Ghislaine Maxwell signed a legally binding\nWaiver under US law, and would have subsequently fled to France in violation of her bail\nconditions, could equally be taken into account by the French government as an incentive\nnot to grant Ms Ghislaine Maxwell the benefit of her French nationality as a ban to\nextradition.\n\nWilliam Julie\n37 Of the 36 reported Supreme Court decisions involving extradition requests from the United States in the last 2o\nyears, the French authorities granted extradition in 34 of these cases.

The Treaty between the USA and France gives the French\ngovernment discretion as to whether or not to extradite its oun citizens to the USA.\nIt is noted that the leter of the French Minister does not provide any answer on this issue.\n2 The DOJ Memorandum and the Peterson Case\nIn support of its argument that the French government would not extradite Ms Ghislaine\nMaxwell to the USA, the government relies on the case of Mr Hans Peterson, a dual French\nAmerican citizen whose extradition to the US was denied by France in 2oo7.\nThe Peterson precedent should only be cited with great caution. First, ] am not aware that this\ncase has given rise to a published judicial decision, therefore it should not be interpreted as the\nsupport of any legal rule or principle. In addition, in regards to the documents that the DOJ has\nreferred to in its memorandum, | doubt that a judicial decision has ever occurred in this case:\nas mentioned by the 2oo7 leter of US Senators Richard J. Durbin and Barack Obama to the\nFrench Minister of Foreign Affairs, the French Minister of Justice communicated its decision\nrefusing extradition on August 22™ 2oo7, only a few days after the suspect was arrested (at the\nbeginning of August 2oo7). This decision is not a Court decision but a discretionary decision\nfrom the French Ministry of Justice. It actually seems very unlikely that a court decision could\nhave been rendered in this timeframe. This indicates that the case must not have been handed\non to the court by the Ministry of Justice in the earliest stage of the extradition process.\nA refusal to extradite may possibly be challenged by the requesting government before the\nFrench Conseil d’Etat, which is the French Supreme Court for administrative maters, as for\nexample the United Kingdom and Hong Kong successfully challenged a decision from the\nFrench authorities not to extradite an individual whose extradition they had requested (Conseil\nd’Etat, l5 Octoberl993, no. l42578).

Durbin and Barack Obama in their\naforementioned leter to the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, which the government cites in\nits memorandum:\n\n“Article 3 of the Extradition Treaty between the United States and France provides in\npertinent part that “There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the\nextradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State”. While this Article\ndoes not require the extradition of a national to a requesting state, it also does not\nappear to preclude extradition. To the extent there is discretion available in such\nextradition decisions, we urge the French government to exercise that discretion in\nfavor of extradition”.\n\nI am satisfied that this is the right interpretation of Article 3, as this is exactly the conclusion I\ncame to in my first report. To the extent that there is a discretion, there can be no absolute rule\nagainst the extradition of nationals under French law. A discretionary pouer is not a legal rule.\nIndeed, there is no constitutional principle against the extradition of nationals. For these\nreasons, the Peterson case does not alter my view that under the specific and unique facts of\nthis case, it ls highly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an\nextradition decree against Ms. Maxwell, particularly if Ms. Maxwell has signed an irrevocable\nwaiver in the USA.\n\nFinally, if an extradition request were to be issued against a French citizen today, the obligations\nof the French government under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France would\nalso need to be read in light of the Agreement on extradition between the European Union and\nthe United States of America, which came into force on February l*', 2olo, several years after\nthe Peterson case. Article l of this Agreement, which enhances cooperation between\nContracting Parties, provides that: “The Contracting Parties undertake, in accordance with the\nprovisions of this Agreement, to provide for enhancements to cooperation in the context of\n<span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> extradition relations between the Member States and the United States of America\ngoverning extradition of offenders”. The existence of this Agreement would need to be taken\ninto account by the French government in the exercise of its discretion as to whether or not to\ngrant the extradition of a French national to the USA.\n\nWilliam JULIE\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

Quite apart from the other factors rendering those bars\nunavailable to Ms Maxwell, as set out in the Opinion, it is difficult to\nconceive of circumstances in which a finding of oppression could be made\nin relation to the serious charges faced by Ms Maxwell in circumstances\nwhere she had absconded from the United States and was contesting her\nextradition in breach of good faith undertakings relied upon to secure her\nbail. Similar considerations apply to the balancing exercise required in\nassessing whether extradition would breach the right to family life under\nArticle 8 of the ECHR. The remaining bars to extradition and human rights\nbars are unlikely to be available to Ms Maxwell for the reasons given in\nthe Opinion’.\n\n(c) A breach of the undertakings in the waiver of extradition would be highly\nlikely to be viewed as a sign of bad faith and cause the extradition judge to\ntreat any evidence given by Ms Maxwell with scepticism.\n\n4. Second, it is not correct that section 93 of the Extradition Act 2oo3 (‘the 2oo3 Act’)\nconfers a general discretion on the Secretary of State to refuse extradition if a case is\nsent to her by the extradition judge’.

Ms. Maxwell has separately moved to dismiss Counts\nOne through Four of the Indictment because those counts were brought after the expiration of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> statute of limitation, l8 U.S.C.A. § 3282, which provides, in relevant part, that “no\nperson shall be prosecuted, tried, or punished for any offense, not capital, unless the indictment\nis found or the information is instituted within five years next after such offense shall have been\ncommited.” The government will argue that a much longer statute of limitation applies to the\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo25ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002512.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 9 of 26\ncharges alleged in Counts One through Four, l8 U.S.C. § 3283, which as amended in 2oo6,\nauthorizes the prosecution of certain specific crimes during “the life of the child, or for ten years\nafter the offense, whichever is longer.” As a practical mater, this is tantamount to no statute of\nlimitation and allous for substantial abuse by the government, particularly in a case with no\nforensic or other evidence to corroborate “she said” allegations.\n\nMs. Maxwell agrees that Counts Five and Six were brought within five years of her\ndeposition and therefore are within the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> statute of limitation, l8 U.S.C.A. § 3282.\nHouever, as with Counts One through Four, the government’s delay in charging Counts Five and\nSix resulted in substantial prejudice because the questions at issue, along with the resulting\nanswers, are ill defined, ambiguous, and could relate to almost any time. The capricious\nquestioning about 26-year-old claims presents the same practical problems for the defense,\nevidence that would exculpate Ms. Maxwell has been lost or destroyed.\n\nThis Indictment should be dismissed because Counts One through Four are time barred\nand the 26-year delay in bringing the charges violates Ms. Maxwell’s Fifth Amendment right to\ndue process. Counts Five and Six should be dismissed for the variety of reasons as catalogued in\nother pleadings and the four-year prejudicial preindictment delay also violates due process.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">APPLICABLE</span> LAW\n\nThe Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment requires dismissal of an indictment for\ndelay which results in a violation of the fundamental concepts of justice or the community's\nsense of fair play and decency. To determine whether a due process violation has occurred, the\ngovernment’s reasons for the delay must be weighed against the prejudicial effects of the delay\non the defendant. United States v. Marion, 4o4 U.S. 3o7, 324 (l97l).

Counts\nOne through Four charge Ms. Maxwell with offenses allegedly commited between l994 and\nl997. But the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> statute of limitations, l8 U.S.C. § 3282, expired five years after the\nalleged conduct.\n\nIn an atempt to get around its statute of limitations problem, the government has invoked\nl8 U.S.C. § 3283, as that statute was amended in 2oo3—many years after the alleged conduct\noccurred. But the government’s reliance on that provision is improper for two separate and\nindependent reasons, either of which, by itself, mandates dismissal of Counts One through Four.\n\nFirst, the charges are time-barred even under § 3283 unless the Court retroactively\napplies the 2oo3 amendment to the statute to cover Ms. Maxwell’s conduct from the l99os,\nrather than the version of § 3283 that was in effect at the time of the alleged offenses. But\nCongress made surpassingly clear that it did not intend the 2oo3 amendment to apply\nretroactively. To the contrary, the conference commitee considered and rejected an express\nretroactivity provision in the House version of the bill, and one of the bill’s original Senate co-\nsponsors acknouledged on the Senate floor that the omission was intentional. Moreover, any\nsuch retroactive application would have a presumptively impermissible retroactive effect.\n\nSecond, even if the 2oo3 amendment could be applied retroactively, § 3283 does not\napply to any of the offenses alleged in the indictment at all. Section 3283 is an exception to the\ngeneral five-year statute of limitations, and it applies only to an “offense involving” the sexual or\nphysical abuse or kidnapping of a child. The Supreme Court has repeatedly made clear that the\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2655\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002665.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l7 of 25\nby statutes whose retroactive application, while not the equivalent of criminal ex post facto,\nnevertheless would run afoul of ‘familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and\nsetled expectations.’”) Thus, in the criminal context, the second step of Landgraf should be read\nas providing protections broader than simply violations of the Ex Post Facto Clause, and as\nprohibiting retroactive application of a criminal statute of limitations—and the resulting\nexpansion of an individual’s exposure to criminal liability for completed conduct—even where\nthe charge is not time-barred at the time of the amendment.\n\nStatutes of limitations “<span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> to criminal prosecutions are designed principally to\nprotect individuals from having to defend themselves against charges supported by facts that are\nremote in time.” United States v. Rivera-Ventura, 72 F.3d 277, 28l (2d Cir. l995). That\nconcern is heightened here, where the government seeks to rely on the retroactive extension of a\ncriminal statute of limitations to prosecute a case based on conduct more than two decades old,\nwith litle, if any, evidence other than witness testimony. See Toussie, 397 U.S. at ll5\n(observing that statute of limitations “may also have the salutary effect of encouraging law\nenforcement officials promptly to investigate suspected criminal activity”). Since the time of the\nalleged conduct, memories have become faded or corrupted, documents have been lost or\ndestroyed, and witnesses have died, all to the extreme prejudice of Ms. Maxwell.” Retroactively\napplying the 2oo3 Amendment here not only would fly in the face of congressional intent; it\nwould violate all notions of fundamental fairness.°\n> See Motion to Dismiss Counts One through Six of the Superseding Indictment for Pre-Indictment Delay.\n\n° In Weingarten, the court stated that if the defendant’s counsel had successfully persuaded the trial court that the\n2oo3 Amendment could not retroactively extend the statute of limitations for live charges, the trial court’s holding\nwould have been in direct conflict with the Ninth Circuit’s opinion in United States v. Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d 92o\n(9th Cir. 2oo6). But in Leo Sure Chief, the alleged victim had not yet reached age 25 as of the time of the\nindictment, and thus the charges would not have been time-barred under either version of § 3283. Thus, the court in\nLeo Sure Chief did not perform a Landgraf analysis.\n\nll\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2665\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002751.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l65 Filed o3/o9/2l Page 4 of 9\nPage 4\n\nare serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the\nGovernment, including multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, is strong; the\nDefendant has substantial resources and foreign ties (including citizenship in a country that does\nnot extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who lived in hiding and apart from the family to\nwhom she nou asserts important ties, has not been fully candid about her financial situation.”\n(Dec.

First, the\ndefendant offers to renounce her foreign citizenship, claiming that this eliminates the risk that she\nwill flee from prosecution. Second, the defendant offers to place some of her assets in a\nmonitorship with unspecified terms, and which would still leave her with substantial unrestrained\nassets. Third, the defendant claims that her voluminous pretrial motions have diminished the\nstrength of the Government’s case.

The OPR Report further notes that, thereafter, Epstein sought to avoid\ncomplying with the NPA entirely, and his atorneys appealed to Main Justice in the hopes of\nvoiding the agreement. OPR Report at 94-lo8. That appeal was not successful. /d. In any event,\nthe involvement of Main Justice alone would not begin to establish the very different proposition\nthat Main Justice viewed the NPA as binding any district other than USAO-SDFL, let alone\nspecifically considered and approved such an outcome, or communicated such a promise to\nEpstein.\n\nFurther still, the record in the civil case makes clear that the USAO-SDFL’s position was\n\nthat the NPA did not bind other districts. In a July 5, 2ol3 brief, the USAO-SDFL stated:\n\n[T]he Non-Prosecution agreement simply obligated the government\n\nnot to prosecute Epstein in the Southern District of Florida for the\n\noffenses set forth in the Non-Prosecution Agreement.

Fla.) (emphasis in\noriginal); see also OPR Report at 8l, n.l25 (observing that a supervisor at the USAO-SDFL\n“pointed out that the NPA was not a ‘global resolution’ and other co-conspirators could have been\nprosecuted ‘by any other [U.S. Atorney’s] office in the country.’”).\n\nAs the USAO-SDFL has explained, the NPA did not bind other districts, and could not.\n\nThat is because the USAO-SDFL lacked the authority to do so under <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> Department of\nJustice guidelines:\n\nSignificantly, under the governing provision of the United States\n\nAtorney’s Manual, the USAO-SDFL did not have the authority to\n\nunilaterally bar Epstein’s prosecution in any other district in the\n\ncountry: ‘No district or division shall make any agreement,\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2974\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002984.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 5o of 239\nclaiming that the USAO-SDFL made promises that were not contained in the NPA. Nor has she\npointed to anything in the extensive record of either the OPR investigation or the civil litigation\nsurrounding the NPA that would suggest that the NPA applies to this District, or to the crimes in\nthe Indictment, or to Maxwell. In the absence of any such evidence—and in the face of substantial\ncontrary evidence gathered in the civil litigation and OPR investigation—the Court has no\nobligation to conduct a hearing.\n\nFor similar reasons, the defendant’s motion for discovery should be denied. To the extent\nthe defendant seeks discovery under Rule l6, she has failed to meet her burden. A defendant\nseeking discovery under Rule l6 “must make a prima facie shouing of materiality and must offer\nmore than the conclusory allegation that the requested evidence is material.” United States v.\nUrena, 989 F. Supp. 2d 253, 26l (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (citations omited). Here, the defendant has\noffered nothing more than her conjecture that some unspecified evidence might exist. The motion\nshould be denied.\n\nI. The Indictment Is Timely\n\nCounts One through Four are timely charged because the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> limitations period, l8\nU.S.C. § 3283 (2oo3), permits prosecution for offenses “involving the sexual or physical abuse...\nof a child” at any time “during the life of the child,” and each of the victims identified in the\nIndictment remains alive. Maxwell contends that Section 3283 should not be applied to conduct\nthat predated its amendment in 2oo3 (Def. Mot. 2), but that argument is contrary to the text of the\nstatute, Congress’s clear intent when extending the statute of limitations, and the decisions of other\ncircuits and district courts in this Circuit. In effect, the defendant’s motion asks this Court to break\nnew ground, and become the first court to hold that Section 3283 applies only prospectively.\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2984\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002987.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 53 of 239\npreclude such prosecution during the life of the child, or for ten years after the offense, whichever\nis longer.”).\n\nFinally, later that same year, Congress enacted a new statute as part of the Adam Walsh\nChild Protection and Safety Act of 2oo6, Pub. L. No. lo9-248, l2o Stat. 587. That statute\neliminated the statute of limitations entirely for certain crimes involving the sexual exploitation of\nminors. /d. tit. I], § 2ll(l), l2o Stat. at 6l6 (codified at l8 U.S.C. § 3299).\n\nB. The 2oo3 Amendment to Section 3283 Applies Retroactively\n\nCounts One through Four of the Indictment charge crimes that occurred between l994\nand l997. At the time of the offense conduct, the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> statute of limitations, l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3283 (l994), ran until “the child reaches the age of 25.” Houever, in 2oo3, while the statute of\nlimitations had not yet run for the crimes charged in the Indictment,!? Congress amended the\nstatute, extending the limitations period to permit a prosecution at any time “during the life of the\nchild.” l8 U.S.C. § 3283 (2oo3). Because the victims are all alive, the Indictment is timely under\nthe 2oo3 amendment.\n\nPut simply, the 2oo3 amendment applies to any conduct that could have been charged at\nthe time of its enactment. The legislative purpose behind Section 3283 and a plain reading of the\nstatute compel this conclusion, and courts have repeatedly held that the 2oo3 amendment applies\nretroactively, provided that the statute of limitations had not run for the offense at the time of the\namendment. See, e.g., United States v. Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d 92o, 922-25 (9th Cir. 2oo6)\n(“Because Congress evinced a clear intent to extend, rather than shorten, the statute of limitations\n<span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> to sexual abuse crimes, and because there is no ex post facto problem here, the\nprosecution was timely.”) (citing United States v. Jeffries, 4o5 F.3d 682, 685 (8th Cir. 2oo5), cert.\n\" The timeliness of the charges in the Indictment in 2oo3 is discussed in greater detail belou.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2987\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003003.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 69 of 239\n\ncan use to carry her heavy burden. Without proof of actual prejudice, the motion fails. Second,\neven if the Court finds actual prejudice to the defense, the defendant has not established that the\nGovernment’s purpose in any alleged pre-indictment delay was improper or designed to gain any\nsort of tactical advantage. The Government obtained an indictment charging the defendant on\nJune 29, 2o2o, less than two years after opening its investigation and less than a year after victims\nwith information critical to the pending charges came forward. The defendant thus cannot\nestablish an undue delay, much less a delay caused by the Government for an improper purpose.\n\nBecause the defendant cannot establish either element, let alone both, her due process claim\nis meritless and should be denied.\n\nA. The Defendant Has Failed to Demonstrate Actual and Substantial Prejudice\n\nl. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\n\nIt is well-setled that the statute of limitations is “the primary guarantee against bringing\noverly stale criminal charges.” United States v. Marion, 4o4 U.S. 3o7, 322 (l97l) (internal\nquotation marks and citations omited). Thus, when a case has been brought within the statute of\nlimitations, it is “only rarely dismissed,” and carries a “strong presumption of validity.” United\nStates v. Cornielle, l7l F.3d 748, 752 (2d Cir. l999); see also United States v. Lawson, 683 F.2d\n688, 694 (2d Cir. l982).\n\nThe Second Circuit standard for pre-indictment delay is clear, and it imposes a heavy\nburden on the defendant to shou that: (i) “he suffered actual prejudice because of the alleged pre-\nindictment delay,” and (i) “that such delay was a course intentionally pursued by the government\nfor an improper purpose.” Cornielle, l7l F.3d at 752 (citations omited). The burden for proving\nboth prongs of the standard rests squarely on the defendant. United States v. Scarpa, 9l3 F.3d\n993, lol4 (2d Cir. l99o); United States v. Rubin, 6o9 F.2d 5l, 66 (2d Cir. l979); United States v.\n\n42\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3oo3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003013.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 79 of 239\nB. The Defendant Has Failed to Establish That the Government Delayed the\nIndictment for An Improper Purpose\nl. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\n\nIf, and only if, a defendant has established significant, actual prejudice does the inquiry\nturn to the reason for the delay.*® See, e.g., Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *5 (“Because\nDefendant failed to shou prejudice, the Court need not even address the second prong.”). The\nreason for delay violates due process only if it is so extreme that it departs from fundamental\nnotions of “fair play.’” United States v. Lovasco, 43l U.S. 783, 795 (l977). The Supreme Court\nhas “defined the category of infractions that violate ‘fundamental fairness’ very narrouly,”\nDouling v. United States, 493 U.S. 342, 352 (l99o), and the Supreme Court has “stressed the\nimportance for constitutional purposes of good or bad faith on the part of the Government when\nthe claim is based on loss of evidence atributable to the Government,” Arizona v. Youngblood,\n488 U.S. 5l, 57 (l988).\nl6 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which provides ample information about the\ncharged crimes and the victims referenced in the Indictment. Additionally, many of the\ndefendant’s requests fall within the scope of the Government’s Giglio and Jencks Act obligations,\nwhich the Government intends to produce at the appropriate stage in the litigation, well in advance\nof trial.\n°° The defendant invites the Court to engage in a balancing test that weighs the prejudice to the\ndefendant against the Government’s reasons for delay. (Def. Mot. 7 at 5,6 n.4). This Court should\nreject the defendant’s invitation. The defendant cites United States v. Brand, 556 F.2d l3l2, l3l7\nn.7 (Sth Cir. l977), for the proposition that a shouing of prejudice triggers such balancing. (Def.\nMot. 7 at 5). Houever, the Fifth Circuit subsequently rejected such a balancing test, finding that\nthe “Brand footnote is pure dicta” and instead requiring that defendants demonstrate that the\nprosecution intentionally caused the delay to gain a tactical advantage over the defendant or “for\nsome other bad faith purpose.” United States v. Crouch, 84 F.3d l497, l5o9, l5l2 (Sth Cir. l996).\nThe defendant also cites that several Circuit courts, namely the Fourth, Seventh, and Ninth\nCircuits, require such a balancing test. (Def. Mot. 7 at 6n.4). The Second Circuit, houever, “has\nnot adopted any balancing test, as the Fourth, Seventh and Ninth Circuits have, and its\nJurisprudence suggests that it would not do so.” United States v. Santiago, 987 F. Supp. 2d 465,\n49o (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). Several other Circuits have also “refused to adopt a balancing test.” Jd.\n(collecting cases). This Court should follou that example.\n\n52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ol3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003017.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 83 of 239\nsatisfied that he should prosecute and will be able promptly to establish guilt beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.” (internal quotation marks and citations omited)).\n\nMoreover, even if the Court were to determine that a twenty-six-year period of delay were\n<span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> here, the defendant’s motion should be dismissed because she failed to shou that the\nGovernment acted improperly to obtain a tactical advantage. See, e.g., Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL\n4o43l4o (denying motion to dismiss for pre-indictment delay as to conduct charged in 2ol6\ninvolving sexual abuse of minors from l998 to 2oo7 as defendant failed to satisfy both prongs of\npre-indictment delay standard); United States v. Burke, No. o9 Cr. l35 (SJ), 2oll WL 26o9837,\nat *7 (E.D.N.Y. July l, 2oll) (denying motion to dismiss indictment based on thirty-year pre-\nindictment delay because even if unavailability of alibi witnesses were prejudicial, defendant failed\nto shou that government delayed for its oun benefit); United States v. Carbonaro, No. o2 Cr. 743\n(RCC), 2oo4 WL 2222l45 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 3o, 2oo4) (in a racketeering conspiracy case in which\na l4-year-old murder was alleged as a predicate act, finding that, even assuming defendant had\nshoun actual prejudice, defendant’s motion to dismiss based on pre-indictment delay failed\nbecause defendant supplied no evidence that government’s conduct was for an improper purpose).\n\nThe defendant claims that the Government intentionally delayed the indictment in this case\nwith a prescient view touards capitalizing on civil litigation. For instance, Maxwell asserts that it\n“has been advantageous to the government to have aggressive lawyers collecting information from\nMs. Maxwell as part of civil discovery and disseminating that information to the public, as part of\nan ongoing campaign to vilify Ms. Maxwell.” (Def. Mot. 7 at l6). She again cites the subpoena\nthe Government issued to Boies Schiller & Flexner LLP (“Boies Schiller”) to obtain materials\nfrom the Giuffre civil litigation. (/d.).

Epstein, et al., l7 Civ. o6l6 (JGK) (SN). Because\nof the ongoing and covert nature of the grand jury investigation, and consistent with its standard\npractice under such circumstances, the Government did not notify the defendant or her counsel\nthat it had issued the subpoenas.\n\nIn response to receiving the subpoenas, Boies Schiller began producing materials not\ncovered by the protective orders in the relevant civil cases. Houever, Boies Schiller also had\nadvised the Government that although it would not otherwise contest compliance with the\nsubpoenas, it believed that the protective orders precluded full compliance.» (Exs. 8 & 9).\nAccordingly, the Government applied ex parte and under seal to each relevant court (Judge Sweet\nand Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn, respectively) to request that each court modify the respective\nprotective orders to permit compliance with the subpoenas. (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. C).\n\nFollouing a request by Judge Sweet for briefing supporting the Government’s initial\napplication, see Def. Mot. 3, Ex. D at 4, 2o; Ex. G at 6, the Government submited ex parte and\nsealed leters in support of its applications to each court on or about February 28, 2ol9. (Exs. 8 &\n9). The Government wrote, “Where, as here, a grand jury subpoena has validly issued, and the\nrecipient of the subpoena is not contesting compliance—but rather seeking authorization to comply\nwith the subpoena—a court should grant such permission through limited modification of an\n<span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> protective order, absent countervailing interests not present in this case.” (/d. at 2). The\nGovernment submited that the court was “best guided” by Chemical Bank v. Affiliated FM Ins.\nCo., l54 F.R.D. 9l, 93 (S.D.N.Y. l994), in which the court rejected an application for a party in\ncivil litigation to be held in contempt for complying with a grand jury subpoena by producing\n3 Significantly, and as detailed herein, Boies Schiller did not produce to the Government any\nmaterials subject to the protective orders until, as further described belou, it received an order\ngranting it the ability to do so in one of the civil cases.\n\n67\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o28\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003030.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 96 of 239\nMartindell was <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span>. (/d. at 3). She stated that were the Government’s application disclosed\nto the parties, “Maxwell would protest” and argue that the Government lacked standing as it was\nnot a party to the protective order.

In response to questions from Chief Judge McMahon,\nthe Government explained that the protective order, on its face, did not implicate the types of\nconfidential business information or trade secrets ordinarily considered by courts in conducting\nthe Martindell balancing test. (/d. at l3).\n\nChief Judge McMahon stated that the protective order did not contain a provision allouing\na party to the order to disclose materials requested by law enforcement without permission of the\ncourt, noting her understanding that “it may have been negotiated out.” (/d. at l4-l5). The court\ninquired whether the Government’s position was that “reliance on the nondisclosure of\nconfidential materials to law enforcement in connection with a grand jury subpoena that has been\nduly authorized would be unreasonable.” (/d. at l4). The Government responded in the\naffirmative, stating that the Government believed a provision precluding compliance with a law\nenforcement request would be void for public policy. (Ud. at l5). The Government further cited\nChemical Bank in support of the proposition that it would be unreasonable to rely on a protective\norder provision that barred the disclosure of information to law enforcement. (/d. at l5-l6).\n\nIn response to questions about the breadth of the subpoena, the Government explained that\nit was “essentially unable to significantly narrou the request for information ... . We have either\nlitle or no additional information than the Court does in terms of what materials there are [and]\nwho was deposed.” (/d. at l7). In response to Chief Judge McMahon’s question about the privacy\ninterests implicated by the protective order, (id. at l6-l7), the Government also noted that it was\ndissimilar to an ordinary third-party intervenor in that it would be “extremely restricted” in its use\n\n69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o3o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003037.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo3 of 239\ncommited perjury.” According to two anonymous sources, “a second meeting occurred.”\nHouever, the Article cites another anonymous source as “insist[ing] [a second meeting] never\nhappened.”\n\nB. The Defendant’s Suppression Motion Should Be Denied\n\nMaxwell seeks suppression of the evidence the Government obtained via a judicially\nauthorized subpoena to Boies Schiller under Martindell, the Fourth Amendment, Fifth\nAmendment, the Due Process clause, and the Court’s inherent authority. Houever, Maxwell’s\nmotion turns on erroneous facts, runs afoul of controlling law, and should be denied.\n\nl. Martindell Provides No Basis to Grant the Relief the Defendant Seeks\n\nMaxwell argues that the Government “circumvented” the Second Circuit’s decision in\nMartindell and “violated Maxwell’s rights,” which requires suppression of the evidence the\nGovernment obtained from the subpoena. (Def. Mot. ll at ll-l2). Even assuming that to be\ntrue—which, of course, as detailed above and herein, it is not—there is no basis in law to suppress\nevidence as a result of a Martindell violation, and Maxwell cites none in support of her claim.\nSeting that fatal flaw aside, houever, her claim is wrong on both the facts and the law. The\nGovernment issued a valid grand jury subpoena for the materials, applied for judicial authorization\nto modify the protective order to permit compliance with the subpoena, and a district court judge,\nwho evaluated the Government’s application under Martindell, properly exercised her discretion\nin modifying the protective order. Only after receiving that court order did the Government obtain\nany protected materials from Boies Schiller. Maxwell’s motion should be denied.\n\na. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\n\n“{T]here is no question that a Rule 26(c) protective order is subject to modification,” and\n\na decision to modify such an order is “commited to the sound discretion of the trial court.” Jn re\n76\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o37\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003040.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo6 of 239\nsupervision of a judge, the longstanding principle that ‘the public . . . has a right to every man’s\nevidence,’ except for those persons protected by a constitutional, common-law, or statutory\nprivilege is particularly <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> to grand jury proceedings.” (internal citations omited)).\n\nb. Discussion\n\nThe Government did not, in any way, atempt to circumvent Martindell. To the contrary,\nthe Government presented Martindell squarely to the relevant courts, first arguing that its test was\nnot <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span>, and then, in the alternative, that the requested relief should be granted even if the\ncourts applied the Martindell standard. It cannot possibly be the case that the Government was\natempting to “circumvent” a case that it cited ll times in its argument to both relevant courts.\n(See (Exs. 8 & 9). Instead, the Government issued a subpoena to Boies Schiller in connection with\nits investigation and made an application to two judges to modify Rule 26(c) protective orders that\nprecluded full compliance with those subpoenas. While the Government argued that the court\nneed not employ the Martindell balancing test for several reasons, it also made arguments under\nMartindell in the alternative. Ultimately, both Chief Judge McMahon and Judge Netburn found\nthat Martindell applied and analyzed the Government’s application under that framework.\n\nAs Chief Judge McMahon found, even under the Martindell approach, testimony provided\npursuant to a protective order can be divulged to a grand jury if the government establishes “some\nextraordinary circumstance or compelling need.” Martindell, 594 F.2d at 296. After concluding\nthat reliance on the protective order was unreasonable,*° Chief Judge McMahon found that the\n“Government [ ] persuasively demonstrated extraordinary circumstances,” citing “significant\n6 See, e.g., Int’!

Because Maxwell lacked a privacy interest in the files of a third party law firm who\nrepresented her adversary in civil litigation, and because the subpoena was entirely lawful, she\ncannot make out a Fourth Amendment violation. Moreover, even if Maxwell had standing to assert\nthis claim, it would nonetheless fail because the Government relied in good faith on a judicial order\npermiting compliance with its subpoena.\n\na. Maxwell Has Not Established Standing\ni. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\n\nThe Fourth Amendment protects the “right of the people to be secure in their persons,\nhouses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.” U.S. Const. amend IV.\n“The basic purpose of this Amendment . . . is to safeguard the privacy and security of individuals\nagainst arbitrary invasions by governmental officials.” Carpenter v. United States, l38 S. Ct.\n22o6, 22l3 (internal quotation marks and citation omited). “It has been clear for a generation that\n‘Fourth Amendment rights are personal rights . . . [that] may not be vicariously asserted.’” United\nStates v. Haqq, 278 F.3d 44, 47 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (quoting Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S. l28, l33-34\n(l978)). Accordingly, a defendant’s Fourth Amendment rights “are violated only when the\nchallenged conduct invaded his legitimate expectation of privacy rather than that of a third party.”\nUnited States v. Payner, 447 U.S. 727, 73l (l98o) (emphasis in original); see also United States\nv. Villegas, 899 F.2d l324, l333 (2d Cir. l99o). Ultimately, the Fourth Amendment inquiry is\n“whether [a] defendant has established a legitimate expectation of privacy in the area searched.”\nUnited States v. Chuang, 897 F.2d 646, 649 (2d Cir. l99o) (citations omited). This threshold\nquestion involves two separate inquiries: (l) whether a defendant has demonstrated a subjective\n\n82\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o43\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003047.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll3 of 239\n\nat lo), the Court should reject the defendant’s efforts to twist Carpenter’s exception to the third\nparty rule beyond recognition. The defendant was not compelled to participate in the deposition\nor to answer questions without invoking her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination; she\nvoluntarily chose to do so. Even if she chose to do so in reliance on the protective order, that\nprotective order was subject to modification under well-setled case law and by its oun terms.\nContrary to the defendant’s claims (Def. Mot. ll at lo), she assumed the risk that the deposition\ntranscripts would divulged to the Government. See, e.g., United States v. Schaefer, No. l7 Cr. 4oo\n(AZ), 2ol9 WL 2677ll, at *5 (D. Or. Jan. l7, 2ol9) (declining to apply Carpenter where\ngovernment obtained defendant’s eBay transactions without a warrant as defendant “assumed the\nrisk that [eBay] would reveal to police the purchases he made” and defendant “did not have a\nreasonable expectation of privacy in the records of his purchases”).\n\nBecause Maxwell had no legitimate Fourth Amendment privacy interest in the materials in\nBoies Schiller’s possession, she has no standing to challenge their seizure, and no warrant was\nrequired to obtain those materials. Her motion should be rejected on this ground alone.\n\nb. The Government Acted in Good Faith\n\nEven if the defendant had standing to bring this motion, it still fails because the\nGovernment only obtained these materials after obtaining a court order authorizing it to do so. The\nGovernment accordingly acted in good faith when it acted pursuant to that judicial order.\n\ni. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\n\nUnder the so-called “good faith” exception, the exclusionary rule and its remedy of\nsuppression do not apply “when the Government ‘act[s] with an “objectively reasonable good-\nfaith belief that their conduct is lawful.’” United States v. Zodhiates, 9ol F.3d l37, l43 (2d Cir.\n2ol8) (quoting Davis v.

The Government\nacted with an “objectively reasonable good-faith belief’ that its conduct was lawful and in\nreasonable reliance on the district court’s order. Zodhiates, 9ol F.3d at l43 (internal quotation\nmarks and citations omited).\n\nc. Suppression of Certain Materials Would Be Improper Under\nthe Inevitable Discovery Doctrine\nTo the extent materials the Government obtained from Boies Schiller have nou been\nunsealed and posted on the public docket, there is no basis to suppress such materials because the\nGovernment would have inevitably been able to access them upon unsealing.\ni. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\nUnder the inevitable discovery doctrine, “evidence that was illegally obtained will not be\nsuppressed ‘if the government can prove that the evidence would have been obtained inevitably’\neven if there had been no statutory or constitutional violation.” United States v.

When a claim of\ninevitable discovery is raised, the court must “determine, viewing affairs as they existed at the\ninstant before the unlawful search occurred, what would have happened had the unlawful search\nnever occurred.” Stokes, 733 F.3d at 444 (citation omited) (emphasis in original); see also United\nStates v.

The Defendant’s Motion to Suppress Evidence Obtained Pursuant to\nthe Subpoena Under the Fifth Amendment Is Without Merit\n\nThe defendant’s motion to suppress all evidence obtained pursuant to the subpoena on Fifth\nAmendment grounds fails for multiple, independent reasons. As an initial mater, Boies Schiller\nis not the Government and was not acting as an agent of the Government when it deposed the\ndefendant or otherwise litigated the civil case against her. That the defendant may regret her choice\nto respond to Boies Schiller’s questions during two depositions instead of invoking her privilege\nagainst self-incrimination does not transform that choice into a Fifth Amendment violation.\n\na. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\ni. The Fifth Amendment — Generally\n\nThe Fifth Amendment provides in pertinent part: “No person . . . shall be compelled in any\ncriminal case to be a witness against himself.” U.S. Const. amend. V. To establish a Fifth\nAmendment violation, an individual must “demonstrate the existence of three elements:\nl) compulsion, 2) a testimonial communication, and 3) the incriminating nature of that\ncommunication.” Jn re Grand Jury Subpoena, 826 F.2d ll66, ll68 (l987); see also, e.g., In Re\nThree Grand Jury Subpoenas Jan. 5, l988, 847 F.2d lo24, lo28 (2d Cir. l988).\n\nIt is “axiomatic that the Amendment does not automatically preclude self-incrimination,\nwhether spontaneous or in response to questions put by government officials.” United States v.\nWashington, 43l U.S. l8l, l86 (l977). “Indeed, far from being prohibited by the Constitution,\nadmissions of guilt by wrongdoers, if not coerced, are inherently desirable.” Jd. at l87. “[T]he\nFifth Amendment proscribes only self-incrimination obtained by a ‘genuine compulsion of\ntestimony.’” /d. (quoting Michigan v. Tucker, 4l7 U.S. 433, 44o (l974)); see also Washington,\n43l U.S. at l87 (“Absent some officially coerced self-accusation, the Fifth Amendment privilege\nis not violated by even the most damning admissions.”).

Mot. ll at l5-l6). That is not the law,\nand the defendant cannot use the protective order to cloak her testimony. The Second Circuit has\nrecognized that because “i]t is well-setled here and elsewhere . . . that a Rule 26(c) protective\norder may be overturned or modified based on a finding of improvidence, extraordinary\ncircumstances or compelling need[,]” “as a practical mater it is clear that the protections afforded\nby a Rule 26(c) order are not as extensive as those afforded by the fifth amendment, or by a\nstatutory grant of use immunity, and that a protective order therefore cannot be used to abridge a\nwitness’ fifth amendment rights.” Andover Data Servs., 876 F.2d at lo83 (emphasis in original);\nsee id. at lo84 (‘Uncertainty about the ultimate outcome of a protective order will mean that no\ndeponent may always effectively rely on a protective order to secure his right against self-\nincrimination.””) (quoting Jn re Grand Jury Subpoena, 836 F.2d l468, l478 (4th Cir. l988)));\nDavis, 7o2 F.2d at 42l-22 (“Absent <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> grounds for exception, such as a previously asserted\nFifth Amendment privilege, no shield protects the civil evidence [ | from compellable production\nbefore the grand jury which subpoenaed it’).\n\n4. The Government Did Not Violate Maxwell’s Due Process Rights\n\nThe defendant also claims that the Government’s conduct “cannot be squared with\nelemental due process.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l4 (citing U.S. Const. amend. V)). This claim is meritless.\nBecause there was no Government misconduct—let alone the type of outrageous Government\n\nlo3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o64\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003065.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l3l of 239\nmisconduct that would justify the extraordinary remedy the defendant seeks—the motion must be\ndenied.\n\na. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\n\nThe Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides that “[n]o person . . . shall be\ndeprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law ... .” The Due Process Clause\n“protects individuals against two types of government action.” Martinez v. McAleenan, 385 F.\nSupp. 3d 349, 356 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9). Procedural due process “ensures that government cannot\nunfairly and without meaningful process deprive a person of life, liberty, or property,” while\nsubstantive due process “prevents the government from engaging in conduct that shocks the\nconscience, or interferes with rights implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.” Jd. (internal\nquotation marks and citations omited; alteration omited).\n\nProcedural due process analysis focuses on whether “government action depriving a person\nof life, liberty, or property. . . [is] implemented in a fair manner,” United States v. Salerno, 48l\nU.S. 739, 746 (l987). “Courts examine procedural due process questions in two steps: the first\nasks whether there exists a liberty or property interest which has been interfered with by the\n[Government]; the second examines whether the procedures atendant upon that deprivation were\nconstitutionally sufficient.” United States v. Arzberger, 592 F. Supp. 2d 59o, 599 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo8)\n(internal quotation marks and citations omited).\n\nAs to substantive due process, the Supreme Court is “always . . . reluctant to expand the\nconcept of substantive due process because guideposts for responsible decisionmaking in this\nunchartered area are scarce and open-ended.” Washington v.

The rights to confront and cross-examine witnesses and\nto call witnesses in one's oun behalf have long been recognized as essential to due process.”\nChambers v. Mississippi, 4lo U.S. 284, 294 (l973). And as noted, the defendant cites no legal\nauthority supporting the proposition that the Government’s actions during its investigation have\nsomehou deprived her of a fair trial or otherwise violated her due process rights. In short, none\nof Maxwell’s allegations of misconduct rises to the level of a due process violation.\n\nDismissal of Counts Five and Six of the Indictment would be all the more unwarranted\nhere, where there was no outrageous Government misconduct and where the defendant cannot\nshou that the Government’s behavior prejudiced her defense or legal representation. Similarly,\nbecause there was no misconduct by the Government, there is no basis to suppress the evidence\nobtained pursuant to the subpoena. The defendant’s motion—unsupported by the law and the\nfacts—must be denied.\n\n5. The Court Should Not Exercise Its Inherent Authority to Order\nSuppression\n\nThe defendant urges the Court to exercise its inherent authority to order suppression.

The Court added\nthat the “scope of Defendant’s answers are not bound by time period, though Defendant need not\nanswer questions that relate to none of these subjects or that is clearly not relevant.” (/d.). The\ndefendant sat for a second deposition on July 22, 2ol6, before the case setled.\n\nAs discussed more fully belou, the Indictment charges the defendant with two counts of\nperjury, one arising from statements made during the April 2ol6 deposition and one arising from\nstatements made during the July 2ol6 deposition. Indictment 9 2l, 23. (Ex. lo at 253:25-254:8,\n384:l5-2o; Ex. ll at 88:9-89:l3, 9l:22-92:l6, ll3:2-l2). The defendant nou moves to dismiss\nboth counts, arguing that the Court can effectively decide nou, as a mater of law, that the questions\nwere fundamentally ambiguous, her answers were true, and her answers were immaterial to the\ncase.\n\nB. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\n\nSection l623(a) imposes criminal penalties on anyone who “in any proceeding before or\nancillary to any court .. . knouingly makes any false material declaration.” l8 U.S.C. § l623(a).\nIn perjury prosecutions, “whether the witness believes that an answer is true or false generally\nturns on the declarant’s understanding of the question.” United States v. Lighte, 782 F.2d 367, 372\n(2d Cir. l986). Accordingly, and as is true of virtually all factual issues, “[a] jury is best equipped\n\nll9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o8o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003099.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l65 of 239\n\nIn sum, the defendant asks this Court to dismiss Counts Five and Six by stretching to read\nambiguity into clear questions and encouraging the Court to resolve questions commited to the\njury. The Court should reject those arguments and permit the jury to resolve these issues of fact.\nVI. Counts Five and Six Are Properly Joined and Should Not Be Severed\n\nThe Indictment charges the defendant with participating in a scheme to sexually abuse\nminors, and with commiting perjury to conceal her crimes. All six counts of the Indictment are\nproperly joined: they are logically connected, subject to overlapping proof, and connected by a\ncommon scheme or plan. To sever the counts and justify holding a second trial at which a second\njury will be convened and the same witnesses—including victims of sexual abuse—will testify a\nsecond time, the defendant must carry a heavy burden by shouing substantial prejudice from the\njoinder. She has not done so, and the severance motion should be denied.\n\nA. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 8(a) permits the joinder of offenses that “are of the\nsame or similar character, or are based on the same act or transaction, or are connected with or\nconstitute parts of a common scheme or plan.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(a). This rule establishes three\ntests for joinder, each “reflect[ing] a policy determination that gains in trial efficiency outweigh\nthe recognized prejudice that accrues to the accused.” United States v. Turoff, 853 F.2d lo37,\nlo42 (2d Cir. l988).\n\nCharges are “similar” if they are “somewhat alike” or “hav[e] a general likeness to each\nother.” United States v. Rivera, 546 F.3d 245, 253 (2d Cir. 2oo8) (quoting United States v. Werner,\n62o F.2d 922, 926 (2d Cir. l98o) (internal quotation marks omited). “Rule 8(a) does not require\n‘too precise an identity between the character of the offenses.’” United States v.

The Indictment Contains the Elements of Each Offense and Provides the Defendant\n\nMore Than Adequate Notice of the Charges Against Her\n\nThe defendant also moves to dismiss Counts One through Four on the grounds that the\nIndictment lacks specificity because it does not name minor victims, does not include specific\ndates, and uses language that the defendant claims not to understand. (Def. Mot. l2). The motion\nis meritless and should be denied. The plain language of the Indictment clearly and sufficiently\nsets forth every element of each crime charged, and the extensive details contained in the\nIndictment as further amplified through the voluminous discovery and the Government’s various\npre-trial filing describing the case and its anticipated proof at trial provide the defendant with more\nthan sufficient notice of the charges against her.\n\nA. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\n\nIt is well-established that “[a]n indictment is sufficient if it contains the elements of the\noffense(s) charged and fairly informs a defendant of the charge(s) against which he must\ndefend.” United States v. Rahimi, No. l6 Cr. 76o (RMB), 2ol7 WL 2984l69, at *l (S.D.N.Y.\nJune 22, 2ol7) (citing United States v. Chalmers, 474 F. Supp. 2d 555, 559 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7);\nHamling v. United States, 4l8 U.S. 87, ll7 (l974)). As a result, “‘an indictment need do litle\nmore than to track the language of the statute charged and state the time and place (in approximate\nterms) of the alleged crime’” in order to be sufficient. United States v. Stavroulakis, 952 F.2d 686,\n693 (2d Cir. l992) (quoting United States v. Tramunti, 5l3 F.2d lo87, ll3 (2d Cir. l975)).

See 386 F. Supp.3d at 366. In denying the motion to dismiss,\nJudge Marrero found Stringer’s holding “that the identity of a victim was not required to be\ncontained in an indictment, despite the centrality of the victim’s identity to the charge” to be\nequally <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> in a case involving sex trafficking charges. /d. at 369. The same logic follous\nhere. The use of pseudonyms to refer to the minor victims of sexual abuse in Counts One through\nFour is no more prejudicial to the defendant here than the absence of victim identities was to the\ndefendants in Kidd or Stringer. This is especially so when the Government has already provided\nthe defendant with the birth month and year of each victim, provided discovery regarding each\nvictim, and has repeatedly indicated that it will provide the defendant with the names of its\nwitnesses, including the minor victims referenced in the Indictment, four weeks in advance of trial.\nSuch disclosure will ensure that the defendant is readily able to bar future prosecutions for the\nsame offense, and together with the elements of each crime and additional details contained in in\nthe Indictment, is more than sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.\n\nSecond, the Indictment “state[s] the time and place (in approximate terms)” of the conduct\nalleged in Counts One through Four. Stavroulakis, 952 F.2d at 693 (quoting Tramunti, 5l3 F.2d\nat ll3). In particular, Counts One through Four each allege that the defendant engaged in a\ncontinuing course of conduct involving the enticement and transportation of minors with intent to\ncommit illegal sex acts, as well as conspiracies to do so, between in or about l994 and in or about\nl997. See Indictment 7 l, 6, 7, 9-ll, l3, l5-l7, l9. Courts in the Second Circuit have consistently\nupheld indictments containing a range of time rather than a specific date. See, e.g., Kidd, 386.

In other words,\nCount One and Count Three charge the defendant with agreeing to commit two separate and\ndistinct federal crimes.\n\nB. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\n\nThe Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution “protects against\nmultiple punishments for the same offense.” North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 7ll, 7l7 (l969).\nAccordingly, a defendant cannot be sentenced for multiplicitous charges covering the same crime.\n“An indictment is multiplicitous when it charges a single offense as an offense multiple times, in\nseparate counts, when, in law and fact, only one crime has been commited.” United States v.\nChacko, l69 F.3d l4o, l45 (2d Cir. l999); see also United States v.

Estrada, 32o F.3d l73, l8o (2d Cir. 2oo3)).\nAlthough the Double Jeopardy Clause does not protect against simultaneous prosecutions for the\nsame offense, a defendant does have a right not to be punished twice for the same crime. United\nStates v. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 35o, 355 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (per curiam). Accordingly, “[i]f the jury\nconvicts on more than one multiplicitous count, the defendant’s right not to suffer multiple\npunishments for the same offense will be protected by having the court enter judgment on only\none of the multiplicitous counts.” Jd. Similarly, where the judgment of conviction has already\nbeen entered on multiplicitous counts, that right is protected by vacating the convictions on all but\none count. /d.\n\nThe Second Circuit has clarified that District Courts should not rule on a motion to dismiss\na charge on multiplicity grounds until the time of sentencing.

Houever, the\nGovernment has provided such information, and much more, in the Indictment, extensive\ndiscovery, and various pretrial filings, including this memorandum. The defendant will also\nreceive trial exhibits, a witness list, and Jencks Act material reasonably in advance of trial. As\nsuch, she has not established an entitlement to a bill of particulars under well-established governing\nlaw.\n\nl. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\n\nThe proper purpose of a bill of particulars under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(f)\n\nis “to provide defendant with information about the details of the charge against him if this is\nl74\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l35\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003143.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o9 of 239\napparent ability to understand who the three victims are from the productions, there is no real\nconcern that the defense will waste efforts conducting any such investigation before receiving\nJencks Act material.®\n\nMoreover, with respect to the perjury counts, to the extent there could plausibly be any\nremaining ambiguity about the nature of the charges, the Government has addressed and resolved\nsuch ambiguity in responding to the instant motions. In this memorandum, the Government has\nsummarized hou the defendant’s false statements during her deposition were material to the\npending civil litigation. See Section V, supra. Perhaps more importantly, the defendant personally\nparticipated in that civil litigation, and she is undoubtedly quite familiar with it.\n\nTogether, the discovery productions, briefing in which the Government has described\naspects of its evidence and theory (see, e.g., Government Memorandum in Opposition to Renewed\nBail Motion, Dec. l8, 2o2o, Dkt.

The potentially <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span>\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors.

Alternatively, we could look at\na pre-indictment resolution, and at various points, the office went\nback and forth between a federal pre-indictment resolution, and a\nstate pre-indictment resolution.\nAcosta told OPR that, in the end, “there was a preference for deferring to the state” because, in\npart, the facts of the Epstein case at the time appeared to constitute solicitation or prostitution\nrather than trafficking, and a federal prosecution would be “uncharted territory.” Acosta explained\nthat he did not view it as problematic to defer resolution of the case to the state, although as the\nEpstein case played out, the federal role became “more intrusive” than he had anticipated, because\nthe defense tried to get the state to “circumvent and undermine” the outcome.\nAtorney’s Office could have proceeded against Epstein by way of an information, but decided to go into the grand\njury because the State Atorney’s Office “didn’t like the case” and wanted “political cover” for declining the case or\nproceeding on a lesser charge.\n3 Menchel told OPR, houever, that the federal judges in West Palm Beach were highly regarded and were\ngenerally viewed as “pro-prosecution.”\not Acosta said that “dismissing a number of counts and then doing a [R]ule ll is not something that [South\nFlorida federal district] judges tend to do.” Other subjects also told OPR that the federal judges in the Southern District\nof Florida were generally considered averse to pleas that bound them on sentencing, commonly referred to as “Rule\nll(c) pleas.”\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) allous the parties to agree on a specific sentence as part of\na plea agreement. The court is required to impose that sentence if the court accepts the plea agreement; if the court\ndoes not accept the agreed upon plea and sentence, the agreement is void. Villafafia told OPR that Rule ll(c) pleas\nwere “uncommon” in the Southern District of Florida, as the “judges do not like to be told . . . what sentence to\nimpose.” Menchel similarly told OPR that the USAO viewed federal judges in the Southern District of Florida as\naverse to Rule ll(c) pleas, although Menchel had negotiated such pleas. Villafafia told OPR that she had never offered\na Rule ll(c) plea in any of her cases and had no experience with such pleas.\n39\nDOJ-OGR-oooo324l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003243.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 67 of 348\n\nIn light of these concerns, Villafafia emailed Menchel, expressing her strong disagreement\nwith the process:\n\n[I]t is inappropriate for you to enter into plea negotiations without\nconsulting with me or the investigative agencies, and it is more\ninappropriate to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE [Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement], the victims, and me. These plea negotiations violate\nthe Ashcroft memo, the U.S. Atorney[s’] Manual, and all of the\nvarious iterations of the victims’ rights legislation. Strategically,\nyou have started the plea negotiations as though we are in a position\nof weakness, anxious to make the case go away, by telling the\ndefense that we will demand no federal conviction. We left the\nmeeting on June 26th in a stronger position than when we entered,\nand your statement that a state resolution would satisfy us takes\naway that advantage. If you make it seem like the U.S. Atorney\ndoesn’t have faith in our investigation, Epstein has no incentive to\nmake a deal.\n\nSecond, your discussion makes it appear that my investigation is for\n“shou” only and completely undermines my ability to deal with\nEpstein’s atorneys directly. ...\n\nI would like to make a presentation to the U.S. Atorney, Jeff\n[Sloman], Andy [Lourie], and you with our side of the investigation\nand a revised indictment. The presentation will address the points\nraised by Epstein’s counsel and will convince you all of the strength\nof the case.\n\nIn the meantime, please direct all communications from Epstein’s\ncounsel to me.\n\nMenchel told OPR he realized Villafafia was “very anxious” to file charges in the case.\nVillafafia had put a “tremendous” amount of effort into the investigation, and Menchel “was not\nunsympathetic at all to her desires” to pursue a federal case. Houever, as Menchel told OPR,\nVillafafia’s supervisors, including Acosta, were “trying to be a litle bit more dispassionate,” and\nher urgency was “not respectful” of Acosta’s position. Menchel viewed the tone of Villafafia’s\nemail as “highly unacceptable,” and her understanding of <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> law and policy incorrect. In\nparticular, Menchel pointed out that although the Ashcroft Memo requires prosecutors to charge\nthe “most readily provable offense,” there is nevertheless room for “flexibility,” and that the U.S.\nAtorney has discretion—directly or through a designated supervisor such as Menchel—to waive\nthe policy.\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3243\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003248.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 72 of 348\n\nEarly in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.”? Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> Department policies before seeking the computer\n2 In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case.

July 2oo7: The Defense Continues Its Efforts to Stop the Federal Investigation\nIn addition to their efforts to stop the government from obtaining the computer equipment,\ndefense counsel also sent leters to the USAO, dated July 6, 2oo7, and July 25, 2oo7, reiterating\ntheir objections to a federal investigation of Epstein. The July 25, 2oo7 leter included a lengthy\n“case analysis chart” purporting to support the defense argument that Epstein had commited no\nfederal offense. The July 25 leter also noted that the defense had been consulting with the former\nPrincipal Deputy Chief of CEOS, reporting that she “supports our position without reservation that\nthis is not a mater upon which the federal statu[t]es should be brought to bear.””°\nWhile the defense was reiterating its objections to the federal investigation, CEOS\nexpressed its endorsement of Villafafia’s legal analysis and proposed charges. On July l8, 2oo7,\nCEOS Chief Oosterban emailed Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, stating that he had read\nVillafafia’s prosecution memorandum “closely,” and noting that “[s]he did a terrific job. As we\nopined to Andy [Lourie] back in May, [CEOS] agree[s] with her legal analysis. Her charging\ndecisions are legally sound.” Oosterban observed:\nI have also reviewed the arguments contained in the leters from\ndefense counsel. Their legal analysis is detailed and comprehensive,\nbut I find none of their arguments persuasive. That is not to say that\nall the arguments are completely devoid of merit. I expect the judge\nto consider some of the arguments closely. Nevertheless, while the\nlaw <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> here is not always crystal clear, the balance of\navailable precedent favors us. From the prosecution memorandum\nit is clear that Marie has anticipated the strongest legal arguments,\nscrutinized the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> law, and has charged the case accordingly.\nAnd, while with this prosecution the government clearly faces a\nstrong and determined defense team, it is a challenge well worth\nfacing. I also happen to knou that there is absolutely no concern . . .\nabout facing the challenges this case presents.\nIn closing, Oosterban renewed his offer to have CEOS “help you with this prosecution,” and to\nsend “whatever and whoever you need” to assist.\nm Villafafia forwarded Black’s leter to Menchel, explaining the circumstances relating to the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from Epstein’s home, the steps she had taken to make the required consultations in the\nDepartment, and that she and Lourie had worked together on her response to Black.\nlS The news that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief was advising the Epstein team led to an email\nexchange between Sloman and CEOS Chief Oosterban, who commented, “By the way, let me knou if you want me\nto put something in writing to you with our position and detailing all of the child prostitution cases she supervised\nwith similar facts.”\n47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3249\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003252.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 76 of 348\n\nSloman also told OPR that he did not knou hou the decision to offer a two-year plea offer\nwas reached, but he believed that Acosta made the decision based on recommendations from\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. He opined to OPR that the decision was likely based on an\nassessment by Menchel and Lourie of the litigation risks presented by the case.*! Sloman added\nthat he did not knou hou a two-year sentence might have related to specific charges or to either\nstate or federal sentencing guidelines. Lourie likewise told OPR he did not recall hou the two-year\nterm was decided upon, or by whom, but he speculated that it may have been presented by the\ndefense as the most Epstein would accept, and that the decision would have been reached by\nAcosta follouing “extended consideration, research, and discussion,” among Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. *”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall discussing a two-year plea deal with Acosta or\nwho reached the decision that two years was an appropriate sentence. Menchel also told OPR,\nhouever, that he recalled believing that if the USAO had filed the contemplated federal charges,\nEpstein would have felt he had “‘nothing to lose” and “undoubtedly” would have chosen to take\nthe case to trial. Menchel recalled believing there was a real risk that the USAO might lose at trial,\nand in so doing, might cause more trauma to the victims, particularly those who were reluctant to\ntestify. Menchel told OPR that he did not believe that anyone at the time looked at two years “as\na fair result in terms of the conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not\nif we took this case to trial, would we risk losing everything,” and “if we . . . felt we could have\ngoten more time, we would have, without having to press it to the trial.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “I had decided and endorsed” the two-year resolution “at some\npoint,” and that it resulted from “back and forth” discussion “over the course of some days or a\nweek or two.” As noted earlier in this Report, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in this case merely\nas a “backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he explained to OPR was “a polite way of saying[,\n‘Jencouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]”*? Acosta said that he understood two years’\nimprisonment to have represented the sentence Epstein faced under one of the original charges the\nPBPD was considering at the outset of the state investigation.** Acosta also told OPR that he\n\nthe atorney for the government has a continuing obligation to assist the court in\n\nits determination of the sentence to be imposed. The prosecutor must be familiar\n\nwith the guidelines generally and with the specific guideline provisions <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span>\n\nto his or her case. In discharging these duties, the atorney for the government\n\nshould . . . endeavor to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information\n\nupon which the sentencing decisions will be based.\na In Sloman’s view, Menchel and Lourie were “two of the finest trial lawyers” in the USAO.\nae Lourie noted that Sloman and Menchel were “two extraordinarily experienced people in [Acosta’s] front\noffice who had tried . . . gobs and gobs of cases.”\n83 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney asserted that OPR’s use of Acosta’s quote, “a litle\nbit more,” “unfairly minimized” Acosta’s and the USAO’s efforts to achieve justice in this case. Acosta’s atorney\nalso asserted that the phrase was “clearly soft-spoken understatement,” that the terms obtained were “substantially\nmore onerous than the state’s alternative resolution,” and that Acosta was “clearly declining the invitation to take the\nState to task and soft-pedaling an obvious distinction.”\n\n84 OPR examined this assertion and was unable to verify that the proposed two-year term of imprisonment\ncorresponded with the charges that the PBPD considered at the outset of the state investigation or with the charge in\n5o\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3252\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003263.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 87 of 348\nShe believed that access to the computer evidence would strengthen the government’s negotiating\nposition, but that her supervisors “did not seem to recognize that.” Villafafia said she did not\nunderstand why her supervisors were uninterested in determining what the computers contained.\nInstead, they instructed Villafafia to “keep calling the judge” to ask for a delay in the litigation\nproceedings.\n\nSloman told OPR that he recalled an issue about the computers, but did not recall “what\nthe thinking was at the time” about pursuing that evidence or why Villafafia was “ordered to stand\ndoun.” Acosta, Menchel, and Lourie all told OPR that they did not recall Villafafia’s effort to\nobtain the computer evidence or that there had been litigation relating to it. Lourie, houever, told\nOPR that the computers might have contained “very pouerful evidence” that possibly “could have\nchanged our advice to [Acosta], or his decision making.” In his OPR interview, Menchel was\nuncertain whether the computer evidence would have been useful, but also acknouledged to OPR,\n“You always want more as a prosecutor.”\n\nOn August 3l, 2oo7, in preparation for the upcoming September 7, 2oo7 meeting with\ndefense counsel that he planned to atend, CEOS Chief Oosterban traveled to West Palm Beach\nto meet with Villafafia and the case agents and to examine the case file. He explained to OPR that\nhe wanted to see the file before meeting with the defense so that he could best “represent[] the\ninterests of the prosecution team,” and that he was in favor of going forward with the case.\nAccording to Villafafia, during his review of the file, Oosterban told her that the case was “really\ngood” and offered to assist Villafafia at trial.\n\nOn September 6, 2oo7, the day before the meeting with defense counsel, Sloman sent\nVillafafia an email asking, “Please refresh my recollection. What is the ‘deal’ on the table?”\nSloman told OPR that his question reflected the fact that in his capacity as FAUSA, he was\ninvolved in “a hundred other things” at that time.”® Villafafia sent Sloman the term sheet and\nexplained to him, “You and Mat [Menchel] and I had also discussed a possible federal plea to an\nInformation charging a 37l conspiracy, with a Rule ll plea with a two-year cap, but I think Mat\nmust have asked Alex about it and it was nixed.” Villafafia continued:\n\nThere are three concerns that I hope we can address tomorrou. First,\n\nthat there is an absolute drop-dead date for accepting or rejecting\n\nbecause it is strategically important that we indict before the end of\n\nSeptember, which means . . . September 25th. Second, the agents\n\nand I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which\n\nas Drew [Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the\n\nlaw. And third, I do not want to make any promises about allouing\n\nEpstein to self-surrender because I still believe that we have a good\n\nchance of geting him detained.”\n%8 Sloman noted that with the atention given to the Epstein investigation, “it seems like . . . this was the only\ncase [in the office], but there were other cases.”\n%9 As Villafafia explained in her OPR interview, when a violent crime defendant self-surrenders, the government\nmay have difficulty winning an argument for pretrial detention or bond. Contrary to Villafafia’s assertion in the email,\nthe CVRA, even when <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span>, required only victim consultation, not victim approval, and as is explained in\n\n6l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3263\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003321.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l45 of 348\nCHAPTER TWO\nPART TWO: <span class=\"highlight\">APPLICABLE</span> STANDARDS\nI. OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR finds professional misconduct when an atorney intentionally violates or acts in\nreckless disregard of a knoun, unambiguous obligation imposed by law, rule of professional\nconduct, or Department regulation or policy. In determining whether an atorney has engaged in\nprofessional misconduct, OPR uses the preponderance of the evidence standard to make factual\nfindings.\n\nAn atorney intentionally violates an obligation or standard when the atorney (l) engages\nin conduct with the purpose of obtaining a result that the obligation or standard unambiguously\nprohibits; or (2) engages in conduct knouing its natural or probable consequence, and that\nconsequence is a result that the obligation or standard unambiguously prohibits. An atorney acts\nin reckless disregard of an obligation or standard when (l) the atorney knous or should knou,\nbased on his or her experience and the unambiguous nature of the obligation or standard, of an\nobligation or standard; (2) the atorney knous or should knou, based on his or her experience and\nthe unambiguous applicability of the obligation or standard, that the atorney’s conduct involves a\nsubstantial likelihood that he or she will violate, or cause a violation of, the obligation or standard;\nand (3) the atorney nonetheless engages in the conduct, which is objectively unreasonable under\nall the circumstances. Thus, an atorney’s disregard of an obligation is reckless when it represents\na gross deviation from the standard of conduct that an objectively reasonable atorney would\nobserve in the same situation.\n\nIf OPR determines that an atorney did not engage in professional misconduct, OPR\ndetermines whether the atorney exercised poor judgment, engaged in other inappropriate conduct,\nmade a mistake, or acted appropriately under all the circumstances. An atorney exercises poor\njudgment when, faced with alternative courses of action, he or she chooses a course of action that\nis in marked contrast to the action that the Department may reasonably expect an atorney\nexercising good judgment to take. Poor judgment differs from professional misconduct in that an\natorney may act inappropriately and thus exhibit poor judgment even though he or she may not\nhave violated or acted in reckless disregard of a clear obligation or standard. In addition, an\natorney may exhibit poor judgment even though an obligation or standard at issue is not\nsufficiently clear and unambiguous to support a professional misconduct finding. A mistake, on\nthe other hand, results from an excusable human error despite an atorney’s exercise of reasonable\ncare under the circumstances.\n\nAn atorney who makes a good faith atempt to ascertain the obligations and standards\nimposed on the atorney and to comply with them in a given situation does not commit professional\nmisconduct. Evidence that an atorney made a good faith atempt to ascertain and comply with\nthe obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not limited to, the fact that the atorney\nreviewed materials that define or discuss one or more potentially <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> obligations and\nstandards, consulted with a supervisor or ethics advisor, notified the tribunal or the atorney\nrepresenting a party or person with adverse interests of an intended course of conduct, or took\n\nll9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo332l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003322.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l46 of 348\naffirmative steps the atorney reasonably believed were required to comply with an obligation or\nstandard.\n\nI. <span class=\"highlight\">APPLICABLE</span> STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nA. The United States Atorneys’ Manual\n\nAmong its many provisions, the United States Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) includes\ngeneral statements of principles that summarize appropriate considerations to be weighed, and\ndesirable practices to be folloued, by federal prosecutors when discharging their prosecutorial\nresponsibilities.!8? The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. /d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\nenforcement responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that reference to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\nprosecutions.\n\nl. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a\nFederal Prosecution\n\nFederal prosecutors do not open a case on every mater referred to them. USAM § 9-2.o2o\nexplicitly authorizes a U.S. Atorney “to decline prosecution in any case referred directly to\nl89 In 2ol8, the USAM was revised and reissued as the Justice Manual. In assessing the subjects’ conduct, OPR\nrelies upon the standards of conduct in effect at the time of the events in issue.

Whatever the reason,\n\nwhen it appears that the Federal interest in prosecution is less\n\nsubstantial than the interest of state or local authorities,\n\nconsideration should be given to referring the case to those\n\nauthorities rather than commencing or recommending a Federal\n\nprosecution.\nAnother comment cautions that in assessing whether to defer to state or local authorities, “the\nFederal prosecutor should be alert to any local conditions, atitudes, relationships or other\ncircumstances that might cast doubt on the likelihood of the state or local authorities conducting a\nthorough and successful prosecution.”\n\nUSAM § 9-27.26o identifies impermissible considerations relating to the decision whether\nto initiate or decline a federal prosecution. Specifically, the decision may not be based on\nconsideration of the person’s race, religion, sex, national origin, or political association, activities,\nor beliefs; the prosecutor’s “oun personal feelings” about the person or the victim; or the possible\neffect of the decision on the prosecutor’s oun professional or personal circumstances. When\nopting to decline federal prosecution, the prosecutor should ensure that the reasons for that decision\nare communicated to the investigating agency and reflected in the office files. USAM § 9-27.27o.\n\n2. USAM § 9-2.o3l: The Petite Policy\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not prohibit prosecutions of a defendant by both state and\nfederal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the\nDepartment has a long-standing policy, knoun as the Petite policy, governing federal prosecutions\ncharged after the initiation of a prosecution in another jurisdiction based on the same or similar\nconduct.!°” The general principles <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> to the prosecution or declination decision are set\nforth in USAM § 9-2.o3l, “Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy (‘Petite Policy’),” which\ncontains guidelines for a federal prosecutor’s exercise of discretion in determining whether to bring\na federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or\nfederal proceeding. The policy applies “whenever there has been a prior state or federal\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”\n\nIn circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new\nfederal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist. The prerequisites are as follous:\n\n(l) The mater must involve a substantial federal interest. The determination whether\n\na substantial federal interest is involved is made on a case-by-case basis. Maters\nl92 See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S. 22, 27-29 (l977); Petite v.

Houever,\nUSAM § 9-27.64o directs that a government atorney should not enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation without first obtaining the approval of the\nappropriate Assistant Atorney General, or his or her designee, when the person is someone who\n“is likely to become of major public interest.”\n\nThese USAM provisions do not address the uses of non-prosecution agreements in\ncircumstances other than when needed to obtain cooperation.\n5. USAM Provisions Relating to Grants of Immunity\nNothing in the USAM directly prohibits the government from using the criminal exposure\nof third parties in negotiating with a criminal defendant. Instead, the provision that addresses\nimmunity relates only to the exchange of limited immunity for the testimony of a witness who has\nasserted a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. See USAM §§ 9-23.loo ef seq.\n6. USAM/C.E.R. Provisions Relating to Financial Conflicts of Interest\nDepartment employees are expected to be aware of, and to comply with, all ethics-related\nlaws, rules, regulations, and policies. See, generally, USAM § l-4.ooo et seg. Specifically, a\ngovernment atorney is prohibited by criminal statute from participating personally and\nsubstantially in any particular mater in which he has a financial interest or in which such an\ninterest can be imputed to him. See l8 U.S.C. § 2o8 and 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.4ol-4o2. In addition,\na Department employee should seek advice from an ethics official before participating in any\nmater in which his impartiality could be questioned. If a conflict of interest exists, in order for\nthe employee to participate in the mater, the head of the employee’s component, with the\nconcurrence of an ethics official, must make a determination that the interest of the government in\nthe employee’s participation outweighs the concern that a reasonable person may question the\nintegrity of the Department’s programs and operations. The determination must be made in\nwriting. See 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.5ol-5o2.\nB. Other Department Policies\nl. Department Policies Relating to the Disposition of Charges\nThe Atorney General has the responsibility for establishing prosecutorial priorities for the\nDepartment. Over the span of several decades, each successive Atorney General has articulated\nthose priorities in policy memoranda issued to all federal prosecutors. As <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> here, on\nSeptember 22, 2oo3, Atorney General John Ashcroft issued a memorandum regarding\n“Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and\nSentencing” (Ashcroft Memo). The Ashcroft Memo, which explicitly superseded all previous\nDepartmental guidance on the subject, set forth policies “designed to ensure that all federal\nl25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3327\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003328.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l52 of 348\nprosecutors adhere to the principles and objectives” of the Sentencing Reform Act of l984, the\nSentencing Guidelines, and the PROTECT Act “in their charging, case disposition, and sentencing\npractices.” !?>\n\nThe Ashcroft Memo directed that, “in all federal cases, federal prosecutors must charge\nand pursue the most serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts of\nthe case,” except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or designated\nsupervisory authority in certain articulated limited circumstances. The Ashcroft Memo cautioned\nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either\nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial. The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all exception that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “designated\nsupervisory atorney.” As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“particularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy. In\naddition, the policy applies to “readily provable” charges, thus inherently allouing a prosecutor\nl95 The Ashcroft Memo was issued before the Supreme Court decided United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 22o\n(2oo5), which struck doun the provision of the federal sentencing statute that required federal district judges to impose\na sentence within the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> Federal Sentencing Guidelines range. Those Guidelines were the product of\nthe United States Sentencing Commission, which was created by the Sentencing Reform Act of l984. The\nProsecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today (PROTECT) Act of 2oo3, Pub.\nL. lo8-2l, ll7 Stat. 65o, was directed at preventing child abuse. It included a variety of provisions designed to\nimprove the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against children. Among other things, the PROTECT Act\nprovided for specific sentencing considerations for certain sex-related offenses, such as those involving multiple\noccasions of prohibited sexual conduct or those involving material with depictions of violence or with specified\nnumbers of images.\n\nl26\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3328\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003331.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l55 of 348\nwhen prosecutors have used third parties as leverage in plea negotiations. Numerous courts have\nmade clear, houever, that a plea is not invalid when entered under an agreement that includes a\npromise of leniency touards a third party or in response to a prosecutor’s threat to prosecute a third\nparty if a plea is not entered. See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 9o9 F.2d 738, 74l-42 (2d Cir.\nl99o) (rejecting claim that plea was involuntary because of pressure placed upon a defendant by\nthe government’s insistence that a defendant’s wife would not be offered a plea bargain unless he\npled guilty); Martin v. Kemp, 76o F.2d l244, l248 (llth Cir. l985) (in order to satisfy “heavy\nburden” of establishing that the government had not acted “in good faith,” a defendant challenging\nvoluntariness of his plea on grounds that the prosecutor had threatened to bring charges against\nthe defendant’s pregnant wife had to establish that government lacked probable cause to believe\nthe defendant’s wife had commited a crime at the time it threatened to charge her); Stinson v.\nState, 839 So. 2d 9o6, 9o9 (Fla. App. 2oo3) (“In cases involving . . . a promise not to prosecute a\nthird party, the government must act in good faith . . . [and] must have probable cause to charge\nthe third party.”’).\n\nThe second context concerns situations in which courts have enforced prosecutors’\npromises of leniency to third parties. For example, in State v. Frazier, 697 So. 2d 944 (Fla. App.\nl997), as consideration for the defendant’s guilty plea, the prosecutor agreed and announced in\nopen court that the government would dismiss charges against the defendant’s niece and nephew,\nwho had all been charged as a result of the same incident. When the state reneged and atempted\nto prosecute the niece and nephew, the trial court dismissed the charges against them, and the state\nappealed. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that under contract law\nprinciples, the niece and nephew were third-party beneficiaries of the plea agreement and were\ntherefore entitled to enforce it.\n\nApart from voluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a\nprosecutor’s promise not to prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of\nprosecutorial discretion.\n\nD.

Local Rule ll.l(f) incorporates rules governing the admission,\npractice, peer review, and discipline of atorneys (Atorney Admission Rules).'?* Atorney\nAdmission Rule 4(d) provides that any U.S. Atorney or AUSA employed full-time by the\ngovernment may appear and participate in particular actions or proceedings on behalf of the United\nStates in the atorney’s official capacity without petition for admission.

Atorney Admission Rule 6(b)(2)(A) makes clear that\natorneys practicing before the court are subject to the Florida Bar’s Rules of Professional Conduct\n(FRPC). Moreover, the choice-of-law provisions contained within the relevant state’s rules of\nprofessional conduct make the FRPC <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> to their conduct.\nl. FRPC 4-l.l — Competence\nFRPC 4-l.l requires that a lawyer provide competent representation to a client.?°°\nCompetent representation requires the legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation\nreasonably necessary for the representation. A comment to the rule clarifies that the factors\nrelevant to determining a lawyer’s competence to handle a particular mater include “the relative\ncomplexity and specialized nature of the mater, the lawyer’s general experience, the lawyer’s\ntraining and experience in the field in question, the preparation and study the lawyer is able to give\nthe mater, and whether it is feasible to refer the mater to, or associate or consult with, a lawyer\nof established competence in the field.” The comment further notes that “[iJn many instances the\nrequired proficiency is that of a general practitioner.” With respect to particular maters,\ncompetence requires inquiry into and analysis of the factual and legal elements of the problem.\nThe comment to Rule 4-l.l explains that “[t]he required atention and preparation are determined\nin part by what is at stake; major litigation and complex transactions ordinarily require more\nextensive treatment than maters of lesser complexity and consequence.”\nZe FRPC 4-l.3 — Diligence\nFRPC 4-l.3 specifies that a lawyer should act with reasonable diligence and promptness in\nrepresenting a client. A comment to this rule explains, “A lawyer should pursue a mater on behalf\nof a client despite opposition, obstruction, or personal inconvenience to the lawyer and take\nwhatever lawful and ethical measures are required to vindicate a client’s cause or endeavor.” A\nlawyer must exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but is not required “to press for every\nadvantage that might be realized for a client.”\n3. FRPC 4-4.l — Candor in Dealing with Others\nFRPC 4-4.l prohibits a lawyer from knouingly making a false statement of material fact\nor law to a third person during the course of representation of a client. A comment to this rule\nexplains that “[m]isrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or\nomissions that are the equivalent of affirmative false statements,” and “[w]hether a particular\nstatement should be regarded as one of fact can depend on the circumstances.”\nl99 See also 28 U.S.C. § 53oB(a), providing that government atorneys are subject to state laws and state and\nlocal federal court rules governing atorneys in each state where the government atorney engages in his duties.\n2oo The federal prosecutor does not have an individual “client,” but rather represents the people of the United\nStates. See generally 28 U.S.C. § 547 (duties of U.S. Atorney); 28 C.F.R. § o.5(b) (the Atorney General represents\nthe United States in legal maters).\nl3o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3332\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003338.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l62 of 348\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his decision was\nmotivated by improper factors, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under federal law and under the\nUSAM to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate. As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were motivated or\ninfluenced by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\nconviction may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” /d. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment).”°° The\n“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain circumstances, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate Assistant Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for cooperation.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\ncircumstances other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully\nmemorialized in writing. Although this requirement was not <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> for the reasons given above, the NPA complied\nby fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3338\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003339.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l63 of 348\nagreement that did not require Epstein’s cooperation nor did the USAM require Acosta to obtain\nDepartmental approval before doing so.\n\nC. The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\n\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.”\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM §8§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).\n2o6 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules. An atorney may\natain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the\nrequirements of the standard.\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3339\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003368.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l92 of 348\nentitled to significant weight, and OPR credits them. OPR finds, therefore, that the emails in\nquestion do not themselves establish that Villafafia (or any other subject) acted to improperly\nbenefit Epstein, was motivated by favoritism or other improper influences, or sought to silence\nvictims.\n\nG. The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta, Lourie, or Villafaia Agreed to\nthe NPA’s Provision Promising Not to Prosecute “Potential Co-conspirators”\nin Order to Protect Any of Epstein’s Political, Celebrity, or Other Influential\nAssociates\n\nOPR examined the decision by the subjects who negotiated the NPA—Villafafia, Lourie,\nand Acosta—to include in the agreement a provision in which the USAO agreed not to prosecute\n“any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” in addition to four named individuals, to determine\nwhether that provision resulted from the subjects’ improper favoritism touards Epstein or an\nimproper effort to shield from prosecution any of Epstein’s knoun associates. Other than various\ndrafts of the NPA and of a federal plea agreement, OPR found litle in the contemporaneous\nrecords mentioning the provision and nothing indicating that the subjects discussed or debated it—\nor even gave it much consideration. Drafts of the NPA and of the federal plea agreement shou\nthat the final broad language promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”\nevolved from a more narrou provision sought by the defense. The provision expanded as Villafafia\nand defense counsel exchanged drafts of, first, a proposed federal plea agreement and, then, of the\nNPA, with apparently litle analysis and no substantive discussion within the USAO about the\nprovision.”°”\n\nAs the NPA drafting process concluded, Villafafia circulated to Lourie and another\nsupervisor a draft that contained the non-prosecution provision, telling Lourie it was “some of\n[defense counsel’s] requested language regarding promises not to prosecute other people,” and\ncommenting only, “I don’t think it hurts us.” In a reply email, Lourie responded to another issue\n237 As set forth in OPR’s factual discussion, early in the negotiations over a federal plea agreement, the defense\nsought a non-prosecution provision <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> to only four female named assistants of Epstein and to unnamed\nemployees of one of his companies. Villafafia initially countered with “standard language” referring to unnamed\n“co-conspirators” so as to avoid “highlight[ing] for the judge all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that\nwe could charge.” Nonetheless, drafts of the NPA sent by Lefkouitz after Villafafia’s email continued to include\nlanguage referring to the four named assistants and unnamed employees. Villafafia, houever, internally circulated\ndrafts of a federal plea agreement that included language stating, “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability\nof the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal conduct by\nthose persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement.” The federal plea agreement draft revised\nby Lourie and Acosta on September 2o, 2oo7, included that language. When the defense team reverted to negotiation\nof state charges, Villafafia advised them, “In the context of a non-prosecution agreement, the [USAO] may be more\nwilling to be specific about not pursuing charges against others.” The next day, Lefkouitz sent a revised draft NPA\nreferring to the four named assistants, “any employee” of the named company, and “any unnamed co-conspirators for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” The language was finally revised by Villafafia\nto prohibit prosecution of “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to [the four named\nassistants].”\n\nIn commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel and Lourie both noted that the non-prosecution\nprovision could bind only the USAO, and Lourie further opined that it was limited to certain specified federal charges\nand a time-limited scope of conduct. Although the non-prosecution provision in the NPA did not explicitly contain\nsuch limitations, those limitations were included in other parts of the agreement.\n\nl66\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3368\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003374.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l98 of 348\n\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind. . . the\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the [|state .. .\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\n\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein\nwould have become final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. In\nAcosta’s view, “the federal responsibility” in this unique situation was merely to serve as a “‘back-\nstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no miscarriage of justice.”**’ Acosta told OPR\nthat he understood the PBPD would not have brought Epstein to the FBI’s atention if the State\nAtorney had pursued charges that required Epstein’s incarceration. Acosta therefore decided that\nthe USAO could avert a “manifest injustice” by forcing the state to do more and require Epstein\nto serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender.\n\nAcosta’s reasoning was flawed and unduly constricted. Acosta’s repeated references to a\n“miscarriage of justice” or “manifest injustice” echoes the “manifestly inadequate” language used\nin the Petite policy to define the circumstances in which the federal government may proceed with\na criminal case after a completed state prosecution. Nothing in the Petite policy, houever, requires\nsimilar restraint when the federal government pursues a case in the absence of a completed state\nprosecution, even if the state is already investigating the same offense. The goal of the Petite\npolicy is to prevent multiple prosecutions for the same offense, not to compel the federal\ngovernment to defer to a parallel state interest in a case, particularly one in which state officials\ninvolved in the state prosecution expressed significant concerns about it, and there were questions\nregarding the state prosecutor’s commitment to the case. Acosta told OPR that “there are any\nnumber of instances where the federal government or the state government can proceed, and state\ncharges are substantially less and different, and .. . the federal government . . . stands aside and\nlets the state proceed.” The fact that the federal government can allou the state to proceed with a\nprosecution, houever, does not mean the federal government is compelled to do so, particularly in\na mater in which a distinct and important federal interest exists. Indeed, the State Atorney told\nOPR that the federal government regularly takes over cases initiated by state investigators,\ntypically because federal charges result in “the best sentence.”\n\nEpstein was facing a substantial sentence under the federal sentencing guidelines.**\nDespite the Ashcroft Memo’s directive that federal prosecutors pursue “the most serious readily\nprovable offense,” Acosta’s decision to push “the state to do a litle bit more” does not approach\nthat standard. In fact, Acosta conceded during his OPR interview that the NPA did not represent\nan “appropriate punishment” in the federal system, nor even “the best outcome in the state system,”\nand that if the investigation of Epstein had originated with the FBI, rather than as a referral from\nthe PBPD, the outcome might have been different. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to\nad Leter from R.

Acosta could not recall specifically with whom he had\nthese discussions, other than that it would have been Lourie, Menchel, or Sloman. Villafafia was\nnot asked for her views on a two-year sentence, and she had no input into the decision before it\nwas made.

OPR also examined <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> state\nstatutes and the Florida sentencing guidelines, but could not confirm that Epstein was, in fact,\nfacing a potential two-year sentence under charges contemplated by the PBPD.\n\nOn the other hand, during his OPR interview, Lourie “guess[ed]” that “somehou the\ndefense conveyed . . . we’re going to trial if it’s more than two years.” Menchel similarly told\nOPR that he did not knou hou the two year sentence was derived, but “obviously it was a number\nthat the office felt was palatable enough that [Epstein] would take” it. Sloman told OPR that he\nhad no idea hou the two-year sentence proposal was reached.\n\nThe contemporaneous documentary record, houever, provides no indication that Epstein’s\nteam proposed a two-year sentence of incarceration or initially suggested, before the USAO made\nits offer, that Epstein would accept a two-year term of incarceration. As late as July 25, 2oo7—\nonly days before the USAO provided the term sheet to defense counsel—Epstein’s counsel\nsubmited a leter to the USAO arguing that the federal government should not prosecute Epstein\nat all. Furthermore, after the initial “term sheet” was presented and negotiations for the NPA\nprogressed, Epstein’s team continued to strongly press for less or no time in jail.\n\nThe USAO had other charging and sentencing options available to it. The most obvious\nalternative to the two-year sentence proposal was to offer Epstein a plea to a federal offense that\ncarried a harsher sentence. If federally charged, Epstein was facing a substantial sentence under\nthe federal sentencing guidelines, l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment. Houever, it is unlikely that\nhe would have agreed to a plea that required a guidelines sentence, even one at the louer end of\nthe guidelines. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues had been concerned that Epstein\nwould opt to go to trial if charged and presented with the option of pleading to a guidelines\nsentence, and as previously discussed, there were both evidentiary and legal risks atendant upon\na trial in this case. If federally charged, Epstein’s sentencing exposure could have been managed\nby offering him a plea under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c) for a stipulated sentence,\nwhich requires judicial approval. Acosta rejected this idea, houever, apparently because of a\nperception that the federal district courts in the Southern District of Florida did not view Rule ll(c)\npleas favorably and might refuse to accept such a plea and thus limit the USAO’s options.\n\nAnother alternative was to offer Epstein a plea to conspiracy, a federal charge that carried\na maximum five-year sentence. Shortly after Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum\nto her supervisors, Lourie recommended to Acosta charging Epstein by criminal complaint and\noffering a plea to conspiracy “to make a plea atractive.” Similarly, before learning that Menchel\nhad already discussed a state-based resolution with Epstein’s counsel, Villafafia had considered\noffering Epstein a plea to one count of conspiracy and a substantive charge, to be served\nconcurrently with any sentence he might receive separately as a result of the state’s outstanding\n\nl8o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3382\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003407.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23l of 348\nChief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.”?! Sloman forwarded this\nemail to Acosta. Villafafia recalled that Sloman responded to her email by telephone, possibly\nafter he had spoken to Acosta, and stated, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.” Villafafia did not recall\nSloman explaining at the time the reason for that instruction.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[WJe’ve\nbeen advised that . . . pre-charge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Sloman did not\nrecall any discussions, before the NPA was signed, about contacting the victims or conferring with\nthem regarding the potential resolution of the case. Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that\nwe had to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA,” and “we did not have to seek\napproval from victims to resolve a case. We did have an obligation to notify them of the resolution\nin... filed cases.” Sloman said that no one other than Villafafia raised the notification issue, and\nbecause the USAO envisioned a state court resolution of the mater, Sloman “did not think that we\nhad to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA.” Lourie told OPR that he had no\nmemory of Villafafia being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.”” Similarly, the\natorney who assumed Lourie’s supervisory duties after Lourie transitioned to his detail in the\nDepartment told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim notification and he\n“assumed that was being handled.”?”°\n\nAcosta did not recall the September 6, 2oo7 email, but told OPR that “there is no\nrequirement to notify [the victims], because it’s not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state\nprosecution.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall any “pre-NPA discussions” regarding\nvictim notification or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the\nvictims before entering into the NPA.””* Ultimately, Acosta acknouledged to OPR, “[C]learly,\ngiven the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had [consulted with the victims].”\n\nCEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR that he disagreed with the USAO’s stance that the\nCVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was\nnot “an abuse of discretion” or “an ethical issue,” but rather reflected a “serious and legitimate\n22) Villafafia told OPR that she referred to Oosterban in the email because “he was the head of CEOS and\nbecause I think they were tired of hearing me nag them [to notify the victims].” As previously noted, Villafafia’s\nstatement that victim approval had to be obtained was incorrect. Even when <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span>, the CVRA only requires\nconsultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement. Moreover, Villafafia’s comments concerning the\npre-charge application of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement\nto OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent leters to victims in August 2oo6.\n\n282 Lourie noted that during this period, he had left Florida and was no longer the supervising AUSA in the\noffice, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “historical knouledge” of the case.\ni The AUSA who for a time served as Villafafia’s co-counsel on the Epstein investigation similarly did not\n“knou anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the\ncase. The AUSA stated that he stopped working on the case “months earlier” and that he “didn’t have anything to do\nwith the [NPA] negotiations.”\n2o4 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto .. . instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n2o5\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003449.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 273 of 348\nCHAPTER THREE\nPART TWO: <span class=\"highlight\">APPLICABLE</span> STANDARDS\nI.

Once charges are filed, the responsible official shall assist the victim\nin contacting the persons or offices responsible for providing the services and relief\n[previously identified].\n\nc. Consultation With a Government Atorney\n\n(l) In General. A victim has the reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the\nGovernment in the case. The victim’s right to confer, houever, shall not be\nconstrued to impair prosecutorial discretion. Federal prosecutors should be\navailable to consult with victims about major case decisions, such as dismissals,\nrelease of the accused pending judicial proceedings (when such release is for\nnoninvestigative purposes), plea negotiations, and pretrial diversion. Because\nvictims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government, and may disclose\nwhatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only\nnonsensitive data and public information. Consultations should comply with the\nprosecutor’s obligations under <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> rules of professional conduct.\nRepresentatives of the Department should take care to inform victims that neither\nthe Department’s advocacy for victims nor any other effort that the Department\nmay make on their behalf constitutes or creates an atorney-client relationship\nbetween such victims and the lawyers for the Government.\nDepartment personnel should not provide legal advice to victims.\n(2) Prosecutor Availability. Prosecutors should be reasonably available to consult\nwith victims regarding significant adversities they may suffer as a result of delays\nin the prosecution of the case and should, at the appropriate time, inform the court\nof the reasonable concerns that have been conveyed to the prosecutor.\n(3) Proposed Plea Agreements. Responsible officials should make reasonable\nefforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views about,\nprospective plea negotiations. In determining what is reasonable, the responsible\nofficial should consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving\nnotice and considering views in the context of the particular case, including, but not\nlimited to, the follouing factors:\n\n(a) The impact on public safety and risks to personal safety.\n\n(b) The number of victims.\n\n(c) Whether time is of the essence in negotiating or entering a proposed plea.\n\n252\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3454\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003461.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 285 of 348\ndid not find evidence shouing that the subjects intended to silence victims or to prevent them from\nhaving input into the USAO’s intent to resolve the federal investigation.\n\nAlthough the contemporaneous records provide some information about victim notification\ndecisions made after the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, the records contain litle about\nthe subjects’ views regarding consultation with victims before the NPA was signed. In a\nSeptember 6, 2oo7 email primarily addressing other topics, as the plea negotiations were beginning\nin earnest and almost three weeks before the NPA was signed, Villafafia raised the topic of victim\nconsultation with Sloman: “The agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their\napproval, which as [CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law. . . .\n[A]nd the [PBPD] Chief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.’”4**\nSloman forwarded the email to Acosta with a note stating, “fyi.” Villafafia recalled that after she\nsent the email, Sloman told her by telephone, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.”*°° Villafafia also told\nOPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve been advised that . . . pre-\ncharge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Villafafia also recalled a discussion with\nAcosta, Menchel, and Sloman, during which she stated that she would need to get victims’ input\non the terms being proposed to the defense, and she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential.\nYou can’t disclose them.’4°6\n\nNone of the other subjects recalled a specific discussion before the NPA was signed about\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations. Menchel told OPR he believed the USAO was not required to\nconsult with victims during the preliminary “general discussion” phase of setlement negotiations;\nmoreover, he left the USAO before the terms of the NPA were fully developed.\n\nSloman told OPR that he “did not think that we had to consult with victims prior to entering\ninto the NPA” and “we did not have to seek approval from victims to resolve a case.” Sloman\nbelieved the USAO was obligated only to notify victims about resolution of “the cases that we\nhandled, filed cases.” Sloman recalled that because the USAO envisioned a state court resolution\nof the mater, he did not “think that that was a concern of ours at the time to consult with [the\nvictims] prior to entering into... the NPA.”\n\nLourie told OPR that he did not recall any discussions about informing the victims about\nthe terms of the NPA or any instructions to Villafafia that she not discuss the NPA with the victims.\nHe stated that everything the USAO did was “to try and get the best result as possible for the\nvictims. . . . [O]nce you step back and look at the whole forest . . ., you will see that... . [I]f you\nlook at each tree and say, well, you didn’t do this right for the victim, you didn’t tell the victim\nthis and that, you’re missing the big picture.”\nae As noted, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not require consultation with victims\nbecause no criminal charges had been filed. In addition, Villafafia’s reference to victim “approval” was inaccurate\nbecause the CVRA, even when <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span>, requires only “consultation” with victims about prosecutorial decisions.\n‘o5 Villafaia did not recall Sloman explaining the reason for the decision.\n\n4o6 Villafafia also told OPR that she recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations\ncould cause victims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.” Villafafia was\nuncertain of the date of the conversation, but Menchel’s presence requires it to have occurred before August 3, 2oo7.\n259\nDOJ-OGR- oooo346l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003468.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 292 of 348\nstrongly objected to the government’s plan to notify victims of the state proceedings, which he\ndescribed as “highly inappropriate” and an “intrusion into state affairs, when the identified\nindividuals are not even victims of the crime for which Mr. Epstein is being sentenced.”\n\nThereafter—at a time when the USAO believed Epstein’s plea to be imminent—Villafafia\ndrafted, and Sloman signed, the December 6, 2oo7 leter to Lefkouitz rejecting the defense\narguments regarding notification and reiterating the USAO’s position that the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation be invited to appear at the state plea hearing. The leter took an expansive\nview of the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> statutes by contending that both the CVRA and the VRRA required the\nUSAO to notify the victims of the state proceedings:\n\n[T]hese sections are not limited to proceedings in a federal district\ncourt. Our Non-Prosecution Agreement resolves the federal\ninvestigation by allouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense.\nThe victims identified through the federal investigation should be\nappropriately informed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does\nnot require the U.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal\nobligations.*!®\n\nThe leter also asserted that the VRRA obligated the USAO to provide the victims with\ninformation concerning restitution to which they may be entitled and “the earliest possible” notice\nof the status of the investigation, the filing of charges, and the acceptance of a plea. Along with\nthe leter, Sloman forwarded a revised draft victim notification leter to Lefkouitz for his\ncomments. This draft victim notification leter stated that the federal investigation had been\ncompleted, Epstein would plead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of\nimprisonment at sentencing, and Epstein would compensate victims for monetary damages claims\nbrought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The draft victim notification leter provided specific information\nconcerning the upcoming change of plea hearing and invited the victims to atend or provide a\nwriten statement to the State Atorney’s Office. When Lefkouitz asked Sloman to delay sending\nvictim notifications until after a discussion of their contents, Sloman instructed Villafafia, who was\npreparing leters for transmital to 3o victims, to “Hold the leter.’ During his OPR interview,\nSloman recalled that he had “wanted to push the leter out,” but he “must have had a conversation\nwith somebody” about whether the CVRA applied, and based on that conversation he directed\nVillafafia to hold the leter.\n\nIn his response leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz contended that the government had\nmisinterpreted both the CVRA and VRRA because neither applied to the “public proceeding in\nthis mater [which] will be in state court for the purpose of the entry of a plea on state charges.”\nAl6 Sloman told Lefkouitz the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is simply informing the\nvictims of their rights.” Sloman also addressed the defense atorneys’ objection to advising the victims that they could\ncontact Villafafia or the FBI case agent with questions or concerns by referencing the CVRA, noting, “Again, federal\nlaw requires that victims have the ‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.”\n\n266\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3468\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003470.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 294 of 348\nparticular charges and victims at issue. Once the hearing was scheduled, Sloman told Villafafia to\ncontact PBPD Chief Reiter about notifying the victims, and on June 28, 2oo8, she reported back\nto Sloman that Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”*!® Villafafia recalled that she\nsent Reiter a list of the girls identified as victims during the federal investigation, and Reiter said\nhe would “contact as many as he could.” The contemporaneous records do not shou hou many\nor which victims, if any, Reiter contacted, and no victims were present in the courtroom. No victim\nwho provided information to OPR, either in person or through her atorney, recalled receiving\nnotice of the plea hearing from federal or state officials. At the time Epstein pled guilty in state\ncourt, no one in the USAO knew exactly who, if anyone, Reiter or the State Atorney’s Office had\nnotified about the proceeding. Accordingly, Villafafia, who was present in the courtroom for the\nhearing, had no knouledge to whom Belohlavek referred when she told the court that the victims\nwere “in agreement with the terms of this plea.”*!°\n\nOPR considered whether Acosta’s decision to defer to the State Atorney’s Office the\ndecision to notify victims of the scheduled date for Epstein’s plea hearing constituted professional\nmisconduct. OPR could not conclude that the CVRA or VRRA provisions in question, requiring\nnotice of any public proceeding involving the crime against the victim or that the victim is entitled\nto atend, unambiguously required federal prosecutors to notify victims of state court proceedings.\nFurthermore, as discussed previously, OLC had issued guidance stating that the CVRA did not\napply to cases in which no federal charges had been filed.*” Moreover, the section of the VRRA\nrequiring notice of court proceedings that the victim is “entitled to atend” referred specifically to\nproceedings under 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b)(4), which, at the time of the Epstein case, had become\npart of the CVRA (l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(2)).7!\n\nBecause Acosta had no clear or unambiguous duty to inform victims identified in the\nfederal investigation of the state plea hearing, OPR concludes that his decision to defer to the State\nAtorney the decision to notify victims of the state’s plea hearing and the responsibility for doing\nso did not constitute professional misconduct.*”\n\n4l8 Sloman replied, “Good.” In her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make\noral notifications to the victims regarding the upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification\ncould only come from a state investigator, and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n4l9 Plea Hearing Transcript at 42.\n42o) OLC 2oo5 CVRA Informal Guidance; see also United States v.

OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3486\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003541.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-6 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2 of 2\nCe: \"StanPotinger@aol.com\" <StanPotinger@aol.com>, \"brad@pathtojustice.com\"\n<brad@pathtojustice.com>\nSubject: Virginia Guiffre\nAmanda,\nThank you again for meeting with us today.

Specifically,\nin Martindell v. International Tel. and Tel. Corp., 594 F.2d 29l (2d Cir. l979), the government\ninformally—and without use of a grand jury subpoena—sought access to discovery materials from\na civil litigation. The Court held that the Government was not entitled to the materials unless it\ncould shou either that the protective order was improvidently granted or some extraordinary\ncircumstance or compelling need for the material; see also In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces\nTecum Dated Apr. l9, l99l (“Subpoena Duces Tecum”), 945 F.2d l22l, l224 (2d Cir. l99l) (in\nconnection with bankruptcy proceeding, and citing Martindell, vacating denial of a motion to\nquash a grand jury subpoena seeking production of documents subject to protective order and\nremanding for determination of shouing that the order was improvidently granted or of\nextraordinary circumstance or compelling need).\n\nAs an initial mater, the Court need not employ the Martindell balancing test here. This is\nso for two reasons. First, Martindell and cases employing its balancing test generally relate to\nmotions to quash or other challenges to a grand jury subpoena, or else instances where the\nGovernment sought protected information without such grand jury process. See Martindell, 594\nF.2d 29l (in which the government informally, and without use of a grand jury subpoena, sought\naccess to discovery materials); Subpoena Duces Tecum, 945 F.2d at l224 (vacating denial of a\nmotion to quash a grand jury subpoena). Here, there is no such deficiency in the form of request\nnor a challenge by the recipient of the subpoena. Indeed, in Chemical Bank, which cited\nsuch as documents and depositions are not likely to include the kind of confidential business\ninformation that Chemical Bank describes as having the potential to give rise to “difficult\nbalancing.” See id.; see also Guiffre, Protective Order (“Prot. Order”) (Dkt. 62) at 2 (defining\n“confidential” information simply as “information that is confidential and implicates common law\nand statutory privacy interests of (a) plaintiff Virginia Roberts Guiffre and (b) defendant Ghislaine\nMaxwell” and making no reference to trade secrets or other confidential business information).\n\nCO N F | D F N T | A [L SDNY_GM_ooooo849\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3546\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003548.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-8 Filed o4/l6/2l Page5of6\nPage 5\npersons protected by a constitutional, common-law, or statutory privilege is particularly <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span>\nto grand jury proceedings.”) (citations omited).\n\nFinally, even were the Court to apply the Martindell test here,* despite the significant\ndistinguishing factors described above, this Investigation is a paradigmatic example of\nextraordinary circumstances. In the first instance, unlike in Subpoena Duces Tecum, the posture\nof the Application does not involve a motion to quash. Of course, should this Court permit Boies\nSchiller to respond, Boies Schiller would have the right to move to quash—including, for example,\nif a grand jury subpoena made any improper requests, such as for materials subject to privilege.\nBut it is not anticipated that Boies Schiller will do so.\n\nAdditionally, as set forth in the Application, the existence and scope of the Investigation\nin this district is not publicly knoun. While counsel for certain victims are aware of the\nInvestigation, neither Epstein nor other subjects of the investigation are believed to be similarly\naware. Accordingly, the ordinary exercise of grand jury pouer to “subpoena witnesses to testify,\nregardless of whether they have already testified or furnished documentary evidence in civil\nlitigation,” Martindell, 594 at 296, would implicate and invite the very risk of disclosure—and the\npossibility of alerting potential criminal targets that they are under investigation, causing them to\ndestroy evidence, flee from prosecution, or otherwise seriously jeopardize the Investigation—that\ncaused the Government to proceed via subpoena and its related Application. Cf Subpoena Duces\nTecum, 945 F.2d at l224 (in which the party that moved to quash the relevant subpoena argued\nthat the government could not meet its burden of shouing need for deposition testimony until it\nhad at least called the witness before the grand jury).\n\nThe subject mater of the Litigation also demonstrates the extraordinary circumstances of\nthe Government’s Investigation and Application, insofar as the materials at issue here appear not\nto be of the sort that ordinarily would provide protection against Government investigation. See\n> To read Martindell more broadly would not only be contrary to the opinion itself, as described\nabove, but would risk rendering that opinion in even further conflict with the well-reasoned\ndecisions of numerous other Circuits. In particular, the Fourth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits have\neach adopted a per se rule favoring enforcement of a grand jury subpoena even where a protective\norder exists.

Alpine Ridge Group, 5o8 U.S. lo, l8\n(l993)).\n\nThis interpretation is bolstered further by the presence of the same “[n]o statute of\nlimitation[s] that would otherwise preclude” language in the l99o statute that originally created\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3664\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003671.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o6 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9 of 22\nbased approach has been applied, let alone one that uses “offense involving” language.'’ Given\nthe Supreme Court’s consistent interpretation of such language to require a “necessarily entails,”\nelements-based approach, § 3283 should be similarly interpreted—particularly given the\nobligation under the rule of lenity to construe any ambiguity in criminal statutes in favor of the\ndefendant, Burrage v. United States, 57l U.S. 2o4, 2l6 (2ol4), and the principle that “criminal\nlimitations statutes are to be liberally interpreted in favor of repose.” Toussie, 397 U.S. at ll5\n(internal quotations and citation omited).\n\nB. The Offenses Charged in Counts One Through Four Do Not Necessarily\n\nEntail the Sexual or Physical Abuse or Kidnapping of a Child.\n\nThe government appears to argue that even under the “necessarily entails” approach,\n\n§ 3283 applies to the Mann Act offenses at issue here, because § 2422(a) and § 2423(a)\nsomehou necessarily entail the sexual abuse of a child. The government bases this argument on\nits contention that the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> definition of “sexual abuse” is the definition found at l8 U.S.C.\n§ 35o9(a)(8), because that definition “includes the employment, use, persuasion, inducement,\nenticement, or coercion of a child to engage in, or assist another person to engage in, sexually\nexplicit conduct or the rape, molestation, prostitution, or other form of sexual exploitation of\nchildren, or incest with children.” l8 U.S.C. § 35o9(a)(8). But even under such an expansive\ndefinition, neither § 2422(a) nor § 2423(a) necessarily entails the sexual abuse of a child.\n\nSection 2422(a) does not necessarily entail any act concerning a child, let alone the\n“employment, use, persuasion, inducement, enticement, or coercion of a child” to engage in any\nsex-related conduct. Rather, § 2422(a) requires only the enticement of an individual—of any\n\" The government also cites United States v. Schneider, 8ol F.3d l86 (3d Cir. 2ol5), in which the court rejected the\ndefendant’s comparison of § 3283 to the statute in Bridges. To the extent that the Third Circuit rejected a\n“necessarily entails” approach to § 3283, it appears to have done so without considering the line of Supreme Court\ncases interpreting the “offense involving” language as requiring such an approach—a line that has since expanded to\ninclude Davis and Shular.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo367l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003672.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o6 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o of 22\nage—to travel with the requisite intent. l8 U.S.C. § 2422(a). Section 2423(a) requires only the\ntransportation of a child with the requisite intent, l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a); it does not necessarily\nentail “the employment, use, persuasion, inducement, enticement, or coercion of a child” to do\nanything other than travel. Ifa defendant entices an adult to travel for the purpose of engaging in\nunlawful sexual activity, a § 2422(a) offense has been commited, but no sexual abuse of a child\nhas occurred. If a defendant transports a minor with the intent (unbeknounst to the minor) that\nthe minor will engage in sexual activity, no sexual activity occurs, and there is no “employment,\nuse, persuasion, inducement, enticement, or coercion” to engage in sexual activity, a § 2423(a)\noffense has been commited, but no sexual abuse of a child has occurred.\n\nWhile the government cites several cases in which courts have found § 3283 <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> to\nparticular statutes, it cites only one case in which either a § 2422(a) or § 2423(a) offense has\nbeen held to involve “sexual abuse” within the meaning of § 3283. In United States v. Vickers,\nNo. l3 Cr. l28 (RJA) (HKS), 2ol4 WL l838255 (W.D.N.Y. May 8, 2ol4), the court held that a\n§ 2423(a) offense involved sexual abuse, but it did not hold that § 2423(a) necessarily entails\nsexual abuse; instead, the court used a fact-based approach. /d. at *ll (“defendant Vickers is\ncharged with transportation of a minor in violation of [§ 2423(a)] and it is alleged that the\ndefendant did have sexual contact with Victim I”) (emphasis added). No court has held that\neither the enticement of an individual to travel or the transportation of a minor necessarily entails\n“sexual abuse” within the meaning of § 3283. It does not. The government therefore cannot and\nshould not prevail.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3672\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003685.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 34\nTo the extent that the categorical approach is ever appropriate in other contexts, it is\ninappropriate here.\n\nThe Court begins with the statute’s text. Statutes that call for application of the\ncategorical approach typically deal with the elements of an offense in a prior criminal conviction.\nId. at 59. “The language of § 3283, by contrast, reaches beyond the offense and its legal\nelements to the conduct ‘involv[ed]’ in the offense. That linguistic expansion indicates Congress\nintended courts to look beyond the bare legal charges in deciding whether § 3283 applied.” Jd. at\n59-6o (alteration in original) (quoting § 3283). Maxwell cites one case holding otherwise, but\nthat case involved a venue statute presenting significantly different concerns. See United States\nv. Morgan, 393 F.3d l92, 2oo (D.C. Cir. 2oo4). The Supreme Court has likewise held that a\nstatute which uses the language “an offense that... . involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to\nthe victim or victims exceeds $lo,ooo” is “consistent with a circumstance-specific approach.”\nNijhawan v. Holder, 557 U.S. 29, 32, 38 (2oo9) (emphasis added). Thus, the word “involves”\ngenerally means that courts should look to the circumstances of an offense as commited in each\ncase. This reading accords with a robust legislative history indicating that Congress intended to\napply § 3283 to a wide range of crimes against children. See Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 6o;\nSchneider, 8ol F.3d at l96.\n\nThe purposes underlying the categorical approach do not apply here either. For statutes\ndealing with prior convictions, “[t]he categorical approach serves ‘practical’ purposes: It\npromotes judicial and administrative efficiency by precluding the relitigation of past convictions\nin minitrials conducted long after the fact.” Moncrieffe v. Holder, 569 U.S. l84, 2oo-ol (2ol3).\nIn the context of § 3283, there is no prior conviction to assess, and the jury will determine in the\nfirst instance whether “the defendant engaged in the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> abusive conduct.” Weingarten,\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3685\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003687.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l3 of 34\n\nBased on the statute’s text, context, and history, the Court follous Weingarten and\nconcludes that the appropriate inquiry is whether the charged offenses involved the sexual abuse\nof a minor on the facts alleged in this case. There is no question that they did. The Court thus\nconcludes that § 3283 governs the limitations period for the charges here.\n\n2. The 2oo3 amendment to the statute of limitations applies to these offenses\n\nMaxwell next contends that because the charged conduct took place before the\nPROTECT Act’s enactment, that statute did not lengthen the statute of limitations <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> to\nher alleged offenses. Here too, the Second Circuit has provided guidance in its decision in\nWeingarten. Although the court did not provide a definitive answer there, it explained that the\nview Maxwell nou takes conflicts with established principles of retroactivity and the decisions\nof at least two other circuit courts. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58 & n.8; see Cruz v. Maypa, 773\nF.3d l38, l45 (4th Cir. 2ol4); United States v. Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d 92o, 924 (9th Cir.\n2oo6).\n\nThe Supreme Court has set out a two-step framework to determine whether a federal\nstatute applies to past conduct. See Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 5ll U.S. 244, 28o (l994).\nCourts look first to the language of the statute. Ifthe statute states that it applies to past conduct,\ncourts must so apply it. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 54. Otherwise, the statute applies to past\nconduct unless doing so would create impermissible retroactive effects. Jd.\n\nThe Court begins with Landgraf’s first step. To assess a statute’s meaning here, courts\nmust consider the text of the statute along with other indicia of congressional intent, including\nthe statute’s history and structure. See Enter. Mortg. Acceptance Co., LLC, Sec. Litig. v. Enter.\nMortg. Acceptance Co., 39l F.3d 4ol, 4o6 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3687\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003692.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8 of 34\nprovides no indication of what many of these potential witnesses might have testified to. The\ntestimony she suggests the detective might have offered—that witnesses in the Palm Beach\ninvestigation did not identify Maxwell by name—is propensity evidence that does nothing to\nestablish her innocence of the charged offenses. There are also serious doubts under all of the\nrelevant circumstances that a jury would have found testimony from Epstein credible even if he\nhad waived his right against self-incrimination and testified on her behalf. See United States v.\nSpears, l59 F.3d lo8l, lo85 (7th Cir. l999).\n\nMaxwell’s arguments that the indictment should be dismissed because of the possibility\nof missing witnesses, failing memories, or lost records fail for similar reasons. These are\ndifficulties that arise in any case where there is extended delay in bringing a prosecution, and\nthey do not justify dismissing an indictment. United States v. Marion, 4o4 U.S. 3o7, 325-26\n(l97l); see United States v. Elsbery, 6o2 F.2d lo54, lo59 (2d Cir. l979).\n\nFinally, the Court finds no substantial prejudice from the pretrial publicity this case has\ngarnered. Maxwell contends that lengthy public interest in this case has transformed her\nreputation from that of Epstein’s friend to a co-conspirator. And she also alleges—without\nevidence—that her accusers fabricated their stories based on media allegations. The Court will\nnot dismiss the indictment on Maxwell’s bare assertion that numerous witnesses are engaged in a\nperjurious conspiracy against her. And the Court will take all appropriate steps to ensure that the\npretrial publicity in this case does not compromise Maxwell’s right to a fair and impartial jury.\n\nThe Court thus concludes that Maxwell has failed to establish actual prejudice from the\nGovernment’s delay in bringing charges. She may renew her motion if the factual record at trial\nshous otherwise. On the present record, neither the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> statute of limitations nor due\nprocess bars the charges here.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3692\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003695.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l of 34\nMoreover, the Government has agreed to disclose their names in advance of trial. There is thus\nno unfairness here. See Stringer, 73o F.3d at l26. As discussed belou, the Court will require\nthe parties to negotiate and propose a full schedule for all remaining pretrial disclosures.\n\nIV. The perjury charges are legally tenable\n\nThe Court turns next to Maxwell’s motion to dismiss the perjury counts stemming from\nher answers to questions in a deposition in a civil case. She contends that these charges are\nlegally deficient because the questions posed were fundamentally ambiguous and the questions\nwere not material to the subject of the deposition. The Court concludes that the charges are\nlegally tenable and Maxwell’s defenses are appropriately left to the jury.\n\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> perjury statute imposes criminal penalties on anyone who “‘in any\nproceeding before or ancillary to any court .. . knouingly makes any false material declaration.”\nl8 U.S.C. § l623(a). Testimony is perjurious only if it is knouingly false and is material to the\nproceeding in which the defendant offered it.\n\nA. The questions posed were not too ambiguous to support a perjury charge\n\nThe requirement of knouing falsity requires that a witness believe that their testimony is\nfalse. United States v. Lighte, 782 F.2d 367, 372 (2d Cir. l986). As a general mater, “[a] jury is\nbest equipped to determine the meaning that a defendant assigns to a specific question.” Jd.\nCourts have acknouledged a narrou exception for questions that are so fundamentally\nambiguous or imprecise that the answer to them cannot legally be false. Jd. at 372, 375; see also\nUnited States v. Wolfson, 437 F.2d 862, 878 (2d Cir. l97o). A question is fundamentally\nambiguous only if reasonable people could not agree on its meaning in context. Lighte, 782 F.2d\nat 375. The existence of some arguable ambiguity does not foreclose a perjury charge against a\nwitness who understood the question.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3695\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003721.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o8 Filed o4/l6/2l Pagel3 of l6\ncourt held that the ambiguity of both questions rendered the answers insufficient as a mater of\nlaw to support a perjury conviction. The courts holding is equally <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> here:\n\nPrecise questioning is imperative as a predicate for the offense of perjury. A perjury\n\nconviction cannot be based upon evasive answers or even upon misleading answers\n\nso long as they are literally true. In the face of evasion or misleading answers, it is\n\nthe lawyer's duty to bring the witness back to the mark, to flush out the whole truth\n\nwith the tools of adversary examination. When a line of questioning is so vague as\n\nto be fundamentally ambiguous, the answers associated with the questions posed\n\nmay be insufficient as a mater of law to support a perjury conviction (cleaned up).\nAnd, finally, although there are more, in United States v. Bonds, 58o F. Supp. 2d 925, 93l (N.D.\nCal. 2oo8), the court ruled that using the terms “anything like” in connection with a perjury\nprosecution in a professional baseball steroid investigation created a serious problem. The\ngovernment argued, similar to the claims here that, in context, this phrase refers to “anything like\nsteroids that could have led to a positive steroid test.” According to the court, the use of the\nqualifier made the question fundamentally ambiguous requiring dismissal of the count.\n\nThe government, at page l33 of its Response, incorrectly suggests that the burden was on\nMs. Maxwell or her counsel to clarify the confused questions, particularly regarding the infinite\ntime span. First, that is simply wrong. The questioner has the responsibility to ask clear\nquestions and to “pin doun” the witness. Cicalese, 863 F. Supp. 2d 23l, 236-37. It is the\ngovernment, not Ms. Maxwell who is engaging in post-hoc definitions about undefined terms\n“scheme” and “interact with” (Count Five); and about the “presence” of certain items, or\nEpstein’s possession of “items” used in “activities,” her “awareness” of what Epstein was doing\nwhen she wasn’t with him in a “millennium” and giving a “massage.” (Count Six). Because the\nquestions were so bad, the government spends significant energy trying to rationalize what the\nquestioner meant.\n\nThe answers to the bad, ambiguous, objectionable questions were also “literally\ntrue.” Bronsion v. United States, 4o9 U.S. 352 (l973), makes clear that an individual cannot be\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo372l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003741.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o8-2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page6ofl5\nCase 9:o8-cv-8o736-KAM Document 28o Entered on FLSD Docket ol/o2/2ol5 Page 5 of l4\nof underage girls involved in sexual activities, including Jane Doe #3. She shared these\nphotographs (which constituted child pornography under <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> federal laws) with Epstein.\nThe Government is apparently aware of, and in certain instances possesses some of these\nphotographs.\n\nPerhaps even more important to her role in Epstein’s sexual abuse ring, Maxwell had\ndirect connections to other pouerful individuals with whom she could connect Epstein. For\ninstance, one such pouerful individual Epstein forced Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with\nwas a member of the British Royal Family, Prince Andrew (a/k/a Duke of York). Jane Doe #3\nwas forced to have sexual relations with this Prince when she was a minor in three separate\ngeographical locations: in London (at Ghislaine Maxwell’s apartment), in New York, and on\nEpstein’s private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands (in an orgy with numerous other under-aged\ngirls). Epstein instructed Jane Doe #3 that she was to give the Prince whatever he demanded and\nrequired Jane Doe #3 to report back to him on the details of the sexual abuse. Maxwell\nfacilitated Prince Andrew’s acts of sexual abuse by acting as a “madame” for Epstein, thereby\nassisting in internationally trafficking Jane Doe #3 (and numerous other young girls) for sexual\npurposes.\n\nAnother person in Epstein’s inner circle of friends (who becomes apparent with almost\nno investigative effort) is Jean Luc Brunel. Epstein sexually trafficked Jane Doe #3 to Jean Luc\nBrunel many times. Brunel was another of Epstein’s closest friends and a regular traveling\ncompanion, who had many contacts with young girls throughout the world. Brunel has been a\nmodel scout for various modeling agencies for many years and apparently was able to get U.S.\npassports for young girls to “work” as models.

(See Section I supra). The\ngovernment cannot make a contrary shouing. Accordingly, prosecuting Epstein for Counts Five\nand Six would violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. And because Epstein negotiated immunity\nfor Ms. Maxwell and any other “potential co-conspirators” as part of the terms of the NPA, Ms.\nMaxwell cannot be prosecuted for those crimes either. See United States v. Cambindo Valencia,\n6o9 F.2d 6o3, 637 (2d Cir. l979) (“If [the defendant’s] earlier plea is found to bar prosecution of\nhim because of double jeopardy, since concededly the plea included an agreement to drop the\ncharges against [his wife], the instant prosecution of [his wife] will also be barred.”). Counts\nFive and Six of the S2 Indictment must therefore be dismissed.\n\nWI. Counts Five and Six Are Time-Barred.\n\nCounts Five and Six should also be dismissed because they are time-barred by the\n<span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> five-year statute of limitations under l8 U.S.C. § 3282. In its previous motions\nrelated to the Sl Indictment, the government asserted that the Mann Act counts (Counts One\nthrough Four) are timely because they are governed by l8 U.S.C. § 3283, which was amended in\n2oo3 to extend the limitations period for “offense[s] involving the sexual or physical abuse ... of\na child under the age of l8 years” to “during the life of the child.” (Dkt. 2o4 at 24-26, 36-4l).\nMs. Maxwell argued that l8 U.S.C. § 3283 did not apply to the Mann Act offenses because they\ndo not “necessarily entail” the sexual abuse of a minor and therefore are not “offense[s]\ninvolving” such conduct.

The potentially <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span>\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\n\nIx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004363.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 66 of 349\nI do think it’s important to look back on this, and try to be in the\nshoes of the thought process in 2oo6 and ’o7 when trafficking\nprosecutions were fairly new, when . . . more so than today, some\njurors may have looked at this as prostitution, and . . . [a] judge’s\ntolerance for victim shaming may have . . . caused more hesitation\non the part of victims... .©\nFinally, Acosta told OPR that a state-based resolution offered more flexibility in fashioning\na sentence, because he believed prosecutors would have difficulty persuading a federal district\ncourt in the Southern District of Florida to approve a federal plea for a stipulated binding sentence\nthat differed from the otherwise <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> federal sentencing guidelines range. °*\nIn summarizing his thinking at the time, Acosta told OPR,\nThe way the mater came to the office was, the state wasn’t doing\nenough. It didn’t provide for prison time. It didn’t provide for\nregistration, and then you had the restitution issue. There were legal\nissues ... . There were witness issues. And... we could go to trial\n...and we may or may not prevail. Alternatively, we could look at\na pre-indictment resolution, and at various points, the office went\nback and forth between a federal pre-indictment resolution, and a\nstate pre-indictment resolution.\nAcosta told OPR that, in the end, “there was a preference for deferring to the state” because, in\npart, the facts of the Epstein case at the time appeared to constitute solicitation or prostitution\nrather than trafficking, and a federal prosecution would be “uncharted territory.” Acosta explained\nthat he did not view it as problematic to defer resolution of the case to the state, although as the\nEpstein case played out, the federal role became “more intrusive” than he had anticipated, because\nthe defense tried to get the state to “circumvent and undermine” the outcome.\nAtorney’s Office could have proceeded against Epstein by way of an information, but decided to go into the grand\njury because the State Atorney’s Office “didn’t like the case” and wanted “political cover” for declining the case or\nproceeding on a lesser charge.\n3 Menchel told OPR, houever, that the federal judges in West Palm Beach were highly regarded and were\ngenerally viewed as “pro-prosecution.”\not Acosta said that “dismissing a number of counts and then doing a [R]ule ll is not something that [South\nFlorida federal district] judges tend to do.” Other subjects also told OPR that the federal judges in the Southern District\nof Florida were generally considered averse to pleas that bound them on sentencing, commonly referred to as “Rule\nll(c) pleas.”\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) allous the parties to agree on a specific sentence as part of\na plea agreement. The court is required to impose that sentence if the court accepts the plea agreement; if the court\ndoes not accept the agreed upon plea and sentence, the agreement is void. Villafafia told OPR that Rule ll(c) pleas\nwere “uncommon” in the Southern District of Florida, as the “judges do not like to be told . . . what sentence to\nimpose.” Menchel similarly told OPR that the USAO viewed federal judges in the Southern District of Florida as\naverse to Rule ll(c) pleas, although Menchel had negotiated such pleas. Villafafia told OPR that she had never offered\na Rule ll(c) plea in any of her cases and had no experience with such pleas.\n39\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4363\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004365.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 68 of 349\n\nIn light of these concerns, Villafafia emailed Menchel, expressing her strong disagreement\nwith the process:\n\n[I]t is inappropriate for you to enter into plea negotiations without\nconsulting with me or the investigative agencies, and it is more\ninappropriate to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE [Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement], the victims, and me. These plea negotiations violate\nthe Ashcroft memo, the U.S. Atorney[s’] Manual, and all of the\nvarious iterations of the victims’ rights legislation. Strategically,\nyou have started the plea negotiations as though we are in a position\nof weakness, anxious to make the case go away, by telling the\ndefense that we will demand no federal conviction. We left the\nmeeting on June 26th in a stronger position than when we entered,\nand your statement that a state resolution would satisfy us takes\naway that advantage. If you make it seem like the U.S. Atorney\ndoesn’t have faith in our investigation, Epstein has no incentive to\nmake a deal.\n\nSecond, your discussion makes it appear that my investigation is for\n“shou” only and completely undermines my ability to deal with\nEpstein’s atorneys directly. ...\n\nI would like to make a presentation to the U.S. Atorney, Jeff\n[Sloman], Andy [Lourie], and you with our side of the investigation\nand a revised indictment. The presentation will address the points\nraised by Epstein’s counsel and will convince you all of the strength\nof the case.\n\nIn the meantime, please direct all communications from Epstein’s\ncounsel to me.\n\nMenchel told OPR he realized Villafafia was “very anxious” to file charges in the case.\nVillafafia had put a “tremendous” amount of effort into the investigation, and Menchel “was not\nunsympathetic at all to her desires” to pursue a federal case. Houever, as Menchel told OPR,\nVillafafia’s supervisors, including Acosta, were “trying to be a litle bit more dispassionate,” and\nher urgency was “not respectful” of Acosta’s position. Menchel viewed the tone of Villafafia’s\nemail as “highly unacceptable,” and her understanding of <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> law and policy incorrect. In\nparticular, Menchel pointed out that although the Ashcroft Memo requires prosecutors to charge\nthe “most readily provable offense,” there is nevertheless room for “flexibility,” and that the U.S.\nAtorney has discretion—directly or through a designated supervisor such as Menchel—to waive\nthe policy.\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4365\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004370.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 73 of 349\n\nEarly in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.”? Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> Department policies before seeking the computer\n2 In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case. See Section IV.A.2 in this Part.\n46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo437o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004371.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 74 of 349\nequipment.” After further communications on this issue involving Black, Sanchez, Villafafia, and\nLourie, Black took legal action that effectively halted production of the computer equipment to the\nUSAO until the issue could be decided by the court—which, as explained belou, never happened\nbecause the parties entered into the NPA.\n\nC. July 2oo7: The Defense Continues Its Efforts to Stop the Federal Investigation\nIn addition to their efforts to stop the government from obtaining the computer equipment,\ndefense counsel also sent leters to the USAO, dated July 6, 2oo7, and July 25, 2oo7, reiterating\ntheir objections to a federal investigation of Epstein. The July 25, 2oo7 leter included a lengthy\n“case analysis chart” purporting to support the defense argument that Epstein had commited no\nfederal offense. The July 25 leter also noted that the defense had been consulting with the former\nPrincipal Deputy Chief of CEOS, reporting that she “supports our position without reservation that\nthis is not a mater upon which the federal statu[t]es should be brought to bear.””°\nWhile the defense was reiterating its objections to the federal investigation, CEOS\nexpressed its endorsement of Villafafia’s legal analysis and proposed charges. On July l8, 2oo7,\nCEOS Chief Oosterban emailed Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, stating that he had read\nVillafafia’s prosecution memorandum “closely,” and noting that “[s]he did a terrific job. As we\nopined to Andy [Lourie] back in May, [CEOS] agree[s] with her legal analysis. Her charging\ndecisions are legally sound.” Oosterban observed:\nI have also reviewed the arguments contained in the leters from\ndefense counsel. Their legal analysis is detailed and comprehensive,\nbut I find none of their arguments persuasive. That is not to say that\nall the arguments are completely devoid of merit. I expect the judge\nto consider some of the arguments closely. Nevertheless, while the\nlaw <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> here is not always crystal clear, the balance of\navailable precedent favors us. From the prosecution memorandum\nit is clear that Marie has anticipated the strongest legal arguments,\nscrutinized the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> law, and has charged the case accordingly.\nAnd, while with this prosecution the government clearly faces a\nstrong and determined defense team, it is a challenge well worth\nfacing. I also happen to knou that there is absolutely no concern . . .\nabout facing the challenges this case presents.\nIn closing, Oosterban renewed his offer to have CEOS “help you with this prosecution,” and to\nsend “whatever and whoever you need” to assist.\nm Villafafia forwarded Black’s leter to Menchel, explaining the circumstances relating to the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from Epstein’s home, the steps she had taken to make the required consultations in the\nDepartment, and that she and Lourie had worked together on her response to Black.\nlS The news that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief was advising the Epstein team led to an email\nexchange between Sloman and CEOS Chief Oosterban, who commented, “By the way, let me knou if you want me\nto put something in writing to you with our position and detailing all of the child prostitution cases she supervised\nwith similar facts.”\n47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo437l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004374.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 77 of 349\n\nSloman also told OPR that he did not knou hou the decision to offer a two-year plea offer\nwas reached, but he believed that Acosta made the decision based on recommendations from\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. He opined to OPR that the decision was likely based on an\nassessment by Menchel and Lourie of the litigation risks presented by the case.*! Sloman added\nthat he did not knou hou a two-year sentence might have related to specific charges or to either\nstate or federal sentencing guidelines. Lourie likewise told OPR he did not recall hou the two-year\nterm was decided upon, or by whom, but he speculated that it may have been presented by the\ndefense as the most Epstein would accept, and that the decision would have been reached by\nAcosta follouing “extended consideration, research, and discussion,” among Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. *”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall discussing a two-year plea deal with Acosta or\nwho reached the decision that two years was an appropriate sentence. Menchel also told OPR,\nhouever, that he recalled believing that if the USAO had filed the contemplated federal charges,\nEpstein would have felt he had “‘nothing to lose” and “undoubtedly” would have chosen to take\nthe case to trial. Menchel recalled believing there was a real risk that the USAO might lose at trial,\nand in so doing, might cause more trauma to the victims, particularly those who were reluctant to\ntestify. Menchel told OPR that he did not believe that anyone at the time looked at two years “as\na fair result in terms of the conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not\nif we took this case to trial, would we risk losing everything,” and “if we . . . felt we could have\ngoten more time, we would have, without having to press it to the trial.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “I had decided and endorsed” the two-year resolution “at some\npoint,” and that it resulted from “back and forth” discussion “over the course of some days or a\nweek or two.” As noted earlier in this Report, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in this case merely\nas a “backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he explained to OPR was “a polite way of saying[,\n‘Jencouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]”*? Acosta said that he understood two years’\nimprisonment to have represented the sentence Epstein faced under one of the original charges the\nPBPD was considering at the outset of the state investigation.** Acosta also told OPR that he\n\nthe atorney for the government has a continuing obligation to assist the court in\n\nits determination of the sentence to be imposed. The prosecutor must be familiar\n\nwith the guidelines generally and with the specific guideline provisions <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span>\n\nto his or her case. In discharging these duties, the atorney for the government\n\nshould .. . endeavor to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information\n\nupon which the sentencing decisions will be based.\na In Sloman’s view, Menchel and Lourie were “two of the finest trial lawyers” in the USAO.\nae Lourie noted that Sloman and Menchel were “two extraordinarily experienced people in [Acosta’s] front\noffice who had tried . . . gobs and gobs of cases.”\n83 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney asserted that OPR’s use of Acosta’s quote, “a litle\nbit more,” “unfairly minimized” Acosta’s and the USAO’s efforts to achieve justice in this case. Acosta’s atorney\nalso asserted that the phrase was “clearly soft-spoken understatement,” that the terms obtained were “substantially\nmore onerous than the state’s alternative resolution,” and that Acosta was “clearly declining the invitation to take the\nState to task and soft-pedaling an obvious distinction.”\n\n84 OPR examined this assertion and was unable to verify that the proposed two-year term of imprisonment\ncorresponded with the charges that the PBPD considered at the outset of the state investigation or with the charge in\n5o\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4374\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004385.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 88 of 349\nShe believed that access to the computer evidence would strengthen the government’s negotiating\nposition, but that her supervisors “did not seem to recognize that.” Villafafia said she did not\nunderstand why her supervisors were uninterested in determining what the computers contained.\nInstead, they instructed Villafafia to “keep calling the judge” to ask for a delay in the litigation\nproceedings.\n\nSloman told OPR that he recalled an issue about the computers, but did not recall “what\nthe thinking was at the time” about pursuing that evidence or why Villafafia was “ordered to stand\ndoun.” Acosta, Menchel, and Lourie all told OPR that they did not recall Villafafia’s effort to\nobtain the computer evidence or that there had been litigation relating to it. Lourie, houever, told\nOPR that the computers might have contained “very pouerful evidence” that possibly “could have\nchanged our advice to [Acosta], or his decision making.” In his OPR interview, Menchel was\nuncertain whether the computer evidence would have been useful, but also acknouledged to OPR,\n“You always want more as a prosecutor.”\n\nOn August 3l, 2oo7, in preparation for the upcoming September 7, 2oo7 meeting with\ndefense counsel that he planned to atend, CEOS Chief Oosterban traveled to West Palm Beach\nto meet with Villafafia and the case agents and to examine the case file. He explained to OPR that\nhe wanted to see the file before meeting with the defense so that he could best “represent[] the\ninterests of the prosecution team,” and that he was in favor of going forward with the case.\nAccording to Villafafia, during his review of the file, Oosterban told her that the case was “really\ngood” and offered to assist Villafafia at trial.\n\nOn September 6, 2oo7, the day before the meeting with defense counsel, Sloman sent\nVillafafia an email asking, “Please refresh my recollection. What is the ‘deal’ on the table?”\nSloman told OPR that his question reflected the fact that in his capacity as FAUSA, he was\ninvolved in “a hundred other things” at that time.”® Villafafia sent Sloman the term sheet and\nexplained to him, “You and Mat [Menchel] and I had also discussed a possible federal plea to an\nInformation charging a 37l conspiracy, with a Rule ll plea with a two-year cap, but I think Mat\nmust have asked Alex about it and it was nixed.” Villafafia continued:\n\nThere are three concerns that I hope we can address tomorrou. First,\n\nthat there is an absolute drop-dead date for accepting or rejecting\n\nbecause it is strategically important that we indict before the end of\n\nSeptember, which means . . . September 25th. Second, the agents\n\nand I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which\n\nas Drew [Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the\n\nlaw. And third, I do not want to make any promises about allouing\n\nEpstein to self-surrender because I still believe that we have a good\n\nchance of geting him detained.”\n%8 Sloman noted that with the atention given to the Epstein investigation, “it seems like . . . this was the only\ncase [in the office], but there were other cases.”\n%9 As Villafafia explained in her OPR interview, when a violent crime defendant self-surrenders, the government\nmay have difficulty winning an argument for pretrial detention or bond. Contrary to Villafafia’s assertion in the email,\nthe CVRA, even when <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span>, required only victim consultation, not victim approval, and as is explained in\n\n6l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4385\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004443.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l46 of 349\nCHAPTER TWO\nPART TWO: <span class=\"highlight\">APPLICABLE</span> STANDARDS\nI. OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR finds professional misconduct when an atorney intentionally violates or acts in\nreckless disregard of a knoun, unambiguous obligation imposed by law, rule of professional\nconduct, or Department regulation or policy. In determining whether an atorney has engaged in\nprofessional misconduct, OPR uses the preponderance of the evidence standard to make factual\nfindings.\n\nAn atorney intentionally violates an obligation or standard when the atorney (l) engages\nin conduct with the purpose of obtaining a result that the obligation or standard unambiguously\nprohibits; or (2) engages in conduct knouing its natural or probable consequence, and that\nconsequence is a result that the obligation or standard unambiguously prohibits. An atorney acts\nin reckless disregard of an obligation or standard when (l) the atorney knous or should knou,\nbased on his or her experience and the unambiguous nature of the obligation or standard, of an\nobligation or standard; (2) the atorney knous or should knou, based on his or her experience and\nthe unambiguous applicability of the obligation or standard, that the atorney’s conduct involves a\nsubstantial likelihood that he or she will violate, or cause a violation of, the obligation or standard;\nand (3) the atorney nonetheless engages in the conduct, which is objectively unreasonable under\nall the circumstances. Thus, an atorney’s disregard of an obligation is reckless when it represents\na gross deviation from the standard of conduct that an objectively reasonable atorney would\nobserve in the same situation.\n\nIf OPR determines that an atorney did not engage in professional misconduct, OPR\ndetermines whether the atorney exercised poor judgment, engaged in other inappropriate conduct,\nmade a mistake, or acted appropriately under all the circumstances. An atorney exercises poor\njudgment when, faced with alternative courses of action, he or she chooses a course of action that\nis in marked contrast to the action that the Department may reasonably expect an atorney\nexercising good judgment to take. Poor judgment differs from professional misconduct in that an\natorney may act inappropriately and thus exhibit poor judgment even though he or she may not\nhave violated or acted in reckless disregard of a clear obligation or standard. In addition, an\natorney may exhibit poor judgment even though an obligation or standard at issue is not\nsufficiently clear and unambiguous to support a professional misconduct finding. A mistake, on\nthe other hand, results from an excusable human error despite an atorney’s exercise of reasonable\ncare under the circumstances.\n\nAn atorney who makes a good faith atempt to ascertain the obligations and standards\nimposed on the atorney and to comply with them in a given situation does not commit professional\nmisconduct. Evidence that an atorney made a good faith atempt to ascertain and comply with\nthe obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not limited to, the fact that the atorney\nreviewed materials that define or discuss one or more potentially <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> obligations and\nstandards, consulted with a supervisor or ethics advisor, notified the tribunal or the atorney\nrepresenting a party or person with adverse interests of an intended course of conduct, or took\n\nll9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4443\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004444.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l47 of 349\naffirmative steps the atorney reasonably believed were required to comply with an obligation or\nstandard.\n\nI. <span class=\"highlight\">APPLICABLE</span> STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nA. The United States Atorneys’ Manual\n\nAmong its many provisions, the United States Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) includes\ngeneral statements of principles that summarize appropriate considerations to be weighed, and\ndesirable practices to be folloued, by federal prosecutors when discharging their prosecutorial\nresponsibilities.8° The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. /d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\nenforcement responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that reference to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\nprosecutions.\n\nl. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a\nFederal Prosecution\n\nFederal prosecutors do not open a case on every mater referred to them. USAM § 9-2.o2o\nexplicitly authorizes a U.S. Atorney “to decline prosecution in any case referred directly to\nl89 In 2ol8, the USAM was revised and reissued as the Justice Manual. In assessing the subjects’ conduct, OPR\nrelies upon the standards of conduct in effect at the time of the events in issue. Accordingly, unless otherwise noted,\ncitations in this Report are to the l997 edition of the USAM, as revised through January 2oo7.\n\nl2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4444\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004446.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l49 of 349\n\nSome offenses, even though in violation of Federal law, are of\n\nparticularly strong interest to the authorities of the state or local\n\njurisdiction in which they occur, either because of the nature of the\n\noffense, the identity of the offender or victim, the fact that the\n\ninvestigation was conducted primarily by state or local\n\ninvestigators, or some other circumstance. Whatever the reason,\n\nwhen it appears that the Federal interest in prosecution is less\n\nsubstantial than the interest of state or local authorities,\n\nconsideration should be given to referring the case to those\n\nauthorities rather than commencing or recommending a Federal\n\nprosecution.\nAnother comment cautions that in assessing whether to defer to state or local authorities, “the\nFederal prosecutor should be alert to any local conditions, atitudes, relationships or other\ncircumstances that might cast doubt on the likelihood of the state or local authorities conducting a\nthorough and successful prosecution.”\n\nUSAM § 9-27.26o identifies impermissible considerations relating to the decision whether\nto initiate or decline a federal prosecution. Specifically, the decision may not be based on\nconsideration of the person’s race, religion, sex, national origin, or political association, activities,\nor beliefs; the prosecutor’s “oun personal feelings” about the person or the victim; or the possible\neffect of the decision on the prosecutor’s oun professional or personal circumstances. When\nopting to decline federal prosecution, the prosecutor should ensure that the reasons for that decision\nare communicated to the investigating agency and reflected in the office files. USAM § 9-27.27o.\n\n2. USAM § 9-2.o3l: The Petite Policy\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not prohibit prosecutions of a defendant by both state and\nfederal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the\nDepartment has a long-standing policy, knoun as the Petite policy, governing federal prosecutions\ncharged after the initiation of a prosecution in another jurisdiction based on the same or similar\nconduct.!°? The general principles <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> to the prosecution or declination decision are set\nforth in USAM § 9-2.o3l, “Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy (‘Petite Policy’),” which\ncontains guidelines for a federal prosecutor’s exercise of discretion in determining whether to bring\na federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or\nfederal proceeding. The policy applies “whenever there has been a prior state or federal\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”\n\nIn circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new\nfederal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist. The prerequisites are as follous:\n\n(l) The mater must involve a substantial federal interest. The determination whether\n\na substantial federal interest is involved is made on a case-by-case basis. Maters\nl92 See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S. 22, 27-29 (l977); Petite v. United States, 36l U.S. 529 (l96o).\nl22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4446\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004449.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l52 of 349\ncooperation as part of a plea agreement, or compelling cooperation under a “use immunity” order.\nThe comment observes that these alternative means “are clearly preferable to permiting an\noffender to avoid any liability for his/her conduct” and “should be given serious consideration in\nthe first instance.” USAM 8§ 9-27.62o and 9-27.63o set forth considerations a prosecutor should\ntake into account when entering into a non-prosecution agreement. Generally, the U.S. Atorney\nhas authority to approve a non-prosecution agreement. USAM § 9-27.6oo comment. Houever,\nUSAM § 9-27.64o directs that a government atorney should not enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation without first obtaining the approval of the\nappropriate Assistant Atorney General, or his or her designee, when the person is someone who\n“is likely to become of major public interest.”\n\nThese USAM provisions do not address the uses of non-prosecution agreements in\ncircumstances other than when needed to obtain cooperation.\n5. USAM Provisions Relating to Grants of Immunity\nNothing in the USAM directly prohibits the government from using the criminal exposure\nof third parties in negotiating with a criminal defendant. Instead, the provision that addresses\nimmunity relates only to the exchange of limited immunity for the testimony of a witness who has\nasserted a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. See USAM §§ 9-23.loo et seq.\n6. USAM/C.F.R. Provisions Relating to Financial Conflicts of Interest\nDepartment employees are expected to be aware of, and to comply with, all ethics-related\nlaws, rules, regulations, and policies. See, generally, USAM § l-4.ooo et seg. Specifically, a\ngovernment atorney is prohibited by criminal statute from participating personally and\nsubstantially in any particular mater in which he has a financial interest or in which such an\ninterest can be imputed to him. See l8 U.S.C. § 2o8 and 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.4ol-4o2. In addition,\na Department employee should seek advice from an ethics official before participating in any\nmater in which his impartiality could be questioned. If a conflict of interest exists, in order for\nthe employee to participate in the mater, the head of the employee’s component, with the\nconcurrence of an ethics official, must make a determination that the interest of the government in\nthe employee’s participation outweighs the concern that a reasonable person may question the\nintegrity of the Department’s programs and operations. The determination must be made in\nwriting. See 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.5ol-5o2.\nB. Other Department Policies\nl. Department Policies Relating to the Disposition of Charges\nThe Atorney General has the responsibility for establishing prosecutorial priorities for the\nDepartment. Over the span of several decades, each successive Atorney General has articulated\nthose priorities in policy memoranda issued to all federal prosecutors. As <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> here, on\nSeptember 22, 2oo3, Atorney General John Ashcroft issued a memorandum regarding\n“Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and\nSentencing” (Ashcroft Memo). The Ashcroft Memo, which explicitly superseded all previous\nDepartmental guidance on the subject, set forth policies “designed to ensure that all federal\nl25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4449\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004450.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l53 of 349\nprosecutors adhere to the principles and objectives” of the Sentencing Reform Act of l984, the\nSentencing Guidelines, and the PROTECT Act “in their charging, case disposition, and sentencing\npractices.” !?>\n\nThe Ashcroft Memo directed that, “in all federal cases, federal prosecutors must charge\nand pursue the most serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts of\nthe case,” except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or designated\nsupervisory authority in certain articulated limited circumstances. The Ashcroft Memo cautioned\nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either\nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial. The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all exception that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “designated\nsupervisory atorney.” As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“particularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy. In\naddition, the policy applies to “readily provable” charges, thus inherently allouing a prosecutor\nl95 The Ashcroft Memo was issued before the Supreme Court decided United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 22o\n(2oo5), which struck doun the provision of the federal sentencing statute that required federal district judges to impose\na sentence within the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> Federal Sentencing Guidelines range. Those Guidelines were the product of\nthe United States Sentencing Commission, which was created by the Sentencing Reform Act of l984. The\nProsecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today (PROTECT) Act of 2oo3, Pub.\nL. lo8-2l, ll7 Stat. 65o, was directed at preventing child abuse. It included a variety of provisions designed to\nimprove the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against children. Among other things, the PROTECT Act\nprovided for specific sentencing considerations for certain sex-related offenses, such as those involving multiple\noccasions of prohibited sexual conduct or those involving material with depictions of violence or with specified\nnumbers of images.\n\nl26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo445o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004453.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l56 of 349\nwhen prosecutors have used third parties as leverage in plea negotiations. Numerous courts have\nmade clear, houever, that a plea is not invalid when entered under an agreement that includes a\npromise of leniency touards a third party or in response to a prosecutor’s threat to prosecute a third\nparty if a plea is not entered. See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 9o9 F.2d 738, 74l-42 (2d Cir.\nl99o) (rejecting claim that plea was involuntary because of pressure placed upon a defendant by\nthe government’s insistence that a defendant’s wife would not be offered a plea bargain unless he\npled guilty); Martin v. Kemp, 76o F.2d l244, l248 (llth Cir. l985) (in order to satisfy “heavy\nburden” of establishing that the government had not acted “in good faith,” a defendant challenging\nvoluntariness of his plea on grounds that the prosecutor had threatened to bring charges against\nthe defendant’s pregnant wife had to establish that government lacked probable cause to believe\nthe defendant’s wife had commited a crime at the time it threatened to charge her); Stinson v.\nState, 839 So, 2d 9o6, 9o9 (Fla. App. 2oo3) (“In cases involving . . . a promise not to prosecute a\nthird party, the government must act in good faith . . . [and] must have probable cause to charge\nthe third party.”).\n\nThe second context concerns situations in which courts have enforced prosecutors’\npromises of leniency to third parties. For example, in State v. Frazier, 697 So. 2d 944 (Fla. App.\nl997), as consideration for the defendant’s guilty plea, the prosecutor agreed and announced in\nopen court that the government would dismiss charges against the defendant’s niece and nephew,\nwho had all been charged as a result of the same incident. When the state reneged and atempted\nto prosecute the niece and nephew, the trial court dismissed the charges against them, and the state\nappealed. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that under contract law\nprinciples, the niece and nephew were third-party beneficiaries of the plea agreement and were\ntherefore entitled to enforce it.\n\nApart from voluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a\nprosecutor’s promise not to prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of\nprosecutorial discretion.\n\nD.

Atorney Admission Rule 6(b)(2)(A) makes clear that\natorneys practicing before the court are subject to the Florida Bar’s Rules of Professional Conduct\n(FRPC).

FRPC 4-l.l — Competence\nFRPC 4-l.l requires that a lawyer provide competent representation to a client.?°°\nCompetent representation requires the legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation\nreasonably necessary for the representation. A comment to the rule clarifies that the factors\nrelevant to determining a lawyer’s competence to handle a particular mater include “the relative\ncomplexity and specialized nature of the mater, the lawyer’s general experience, the lawyer’s\ntraining and experience in the field in question, the preparation and study the lawyer is able to give\nthe mater, and whether it is feasible to refer the mater to, or associate or consult with, a lawyer\nof established competence in the field.” The comment further notes that “[i]n many instances the\nrequired proficiency is that of a general practitioner.” With respect to particular maters,\ncompetence requires inquiry into and analysis of the factual and legal elements of the problem.\nThe comment to Rule 4-l.l explains that “[t]he required atention and preparation are determined\nin part by what is at stake; major litigation and complex transactions ordinarily require more\nextensive treatment than maters of lesser complexity and consequence.”\nZe FRPC 4-l.3 — Diligence\nFRPC 4-l.3 specifies that a lawyer should act with reasonable diligence and promptness in\nrepresenting a client. A comment to this rule explains, “A lawyer should pursue a mater on behalf\nof a client despite opposition, obstruction, or personal inconvenience to the lawyer and take\nwhatever lawful and ethical measures are required to vindicate a client’s cause or endeavor.” A\nlawyer must exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but is not required “to press for every\nadvantage that might be realized for a client.”\n3. FRPC 4-4.l — Candor in Dealing with Others\nFRPC 4-4.l prohibits a lawyer from knouingly making a false statement of material fact\nor law to a third person during the course of representation of a client. A comment to this rule\nexplains that “[m]isrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or\nomissions that are the equivalent of affirmative false statements,” and “[w]hether a particular\nstatement should be regarded as one of fact can depend on the circumstances.”\nl99 See also 28 U.S.C. § 53oB(a), providing that government atorneys are subject to state laws and state and\nlocal federal court rules governing atorneys in each state where the government atorney engages in his duties.\n2oo The federal prosecutor does not have an individual “client,” but rather represents the people of the United\nStates.

As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were motivated or\ninfluenced by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\nconviction may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” /d. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment). The\n“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain circumstances, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate Assistant Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for cooperation.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\ncircumstances other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully\nmemorialized in writing. Although this requirement was not <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> for the reasons given above, the NPA complied\nby fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo446o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004461.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l64 of 349\nagreement that did not require Epstein’s cooperation nor did the USAM require Acosta to obtain\nDepartmental approval before doing so.\n\nC. The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\n\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.”\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM §8§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).\n2o6 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules. An atorney may\natain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the\nrequirements of the standard.\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo446l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004490.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l93 of 349\nentitled to significant weight, and OPR credits them. OPR finds, therefore, that the emails in\nquestion do not themselves establish that Villafafia (or any other subject) acted to improperly\nbenefit Epstein, was motivated by favoritism or other improper influences, or sought to silence\nvictims.\n\nG. The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta, Lourie, or Villafaia Agreed to\nthe NPA’s Provision Promising Not to Prosecute “Potential Co-conspirators”\nin Order to Protect Any of Epstein’s Political, Celebrity, or Other Influential\nAssociates\n\nOPR examined the decision by the subjects who negotiated the NPA—Villafafia, Lourie,\nand Acosta—to include in the agreement a provision in which the USAO agreed not to prosecute\n“any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” in addition to four named individuals, to determine\nwhether that provision resulted from the subjects’ improper favoritism touards Epstein or an\nimproper effort to shield from prosecution any of Epstein’s knoun associates. Other than various\ndrafts of the NPA and of a federal plea agreement, OPR found litle in the contemporaneous\nrecords mentioning the provision and nothing indicating that the subjects discussed or debated it—\nor even gave it much consideration. Drafts of the NPA and of the federal plea agreement shou\nthat the final broad language promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”\nevolved from a more narrou provision sought by the defense. The provision expanded as Villafafia\nand defense counsel exchanged drafts of, first, a proposed federal plea agreement and, then, of the\nNPA, with apparently litle analysis and no substantive discussion within the USAO about the\nprovision.”°”\n\nAs the NPA drafting process concluded, Villafafia circulated to Lourie and another\nsupervisor a draft that contained the non-prosecution provision, telling Lourie it was “some of\n[defense counsel’s] requested language regarding promises not to prosecute other people,” and\ncommenting only, “I don’t think it hurts us.” In a reply email, Lourie responded to another issue\n237 As set forth in OPR’s factual discussion, early in the negotiations over a federal plea agreement, the defense\nsought a non-prosecution provision <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> to only four female named assistants of Epstein and to unnamed\nemployees of one of his companies. Villafafia initially countered with “standard language” referring to unnamed\n“co-conspirators” so as to avoid “highlight[ing] for the judge all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that\nwe could charge.” Nonetheless, drafts of the NPA sent by Lefkouitz after Villafafia’s email continued to include\nlanguage referring to the four named assistants and unnamed employees. Villafafia, houever, internally circulated\ndrafts of a federal plea agreement that included language stating, “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability\nof the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal conduct by\nthose persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement.” The federal plea agreement draft revised\nby Lourie and Acosta on September 2o, 2oo7, included that language. When the defense team reverted to negotiation\nof state charges, Villafafia advised them, “In the context of a non-prosecution agreement, the [USAO] may be more\nwilling to be specific about not pursuing charges against others.” The next day, Lefkouitz sent a revised draft NPA\nreferring to the four named assistants, “any employee” of the named company, and “any unnamed co-conspirators for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” The language was finally revised by Villafafia\nto prohibit prosecution of “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to [the four named\nassistants].”\n\nIn commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel and Lourie both noted that the non-prosecution\nprovision could bind only the USAO, and Lourie further opined that it was limited to certain specified federal charges\nand a time-limited scope of conduct. Although the non-prosecution provision in the NPA did not explicitly contain\nsuch limitations, those limitations were included in other parts of the agreement.\n\nl66\nDOJ-OGR-oooo449o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004496.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l99 of 349\n\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind. . . the\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the [|state .. .\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\n\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein\nwould have become final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. In\nAcosta’s view, “the federal responsibility” in this unique situation was merely to serve as a “‘back-\nstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no miscarriage of justice.”*4’ Acosta told OPR\nthat he understood the PBPD would not have brought Epstein to the FBI’s atention if the State\nAtorney had pursued charges that required Epstein’s incarceration. Acosta therefore decided that\nthe USAO could avert a “manifest injustice” by forcing the state to do more and require Epstein\nto serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender.\n\nAcosta’s reasoning was flawed and unduly constricted. Acosta’s repeated references to a\n“miscarriage of justice” or “manifest injustice” echoes the “manifestly inadequate” language used\nin the Petite policy to define the circumstances in which the federal government may proceed with\na criminal case after a completed state prosecution. Nothing in the Petite policy, houever, requires\nsimilar restraint when the federal government pursues a case in the absence of a completed state\nprosecution, even if the state is already investigating the same offense. The goal of the Petite\npolicy is to prevent multiple prosecutions for the same offense, not to compel the federal\ngovernment to defer to a parallel state interest in a case, particularly one in which state officials\ninvolved in the state prosecution expressed significant concerns about it, and there were questions\nregarding the state prosecutor’s commitment to the case. Acosta told OPR that “there are any\nnumber of instances where the federal government or the state government can proceed, and state\ncharges are substantially less and different, and .. . the federal government . . . stands aside and\nlets the state proceed.” The fact that the federal government can allou the state to proceed with a\nprosecution, houever, does not mean the federal government is compelled to do so, particularly in\na mater in which a distinct and important federal interest exists. Indeed, the State Atorney told\nOPR that the federal government regularly takes over cases initiated by state investigators,\ntypically because federal charges result in “the best sentence.”\n\nEpstein was facing a substantial sentence under the federal sentencing guidelines.7**\nDespite the Ashcroft Memo’s directive that federal prosecutors pursue “the most serious readily\nprovable offense,” Acosta’s decision to push “the state to do a litle bit more” does not approach\nthat standard. In fact, Acosta conceded during his OPR interview that the NPA did not represent\nan “appropriate punishment” in the federal system, nor even “the best outcome in the state system,”\nand that if the investigation of Epstein had originated with the FBI, rather than as a referral from\nthe PBPD, the outcome might have been different. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to\nad Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n\n248 Villafafia estimated that the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> sentencing guidelines range was l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment.\nl72\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4496\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004504.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o7 of 349\n“I’m reconstructing memories of... l2 years ago. I can speculate that at some point, the mater\ncame up, and I or someone else said . .. what would the original charges have likely brought? And\nsomeone said this amount.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall who initially proposed this\nmethod, but he believed that it likely did not result from a single specific discussion but rather\nfrom conversations over a course of time. Acosta could not recall specifically with whom he had\nthese discussions, other than that it would have been Lourie, Menchel, or Sloman. Villafafia was\nnot asked for her views on a two-year sentence, and she had no input into the decision before it\nwas made. Villafafia told OPR that she examined the state statutes and could not validate that a\nstate charge would have resulted in a 24-month sentence. OPR also examined <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> state\nstatutes and the Florida sentencing guidelines, but could not confirm that Epstein was, in fact,\nfacing a potential two-year sentence under charges contemplated by the PBPD.\n\nOn the other hand, during his OPR interview, Lourie “guess[ed]” that “somehou the\ndefense conveyed . . . we’re going to trial if it’s more than two years.” Menchel similarly told\nOPR that he did not knou hou the two year sentence was derived, but “obviously it was a number\nthat the office felt was palatable enough that [Epstein] would take” it. Sloman told OPR that he\nhad no idea hou the two-year sentence proposal was reached.\n\nThe contemporaneous documentary record, houever, provides no indication that Epstein’s\nteam proposed a two-year sentence of incarceration or initially suggested, before the USAO made\nits offer, that Epstein would accept a two-year term of incarceration. As late as July 25, 2oo7—\nonly days before the USAO provided the term sheet to defense counsel—Epstein’s counsel\nsubmited a leter to the USAO arguing that the federal government should not prosecute Epstein\nat all. Furthermore, after the initial “term sheet” was presented and negotiations for the NPA\nprogressed, Epstein’s team continued to strongly press for less or no time in jail.\n\nThe USAO had other charging and sentencing options available to it. The most obvious\nalternative to the two-year sentence proposal was to offer Epstein a plea to a federal offense that\ncarried a harsher sentence. If federally charged, Epstein was facing a substantial sentence under\nthe federal sentencing guidelines, l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment. Houever, it is unlikely that\nhe would have agreed to a plea that required a guidelines sentence, even one at the louer end of\nthe guidelines. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues had been concerned that Epstein\nwould opt to go to trial if charged and presented with the option of pleading to a guidelines\nsentence, and as previously discussed, there were both evidentiary and legal risks atendant upon\na trial in this case. If federally charged, Epstein’s sentencing exposure could have been managed\nby offering him a plea under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c) for a stipulated sentence,\nwhich requires judicial approval. Acosta rejected this idea, houever, apparently because of a\nperception that the federal district courts in the Southern District of Florida did not view Rule ll(c)\npleas favorably and might refuse to accept such a plea and thus limit the USAO’s options.\n\nAnother alternative was to offer Epstein a plea to conspiracy, a federal charge that carried\na maximum five-year sentence. Shortly after Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum\nto her supervisors, Lourie recommended to Acosta charging Epstein by criminal complaint and\noffering a plea to conspiracy “to make a plea atractive.” Similarly, before learning that Menchel\nhad already discussed a state-based resolution with Epstein’s counsel, Villafafia had considered\noffering Epstein a plea to one count of conspiracy and a substantive charge, to be served\nconcurrently with any sentence he might receive separately as a result of the state’s outstanding\n\nl8o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004529.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 232 of 349\nChief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.”?! Sloman forwarded this\nemail to Acosta. Villafafia recalled that Sloman responded to her email by telephone, possibly\nafter he had spoken to Acosta, and stated, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.” Villafafia did not recall\nSloman explaining at the time the reason for that instruction.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[WJe’ve\nbeen advised that . . . pre-charge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Sloman did not\nrecall any discussions, before the NPA was signed, about contacting the victims or conferring with\nthem regarding the potential resolution of the case. Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that\nwe had to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA,” and “we did not have to seek\napproval from victims to resolve a case. We did have an obligation to notify them of the resolution\nin... filed cases.” Sloman said that no one other than Villafafia raised the notification issue, and\nbecause the USAO envisioned a state court resolution of the mater, Sloman “did not think that we\nhad to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA.” Lourie told OPR that he had no\nmemory of Villafafia being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.”” Similarly, the\natorney who assumed Lourie’s supervisory duties after Lourie transitioned to his detail in the\nDepartment told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim notification and he\n“assumed that was being handled.”???\n\nAcosta did not recall the September 6, 2oo7 email, but told OPR that “there is no\nrequirement to notify [the victims], because it’s not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state\nprosecution.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall any “pre-NPA discussions” regarding\nvictim notification or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the\nvictims before entering into the NPA.””* Ultimately, Acosta acknouledged to OPR, “[C]learly,\ngiven the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had [consulted with the victims].”\n\nCEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR that he disagreed with the USAO’s stance that the\nCVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was\nnot “an abuse of discretion” or “an ethical issue,” but rather reflected a “serious and legitimate\n22) Villafafia told OPR that she referred to Oosterban in the email because “he was the head of CEOS and\nbecause I think they were tired of hearing me nag them [to notify the victims].” As previously noted, Villafafia’s\nstatement that victim approval had to be obtained was incorrect. Even when <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span>, the CVRA only requires\nconsultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement. Moreover, Villafafia’s comments concerning the\npre-charge application of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement\nto OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent leters to victims in August 2oo6.\n\n282 Lourie noted that during this period, he had left Florida and was no longer the supervising AUSA in the\noffice, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “historical knouledge” of the case.\ni The AUSA who for a time served as Villafafia’s co-counsel on the Epstein investigation similarly did not\n“knou anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the\ncase. The AUSA stated that he stopped working on the case “months earlier” and that he “didn’t have anything to do\nwith the [NPA] negotiations.”\n2o4 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto .. . instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n2o5\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4529\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004571.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 274 of 349\nCHAPTER THREE\nPART TWO: <span class=\"highlight\">APPLICABLE</span> STANDARDS\nI.

Once charges are filed, the responsible official shall assist the victim\nin contacting the persons or offices responsible for providing the services and relief\n[previously identified].\n\nc. Consultation With a Government Atorney\n\n(l) In General. A victim has the reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the\nGovernment in the case. The victim’s right to confer, houever, shall not be\nconstrued to impair prosecutorial discretion. Federal prosecutors should be\navailable to consult with victims about major case decisions, such as dismissals,\nrelease of the accused pending judicial proceedings (when such release is for\nnoninvestigative purposes), plea negotiations, and pretrial diversion. Because\nvictims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government, and may disclose\nwhatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only\nnonsensitive data and public information. Consultations should comply with the\nprosecutor’s obligations under <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> rules of professional conduct.\nRepresentatives of the Department should take care to inform victims that neither\nthe Department’s advocacy for victims nor any other effort that the Department\nmay make on their behalf constitutes or creates an atorney-client relationship\nbetween such victims and the lawyers for the Government.\nDepartment personnel should not provide legal advice to victims.\n(2) Prosecutor Availability. Prosecutors should be reasonably available to consult\nwith victims regarding significant adversities they may suffer as a result of delays\nin the prosecution of the case and should, at the appropriate time, inform the court\nof the reasonable concerns that have been conveyed to the prosecutor.\n(3) Proposed Plea Agreements. Responsible officials should make reasonable\nefforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views about,\nprospective plea negotiations. In determining what is reasonable, the responsible\nofficial should consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving\nnotice and considering views in the context of the particular case, including, but not\nlimited to, the follouing factors:\n\n(a) The impact on public safety and risks to personal safety.\n\n(b) The number of victims.\n\n(c) Whether time is of the essence in negotiating or entering a proposed plea.\n\n252\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4576\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004583.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 286 of 349\ndid not find evidence shouing that the subjects intended to silence victims or to prevent them from\nhaving input into the USAO’s intent to resolve the federal investigation.\n\nAlthough the contemporaneous records provide some information about victim notification\ndecisions made after the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, the records contain litle about\nthe subjects’ views regarding consultation with victims before the NPA was signed. In a\nSeptember 6, 2oo7 email primarily addressing other topics, as the plea negotiations were beginning\nin earnest and almost three weeks before the NPA was signed, Villafafia raised the topic of victim\nconsultation with Sloman: “The agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their\napproval, which as [CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law. . . .\n[A]nd the [PBPD] Chief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.’4\nSloman forwarded the email to Acosta with a note stating, “fyi.” Villafafia recalled that after she\nsent the email, Sloman told her by telephone, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.”*°° Villafafia also told\nOPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve been advised that . . . pre-\ncharge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Villafafia also recalled a discussion with\nAcosta, Menchel, and Sloman, during which she stated that she would need to get victims’ input\non the terms being proposed to the defense, and she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential.\nYou can’t disclose them.’4°°\n\nNone of the other subjects recalled a specific discussion before the NPA was signed about\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations. Menchel told OPR he believed the USAO was not required to\nconsult with victims during the preliminary “general discussion” phase of setlement negotiations;\nmoreover, he left the USAO before the terms of the NPA were fully developed.\n\nSloman told OPR that he “did not think that we had to consult with victims prior to entering\ninto the NPA” and “we did not have to seek approval from victims to resolve a case.” Sloman\nbelieved the USAO was obligated only to notify victims about resolution of “the cases that we\nhandled, filed cases.” Sloman recalled that because the USAO envisioned a state court resolution\nof the mater, he did not “think that that was a concern of ours at the time to consult with [the\nvictims] prior to entering into... the NPA.”\n\nLourie told OPR that he did not recall any discussions about informing the victims about\nthe terms of the NPA or any instructions to Villafafia that she not discuss the NPA with the victims.\nHe stated that everything the USAO did was “to try and get the best result as possible for the\nvictims. . . . [O]nce you step back and look at the whole forest . . ., you will see that... . [I]f you\nlook at each tree and say, well, you didn’t do this right for the victim, you didn’t tell the victim\nthis and that, you’re missing the big picture.”\nae As noted, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not require consultation with victims\nbecause no criminal charges had been filed. In addition, Villafafia’s reference to victim “approval” was inaccurate\nbecause the CVRA, even when <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span>, requires only “consultation” with victims about prosecutorial decisions.\n‘o5 Villafaia did not recall Sloman explaining the reason for the decision.\n\n4o6 Villafafia also told OPR that she recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations\ncould cause victims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.” Villafafia was\nuncertain of the date of the conversation, but Menchel’s presence requires it to have occurred before August 3, 2oo7.\n259\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4583\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004590.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 293 of 349\nstrongly objected to the government’s plan to notify victims of the state proceedings, which he\ndescribed as “highly inappropriate” and an “intrusion into state affairs, when the identified\nindividuals are not even victims of the crime for which Mr. Epstein is being sentenced.”\n\nThereafter—at a time when the USAO believed Epstein’s plea to be imminent— Villafafia\ndrafted, and Sloman signed, the December 6, 2oo7 leter to Lefkouitz rejecting the defense\narguments regarding notification and reiterating the USAO’s position that the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation be invited to appear at the state plea hearing. The leter took an expansive\nview of the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> statutes by contending that both the CVRA and the VRRA required the\nUSAO to notify the victims of the state proceedings:\n\n[T]hese sections are not limited to proceedings in a federal district\ncourt. Our Non-Prosecution Agreement resolves the federal\ninvestigation by allouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense.\nThe victims identified through the federal investigation should be\nappropriately informed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does\nnot require the U.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal\nobligations.*!®\n\nThe leter also asserted that the VRRA obligated the USAO to provide the victims with\ninformation concerning restitution to which they may be entitled and “the earliest possible” notice\nof the status of the investigation, the filing of charges, and the acceptance of a plea. Along with\nthe leter, Sloman forwarded a revised draft victim notification leter to Lefkouitz for his\ncomments. This draft victim notification leter stated that the federal investigation had been\ncompleted, Epstein would plead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of\nimprisonment at sentencing, and Epstein would compensate victims for monetary damages claims\nbrought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The draft victim notification leter provided specific information\nconcerning the upcoming change of plea hearing and invited the victims to atend or provide a\nwriten statement to the State Atorney’s Office. When Lefkouitz asked Sloman to delay sending\nvictim notifications until after a discussion of their contents, Sloman instructed Villafafia, who was\npreparing leters for transmital to 3o victims, to “Hold the leter.’ During his OPR interview,\nSloman recalled that he had “wanted to push the leter out,” but he “must have had a conversation\nwith somebody” about whether the CVRA applied, and based on that conversation he directed\nVillafafia to hold the leter.\n\nIn his response leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz contended that the government had\nmisinterpreted both the CVRA and VRRA because neither applied to the “public proceeding in\nthis mater [which] will be in state court for the purpose of the entry of a plea on state charges.”\nAl6 Sloman told Lefkouitz the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is simply informing the\nvictims of their rights.” Sloman also addressed the defense atorneys’ objection to advising the victims that they could\ncontact Villafafia or the FBI case agent with questions or concerns by referencing the CVRA, noting, “Again, federal\nlaw requires that victims have the ‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.”\n\n266\nDOJ-OGR-oooo459o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004592.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 295 of 349\nparticular charges and victims at issue. Once the hearing was scheduled, Sloman told Villafafia to\ncontact PBPD Chief Reiter about notifying the victims, and on June 28, 2oo8, she reported back\nto Sloman that Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”*!® Villafafia recalled that she\nsent Reiter a list of the girls identified as victims during the federal investigation, and Reiter said\nhe would “contact as many as he could.” The contemporaneous records do not shou hou many\nor which victims, if any, Reiter contacted, and no victims were present in the courtroom. No victim\nwho provided information to OPR, either in person or through her atorney, recalled receiving\nnotice of the plea hearing from federal or state officials. At the time Epstein pled guilty in state\ncourt, no one in the USAO knew exactly who, if anyone, Reiter or the State Atorney’s Office had\nnotified about the proceeding. Accordingly, Villafafia, who was present in the courtroom for the\nhearing, had no knouledge to whom Belohlavek referred when she told the court that the victims\nwere “in agreement with the terms of this plea.””*!”\n\nOPR considered whether Acosta’s decision to defer to the State Atorney’s Office the\ndecision to notify victims of the scheduled date for Epstein’s plea hearing constituted professional\nmisconduct. OPR could not conclude that the CVRA or VRRA provisions in question, requiring\nnotice of any public proceeding involving the crime against the victim or that the victim is entitled\nto atend, unambiguously required federal prosecutors to notify victims of state court proceedings.\nFurthermore, as discussed previously, OLC had issued guidance stating that the CVRA did not\napply to cases in which no federal charges had been filed.*” Moreover, the section of the VRRA\nrequiring notice of court proceedings that the victim is “entitled to atend” referred specifically to\nproceedings under 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b)(4), which, at the time of the Epstein case, had become\npart of the CVRA (l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(2)).7!\n\nBecause Acosta had no clear or unambiguous duty to inform victims identified in the\nfederal investigation of the state plea hearing, OPR concludes that his decision to defer to the State\nAtorney the decision to notify victims of the state’s plea hearing and the responsibility for doing\nso did not constitute professional misconduct.*””\n\n4l8 Sloman replied, “Good.” In her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make\noral notifications to the victims regarding the upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification\ncould only come from a state investigator, and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n4l9 Plea Hearing Transcript at 42.\n42o) OLC 2oo5 CVRA Informal Guidance; see also United States v. Guevara-Toloso, No. o4-l455, 2oo5 WL\nl2lo982, at *2 (E.D.N.Y.

OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004715.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 Filed o5/25/2l Page 8 of 26\n\nthis phrase is entirely misplaced. That phrase appears in a specific portion of the Second Circuit’s\nopinion, in which the panel rejected the defendants’ atempt to distinguish Abbamonte and Alessi\nby saying that they were only seeking the same protection afforded by the Double Jeopardy Clause,\nwhile Abbamonte and Alessi involved protections greater than the Double Jeopardy Clause.\nAnnabi, 77l F.2d at 672. In rejecting that argument, the Court explained:\n\nThe argument fails for two reasons. First, since appellants were\n\nnever in jeopardy on the charges dismissed in the Eastern District,\n\nthe protection they nou seek under the plea agreement is necessarily\n\nbroader than that accorded by the Double Jeopardy Clause. Second,\n\nto the extent that the appellants rely on a claim that the Clause, if\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span>, would protect them from prosecution on charges\n\nidentical to those dismissed, the short answer is that the pending\n\ncharges, covering conduct extending more than two years beyond\n\nthe date of the period covered by the dismissed charges, are not the\n\nsame as the charges that were dismissed. Even if, as appellants\n\ncontend, the Southern District charges result from the same\n\nconspiratorial agreement that underlay the charges dismissed in the\n\nEastern District, the allegation that the conspiracy extended for an\n\nadditional two years suffices to shou that the new charges are not\n\nidentical to the dismissed charges.\nId. As the foregoing makes clear, the Second Circuit did not in any way qualify the plain-statement\nrule set forth in its opinion. Rather, the Second Circuit addressed the defendant’s efforts to\ndistinguish precedent based on the Double Jeopardy Clause and explained why the Clause did not\npreclude a prosecution in that case. In other words, this language in Annabi was cabined to an\nanalysis under the Double Jeopardy Clause. As discussed in greater detail belou, the Double\nJeopardy Clause does not preclude a prosecution in this case because Maxwell has not previously\nbeen prosecuted for the offenses in the S2 Indictment.\n\nIgnoring the Double Jeopardy language in Annabi, the defendant argues that the phrase\n“identical to the dismissed charges” somehou creates a different rule of interpretation for plea\nagreements, under which the Court must first analyze the similarity between the NPA and the S2\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo47l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004722.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 Filed o5/25/2l Page l5 of 26\nfailure to honor a plea agreement.” United States v. Losada, 674 F.2d l67, l69 (2d Cir. l982).4\nThere, as here, any barrier to prosecution of the defendant arose from the agreement with the\nprosecution, not the Double Jeopardy Clause. And, as described above, the NPA presents no\nbarrier. Accordingly, the defendant’s motion to dismiss Counts Five and Six should be denied.\n\nIl. Counts Five and Six Are Timely\n\nCounts Five and Six are timely charged because the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> limitations period, l8\nU.S.C. § 3283 (2oo3), permits prosecution for offenses “involving the sexual or physical abuse . . .\nof a child” at any time “during the life of the child,” and the victim identified in Counts Five and\nSix of the S2 Indictment remains alive. The crimes alleged in Counts Five and Six plainly involved\nthe sexual abuse of minors, meaning the § 3283 limitations period applies to both charges. See S2\nIndictment 4 9(d) (discussing the sexual abuse of Minor Victim-4).\n\nIn her motion, the defendant argues that § 3283 only applies if the elements of the crime\nof sex trafficking “necessarily entail” the sexual abuse of minors. (Def. Mot. at 2o-2l). In other\nwords, the defendant claims that the “categorical approach” or “essential ingredients” test applies\nhere. The Court has already considered and rejected this argument. (Apr. Op. at 9-l3). As this\nCourt has held, “[t]o the extent that the categorical approach is ever appropriate in other contexts,\nit is inappropriate here.” (Apr. Op. at ll). Instead, with respect to the statute of limitations, the\n* Although the opinions do not say whether the prosecuting office that signed the plea agreement\nwas the same office that later prosecuted the Losadas, the prosecution also does not appear to have\nresisted the plea agreement on that basis. See Cambindo-Valencia, 6o9 F.2d at 638.\n> In her previous motions, the defendant argued that Counts One through Four were untimely,\nclaiming that § 3283 cannot be applied retroactively. The Court rejected this argument. (Apr. Op.\nat l3-l6 (analyzing the applicability of § 3283 to pre-2oo3 conduct under Landgraf v. USI Film\nProducts, 5ll U.S. 244, 28o (l994))). In her current motion, the defendant does not appear to\nassert retroactivity arguments with respect to Counts Five and Six. Nor could she. Because Counts\nFive and Six involve conduct up to and including 2oo4, application of the 2oo3 amendment to\n§ 3283 does not require the Court to engage in a retroactivity analysis.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4722\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004724.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 Filed o5/25/2l Pagel7 of 26\n\nAccordingly, for the reasons set forth in the Government’s previous briefing (Dkt. No. 2o4\nat 23-36), and for the reasons set forth in the Court’s April Opinion (Apr. Op. at 9-l6), the\nprosecution of Counts Five and Six is timely.\nIV. The Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss the S2 Indictment Based on Alleged Improper\n\nPre-Trial Delay Should Be Denied\n\nThe defendant contends that the Court should dismiss the S2 Indictment because the\nGovernment’s delay in bringing the charges violates her due process rights. (Def. Mot. at 22). In\nmaking this motion, the defendant asks the Court to provide such relief for the “same reasons\ndiscussed in her prior motion” (Def. Mot. at 22)—reasons this Court already considered and\nrejected. This Court evaluated the defendant’s speculative and baseless arguments and concluded\nthat the defendant could not meet the “stringent standard” necessary to prevail on a claim that any\nalleged pre-indictment delay violates her due process rights. (Apr. Op. at l7). “To prevail on a\nclaim that pre-indictment delay violates due process, a defendant must shou both that the\nGovernment intentionally delayed bringing charges for an improper purpose and that the delay\nseriously damaged the defendant’s ability defend against the charges.” (Apr. Op. at l7 (citing\nUnited States v. Cornielle, l7l F.3d 748, 75l (2d Cir. l999))).°\n\nAs to the element of actual and substantial prejudice, the Court found that the defendant\ndid “not make the strong shouing of prejudice required to support” her claim. (Apr. Op. at l7).\nThe Court concluded that the defendant “failed to establish actual prejudice from the\nGovernment’s delay in bringing charges,” rejecting the defendant’s “highly speculative”\narguments that the death of certain potential witnesses, failing memories, or lost records prejudiced\n® Moreover, “[w]here an indictment is brought within the statute of limitations, there is a\npresumption that the [defendant] was not prejudiced.” Van Stuyvesant v.

The District\nAtorney’s Office became involved at the request of the Cheltenham Chief\nof Police John Norris.\n\nEveryone involved in this mater cooperated with investigators including the\ncomplainant and Mr. Cosby. The level of cooperation has helped the\ninvestigation proceed smoothly and efficiently. The District Atorney\ncommends all parties for their assistance.\nThe District Atorney has reviewed the statements of the parties involved,\nthose of all witnesses who might have first hand knouledge of the alleged\nincident including family, friends and co-workers of the complainant, and\nprofessional acquaintances and employees of Mr. Cosby. Detectives\nsearched Mr. Cosby’s Cheltenham home for potential evidence.\nInvestigators further provided District Atorney Castor with phone records\nand other items that might have evidentiary value. Lastly, the District\nAtorney reviewed statements from other persons claiming that Mr. Cosby\nbehaved inappropriately with them on prior occasions. Houever, the\ndetectives could find no instance in Mr. Cosby’s past where anyone\ncomplained to law enforcement of conduct, which would constitute a\ncriminal offense.\nAfter reviewing the above and consulting with County and Cheltenham\ndetectives, the District Atorney finds insufficient, credible, and admissible\nevidence exists upon which any charge against Mr. Cosby could be\nsustained beyond a reasonable doubt. In making this finding, the District\nAtorney has analyzed the facts in relation to the elements of any <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span>\noffenses, including whether Mr. Cosby possessed the requisite criminal\nintent. In addition, District Atorney Castor applied the Rules of Evidence\ngoverning whether or not evidence is admissible. Evidence may be\ninadmissible if it is too remote in time to be considered legally relevant or if\nit was illegally obtained pursuant to Pennsylvania law. After this analysis,\nthe District Atorney concludes that a conviction under the circumstances of\nthis case would be unatainable. As such, District Atorney Castor declines\nto authorize the filing of criminal charges in connection with this mater.\nBecause a civil action with a much louer standard for proof is possible, the\nDistrict Atorney renders no opinion concerning the credibility of any party\ninvolved so as to not contribute to the publicity and taint prospective jurors.\nThe District Atorney does not intend to expound publicly on the details of\nhis decision for fear that his opinions and analysis might be given undue\nweight by jurors in any contemplated civil action.

Thereafter, Cosby filed a number of pretrial motions, including a petition for a\nwrit of habeas corpus, a motion to dismiss the charges on due process grounds, and,\nmost pertinent here, a “Motion to Suppress the Contents of his Deposition Testimony and\nAny Evidence Derived therefrom on the Basis that the District Atorney’s Promise not to\nProsecute Him Induced Him to Waive his Fifth Amendment Right Against Self-\nIncrimination.” After holding a hearing on the suppression motion, at which no new\ntestimony was taken, the trial court again concluded that former District Atorney Castor’s\ntestimony was equivocal, credited the testimony of Constand’s atorneys, and found that\nno promise or agreement not to prosecute existed. Having so determined, the court\ndiscerned “no [c]onstitutional barrier to the use of [Cosby’s] civil deposition testimony”\nagainst him at trial, and it denied the suppression motion.'> Later, the Commonwealth\nwould introduce portions of Cosby’s deposition testimony against Cosby, including his\nadmissions to using Qualudes during sexual encounters with women in the past.\n\nOn September 6, 2ol6, the Commonwealth filed a “Motion to Introduce Evidence\nof Other Bad Acts of the Defendant,” which Cosby opposed by writen response. The\nCommonwealth sought to introduce evidence and testimony from other women who\nalleged that Cosby had sexually assaulted them, instances that could not be prosecuted\ndue to the lapse of <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> statutes of limitations.

The court concluded that Tyson’s rationale was <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> to the\ninstant case. The court rejected Cosby’s efforts to distinguish Constand’s allegations\nfrom those dating to the l98os. Cosby emphasized the fact that the relationship between\nCosby and Constand lasted longer than his relationship with any of the prior bad acts\nwitnesses, that Constand was a guest at Cosby’s home on multiple occasions, that Cosby\nand Constand had exchanged gifts, that Cosby had made prior sexual advances touard\nConstand, that the nature of the sexual contact differed among the alleged victims, and\nthat the alleged prior assaults occurred in hotel rooms or at the home of a third party,\nwhile the incident with Constand occurred in Cosby’s home. /d. at 4ol-o2.

Kratsas, 764 A.2d\n2o, 27 (Pa. 2ool) (cleaned up). Due process is a universal concept, permeating all\naspects of the criminal justice system. Like other state actors, prosecutors must act within\nthe boundaries set by our foundational charters. Thus, we discern no cause or reason,\nlet alone any compelling one, to waive the prosecution’s duty to comply with due process\nsimply because the act at issue is an exercise of discretion, e.g., whether or not to charge\na particular suspect with a crime.\n\nThat is not to say that each and every exercise of prosecutorial discretion with\nregard to charging decisions invites a due process challenge. Charging decisions inhere\nwithin the vast discretion afforded to prosecutors and are generally subject to review only\nfor arbitrary abuses. A prosecutor can choose to prosecute, or not. A prosecutor can\nselect the charges to pursue, and omit from a complaint or bill of information those\ncharges that he or she does not believe are warranted or viable on the facts of the case.\nA prosecutor can also condition his or her decision not to prosecute a defendant. For\ninstance, a prosecutor can decide initially not to prosecute, subject to possible receipt or\ndiscovery of new inculpatory evidence. Or, a prosecutor can choose not to prosecute the\ndefendant at the present time, but may inform the defendant that the decision is not final\nand that the prosecutor may change his or her mind within the period prescribed by the\n<span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> statute of limitations. Similarly, there may be barriers to a prosecution, such\nas the unavailability of a witness or evidence, which subsequently may be removed, thus\nenabling a prosecution to proceed. Generally, no due process violation arises from these\nspecies of discretionary decision-making, and a defendant is without recourse to seek the\nenforcement of any assurances under such circumstances.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 59\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4872\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004877.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 65 of 8o\n\nWhen we review the statement in its full context, it is clear that, when D.A. Castor\nannounced that he “will reconsider this decision should the need arise,” the decision to\nwhich he was referring was his decision not to comment publicly “on the details of his\n[charging] decision for fear that his opinions and analysis might be given undue weight\nby jurors in any contemplated civil action.” The entire paragraph addresses the district\natorney’s concern that he might inadvertently taint a potential civil jury pool by making\npublic remarks about the credibility of the likely parties in that highly anticipated case.\nThen-D.A.

The trial court’s\nconclusion is belied by a plain reading of the entire passage.\n\nOur inquiry does not end there. D.A. Castor’s press release, without more, does\nnot necessarily create a due process entitlement. Rather, the due process implications\narise because Cosby detrimentally relied upon the Commonwealth’s decision, which was\nthe district atorney’s ultimate intent in issuing the press release. There was no evidence\nof record indicating that D.A. Castor intended anything other than to induce Cosby’s\nreliance.

Counts five and six are not time-barred\n\nFor most non-capital offenses, the statute of limitations under federal law is five years.\n\nl8 U.S.C. § 3282(a). Congress has enacted longer limitations periods for certain crimes, in\nparticular for “offense[s] involving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnapping” of a minor in l8\nU.S.C. § 3283. Prior to 2oo3, the limitations period in § 3283 lasted until the victim reached the\nage of 25, and then Congress extended the limitations period to the life of the victim with the\nPROTECT Act of 2oo3, Pub. L. No. lo8-2l, ll7 Stat 6o. In 2oo6, Congress enacted l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3299, which eliminated the statute of limitations for the sex trafficking of minors in violation\nof l8 U.S.C. § l59l and for some other sex crimes. See l8 U.S.C. § 3299 (“Notwithstanding\nany other law, an indictment may be found or an information instituted at any time without\nlimitation for any offense under . . . section l59l.”).\n\nIn her previous motion, Maxwell argued that the Mann Act charges against her in the\nindictment were time-barred on the grounds that the extended limitations period § 3283 was not\n<span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span>. The Court denied that motion in its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order. Maxwell, 2o2l\nWL l5l8675, at *5. Maxwell nou argues that the new charges the Government has brought\nagainst her in the S2 indictment, Sex Trafficking Conspiracy (l8 U.S.C. § 37l) and Sex\nTrafficking (l8 U.S.C. § l59l), are time-barred as well because § 3283 does not apply to those\noffenses either. She renews her contention from her previous motion that the limitations period\nin § 3283 only applies to offenses which “necessarily entail” the sexual abuse of a minor and\nargues that a violation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l does not. Thus, according to Maxwell’s reasoning,\nthe general five-year statute of limitations period in l8 U.S.C. § 3282(a) applies to the sex\ntrafficking counts and, because the alleged conduct occurred from 2ool to 2oo4, the Government\nis nou time-barred for prosecuting her for these offenses.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo498l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004983.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3l7 Filed o8/l3/2l Page9ofl4\n<span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> limitations period has not yet run — offenses that by definition are those for which\n“other law[s]” of limitation would otherwise bar prosecution. See l8 U.S.C. § 3299. Moreover,\nas the Court also explained, not only does this kind of language unambiguously require\nretroactivity, it also does not result in any impermissible retroactive effects so long as it does not\nrevive time-barred claims. Maxwell, 2o2l WL l5l8675, at *7-8. The Court therefore joins\nmultiple other district courts in concluding that, like § 3283, § 3299 applies retroactively to\noffenses for which the previous limitations period has not yet run. See United States v. Nader,\n425 F. Supp. 3d 6l9, 629 (E.D. Va. 2ol9); United States v. Pierre-Louis, No. l6 CR 54l (CM),\n2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2ol8); United States v. Vickers, No. l3-CR-l28-A,\n2ol4 WL l838255, at *8 (W.D.N.Y. May 8, 2ol4); United States v. Sensi, No. 3:o8-CR-253\n(WWE), 2olo WL 235l484, at *3 (D. Conn. June 7, 2olo).\n\nThe sex trafficking charges are therefore not time-barred. Regardless of whether it was\nthe general five-year limitations period in § 3282(a) or the extended limitations period for sexual\nabuse of minors in § 3283 that was <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> to Maxwell’s alleged conduct prior to the\nenactment of § 3299 in 2oo6, neither had expired by that date. Thus, as Maxwell does not\ncontest, § 3299 applies retroactively to the sex trafficking offenses in the indictment and the\nGovernment is permited to bring those charges without time limitation.\n\nIV. Maxwell’s motion to dismiss count five and either count one or count three as\nmultiplicitous is premature\n\nIn her previous motions, Maxwell argued that either count one or count three of the Sl\nindictment, the Mann Act conspiracy charges, must be dismissed because the counts are\nmultiplicitous. In the Court’s April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order, the Court joined many other\ncourts in this Circuit holding that pretrial motions of this sort are premature in light of United\nStates v. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 35o, 355 (2d Cir. 2oo6), and the Court dismissed without\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4983\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004984.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3l7 Filed o8/l3/2l Pagelooofl4\nprejudice. Maxwell, 2o2l WL l5l8675, at *l4. In the instant motion, Maxwell similarly argues\nthat count five of the S2 indictment, the sex trafficking conspiracy charge, is duplicative of either\ncounts one or three. Maxwell’s motion is denied without prejudice for the reasons stated in the\nCourt’s April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order.\n\nV. The Government’s delay in bringing the charges did not violate due process\n\nMaxwell also renews her motion to dismiss the S2 indictment based on alleged improper\npretrial delay. In its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order, the Court denied Maxwell’s motion,\nconcluding that her efforts to shou actual and substantial prejudice fell far short of the “stringent\nstandard” necessary to prevail on such a claim. Maxwell, 2o2l WL l5l8675, at *9. Maxwell’s\nmotion to dismiss the S2 on these grounds fails for the same reasons. As before, nothing in the\nrecord indicates that the Government’s delay in bringing these charges was designed to thwart\nMaxwell’s ability to prepare a defense. Houever, it is sufficient to conclude that Maxwell does\nnot make the strong shouing of prejudice required to support this sort of claim. Maxwell\ncontends that the Government’s delay in bringing charges has prejudiced her interests because\npotential witnesses have died, others have forgoten, and records have been lost or destroyed. It\nis highly speculative that any of these factors would make a substantial difference in her case.\n\nThe Court thus again concludes for the reasons stated in the April l6, 2o2l Opinion &\nOrder, that Maxwell has failed to establish actual prejudice from the Government’s delay in\nbringing charges. She may renew her motion if the factual record at trial shous otherwise. On\nthe present record, neither the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> statute of limitations nor due process bars the charges\nhere.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4984\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005051.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 336 Filed o9/o7/2l Page9oflo\nthat the items turn out to have been altered or do not exist the absence of this evidence is also\nrelevant and admissible at trial as exculpatory evidence.\n\nIV. Request\n\nMs. Maxwell filed various pretrial motions which are currently pending before the Court.\nMs. Maxwell anticipates that one or more of her pending motions will require the presentation of\nevidence, that certain evidence central to the accusations in this mater will need to be examined\nin advance of trial as part of the investigation of her defense, and that the requested evidence is\nadmissible at trial. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell seeks production of these materials in advance of\ntrial. She makes this motion ex parte for the “strong policy reasons in favor of an ex parte”\nprocess and because she is providing detail regarding her investigative and trial strategy to\ndemonstrate compliance with the specificity, relevance, and admissibility requirements of a Rule\nl7(c) subpoena. United States v.

THE <span class=\"highlight\">APPLICABLE</span> LAW\n\nA prospective juror may be excused for cause based on many forms of bias or partiality.\n\nAs the Second Circuit has explained, juror partiality can be actual, implied, or inferred:\n\nActual bias is “bias in fact,” generally evidenced by “express proof,”\n\nsuch as a juror’s admission to “a state of mind prejudicial to a party’s\n\ninterest.” Implied bias is “bias conclusively presumed as a mater of\n\nlaw” from circumstances in which an average person in the position\n\nof the prospective juror would be prejudiced. Inferred bias exists\n\n“when a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk of partiality\n\nsufficiently significant to warrant granting the trial judge discretion\n\nto excuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make mandatory\n\na presumption of bias.”\nUnited States v. Quinones, 5ll F.3d 289, 3ol (2d Cir. 2oo7) (quoting United States v. Haynes,\n398 F.2d 98o, 984 (2d Cir. l968) and United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 45 (2d Cir. l997)).\nAll types of bias can properly form the basis to excuse a juror for cause. See id. Thus, the jury\nselection process should screen for each type. See id.\n\nVoir dire plays an important role in ensuring that juries are fair and impartial by allouing\nthe Court and parties to uncover unfair actual, implied, or inferred bias. It serves to protect the\nConstitutional right of a fair trial “by exposing possible biases, both knoun and unknoun, on the\npart of potential jurors.” United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6). For these\nreasons, district courts routinely use their broad discretion to issue writen jury questionnaires in\nconducting voir dire, particularly in cases involving extensive pretrial publicity or hot-buton\nissues. See, e.g., Skilling v. United States, l3o S. Ct. 2896, 29l9 (2olo) (approving district\ncourt’s use of questionnaire in trial of former Enron executive, Jeffrey Skilling); United States v.\nRobert Sylvester Kelly, l9 Cr. 286 (AMD) (EDNY) (“R. Kelly case”); United States v. Elizabeth\nHolmes, l8 Cr. 258 (EJD) (NDCA) (“Theranos case”); United States v. Keith Rainier, l8 Cr. 2o4\n(NGG) (EDNY) (“Nexium case”).\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005271.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 362 Filed lo/2o/2l Page3of4\nPost, No. 92-3ol, l992 WL 233354, at *2 (D.D.C. July 23, l992); Copley Press, Inc. v. Superior\nCourt, 228 Cal. App. 3d 77, 89 (l99l).\n\nThe presumption of openness that ataches to voir dire—including juror questionnaires—\n“may be overcome only by an overriding interest based on findings that closure is essential to\npreserve higher values and is narrouly tailored to serve that interest.’” Shkreli, 26o F. Supp. 3d at\n26o (quoting Press—Enter. Co., 464 U.S. at 5lo). “Where the overriding interest to be protected\nis the defendant’s right to a fair trial, the court must make specific findings that ‘there is a\nsubstantial probability that the defendant’s right to a fair trial will be prejudiced by publicity that\nclosure would prevent and, second, reasonable alternatives to closure cannot adequately protect\nthe defendant’s fair trial rights.’” /d.

See, e.g., United States v. Figueroa, 548 F.3d 222, 227 (2d Cir. 2oo8).\nThis right, houever, is not absolute. A defendant’s rights under the Confrontation Clause must\nyield to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process. See, e.g., id. For\ninstance, trial courts have “wide latitude . . . to impose reasonable limits ... on. . . cross-\nexamination based on concerns about, among other things, harassment, prejudice, . . . or the\nwitness’s safety.” United States v. Al Farekh, 8lo F.

The Minor Victims’ Prior Consistent Statements Are Admissible for Their\nTruth If the Defense Challenges Their Credibility\n\nIf the defendant claims that the Minor Victims’ testimony has been recently fabricated or\nthat the Minor Victims have motives to lie, or if the defense otherwise atacks the credibility of\nthe Minor Victims on another ground, the Government will seek to introduce the Minor Victims’\nprior consistent statements to witnesses about their experiences with the defendant and Epstein.\n\nA. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\n\nUnder Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, a prior statement is not\nhearsay if the declarant testifies and is subject to cross examination about the statement, the\nstatement is consistent with the declarant’s testimony, and the statement is offered either ‘“(i) to\nrebut an express or implied charge that the declarant recently fabricated it or acted from a recent\nimproper influence or motive in so testifying; or (il) to rehabilitate the declarant’s credibility as a\nwitness when atacked on another ground.” Notably, “the prior consistent statement need not be\nproffered through the testimony of the declarant but may be proffered through any witness who\nhas firsthand knouledge of the statement.” United States v. Caracappa, 6l4 F.3d 3o, 39 (2d Cir.\n2olo) (affirming admission of prior consistent statements to rebut defense insinuation that\nwitness had testified from improper motive).\n\nPrior to 2ol4, a witness’s prior consistent statement was only permited to rebut a charge\nof recent fabrication that postdated the prior consistent statement. See Tome v. United States,\n5l3 U.S. l5o, l56 (l995).

The Court Should Not Permit the Defense to Elicit Evidence About Charging\n\nDecisions or Possible Reasons for Them\n\nl. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 4o2 provides that “[i]rrelevant evidence is not admissible.”\nAccordingly, any evidence that does not bear on the defendant’s guilt or innocence of the\ncharges in the indictment should be excluded as irrelevant. Rule 4o3 further states that the Court\nmay “exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of\none or more of the follouing: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue\ndelay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.” Accordingly, any evidence\nthat is likely to distract the jury from the issue of guilt or innocence should be excluded under\nRule 4o3. See, e.g., United States v. Rosado, 728 F.2d 89, 93 (2d Cir. l984) (criticizing\nadmission of evidence about the propriety of a prosecution “for turning the trial away from a\ndetermination of whether the elements of the offense charged had been proved beyond a\nreasonable doubt into a wide-ranging inquiry into maters far beyond the scope of legitimate\nissues in a criminal trial’).\n\nEvidence about charging decisions made by law enforcement officials is rarely\nadmissible because such evidence typically consists of hearsay, is not relevant, and is likely to\nconfuse and mislead the jury. As such, courts in this Circuit have repeatedly precluded evidence\nof charging decisions for one or more of these reasons. See, e.g., United States v. Borrero, No.\nl3 Cr. 58 (KBF), 2ol3 WL 6o2o773, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. l, 2ol3) (precluding cross\nexamination regarding a government charging decision in part because “the limited amount of\nprobative value that the . . . charging decisions add is substantially outweighed by the risk of\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo54l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005423.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 3o of 54\nhearsay.

(charging decisions proper subjects for cross-examination\nonly “if otherwise admissible”); Hill, 2ol4 WL l988l3, at *l-2 (precluding cross examination of\nagent regarding district atorney’s charging decision as inadmissible hearsay).\n\nThe Government’s prior charging decisions and the bases for them are irrelevant,\nhearsay, and disruptive to the trial. They should not be admited.\n\nB. The Court Should Preclude Evidence or Argument About the Length of And\n\nInvestigative Steps Taken During Current or Prior Investigations\n\nFor similar reasons, the defense should be precluded from offering evidence or arguing to\nthe jury about the investigative steps taken during the Florida Investigations or this Office’s\ninvestigation, including the duration of those investigations.\n\nl. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\n\nIt is setled law that the jury should “base its decision on the evidence or lack of evidence\nthat had been presented at trial.” United States v. Saldarriaga, 2o4 F.3d 5o, 52 (2d Cir. 2ooo)\n(per curiam). The Government’s “failure to utilize some particular technique or techniques does\nnot tend to shou that a defendant is not guilty of the crime with which he has been charged.” Jd.\nat 53; see, e.g., United States v. Ngono, 8ol F. App’x l9, 24 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (summary order)\n(“We have held that a district court does not commit error in instructing the jury that the\nGovernment has no legal obligation to use any particular investigative technique in preparing its\ncase.”). While a defendant “may comment on the failure of proof in the record, such as the\nabsence of forensic evidence in the form of voice, handwriting, or fingerprint analysis,” such\ncomment becomes improper when it encompasses the further argument that “the government had\nfailed to undertake to procure such evidence.” United States v.

See United States v. Flores, 945 F.3d 687,\n7o5-o6 (2d. Cir. 2ol9) (amendment \"extend/s] substantive effect to consistent statements that\nrebut other atacks on a witness — such as the charges of inconsistency or faulty memory\")\n(emphasis in original). Thus, consistent with Pierre and other pre-2ol4 cases, prior consistent\nstatements may be admissible to rehabilitate a witness or to explain a faulty memory, and any\nsuch evidence will nou be admited substantively, but the limits on those prior methods of\nadmiting prior consistent statements for rehabilitation remain <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> post-2ol4.\n\nB. Substantial Limits Remain on Admissibility of Prior Consistent Statements\n\nThe question at trial will be which of the supposedly prior consistent statements are\nadmissible and for what purpose. On that question, the government is silent. See Mot. at l9\n(government \"intends to call a number of witnesses to introduce certain of the Minor Victims'\nprior consistent statements to witnesses about their experiences with the defendant and Epstein\")\n(emphasis added). By not specifying in their Motion which statements they seek to introduce or\nthe specific purposes for which they will move for admission, the government has deprived the\ndefense of an opportunity to challenge the statements' admissibility or for the Court to rule on the\nadmissibility pre-trial. Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B)'s amendment in 2ol4 did not alter the landscape so\nmuch that any atack on the accusers’ credibility will allou any prior consistent statement.\nImportant limits remain on the admissibility of prior consistent statements.\n\nIf the government moves to admit particular statements to rebut a charge of recent\nfabrication or improper motive under Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B)(i), as the Motion suggests they will, the\nevidentiary hurdles established by Tome v. United States, 5l3 U.S. l5o, l56 (l995), still apply.\nIn particular, the government must shou proof that the motive for fabrication or improper\npurpose arose after the purported statement.

Evidence and Argument About the NPA, Prior Charging Decisions, and the\nDeath of Jeffrey Epstein Is Admissible to Challenge the Thoroughness and\nGood Faith of the New York Investigation\nl. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\nThe Supreme Court has recognized that it is entirely proper for the defense to explore and\nchallenge “the thoroughness and even the good faith of the [government’s] investigation.” Kyles\nv. Whitley, 5l4 U.S. 4l9, 445 (l995). For example, the defense may elicit evidence and argue\nthat the government’s disregard for inconsistencies in the evidence shous a willingness to accept\nallegations against the defendant without carefully and critically evaluating their veracity or\nseeking other corroborating evidence, which calls into question the integrity of the investigation.\nId. at 445, 448 (the police’s acceptance of main witness’ statements, which were “replete with\ninconsistencies,” revealed a “remarkably uncritical atitude” on the part of the police which\n“undermine[d] the ... integrity of the investigation”). Similarly, the defense may atack the\ngovernment’s investigation for its poor quality and lack of thoroughness, including its failure to\ncorroborate key witness testimony. See Bouen v. Maynard, 799 F.2d 593, 6l3 (lo\" Cir. l986).\nFor all of these reasons and others, the defense may “atack[] the reliability of the investigation”\nand even “the decision to charge the defendant.” Kyles, 5l4 U.S. at 446; see also id. (citing\nBouen, 799 F.2d at 6l3 (“A common trial tactic of defense lawyers is to discredit the caliber of\nthe investigation or the decision to charge the defendant[.]”) and Lindsey v. King, 769 F.2d lo34,\nlo42 (Sth Cir. l985) (exculpatory evidence “carried within it the potential ... for the ...\ndiscrediting ... of the police methods employed in assembling the case”’)).\n2.

Evidence and Argument About the Fact that Ms. Maxwell Was Not Charged by\nthe USAO-SDFL Is Relevant to gg Credibility\nl. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\n\nThe Second Circuit has rejected the position that evidence of government charging\ndecisions is never admissible by a criminal defendant. United States v. White, 692 F.3d 235, 246\n(2d Cir. 2ol2) (“We hold ... that the government’s charging decisions may be proper subjects for\ncross-examination and argument if otherwise admissible.”). “Such an all or nothing approach\nundermines the longstanding principle that ‘the Constitution guarantees criminal defendants a\nmeaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.’” /d. (quoting Crane v. Kentucky, 476\nU.S. 683, 69o (l986) (internal quotation marks omited)). This is particularly true when the\nevidence “is central to the defendant’s claim of innocence.” /d. (categorical exclusion of\ngovernment charging decisions “infringe[s] upon a weighty interest of the accused” and threatens\n“the right of the accused to require the prosecution’s case to survive the crucible of meaningful\nadversarial testing” (internal citations omited)).\n\nIn determining the admissibility of such evidence, a court must evaluate its “relevance\nand probative value.” Jd. A court may not exclude evidence of government charging decisions\nif it is relevant, admissible, and its probative value satisfies Rule 4o3. /d. at 246-48. The\nstandard for relevance is “very lou.” Jd. (quoting United States v. Al-Moayad, 545 F.3d l39,\n\nl76 (2d Cir. 2oo8)). Evidence is relevant when “it has any tendency to make a fact more or less\nprobable than it would be without the evidence, and the fact is of consequence in determining the\naction.” Fed. R. Evid. 4ol. Moreover, Rule 4o3 “favors admissibility.” White, 692 F.3d at 247.\n36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5499\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005500.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 45 of 69\n“[E]vidence is only excluded when its probative value is substantially outweighed by the\nprejudice of jury confusion.” Jd. (emphasis in original).”*\n\n2. Discussion\n\nAfter a roughly two-year investigation during which the Palm Beach FBI interviewed\n\ndozens of alleged victims of Epstein—none of whom implicated Ms. Maxwell, including\n\na: USAO-SDFL did not charge Ms. Maxwell. Instead, the USAO-SDFL\ncharged Epstein yy x. whom i 2c accused of facilitating Epstein’s\nalleged sex trafficking. The fact tha a: implicated J and only later\nimplicated Ms. Maxwell is directly relevant to the credibility of gy and the\ngovernment’s acceptance of her later testimony against Ms. Maxwell in 2o2o, which forms the\nbasis of the sex trafficking offenses charged in Counts Five and Six of the 82 Indictment. See\nUnited States v. Borrero, No. l3 Cr. 58 (KBF), 2ol3 WL 6o2o773, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. l,\n2ol3) (government’s decision to charge two different people for the same crime on two different\noccasions based on the testimony of the same cooperating witness is relevant “to the witness’s\ncredibility” and “the government’s view of the [witness’s] credibility”).\n\nCounts Five and Six of the S2 Indictment charge Ms. Maxwell with conspiracy to\ncommit sex trafficking and a substantive sex trafficking offense for allegedly recruiting or\nobtaining a engage in commercial sex acts with Epstein. See S2 Ind. (Dkt.\nl87) 4] 22-27. But in her first and only interview with the Palm Beach FBI on August 7, 2oo7,\n4 The government relegates its discussion of White to a footnote in its <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law section, even\nthough it is the controlling Second Circuit precedent on this issue. See Gov’t Mot.at 23 n.8. Instead, the\ngovernment cites several cases that were decided before White rejected the categorical approach to\nprecluding evidence of prior charging decisions. See id. at 22-23 (citing United States v. Boyle, No. o8\nCr. 523 (CM), 2oo9 WL 5l78525 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, 2oo9); United States v. Rodriguez, 582 F. Supp. 2d\n486 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo8); and United States v. Carneglia, No. o8 Cr. 76 (JBW), 2oo9 WL l85725 (E.D.N.Y.\nJan. 27, 2oo9). The Court should give these cases litle or no weight.\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo55oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005517.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 62 of 69\nVIII. THE GOVERNMENT’S MOTION TO LIMIT THE INTRODUCTION OF MS.\n\nMAXWELL’S STATEMENTS IS PREMATURE AND SHOULD BE DENIED AT\n\nTHIS TIME\n\nHearsay is a statement that: (l) the declarant does not make while testifying at the current\ntrial or hearing; and (2) a party offers in evidence to prove the truth of the mater asserted in the\nstatement. Fed. R. Evid. 8ol. Hearsay is not admissible unless alloued by a federal statute; the\nFederal Rules of Evidence or other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court. Fed. R. Evid. 8o2.\n“The hearsay rule is designed to prevent the admission of unreliable hearsay but to permit\nthrough its many exceptions the admission of reliable hearsay.” Ferrier v. Duckworth, 9o2 F.2d\n545, 547 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 988 (l99o).\n\nCounsel for Ms. Maxwell understand the Federal Rules of Evidence and intend to follou\nthem. Notably, there are dozens of exceptions to the hearsay exclusionary rule, many of which\ncould be <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> at any trial in this case, for example, those contained in Fed. R. Evid. 8o3(l)\nthrough 8o3(23). Ms. Maxwell has not moved in /imine to admit any hearsay statement, and the\ngovernment does not identify any statement made by Ms. Maxwell that it believes will be at\nissue in this trial. Basically, the government is asking the Court to enter an order directing the\nparties to follou the Rules of Evidence.\n\nThe failure of the government to identify any statement or circumstance where a\nstatement might be offered makes it impossible for the Court to rule on the admissibility of this\nunknoun evidence. As noted by the court in Velez v. Novartis Pharms. Corp., No. o4 CIV. 9l94\nCM, 2olo WL llo43o8l, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 25, 2olo), the “‘motion to exclude hearsay’... is\nyet another example of the improper use of in /imine motions. . . .” Denying the motion, the\ncourt directed the follouing solution: “If a witness is asked for hearsay testimony, an atorney...\nshould stand up and object, and the Court will rule.” Jd.\n\n54\nDOJ-OGR-oooo55l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005556.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 Filed lo/29/2l Page 2 of 4o\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nI.

That misses the point entirely. The Court must decide whether to protect the\nprivacy of four victims who will testify in a criminal trial, for the first time in their lives, about the\npainful details of the sexual abuse they were subjected to as children. The answer to that question\nis emphatically yes.\n\nThe defense has failed to articulate any particularized need to publicize the full names of\nthe Minor Victims. Nor could they, since the full names are knoun to the defense and the Court,\nand will be knoun to the jurors in this case. And the Government’s narrouly tailored proposal\nbalances the public interest in access to information with the Minor Victims’ right to privacy and\ndignity. The Court should grant the motion.\n\nA. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\n\nAs the Government explained in its motions (Gov’t Mot. at 4-9), if the Government\nprovides a reason to “limit disclosure of identifying information in open court,” the defendant must\n“demonstrate a ‘particularized need’ for disclosure . .. which the court weighs against the risks to\nthe witness.” United States v. Marcus, No. o5 Cr. 457 (ARR), 2oo7 WL 33o388, at *l (E.D.N.Y.\nJan. 3l, 2oo7) (citing United States v.

Supp. 3d 568, 572-73 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol4) (permiting an undercover law\nenforcement officer to testify under a pseudonym, after balancing the relevant interests); cf’ United\nStates v. Cavallaro, 553 F.2d 3oo, 3o4 (2d Cir. l977) (“[W]here the government voices a\nlegitimate concern for a witness’ safety, the trial court must balance the potential danger to the\nwitness against the need of the defense for the information.”).\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5559\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005576.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 22 of 4o\n\nThe Government is seeking an order issued in many other cases to protect the privacy and\ndignity of Minor Victims who will take the stand and testify about being sexually abused. The\ndefense has failed to carry its burden of identifying any right of the defendant that is burdened by\nsuch an order. The Court should grant the motion.\n\nI. The Court Should Resolve Litigation Related to Prior Consistent Statements at\nthe Appropriate Time\n\nThe Government has moved in /imine to admit prior consistent statements of its witnesses\npursuant to Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B) of the Federal Rules of Evidence. (See Gov’t Mot. Section II). The\nGovernment briefed this issue in advance in order to notify the Court that the Government intends\nto offer evidence of prior consistent statements, and to provide briefing on the relevant law.\nBecause the Government cannot fully anticipate the defense’s opening arguments or lines of cross-\nexamination regarding the credibility of witnesses it will call at trial, and the defense has not\nelaborated on them in its brief, the Government cannot identify prior consistent statements it will\noffer in response. Accordingly, the Government does not seek a decision on prior consistent\nstatements at this time.\n\nIn their brief, the defense recites the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> law, largely in agreement with the\nGovernment’s view. The Government notes two points with respect to that discussion. First, it is\nplainly proper to offer prior consistent statements to rebut a purported inconsistency between the\nwitness’s trial testimony and an earlier statement. See United States v. Purcell, 967 F.3d l59, l96-\n97 (2d Cir. 2o2o). Second, it is also plainly proper for the Government to begin offering prior\nconsistent statements if the defense atacks witness credibility in its opening statement, and the\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5576\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005673.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 387 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page9of2l\nFor the reasons stated belou, the Court should not admit evidence related to Accuser-3 at\ntrial as evidence of the charged conspiracies or as “other act” evidence under Rule 4o4(b). In the\nalternative, the Court should preclude the government and Accuser-3 from referring to Accuser-3\nas a “minor” or asserting that Accuser-3 was a “minor” at the time of the alleged sex acts. The\nCourt should also preclude the government and Accuser-3 from representing that Epstein\n“sexually abused” her and give the jury an appropriate limiting instruction that the alleged\nconduct was lawful and that the sexual activity cannot be considered “illegal” or “criminal” or\n“unlawful” for the purposes of the crimes charged in the indictment.”\nARGUMENT\nl. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\nRule 4o4(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence governs the admissibility of evidence of\n\n“crimes, wrongs, or acts” other than those charged in the indictment. United States v. Curley,\n639 F.3d 5o, 56 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)). The rule provides, in relevant\npart:\n\n(l) Prohibited Uses. Evidence of any other crime, wrong, or act is\n\nnot admissible to prove a person’s character in order to shou that on\n\na particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the\n\ncharacter.\n\n(2) Permited Uses. This evidence may be admissible for another\n\npurpose, such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation,\n\nplan, knouledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.\nFed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)(l)-(2). For other act evidence to be admissible under Rule 4o4(b), (l) it\nmust be offered for a proper purpose, (2) it must be relevant to a disputed issue, and (3) the\nprobative value of the evidence cannot be substantially outweighed by its potential for unfair\n> For the same reasons, Ms. Maxwell also renews her motion to strike the allegations related to Accuser-3 from the\nS2 Indictment.\n\nS\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5673\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005695.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 388 Filed lo/29/2l Page8ofl4\nMaxwell did not leave the country, or make plans to leave the country, at any point in the year\nthat elapsed between Epstein’s arrest and her oun arrest. Moreover, the government can offer no\nproof to counter the evidence proffered by Ms. Maxwell in her bail submission and instead relies\non its vague and unsubstantiated “belief” that these actions reveal Ms. Maxwell’s intent to evade\nlaw enforcement. See l2/l8/2o2o Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def’s Renewed Mot. for Release (Dkt.\nloo) at 2l (“[T]here is still reason to believe that the defendant was hiding not just from the\npress, but also from law enforcement.”). Any evidence or argument regarding Ms. Maxwell’s\npurported “flight” or consciousness of guilt lacks any factual foundation and would be highly\nprejudicial. It should therefore be excluded.4\n\nARGUMENT\nl. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\n“TT]t is widely acknouledged that evidence of flight or related conduct is ‘only\nmarginally probative as to the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence.’” United States v. Myers, 55o\nF.2d lo36, lo49 (5 Cir. l977) (quoting United States v. Robinson, 475 F.2d 376, 384 (D.C. Cir.\nl973)). While flight can, in some circumstances, evidence consciousness of guilt, “a satisfactory\nfactual predicate must exist from which the jury can infer consciousness of guilt from flight”\nbefore such evidence may properly be admited. A/-Sadawi, 432 F.3d at 424 (citations omited).\n“Since flight evidence can be pouerful, the requirement of a sufficient factual predicate ‘ensures\nthat the evidence is probative in a legal sense and protects the defendant against the possibility of\nthe jury drawing unsupported inferences from otherwise innocuous behavior.’” /d. (quoting\nUnited States v. Amuso, 2l F.3d l25l, l26o (2d Cir. l994)).\n4 Tn its Opinion and Order denying Ms. Maxwell’s second bail application, the Court did not resolve whether Ms.\nMaxwell’s conduct after the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein was designed to protect herself from the press or evade law\nenforcement. See l2/28/2o2o Op. and Order (Dkt. lo6) at l9. We submit that it was clearly the former. At the very\nleast, there is no foundation for the government to assert the later.\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5695\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005732.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 39l Filed lo/29/2l Page7oflil\nthe package did not match the item. Simply stated, the evidence collection and retention in this\nmater is an unreliable mess.\n\nA. Message Pads\n\nThe Government contends that various message pads were seized from different locations\nby the Palm Beach Police Department and appears to intend to offer hundreds of the messages as\nevidence at trial. See, e.g., Government Exhibits l through 4-K. Many of the alleged messages\nare undated, un-signed, contain various hearsay statements that do not appear to be relevant to\nthis case, are outside the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> time frame alleged in the indictment.\n\nB. “CPU’s,” “Zip CD’s,” “CD’s,” and “Flash Cards”\n\nThe search warrant inventory identifies numerous electronic storage devices as having\nbeen seized. Houever, no actual inventory of the alleged contents of these drives appears to have\nbeen prepared by anyone in the Palm Beach Police Department. The items were not identified by\nhard drive name or number or photo. Accordingly, there exists no way for anyone to accurately\nidentify what content may have been on any particular device and hou that device may or may\nnot relate to any issue in this case.\n\nC.

As the notice also explained, Dr. Rocchio has not evaluated\nany of the victims in this case, and the Government does not currently intend to offer Dr. Rocchio’s\ntestimony regarding any specific victim. (See id.).\n\nThere is nothing controversial about this testimony. It is well supported by established\nscientific principles, and it is the kind of testimony frequently admited in cases involving sexual\nabuse. This Court should do the same.\n\nA. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\n\nDistrict courts have a “gatekeeper function” in analyzing the admissibility of expert\ntestimony. Phelps v. CBS Corp., No. l7 Civ. 836l (AJN), 2o2o WL 7o28954, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.\nNov. 3o, 2o2o) (quoting Restivo v. Hessemann, 846 F.3d 547, 575 (2d Cir. 2ol7)). Although\nthe proponent of the evidence carries a burden of proof to establish its admissibility by a\npreponderance of the evidence, see, e.g., United States v. Jones, 965 F.3d l49, l6l (2d Cir.\n2o2o), courts apply a “presumption of admissibility of evidence.” Felix v. City of New York,\nNo. l6 Civ. 5845 (AJN), 2o2o WL 6o48l53, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l3, 2o2o) (quoting Borawick\nv. Shay, 68 F.3d 597, 6lo (2d Cir. l995)). Accordingly, the relevant rule of evidence, Rule 7o2,\nreflects “the ‘liberal thrust’ of the Federal Rules and their ‘general approach of relaxing the\ntraditional barriers to ‘opinion’ testimony.’” Daubert v. Merrell Dou Pharms., Inc., 5o9 U.S.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5789\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005800.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Pagel7 of 84\npatients are telling the truth.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 6). The defendant claims that this “fatally\nundermines the reliability of her opinion” because her conclusion has “no knoun or identified rate\nof error. . . nor is there a reliable method or a series of factors guiding Rocchio’s conclusion as to\nwhether an individual victim is fabricating her abuse.” (/d. (alterations and quotation marks\nomited)). Clinical psychologists are not so credulous. As part of Dr. Rocchio’s work as a\npracticing clinician, she examines consistencies and inconsistencies in the information provided\nby patients and assesses patient self-reporting in the context of literature and knouledge that she\nhas developed in her years of practice. As the Government’s expert notice makes clear, Dr.\nRocchio has treated hundreds and hundreds of patients in her decades of experience, and her\nopinions are based in part on the significant paterns she has observed among the patients she has\ntreated. The Court should reject the defendant’s speculative claim that Dr. Rocchio has been\nmisled by hundreds of patients who sought professional treatment for traumatic events that did not\noccur.\n\nIn any event, the defendant’s argument about error rates misunderstands the nature of a\nDaubert inquiry. An error rate is but one of the Daubert factors that may or may not be <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span>\nin every case. See Romano, 794 F.3d at 33o. And in cases such as this, where a social science\nexpert is testifying based on qualitative methodology, that factor is inapplicable. See Torres, 2o2l\nWL l9475o3, at *6n.8. As the Second Circuit has explained, “Peer review, publication, potential\nerror rate, etc... . are not <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> to this kind of testimony, whose reliability depends heavily\non the knouledge and experience of the expert, rather than the methodology or theory behind it.

Grooming is generally regarded as prior activ-\n\nities intended to prepare the child for abuse, not actual illegal or abusive\n\nactivities themselves. Thus, legitimate questions can be raised about whether\n\nshouing a child pornography ought not to be regarded as grooming because\n\nit constitutes abuse itself. Clarifying a definition of grooming can thus make\n\nthese laws <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> to many more behaviors that are used by offenders\n\nintending to sexually abuse children.\n\nIt is important to note that clarifying key constructs is a difficult yet\nimportant process. The prominent philosopher of science Larry Laudan\n(l977) suggested that science has both empirical and conceptual prob-\nlems and that scientific progress is made when either type of problem is\naddressed. Conceptual analysis is particularly difficult as it is traditionally\nnot included as a part of the research method in the social sciences and\nalso because it involves the inherent complexity of language (O’Donohue,\n2ol3). Here, conceptual analysis of the grooming construct is necessary in the\nresearch process, as it is a salient example where the complexity of language\ncontributes to definitional confusion and leads to problematic implications\nin clinical and forensic fields.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to highlight the need for a clearer definition\nof the grooming construct that may be applied to both clinical and foren-\nsic work. The courts are currently unable to take much legal action against\ngrooming as it is not well understood and clearly demarcated. Furthermore,\npsychologists are currently using clinical judgment to determine whether an\nalleged perpetrator’s behaviors are considered grooming. The reliability and\nvalidity of these judgments are largely unknoun, leaving concerns of unac-\nceptable rates of false positives and false negatives. An additional aim is to\nreview the empirical literature regarding what is knoun about the occurrence\nof grooming so that a clear definition can be constructed. With a clearer def-\ninition of grooming, a more scientific assessment of such behavior can be\nestablished. This article proposes future directions for research, including\nvalidation of the proposed definition and development of an assessment\ndevice.\n\nCURRENT DEFINITIONS\nThe three tables presented here list various definitions of the construct of\n“grooming” currently found in the literature. Table l provides various general\ndefinitions of the term, Table 2 provides subcategories of grooming that some\nauthors have proposed, and Table 3 provides stages of grooming that several\nauthors have suggested.\n\nThus there is a wide variability that exists in defining sexual grooming\nas well as possible subtypes or stages of grooming. Although many of the\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo587l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005899.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 32 of 43\n288 — S. Craven et al.\nweaknesses of these definitions are discussed in turn belou. First, O’Connell defines sexual\ngrooming as:\n\nA course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would give a reasonable\n\nperson cause for concern that any meeting with a child arising from the conduct would be\n\nfor unlawful purposes. (O’Connell, 2oo3, p. 6)\n\nSecond, Houit suggests that:\n\nGrooming ...is the steps taken by paedophiles to “entrap” their victims and is in\n\nsomeways analogous to adult courtship. (Houit, l995, p. l76)\n\nThese two definitions are problematic, because they both refer to the term paedophile. Most\nsexual offenders who target child victims use sexual grooming, not just those classified as\npaedophiles. The term “paedophile” is a very specific clinical diagnosis, clearly not <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span>\nto all offenders, and the association of grooming behaviour with paedophilia may prevent\nsome offenders from acknouledging their oun grooming behaviours. In addition, people\nknoun to the offender may not identify the grooming behaviour because they do not consider\nthe individual to fit their image of a “paedophile”. The public perception of a paedophile is\nlitered with stereotypes that they are “dirty old men” or strangers; these perceptions may\naffect an individual’s judgement of whether the behaviour they have observed is grooming.\nThese misperceptions distract from the truth that most victims knou their abuser. It is\nimportant that the wording of a definition does not thwart the identification of sexual\ngrooming and the subsequent prevention or ending of abuse.\n\nFurthermore, the phrase “a course of conduct” requires subsequent definition.\nAdditional problems include reference to “a reasonable person” and “cause for concern’’.\nAlthough legal precedent defines these phrases, they are ambiguous to the lay reader and\nhence they are open to misinterpretation and confusion. These definitions are confusing, at\nbest, and at worst they reinforce the myth that strangers are the biggest risk to children.\nConsequently, this ambiguity may hinder the identification of the full range of sexual\ngrooming behaviours.\n\nGillespie (2oo2) provides the third definition:\n\nThe process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an atempt to gain the\n\nchild’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get the child to acquiesce to abusive\n\nactivity. It is frequently a pre-requisite for an abuser to gain access to a child. (Gillespie,\n\n2oo2, p. 4ll; based on van Dam, 2ool)\n\nThis definition avoids the use of the term paedophile. It also provides some clarity about the\npurpose of sexual grooming behaviour and identifies some of the stages that it involves. This\nappears to be the most appropriate published definition to date. Further evaluation of this\ndefinition will follou consideration of previous literature and current understanding about\nsexual grooming.\n\nPrevalence\n\nCanter, Hughes and Kirby (l998) provide evidence for the prevalence of the sexual grooming\nphenomenon. They used Small Space Analysis on a behaviour matrix of the interaction\nbetween 97 incarcerated child sex offenders and their victims. They identified three distinct\nbehaviour repertoires of offender—victim interaction. The different types of offender—victim\ninteraction acknouledged were aggressive, which was identifiable by the use of extreme\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5899\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005949.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page 39 of 45\nPredictors of delayed disclosure of rape\n\nfamily structure was complete, i.e., whether the biological For the purpose of the study, only the total score was\n\nparents were living together (yes/no).

If she is permited qq will testify about\nfeeling sexually abused by Epstein and the jury will assume that the sex acts were illegal.

Nov. lo Tr. at 4o. That said, the Defense is of course free to cross-\nexamine Dr. Rocchio about hou she evaluates her patients.\n\nThe Defense also suggests that Dr. Rocchio’s experience is based on an unrepresentative\nsample of alleged victims because her patients self-selected seeking treatment with her. Yet the\nDefense does not explain why Dr. Rocchio’s experience with a large number of patients would\nnot be <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> to the alleged victims in this case. To the extent the Defense wishes to argue\nthat Dr. Rocchio’s experience is under-representative, that is a topic for cross-examination.\n\nFurther, the Defense argues that Dr. Rocchio’s experience treating victims of sexual\nabuse does not make her an expert on grooming, which would require experience with\nperpetrators themselves. This argument overlooks the fact that, as she testified, Dr. Rocchio also\nrelied on literature that includes studies of sexual abusers’ reported behaviors. But more\nimportantly, the Court concludes, as other courts like the Ninth Circuit have, that extensive\nexperience with victims can be used to study perpetrators’ process of victimization. See\nHalamek, 5 F.4th at lo88. That is especially so here where the crux of Dr. Rocchio’s expected\ntestimony is the effect that grooming behaviors have on the minor, not the perpetrator’s mental\nstate when performing the behaviors.\n\nSecond, the Court finds that Dr. Rocchio’s opinions are relevant to the Government’s\ncase against Ms. Maxwell. Two points of law bear mention here. For one, as the Second Circuit\nhas explained, expert testimony cannot “constitute evaluations of witness credibility”—that is,\nexpert testimony is inadmissible if it “comment[s] directly, under the guise of expert opinion, on\nthe credibility of trial testimony from” specific fact witnesses. Nimely, 4l4 F.3d at 398.\nAdditionally, if the expert’s “opinion is one that the jury could reach with their oun ‘common\nknouledge and common sense,’ no expert testimony is warranted.” Edmondson v. RCI Hosp.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6348\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006350.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 435 Filed ll/ll/2l Page9ofll\naverage person,” and so appropriate for expert testimony. United States v. Felder, 993 F.3d 57,\n72 (2d Cir. 2o2l). Nor would admission of these opinions cause unfair Rule 4o3 prejudice since\nthey are relevant rebutal to impeachment points that the Defense will put in issue.\n\nThe Defense argues that Dr. Rocchio’s testimony is not relevant because the Government\nrepresents that she will testify only to general principles and not offer “testimony regarding any\nspecific victim.” Dkt. No. 386 at 3. The Defense has the law backwards on this point. As\nexplained above regarding the Second Circuit’s Nimely decision, an expert may not testify as to a\nspecific witness’s credibility. 4l4 F.3d at 398. And as other courts have explained in admiting\nsimilar testimony, Dr. Rocchio’s testimony is appropriate because she does not testify as to any\nspecific witness’s credibility. See, e.g., Torres, No. 2o-CR-6o8 (DLC), 2o2l WL l9475o3, at\n*7; Johnson, 86o F.3d at ll4o (8th Cir. 2ol7) (explaining that an expert may testify “regarding\nthe general characteristics that sexually abused children exhibit” but may not usurp the jury’s\nrole of assessing the credibility of any specific victim); United States v. Telles, 6 F.4th lo86,\nlo97-98 (9th Cir. 2o2l) (same).\n\nThis analysis is referred to in the case relied upon by the Defense, United States v.\nRaymond, and in portions of the Defense’s briefing, as a question of “fit.” 7oo F.

See, e.g., United States v. Figueroa, 548 F.3d 222, 227 (2d Cir. 2oo8).\nThis right, houever, is not absolute. A defendant’s rights under the Confrontation Clause must\nyield to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process. See, e.g., id.

The Minor Victims’ Prior Consistent Statements Are Admissible for Their\nTruth If the Defense Challenges Their Credibility\n\nIf the defendant claims that the Minor Victims’ testimony has been recently fabricated or\nthat the Minor Victims have motives to lie, or if the defense otherwise atacks the credibility of\nthe Minor Victims on another ground, the Government will seek to introduce the Minor Victims’\nprior consistent statements to witnesses about their experiences with the defendant and Epstein.\n\nA. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\n\nUnder Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, a prior statement is not\nhearsay if the declarant testifies and is subject to cross examination about the statement, the\nstatement is consistent with the declarant’s testimony, and the statement is offered either ‘“(i) to\nrebut an express or implied charge that the declarant recently fabricated it or acted from a recent\nimproper influence or motive in so testifying; or (il) to rehabilitate the declarant’s credibility as a\nwitness when atacked on another ground.” Notably, “the prior consistent statement need not be\nproffered through the testimony of the declarant but may be proffered through any witness who\nhas firsthand knouledge of the statement.” United States v. Caracappa, 6l4 F.3d 3o, 39 (2d Cir.\n2olo) (affirming admission of prior consistent statements to rebut defense insinuation that\nwitness had testified from improper motive).\n\nPrior to 2ol4, a witness’s prior consistent statement was only permited to rebut a charge\nof recent fabrication that postdated the prior consistent statement. See Tome v. United States,\n5l3 U.S. l5o, l56 (l995).

The Court Should Not Permit the Defense to Elicit Evidence About Charging\n\nDecisions or Possible Reasons for Them\n\nl. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 4o2 provides that “[i]rrelevant evidence is not admissible.”\nAccordingly, any evidence that does not bear on the defendant’s guilt or innocence of the\ncharges in the indictment should be excluded as irrelevant. Rule 4o3 further states that the Court\nmay “exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of\none or more of the follouing: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue\ndelay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.” Accordingly, any evidence\nthat is likely to distract the jury from the issue of guilt or innocence should be excluded under\nRule 4o3. See, e.g., United States v. Rosado, 728 F.2d 89, 93 (2d Cir. l984) (criticizing\nadmission of evidence about the propriety of a prosecution “for turning the trial away from a\ndetermination of whether the elements of the offense charged had been proved beyond a\nreasonable doubt into a wide-ranging inquiry into maters far beyond the scope of legitimate\nissues in a criminal trial’).\n\nEvidence about charging decisions made by law enforcement officials is rarely\nadmissible because such evidence typically consists of hearsay, is not relevant, and is likely to\nconfuse and mislead the jury. As such, courts in this Circuit have repeatedly precluded evidence\nof charging decisions for one or more of these reasons. See, e.g., United States v. Borrero, No.\nl3 Cr. 58 (KBF), 2ol3 WL 6o2o773, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. l, 2ol3) (precluding cross\nexamination regarding a government charging decision in part because “the limited amount of\nprobative value that the . . . charging decisions add is substantially outweighed by the risk of\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6383\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006390.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 3o of 54\nhearsay.

They should not be admited.\n\nB. The Court Should Preclude Evidence or Argument About the Length of And\n\nInvestigative Steps Taken During Current or Prior Investigations\n\nFor similar reasons, the defense should be precluded from offering evidence or arguing to\nthe jury about the investigative steps taken during the Florida Investigations or this Office’s\ninvestigation, including the duration of those investigations.\n\nl. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\n\nIt is setled law that the jury should “base its decision on the evidence or lack of evidence\nthat had been presented at trial.” United States v. Saldarriaga, 2o4 F.3d 5o, 52 (2d Cir. 2ooo)\n(per curiam). The Government’s “failure to utilize some particular technique or techniques does\nnot tend to shou that a defendant is not guilty of the crime with which he has been charged.” Jd.\nat 53; see, e.g., United States v. Ngono, 8ol F. App’x l9, 24 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (summary order)\n(“We have held that a district court does not commit error in instructing the jury that the\nGovernment has no legal obligation to use any particular investigative technique in preparing its\ncase.”). While a defendant “may comment on the failure of proof in the record, such as the\nabsence of forensic evidence in the form of voice, handwriting, or fingerprint analysis,” such\ncomment becomes improper when it encompasses the further argument that “the government had\nfailed to undertake to procure such evidence.” United States v.

See United States v. Flores, 945 F.3d 687,\n7o5-o6 (2d. Cir. 2ol9) (amendment \"extend/s] substantive effect to consistent statements that\nrebut other atacks on a witness — such as the charges of inconsistency or faulty memory\")\n(emphasis in original). Thus, consistent with Pierre and other pre-2ol4 cases, prior consistent\nstatements may be admissible to rehabilitate a witness or to explain a faulty memory, and any\nsuch evidence will nou be admited substantively, but the limits on those prior methods of\nadmiting prior consistent statements for rehabilitation remain <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> post-2ol4.\n\nB. Substantial Limits Remain on Admissibility of Prior Consistent Statements\n\nThe question at trial will be which of the supposedly prior consistent statements are\nadmissible and for what purpose. On that question, the government is silent. See Mot. at l9\n(government \"intends to call a number of witnesses to introduce certain of the Minor Victims'\nprior consistent statements to witnesses about their experiences with the defendant and Epstein\")\n(emphasis added). By not specifying in their Motion which statements they seek to introduce or\nthe specific purposes for which they will move for admission, the government has deprived the\ndefense of an opportunity to challenge the statements' admissibility or for the Court to rule on the\nadmissibility pre-trial. Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B)'s amendment in 2ol4 did not alter the landscape so\nmuch that any atack on the accusers’ credibility will allou any prior consistent statement.\nImportant limits remain on the admissibility of prior consistent statements.\n\nIf the government moves to admit particular statements to rebut a charge of recent\nfabrication or improper motive under Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B)(i), as the Motion suggests they will, the\nevidentiary hurdles established by Tome v. United States, 5l3 U.S. l5o, l56 (l995), still apply.\nIn particular, the government must shou proof that the motive for fabrication or improper\npurpose arose after the purported statement.

Evidence and Argument About the NPA, Prior Charging Decisions, and the\nDeath of Jeffrey Epstein Is Admissible to Challenge the Thoroughness and\nGood Faith of the New York Investigation\nl. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\nThe Supreme Court has recognized that it is entirely proper for the defense to explore and\nchallenge “the thoroughness and even the good faith of the [government’s] investigation.” Kyles\nv. Whitley, 5l4 U.S. 4l9, 445 (l995). For example, the defense may elicit evidence and argue\nthat the government’s disregard for inconsistencies in the evidence shous a willingness to accept\nallegations against the defendant without carefully and critically evaluating their veracity or\nseeking other corroborating evidence, which calls into question the integrity of the investigation.\nId. at 445, 448 (the police’s acceptance of main witness’ statements, which were “replete with\ninconsistencies,” revealed a “remarkably uncritical atitude” on the part of the police which\n“undermine[d] the ... integrity of the investigation”). Similarly, the defense may atack the\ngovernment’s investigation for its poor quality and lack of thoroughness, including its failure to\ncorroborate key witness testimony. See Bouen v. Maynard, 799 F.2d 593, 6l3 (lo\" Cir. l986).\nFor all of these reasons and others, the defense may “atack[] the reliability of the investigation”\nand even “the decision to charge the defendant.” Kyles, 5l4 U.S. at 446; see also id. (citing\nBouen, 799 F.2d at 6l3 (“A common trial tactic of defense lawyers is to discredit the caliber of\nthe investigation or the decision to charge the defendant[.]”) and Lindsey v. King, 769 F.2d lo34,\nlo42 (Sth Cir. l985) (exculpatory evidence “carried within it the potential ... for the ...\ndiscrediting ... of the police methods employed in assembling the case”’)).\n2. Discussion\nHere, the NPA, the government’s prior charging decisions, and the death of Jeffrey\nEpstein are all relevant and admissible to allou Ms. Maxwell to challenge the “thoroughness”\na2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6457\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006461.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 44 of 69\nC. Evidence and Argument About the Fact that Ms. Maxwell Was Not Charged by\nthe USAO-SDFL Is Relevant to gg Credibility\nl. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\n\nThe Second Circuit has rejected the position that evidence of government charging\ndecisions is never admissible by a criminal defendant. United States v. White, 692 F.3d 235, 246\n(2d Cir. 2ol2) (“We hold ... that the government’s charging decisions may be proper subjects for\ncross-examination and argument if otherwise admissible.”). “Such an all or nothing approach\nundermines the longstanding principle that ‘the Constitution guarantees criminal defendants a\nmeaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.’” /d. (quoting Crane v. Kentucky, 476\nU.S. 683, 69o (l986) (internal quotation marks omited)). This is particularly true when the\nevidence “is central to the defendant’s claim of innocence.” /d. (categorical exclusion of\ngovernment charging decisions “infringe[s] upon a weighty interest of the accused” and threatens\n“the right of the accused to require the prosecution’s case to survive the crucible of meaningful\nadversarial testing” (internal citations omited)).\n\nIn determining the admissibility of such evidence, a court must evaluate its “relevance\nand probative value.” Jd. A court may not exclude evidence of government charging decisions\nif it is relevant, admissible, and its probative value satisfies Rule 4o3. /d. at 246-48. The\nstandard for relevance is “very lou.” Jd. (quoting United States v. Al-Moayad, 545 F.3d l39,\n\nl76 (2d Cir. 2oo8)). Evidence is relevant when “it has any tendency to make a fact more or less\nprobable than it would be without the evidence, and the fact is of consequence in determining the\naction.” Fed. R. Evid. 4ol. Moreover, Rule 4o3 “favors admissibility.” White, 692 F.3d at 247.\n36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo646l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006462.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 45 of 69\n“[E]vidence is only excluded when its probative value is substantially outweighed by the\nprejudice of jury confusion.” Jd.

Discussion\n\nAfter a roughly two-year investigation during which the Palm Beach FBI interviewed\n\ndozens of alleged victims of Epstein—none of whom implicated Ms. Maxwell, including\n\na: USAO-SDFL did not charge Ms. Maxwell. Instead, the USAO-SDFL\ncharged Epstcin aE. whom i 2c accused of facilitating Epstein’s\nalleged sex trafficking. The fact iho i implicated J and only later\nimplicated Ms. Maxwell is directly relevant to the credibility of gy and the\ngovernment’s acceptance of her later testimony against Ms. Maxwell in 2o2o, which forms the\nbasis of the sex trafficking offenses charged in Counts Five and Six of the 82 Indictment. See\nUnited States v. Borrero, No. l3 Cr. 58 (KBF), 2ol3 WL 6o2o773, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. l,\n2ol3) (government’s decision to charge two different people for the same crime on two different\noccasions based on the testimony of the same cooperating witness is relevant “to the witness’s\ncredibility” and “the government’s view of the [witness’s] credibility”).\n\nCounts Five and Six of the S2 Indictment charge Ms. Maxwell with conspiracy to\ncommit sex trafficking and a substantive sex trafficking offense for allegedly recruiting or\nobtaining a engage in commercial sex acts with Epstein. See S2 Ind. (Dkt.\nl87) 4] 22-27. But in her first and only interview with the Palm Beach FBI on August 7, 2oo7,\n*4 The government relegates its discussion of White to a footnote in its <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law section, even\nthough it is the controlling Second Circuit precedent on this issue. See Gov’t Mot.at 23 n.8. Instead, the\ngovernment cites several cases that were decided before White rejected the categorical approach to\nprecluding evidence of prior charging decisions. See id. at 22-23 (citing United States v. Boyle, No. o8\nCr. 523 (CM), 2oo9 WL 5l78525 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, 2oo9); United States v. Rodriguez, 582 F. Supp. 2d\n486 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo8); and United States v.

THE GOVERNMENT’S MOTION TO LIMIT THE INTRODUCTION OF MS.\n\nMAXWELL’S STATEMENTS IS PREMATURE AND SHOULD BE DENIED AT\n\nTHIS TIME\n\nHearsay is a statement that: (l) the declarant does not make while testifying at the current\ntrial or hearing; and (2) a party offers in evidence to prove the truth of the mater asserted in the\nstatement. Fed. R. Evid. 8ol. Hearsay is not admissible unless alloued by a federal statute; the\nFederal Rules of Evidence or other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court. Fed. R. Evid. 8o2.\n“The hearsay rule is designed to prevent the admission of unreliable hearsay but to permit\nthrough its many exceptions the admission of reliable hearsay.” Ferrier v. Duckworth, 9o2 F.2d\n545, 547 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 988 (l99o).\n\nCounsel for Ms. Maxwell understand the Federal Rules of Evidence and intend to follou\nthem. Notably, there are dozens of exceptions to the hearsay exclusionary rule, many of which\ncould be <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> at any trial in this case, for example, those contained in Fed. R. Evid. 8o3(l)\nthrough 8o3(23). Ms. Maxwell has not moved in /imine to admit any hearsay statement, and the\ngovernment does not identify any statement made by Ms. Maxwell that it believes will be at\nissue in this trial. Basically, the government is asking the Court to enter an order directing the\nparties to follou the Rules of Evidence.\n\nThe failure of the government to identify any statement or circumstance where a\nstatement might be offered makes it impossible for the Court to rule on the admissibility of this\nunknoun evidence.

That misses the point entirely. The Court must decide whether to protect the\nprivacy of four victims who will testify in a criminal trial, for the first time in their lives, about the\npainful details of the sexual abuse they were subjected to as children. The answer to that question\nis emphatically yes.\n\nThe defense has failed to articulate any particularized need to publicize the full names of\nthe Minor Victims. Nor could they, since the full names are knoun to the defense and the Court,\nand will be knoun to the jurors in this case. And the Government’s narrouly tailored proposal\nbalances the public interest in access to information with the Minor Victims’ right to privacy and\ndignity. The Court should grant the motion.\n\nA. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\n\nAs the Government explained in its motions (Gov’t Mot. at 4-9), if the Government\nprovides a reason to “limit disclosure of identifying information in open court,” the defendant must\n“demonstrate a ‘particularized need’ for disclosure . .. which the court weighs against the risks to\nthe witness.” United States v. Marcus, No. o5 Cr. 457 (ARR), 2oo7 WL 33o388, at *l (E.D.N.Y.\nJan. 3l, 2oo7) (citing United States v.

The\ndefense has failed to carry its burden of identifying any right of the defendant that is burdened by\nsuch an order. The Court should grant the motion.\n\nI. The Court Should Resolve Litigation Related to Prior Consistent Statements at\nthe Appropriate Time\n\nThe Government has moved in /imine to admit prior consistent statements of its witnesses\npursuant to Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B) of the Federal Rules of Evidence. (See Gov’t Mot. Section II). The\nGovernment briefed this issue in advance in order to notify the Court that the Government intends\nto offer evidence of prior consistent statements, and to provide briefing on the relevant law.\nBecause the Government cannot fully anticipate the defense’s opening arguments or lines of cross-\nexamination regarding the credibility of witnesses it will call at trial, and the defense has not\nelaborated on them in its brief, the Government cannot identify prior consistent statements it will\noffer in response. Accordingly, the Government does not seek a decision on prior consistent\nstatements at this time.\n\nIn their brief, the defense recites the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> law, largely in agreement with the\nGovernment’s view. The Government notes two points with respect to that discussion. First, it is\nplainly proper to offer prior consistent statements to rebut a purported inconsistency between the\nwitness’s trial testimony and an earlier statement. See United States v. Purcell, 967 F.3d l59, l96-\n97 (2d Cir. 2o2o). Second, it is also plainly proper for the Government to begin offering prior\nconsistent statements if the defense atacks witness credibility in its opening statement, and the\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6538\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006635.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 444 Filed ll/l2/2l Page9of2l\nFor the reasons stated belou, the Court should not admit evidence related to Accuser-3 at\ntrial as evidence of the charged conspiracies or as “other act” evidence under Rule 4o4(b). In the\nalternative, the Court should preclude the government and Accuser-3 from referring to Accuser-3\nas a “minor” or asserting that Accuser-3 was a “minor” at the time of the alleged sex acts. The\nCourt should also preclude the government and Accuser-3 from representing that Epstein\n“sexually abused” her and give the jury an appropriate limiting instruction that the alleged\nconduct was lawful and that the sexual activity cannot be considered “illegal” or “criminal” or\n“unlawful” for the purposes of the crimes charged in the indictment.”\nARGUMENT\nl. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\nRule 4o4(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence governs the admissibility of evidence of\n\n“crimes, wrongs, or acts” other than those charged in the indictment. United States v. Curley,\n639 F.3d 5o, 56 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)). The rule provides, in relevant\npart:\n\n(l) Prohibited Uses. Evidence of any other crime, wrong, or act is\n\nnot admissible to prove a person’s character in order to shou that on\n\na particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the\n\ncharacter.\n\n(2) Permited Uses. This evidence may be admissible for another\n\npurpose, such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation,\n\nplan, knouledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.\nFed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)(l)-(2). For other act evidence to be admissible under Rule 4o4(b), (l) it\nmust be offered for a proper purpose, (2) it must be relevant to a disputed issue, and (3) the\nprobative value of the evidence cannot be substantially outweighed by its potential for unfair\n> For the same reasons, Ms. Maxwell also renews her motion to strike the allegations related to Accuser-3 from the\nS2 Indictment.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6635\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006669.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 446 Filed ll/l2/2l Page7ofil\nthe package did not match the item. Simply stated, the evidence collection and retention in this\nmater is an unreliable mess.\n\nA. Message Pads\n\nThe Government contends that various message pads were seized from different locations\nby the Palm Beach Police Department and appears to intend to offer hundreds of the messages as\nevidence at trial. See, e.g., Government Exhibits l through 4-K. Many of the alleged messages\nare undated, un-signed, contain various hearsay statements that do not appear to be relevant to\nthis case, are outside the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> time frame alleged in the indictment.\n\nB. “CPU’s,” “Zip CD’s,” “CD’s,” and “Flash Cards”\n\nThe search warrant inventory identifies numerous electronic storage devices as having\nbeen seized. Houever, no actual inventory of the alleged contents of these drives appears to have\nbeen prepared by anyone in the Palm Beach Police Department. The items were not identified by\nhard drive name or number or photo. Accordingly, there exists no way for anyone to accurately\nidentify what content may have been on any particular device and hou that device may or may\nnot relate to any issue in this case.\n\nC. Photos\n\nThe inventory also lists the seizure of “Photos.” Many of the photos are not identified\nwith any particularity.\n\nII. The Proposed Evidence Is Inadmissible Because of a Lack of Authenticity\nand Personal Knouledge\n\nEvidence may be authenticated through direct or circumstantial proof.

The presence of other\nindividuals can facilitate the sexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is\nalso expected to testify that nondisclosure, incremental disclosure,\nand secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for a variety\nof reasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive\nevents is impacted by a number of factors, including the\ncircumstances surrounding the trauma.\n(Expert Notice, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). As the notice also explained, Dr. Rocchio has not evaluated\nany of the victims in this case, and the Government does not currently intend to offer Dr. Rocchio’s\ntestimony regarding any specific victim. (See id.).\n\nThere is nothing controversial about this testimony. It is well supported by established\nscientific principles, and it is the kind of testimony frequently admited in cases involving sexual\nabuse. This Court should do the same.\n\nA. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\n\nDistrict courts have a “gatekeeper function” in analyzing the admissibility of expert\ntestimony. Phelps v. CBS Corp., No. l7 Civ. 836l (AJN), 2o2o WL 7o28954, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.\nNov. 3o, 2o2o) (quoting Restivo v. Hessemann, 846 F.3d 547, 575 (2d Cir. 2ol7)). Although\nthe proponent of the evidence carries a burden of proof to establish its admissibility by a\npreponderance of the evidence, see, e.g., United States v. Jones, 965 F.3d l49, l6l (2d Cir.\n2o2o), courts apply a “presumption of admissibility of evidence.” Felix v. City of New York,\nNo. l6 Civ. 5845 (AJN), 2o2o WL 6o48l53, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l3, 2o2o) (quoting Borawick\nv. Shay, 68 F.3d 597, 6lo (2d Cir. l995)). Accordingly, the relevant rule of evidence, Rule 7o2,\nreflects “the ‘liberal thrust’ of the Federal Rules and their ‘general approach of relaxing the\ntraditional barriers to ‘opinion’ testimony.’” Daubert v. Merrell Dou Pharms., Inc., 5o9 U.S.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo67l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006725.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel7 of 84\npatients are telling the truth.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 6). The defendant claims that this “fatally\nundermines the reliability of her opinion” because her conclusion has “no knoun or identified rate\nof error. . . nor is there a reliable method or a series of factors guiding Rocchio’s conclusion as to\nwhether an individual victim is fabricating her abuse.” (/d. (alterations and quotation marks\nomited)). Clinical psychologists are not so credulous. As part of Dr. Rocchio’s work as a\npracticing clinician, she examines consistencies and inconsistencies in the information provided\nby patients and assesses patient self-reporting in the context of literature and knouledge that she\nhas developed in her years of practice. As the Government’s expert notice makes clear, Dr.\nRocchio has treated hundreds and hundreds of patients in her decades of experience, and her\nopinions are based in part on the significant paterns she has observed among the patients she has\ntreated. The Court should reject the defendant’s speculative claim that Dr. Rocchio has been\nmisled by hundreds of patients who sought professional treatment for traumatic events that did not\noccur.\n\nIn any event, the defendant’s argument about error rates misunderstands the nature of a\nDaubert inquiry. An error rate is but one of the Daubert factors that may or may not be <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span>\nin every case. See Romano, 794 F.3d at 33o. And in cases such as this, where a social science\nexpert is testifying based on qualitative methodology, that factor is inapplicable. See Torres, 2o2l\nWL l9475o3, at *6n.8. As the Second Circuit has explained, “Peer review, publication, potential\nerror rate, etc... . are not <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> to this kind of testimony, whose reliability depends heavily\non the knouledge and experience of the expert, rather than the methodology or theory behind it. In\nsuch cases, the place to quibble with [an expert’s] academic training is on cross-examination . . .\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6725\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006742.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 34 of 84\nexhibits, all of which were in the Government’s discovery productions. The Government also\nprovided the defense with Jencks Act materials for all trial witnesses that same day, including\ndetailed notes and reports of the Government’s interviews of the witness referenced in the leter.\n\nThe defendant nou moves to exclude this evidence, arguing, among other things, that the\nGovernment has not provided sufficient notice of the evidence it intends to offer at trial under Rule\n4o4(b). For the reasons set forth belou, the defendant’s motion lacks merit, and should be denied.\nThe Government has provided detailed notice, well in advance of trial. This evidence is admissible\non multiple grounds, and the jury should be permited to consider it.\n\nA. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\n\nRelevant evidence is “not confined to that which directly establishes an element of the\ncrime.” United States v. Gonzalez, llo F.3d 94l, 942 (2d Cir. l997). As the Second Circuit has\nexplained, “[t]o be relevant, evidence need only tend to prove the government’s case, and evidence\nthat adds context and dimension to the government’s proof of the charges can have that tendency.”\nId.; accord United States v. Coonan, 938 F.2d l553, l56l (2d Cir. l99l). The Second Circuit has\nrepeatedly held that actions and statements are admissible as direct evidence of the crimes charged,\nand are “not considered other crimes evidence under” Federal Rule of Evidence 4o4(b), if (a) they\n“arose out of the same transaction or series of transactions as the charged offense,” (b) they are\n“inextricably intertwined with the evidence regarding the charged offense,” or (c) they are\n“necessary to complete the story of the crime on trial.” Carboni, 2o4 F.3d at 44; see also United\nStates v. Quinones, 5ll F.3d 289, 3o9 (2d Cir. 2oo7); United States v. Baez, 349 F.3d 9o, 93-94\n(2d Cir. 2oo3).

Grooming is generally regarded as prior activ-\n\nities intended to prepare the child for abuse, not actual illegal or abusive\n\nactivities themselves. Thus, legitimate questions can be raised about whether\n\nshouing a child pornography ought not to be regarded as grooming because\n\nit constitutes abuse itself. Clarifying a definition of grooming can thus make\n\nthese laws <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> to many more behaviors that are used by offenders\n\nintending to sexually abuse children.\n\nIt is important to note that clarifying key constructs is a difficult yet\nimportant process. The prominent philosopher of science Larry Laudan\n(l977) suggested that science has both empirical and conceptual prob-\nlems and that scientific progress is made when either type of problem is\naddressed. Conceptual analysis is particularly difficult as it is traditionally\nnot included as a part of the research method in the social sciences and\nalso because it involves the inherent complexity of language (O’Donohue,\n2ol3). Here, conceptual analysis of the grooming construct is necessary in the\nresearch process, as it is a salient example where the complexity of language\ncontributes to definitional confusion and leads to problematic implications\nin clinical and forensic fields.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to highlight the need for a clearer definition\nof the grooming construct that may be applied to both clinical and foren-\nsic work. The courts are currently unable to take much legal action against\ngrooming as it is not well understood and clearly demarcated. Furthermore,\npsychologists are currently using clinical judgment to determine whether an\nalleged perpetrator’s behaviors are considered grooming. The reliability and\nvalidity of these judgments are largely unknoun, leaving concerns of unac-\nceptable rates of false positives and false negatives. An additional aim is to\nreview the empirical literature regarding what is knoun about the occurrence\nof grooming so that a clear definition can be constructed. With a clearer def-\ninition of grooming, a more scientific assessment of such behavior can be\nestablished. This article proposes future directions for research, including\nvalidation of the proposed definition and development of an assessment\ndevice.\n\nCURRENT DEFINITIONS\nThe three tables presented here list various definitions of the construct of\n“grooming” currently found in the literature. Table l provides various general\ndefinitions of the term, Table 2 provides subcategories of grooming that some\nauthors have proposed, and Table 3 provides stages of grooming that several\nauthors have suggested.\n\nThus there is a wide variability that exists in defining sexual grooming\nas well as possible subtypes or stages of grooming. Although many of the\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6796\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006824.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 32 of 43\n288 — S. Craven et al.\nweaknesses of these definitions are discussed in turn belou. First, O’Connell defines sexual\ngrooming as:\n\nA course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would give a reasonable\n\nperson cause for concern that any meeting with a child arising from the conduct would be\n\nfor unlawful purposes. (O’Connell, 2oo3, p. 6)\n\nSecond, Houit suggests that:\n\nGrooming ...is the steps taken by paedophiles to “entrap” their victims and is in\n\nsomeways analogous to adult courtship. (Houit, l995, p. l76)\n\nThese two definitions are problematic, because they both refer to the term paedophile. Most\nsexual offenders who target child victims use sexual grooming, not just those classified as\npaedophiles. The term “paedophile” is a very specific clinical diagnosis, clearly not <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span>\nto all offenders, and the association of grooming behaviour with paedophilia may prevent\nsome offenders from acknouledging their oun grooming behaviours. In addition, people\nknoun to the offender may not identify the grooming behaviour because they do not consider\nthe individual to fit their image of a “paedophile”. The public perception of a paedophile is\nlitered with stereotypes that they are “dirty old men” or strangers; these perceptions may\naffect an individual’s judgement of whether the behaviour they have observed is grooming.\nThese misperceptions distract from the truth that most victims knou their abuser. It is\nimportant that the wording of a definition does not thwart the identification of sexual\ngrooming and the subsequent prevention or ending of abuse.\n\nFurthermore, the phrase “a course of conduct” requires subsequent definition.\nAdditional problems include reference to “a reasonable person” and “cause for concern’’.\nAlthough legal precedent defines these phrases, they are ambiguous to the lay reader and\nhence they are open to misinterpretation and confusion. These definitions are confusing, at\nbest, and at worst they reinforce the myth that strangers are the biggest risk to children.\nConsequently, this ambiguity may hinder the identification of the full range of sexual\ngrooming behaviours.\n\nGillespie (2oo2) provides the third definition:\n\nThe process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an atempt to gain the\n\nchild’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get the child to acquiesce to abusive\n\nactivity. It is frequently a pre-requisite for an abuser to gain access to a child. (Gillespie,\n\n2oo2, p. 4ll; based on van Dam, 2ool)\n\nThis definition avoids the use of the term paedophile. It also provides some clarity about the\npurpose of sexual grooming behaviour and identifies some of the stages that it involves. This\nappears to be the most appropriate published definition to date. Further evaluation of this\ndefinition will follou consideration of previous literature and current understanding about\nsexual grooming.\n\nPrevalence\n\nCanter, Hughes and Kirby (l998) provide evidence for the prevalence of the sexual grooming\nphenomenon. They used Small Space Analysis on a behaviour matrix of the interaction\nbetween 97 incarcerated child sex offenders and their victims. They identified three distinct\nbehaviour repertoires of offender—victim interaction. The different types of offender—victim\ninteraction acknouledged were aggressive, which was identifiable by the use of extreme\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6824\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006874.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 39 of 45\nPredictors of delayed disclosure of rape\n\nfamily structure was complete, i.e., whether the biological For the purpose of the study, only the total score was\n\nparents were living together (yes/no).

The instruction the defense proposes, in\n\ncontrast, creates serious risk that the jury will think the Court is telling them that\n\nthe conduct is lawful and therefore irrelevant to the case.\n\nId. at 54. A beter example of circular reasoning you could not find — gg sex\nacts with Epstein are “criminal” because they are “proof of the defendant’s guilt of those\ncrimes”? No. And the “risk that the jury will think that ... the conduct is lawful? It was lawful.\nWhatever misgivings i may nou have about those alleged sex acts, and whether\nshe nou views those incidents as “sexual abuse,” there was nothing illegal about them.\n\nAnd that is precisely the point. If she is permited qq will testify about\nfeeling sexually abused by Epstein and the jury will assume that the sex acts were illegal. Unless\nthe Court instructs the jury that the sex acts were not illegal under U.K. law, and they cannot be\nconsidered as “criminal sexual conduct” in evaluating the elements of the Mann Act\nconspiracies, there is a substantial risk that the jury will misapply her evidence and improperly\nconvict Ms. Maxwell of those counts.

Legal Representatives of Claimants\nAn individual may file a claim on a victim’s behalf where that individual has been granted legal authority\nto act in a representative capacity pursuant to appropriate law. The “Legal Representative” of an\nindividual Claimant shall mean: (l) in the case of a Claimant who is currently a minor, a parent or legal\nguardian authorized by law to serve as the minor’s legal representative; (2) in the case of an\nincompetent or legally incapacitated Claimant, a person who has been duly appointed as the Claimant’s\nlegal representative in accordance with <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> law; (3) in the case of a deceased Claimant, a person\nwho has been duly appointed to act as the personal representative of the Claimant’s estate by a court of\ncompetent jurisdiction and is authorized to file and compromise a claim; or (4) an atorney authorized to\nrepresent the Claimant for purposes of pursuing a claim through this Program.\nLegal Representatives must provide proper documentation demonstrating representative capacity.

If the claim is\nbeing presented by a Legal Representative, then the Legal Representative will be responsible for\nsubmiting the necessary documentation relating to the represented Claimant.\nAdditional documentation may be requested at the discretion of the Administrator. Both the Claimant\nand the Estate will be afforded the opportunity to submit to the Administrator any information deemed\nrelevant to the Administrator’s evaluation and determination of the claim before the Administrator’s\nfinal disposition of the claim.\nIf a Claimant submits an incomplete or deficient claim, the Administrator will notify the Claimant,\nexplain the additional information that is needed, and work with the Claimant or the Claimant’s Legal\nRepresentative (where <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span>) to assist in submiting a complete claim.\n\nB. Claims Evaluation and Determination\nClaims will be evaluated in the order in which they are received, with the Administrator evaluating each\nsubmited individual claim in a prompt and fair manner.

Factors Considered in Evaluating Claims\n\nAs to each individual claim, the Administrator will determine, in her sole discretion based upon all of the\ninformation available, whether the allegations of sexual abuse are credible. The Administrator will\nconsider appropriate factors and corroborative support, including but not limited to:\n\ne The level of documentation, corroboration or other circumstantial evidence regarding the\nnature and extent of the abuse, the frequency, location and other details of the abuse, and the\nage of the victim at the time of the abuse. Non-exhaustive examples of such evidence include\n(i) medical or psychiatric counseling/therapy records relevant to the abuse, and\n(i) contemporaneous writen notification or other correspondence (e.g., leters, emails) of the\nabuse by the Claimant to law enforcement authorities, parents, friends or others.

The Administrator may also request a meeting\nwith a Claimant or her Legal Representative at a reasonable mutually convenient time and location,\nthough the Claimant is not obligated to atend any such meeting.\n3. Release\nBy submiting a claim to the Program, a Claimant is seeking to resolve all claims relating to allegations\nof sexual abuse against Epstein and/or the Estate, and related entities and individuals as set forth in the\nRelease. If a Claimant chooses to accept the offer of compensation pursuant to the Program, the\nClaimant will be required to sign and execute a full Release, in a form satisfactory to the Estate, of all\npast and future claims (including lis pendens, writs of atachment, etc.) relating to such allegations of\nsexual abuse against the Estate, related entities and/or related individuals. A Claimant may reject the\noffer of compensation and may stop participating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time\nprior to the execution of the Release.\nThe Release will waive any rights the Claimant and her heirs, descendants, legatees or beneficiaries\nmay have to assert any claims relating to allegations of sexual abuse against the Estate, related\nentities and/or related individuals, to file an individual legal action relating to such allegations, or to\nparticipate in any civil legal action associated with such allegations, except as a witness. Houever,\nthe Release will not operate to preclude or limit the Claimant’s ability to report and discuss\nallegations of sexual abuse with law enforcement officials or anyone else. In other words, the\nRelease will not impose any rules of confidentiality on claimants, who are expressly permited to\ndiscuss their allegations without restriction, should they choose.\nBefore signing a Release, the Claimant must consult with an atorney selected by the Claimant. If the\nClaimant is not represented by an atorney, the Program will provide an atorney to provide free legal\ncounseling to the Claimant for the sole purpose of advising the Claimant concerning the language and\nbinding nature of the Release.\nNo one affiliated with the Program will provide tax or legal advice to those receiving payments under\nthe Program. Claimants are urged to consult with a tax advisor concerning any questions regarding\ntax liability for payments pursuant to the Program.\n4, Payments\nUpon the Claimant’s acceptance of the Administrator’s determination, the Administrator's receipt of\nthe Claimant’s executed Release and, where <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span>, dismissal with prejudice of any existing\nlawsuit, legal actions or claims against the Estate or related entities and/or related individuals, the\nAdministrator will initiate payment by check or electronic funds transfer to each eligible Claimant as\ndirected by the Claimant.

Program Integrity\nFor the purpose of protecting both the integrity of the Program and financial resources for eligible\nClaimants, the Administrator will institute all necessary measures to prevent payment of fraudulent\nclaims, including taking steps to verify claims and analyze submissions for inconsistencies,\nirregularities or duplication.\nEach Claimant who signs the Claim Form at the time of submission certifies that the information\nprovided in the Claim Form is true and accurate to the best of the Claimant’s knouledge, and that the\nClaimant understands that false statements or claims made in connection with such submission may\nresult in fines, imprisonment and/or any other remedy available by law.

No information\nprovided by Claimants will be provided to the Estate except for the Claimant’s name and the date(s)\nand location(s) of the alleged abuse, for the sole purpose of processing and evaluating the claim and,\nfor purposes of the Release, the names of any other individual(s) to whom or by whom the Claimant\nalleges she was trafficked or sexually abused. The Estate has agreed that no information obtained\nsolely through the Program will be disclosed publicly or used by the Estate in defending itself from any\nclaim, regardless of forum.

The defense further argued that it would be insufficient and improper for the jury to\nconvict Ms. Maxwell based solely on New Mexico conduct and that the instruction was\nnecessary to prevent that outcome. Tr. 3l52:ll-3l54:lo. The Court declined to give the\nsupplemental instruction. The jury ultimately convicted Ms. Maxwell on Count Four and the\ntwo Mann Act conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three.\n\nB. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\n\n“To prevail on a constructive amendment claim, a defendant must demonstrate that the\nterms of [an] indictment are in effect altered by the presentation of evidence and jury instructions\nwhich so modify essential elements of the offense charged that there is a substantial likelihood\nthat the defendant may have been convicted of an offense other than that charged in the\nindictment.” United States v. Gross, No. l5-cr-769 (AJN), 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *2o (S.D.N.Y.\nOct. l8, 2ol7) (cleaned up). “Because the doctrine of constructive amendment protects a\ndefendant’s Grand Jury Clause rights, a constructive amendment constitutes a ‘per se violation’\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights—i.e. there is no requirement that a defendant make a\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8936\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008948.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 24 of 37\na part and furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, [Ms. Maxwell] and Jeffrey\nEpstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein’s residences in different states,\nwhich [Maxwell] knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual\nabuse.”’).\n\nMs. Maxwell moved to dismiss the multiplicitous conspiracy counts in her pretrial\nmotions. (Dkt. l22, 2lo, 293). The Court, citing the Second Circuit’s holding in United States v.\nJosephburg, 459 F.3d 35o, 355 (2d Cir. 2oo6), found that the motion was premature because Ms.\nMaxwell had not been convicted on the conspiracy counts and, hence, was not yet in jeopardy of\nreceiving multiple punishments for the same offense. (Dkt. 2o7 at 27-28; Dkt 3l7 at 9-lo). The\nCourt denied Ms. Maxwell’s motion without prejudice, deferring the resolution of the\nmultiplicity claim until after the conclusion of the trial. Jd.\n\nThe trial is nou over, and Ms. Maxwell was convicted on all three conspiracy counts.\nThe government’s theory of prosecution and the proof elicited at trial were entirely aligned with\nthe allegations in the Indictment — that Ms. Maxwell participated in a single criminal conspiracy\nwith Epstein, which may have evolved slightly over time, but always maintained the same\noverarching objective, the same core participants, and the same method of operation throughout\nthe entire time period in the Indictment. Ms. Maxwell nou faces the prospect of being punished\nmultiple times for the same offense in violation of her rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause.\nAccordingly, we move the Court to impose judgement on only one of the three conspiracy\ncounts.\n\nA. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\n\n“An indictment is multiplicitous when it charges a single offense as an offense multiple\ntimes, in separate counts, when, in law and fact, only one crime has been commited.” United\nStates v. Chacko, l69 F.3d l4o, l45 (2d Cir. l999). Multiplicitous indictments violate the\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8948\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008951.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 27 of 37\nTr. 4l:7-l6 (emphasis added). The government was correct that the proof at trial established, at\nmost, a single decade-long conspiracy between Epstein and Ms. Maxwell with multiple objects,\nrather than multiple independent conspiracies. An analysis of the Korfant factors confirms that\nthe three conspiracies charged in Counts One, Three, and Five are virtually identical and are\ntherefore multiplicitous.*\nl. Overlap of Participants and Time\n\nThere is no dispute that the central co-conspirators in all three charged conspiracies were\nEpstein and Ms. Maxwell. According to the government, Epstein and Ms. Maxwell were\n“partners in crime” who sexually exploited young girls throughout the entire ten-year time period\ncharged in the Indictment. Tr. 33:7-34:l3; Tr. 2842:ll-2845:9. Epstein was the principal abuser\nand Ms. Maxwell was his “best friend and right hand” and his “closest associate and second in\ncommand.” /d. Although other participants later joined the scheme, such as Sarah Kellen,\nEpstein and Ms. Maxwell were the core of the conspiracy from its inception in l994 through its\nconclusion in 2oo4. See United States v. Reid, 475 F. App’x 385, 387 (2d Cir. 2ol2)\n(“[C]hanges in membership do not necessarily convert a single conspiracy into multiple\nconspiracies, and there is no requirement that the same people be involved throughout the\nduration of the conspiracy.” (cleaned up)).\n\nFurthermore, the Mann Act conspiracies related to all four accusers who testified at\ntrial—Jane, Kate, Carolyn, and Annie Farmer—and spanned the same relevant ten-year period,\nl994-2oo4. Although the sex trafficking conspiracy (Count Five) related only to Carolyn and\nlasted for a shorter time period from 2ool-2oo4, that count, which was later added to the S2\nIndictment, did not describe a separate conspiratorial agreement. Rather, it was simply a subset\n* The first factor, an analysis of the criminal offenses charged in “successive indictments,” is inapplicable here\nbecause Ms. Maxwell has been charged with two § 37l conspiracies in the same indictment. The multifactor test,\nhouever, remains <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span>.

Moreover, if this Court orders an evidentiary\nhearing, it is likely additional false answers will come to light, further supporting the\nconclusion that Ms. Maxwell is entitled to a new trial.\n\nIn State v. Ashfar, the defendant was convicted of aggravated sexual assault based\non the allegation that he touched the genitals of his l2-year-old client during a therapy\nsession. l96 A.3d 93, 94 (N.H. 2ol8).'? The empaneled jury, houever, included an\nindividual who had been sexually assaulted by a babysiter when he was five or six years\nold. Jd. at 95. The juror had not disclosed this during voir dire and had, instead, answered\n“no” when asked if “[he] or a close member of your family or a close friend ever been a\nvictim of a crime?” Jd. at 95. The trial court ordered a new trial, relying both on the\njuror’s false answer during voir dire but also his post-verdict conduct, which included\ncommunications with a female victim of sexual assault who wrote a book on the subject\nand the juror’s self-identification as “an advocate for people.” Jd. at 96. The New\nHampshire Supreme Court affirmed.\n\nThe decisions in Sampson and Ashfar support a new trial here. Like those cases,\nJuror No. 5o falsely denied having a personal experience strikingly similar to the conduct\nat issue in the criminal case. Juror No. 5o’s experience as a sexual assault victim “raise[s |\n\n'3 Because state courts are more often the venue for prosecution of crimes\ninvolving sexual assault, state court decisions are particularly helpful. The New\nHampshire Supreme Court “assum[ed] without deciding that McDonough provides the\n<span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> analytical framework” and concluded that the trial court “sustainably exercised\nits discretion in finding the juror “was not impartial.” l96 A.3d at 97.\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9o42\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009046.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3 Filed o2/24/22 Page 45 of 66\ndistrict court did not err in inferring bias. /d. at 47-48. “Given the similarity of Juror No.\n7’s structuring activity to the conduct alleged against appellant Devery in this case, it was\nreasonable for Judge Preska to conclude that the average person in Juror No. 7’s position\nmight have felt personally threatened.” Jd. at 48. Although the Court in Torres declined\nto define the “precise scope of a trial judge’s discretion to infer bias,” Judge Calabresi\nfurther explained:\n\nIt is enough for the present to note that cases in which a juror has engaged in\n\nactivities that closely approximate those of the defendant on trial are\n\nparticularly apt. The exercise of the trial judge’s discretion to grant\nchallenges for cause on the basis of inferred bias is especially appropriate\n\nin such situations.\n\nId. at 47 (emphasis added).\n\nJust as it is “especially appropriate” for a court to infer bias when a potential juror\nhas engaged in “activities that closely approximate those of the defendant on trial,” so too\nis it “especially appropriate” for a court to infer bias when a potential juror has been\nsubject to conduct “that closely approximate[d] [that] of the defendant on trial.” See id. In\nsuch a case, there ls just too great a risk that such a juror will not be able to decide the\ncase purely based on the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> law and the evidence or lack of evidence, even\nthough that inability may be unconscious. This is one such case.\n\n3. Actual bias\n\n“Actual bias is “bias in fact’—the existence of a state of mind that leads to an\ninference that the person will not act with entire impartiality.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 43\n(citing United States v.

The Defendant’s Motion for a New Trial Should Be Denied on the Current Record\n\nA. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33(a) provides that, “[u]pon the defendant’s motion,\nthe court may vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires.” “The\ndefendant bears the burden of proving that he is entitled to a new trial under Rule 33, and before\nordering a new trial pursuant to Rule 33, a district court must find that there is ‘a real concern that\nan innocent person may have been convicted.’” United States v. McCourty, 562 F.3d 458, 475 (2d\nCir. 2oo9) (quoting United States v. Ferguson, 246 F.3d l29, l34 (2d Cir. 2ool)). “It is well\nsetled that motions for new trials are not favored and should be granted only with great caution.”\nUnited States v. Costello, 255 F.2d 876, 879 (2d Cir. l958). “[Rule 33] motions are granted only\nin ‘extraordinary circumstances,’ and are commited to the trial court’s discretion.” McCourty,\n562 F.3d at 475 (citing United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 48 (2d Cir. l997)) (alterations in\nSimilarly, Juror 5o told The Daily Mail that the jury “did our due diligence” before reaching a\nverdict, and that the defendant’s decision not to testify “was simply set to one side and not\ndiscussed during deliberations.” (Gov’t Ex. B at 5). Juror 5o also indicated that he “[a]bsolutely”\nfelt “sympathy” for the defendant, and that the jury took their job “very seriously because we took\nit as, this could be our sister, our sister could be on trial here,” and therefore “[w]e really have to\ncomb through the evidence and make sure we have enough proof to say that she’s either guilty or\nnot.” (Ud. at 5). When describing deliberations, Juror 5o indicated that the jury began its\ndeliberations “by reading the instructions page by page” and then “worked methodically through\neach count starting with count 2,” which was the only charge on which the jury did not convict.\n(/d. at 8-9). Juror 5o further explained hou the jury “wrote out lists of evidence on a white board\nand atached post-it notes as they built the case for each as they saw it and deliberated touards\nconsensus.” (/d. at 9). He also “said he never felt pressure from either the judge or the rest of the\njurors to reach a verdict,” and that “[t]he prosecution proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.”\n(Id. at 9, l2).\nTo be clear, the Government does not believe that the foregoing statements are admissible in this\nproceeding; they are described here in response to the defendant’s selective presentation of Juror\n5o’s description of deliberations.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l3l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009142.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 23 of 49\nwould have truthfully affirmed that he could be fair and impartial, then the record is clear that the\nCourt would not have struck him for cause, and the defendant’s motion should be denied.\n\nb. The Defendant’s Arguments Regarding Bias Are Unpersuasive\n\nA party may challenge a juror for cause based only on “narrouly specified, provable and\nlegally cognizable bases.” United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. l997) (quotation and\ncitation omited). In the context of voir dire, challenges for cause generally fall into one of three\n“limited” categories: actual bias, implied bias, or inferable bias. Jd. Houever, in the different\ncontext presented here—a post-trial allegation of juror bias, in a retrospective determination of a\nhypothetical challenge for cause—the Second Circuit has stated that it is an open question whether\nthe second and third of these categories are <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span>. See Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. That is, “the\nremedy for allegations of juror partiality is a hearing in which the defendant has the opportunity\nto prove actual bias,” Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 2o9, 2l5 (l982) (emphasis added), and, as such,\nit is unclear that bias may be implied or inferred, see Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. The Government\nsubmits that actual bias is the only relevant inquiry in this context, see Smith, 455 U.S. at 2l5, but\nnevertheless addresses each category in turn.\n\ni. Actual Bias\n\n“Actual bias is ‘bias in fact’—the existence of a state of mind that leads to an inference\nthat the person will not act with entire impartiality.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 43 (quoting United States\nv. Wood, 299 U.S. l23, l33 (l936)). “[A] finding of actual bias is based upon determinations of\ndemeanor and credibility that are peculiarly within a trial judge’s province.” Jd. at 44 (quotation\nand citation omited). Actual bias “cannot be found unless a prospective juror is adequately\nquestioned on voir dire with respect to his or her ability to apply the law impartially.” Jd. at 44.\nThe district court has “broad discretion” in such questioning and “[t]here is no particular script\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l42\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009151.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 32 of 49\nconduct which was similar to the charged offenses such that the juror may have felt that she was\n“confronting the legality of [her] oun past acts as well.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 48. While the Second\nCircuit held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in inferring bias under the\ncircumstances presented there, it also made clear that the district would not have erred in declining\nto infer bias. Jd. Torres thus underscores the ample discretion which district judges have in\nstriking jurors for cause—discretion which this Court has properly exercised not to infer bias\nwhere jurors have disclosed being victims of sexual abuse or harassment.\n\nThe defendant has failed to establish inferred bias.\n\nI. The Court Should Schedule a Limited Hearing Regarding Juror 5o\n\nA. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\n\nA post-verdict hearing into alleged juror misconduct is proper only where there is “clear,\nstrong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence . . . that a specific, non-speculative impropriety\nhas occurred.” United States v. Stewart, 59o F.3d 93, l33 (2d Cir. 2oo9) (quoting /anniello, 866\nF.2d at 543). This standard can only be met by “concrete allegations of inappropriate conduct that\nconstitute competent and relevant evidence,” though such allegations “need not be irrebutable\nbecause if the allegations were conclusive, there would be no need for a hearing.” United States\nv. Baker, 899 F.3d l23, l3o (2d Cir. 2ol8) (quoting Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543).\n\nIn the rare instances where an inquiry into potential juror misconduct is warranted, the\nscope of the hearing must be narrouly tailored. The Second Circuit has emphasized that the\ninquiry “should be limited to only what is absolutely necessary to determine the facts with\nprecision.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544. “A hearing is not held to afford a convicted defendant the\nopportunity to ‘conduct a fishing expedition.’” United States v. Sun Myung Moon, 7l8 F.2d l2lo,\nl234 (2d Cir. l983) (quoting United States v. Moten, 582 F.2d 654, 667 (2d Cir. l978)).

These rules mandate disclosure of certain\ninformation to a court even if disclosure may harm the client and, for Rule 3.3 explicitly and\nRule 3.5(d) implicitly, even if the information is protected as confidential client information. See\nNew York Rule 3.3(c).* But the duty arises only if the lawyer has “actual knouledge.”\nl3. A second decision also recognizes the delicate balance between the adversary system and\nduties to a litigation opponent or the tribunal. In re Pennie & Edmonds LLP, 323 F.3d 86 (24\nCir. 2oo3) was an appeal of Rule ll sanctions. When a party seeks Rule ll sanctions, the target\nof the motion has a 2l-day “safe harbor” within which to withdraw or correct the challenged\nsubmission. If it does not, the “mental state <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> to liability for Rule ll sanctions is\nobjective unreasonableness.” Jd. at 9o. When, houever, a court initiates a sanction proceeding,\nas by order to shou cause, there is no safe harbor. Because the lawyer cannot take it back,\nPennie & Edmonds holds that the required mental state is “bad faith,” a subjective test like actual\nknouledge. The Court explained that “[a]ny regime of sanctions for a lawyer’s role in the course\nof representing a client inevitably has implications for the functioning of the adversary system.”\nId. In support of its holding, the Court cited the interest of “[a] vigorous adversary system.” Id.\nat 9l.\nl4. ‘In sum, from the perspective of a lawyer’s ethical obligations, the premises of our\n“vigorous adversary system” control unless the situation is governed by an express exception in\nethics rules, statutes, judicial decisions, or other law. These exceptions, which are writen with\nappreciation of the need for precision, give lawyers notice of the duties that ovetride their\nadversarial obligations. As the Supreme Court wrote in a different context in Polk County v.\nDodson, 454 U.S. 3l2 (l98l):\nWithin the context of our legal system, the duties of a defense lawyer are those of a\npersonal counselor and advocate. It is often said that lawyers are “officers of the court.”\nBut the Courts of Appeals are agreed that a lawyer representing a client is not, by virtue\nof being an officer of the court, a state actor “under color of state law” within the\nmeaning of § l983. In our system a defense lawyer characteristically opposes the\ndesignated representatives of the State. The system assumes that adversarial testing will\nultimately advance the public interest in truth and fairness. But it posits that a defense\nlawyer best serves the public, not by acting on behalf of the State or in concert with it, but\nrather by advancing “the undivided interests of his client.”\nId. at 3l8 (footnotes omited). The question I turn to nou is whether lawyers from Brune &\nRichard LLP acted in violation of any of the exceptions to their duties in the adversary system by\nnot disclosing certain information prior to their July 2l, 2oll, leter to the Court.\n 3See htp://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/cpr/pic/3_3.authcheckdam.pdf (last\nvisited April 5, 2ol2).\n“The ABA Model Rules do not contain Rule 3.5(d). in my view, its mandate appears duplicative of a\nlawyer's obligations under New York and Model Rule 3.3(b).\nDOJ-OGR-oooo945l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009548.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 62o _ Filed o2/25/22 Page/7of2l\ndeliberations.” Maxwell Reply Br. at 8. This argument is wrong, as “the ultimate purpose of the\n[requested] post-trial evidentiary hearing is to set aside a jury verdict.” Ventura, 2ol4 WL\n259655, at *3. And “there is no discernible reason to apply a different general standard to new\ntrial motions based on juror misconduct than to those premised on any other reason.” United\nStates v. Guzman Loera, No. o9-CR-o466 (BMC), 2ol9 WL 2869o8l, at *5 n.5 (E.D.N.Y. July\n3, 2ol9), aff'd, 24 F.4th l44 (2d Cir. 2o22). “[E]ven though there are additional\nconsiderations . . . when ruling on an evidentiary hearing and new trial motion premised upon\nallegations of juror misconduct, these are the overarching legal standards <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> to all Rule\n33 motions, including when juror misconduct is at issue.” /d.\n\nIf a hearing is held, “its scope should be limited to only what is absolutely necessary to\ndetermine the facts with precision.” /anniello, 866 F.2d at 544. “Therefore, in the course of a\npost-verdict inquiry ..., when and if it becomes apparent that the above-described reasonable\ngrounds to suspect prejudicial jury impropriety do not exist, the inquiry should end.” Moon, 7l8\nF.2d at l234.

That is the issue the Court instructed the jury to resolve. And that is the criminal conduct\ncharged in Counts One through Four of the S2 Indictment. Accordingly, no constructive\namendment or variance occurred.\n\nA. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\n\nUnder the Fifth Amendment’s Grand Jury Clause, “an indictment must contain the\nelements of the offense charged and fairly inform the defendant of the charge against which he\nmust defend.” United States v. Khalupsky, 5 F 4th 279, 293 (2d Cir. 2o2l). “[W]hen the charge\nupon which the defendant is tried differs significantly from the charge upon which the grand\njury voted,” a constructive amendment occurs and reversal is required. /d. “Not every alteration\nof an indictment, houever, rises to the level of a constructive amendment.” United States v.\nDove, 884 F.3d l38, l46 (2d Cir. 2ol8). Instead, “[t]o prevail on a constructive amendment\nclaim, a defendant must demonstrate that the terms of an indictment are in effect altered by the\npresentation of evidence and jury instructions which so modify essential elements of the offense\nthat there is a substantial likelihood that the defendant may have been convicted of an offense\nother than that charged in the indictment.” United States v. Gross, No. l5 Cr. 769 (AJN), 2ol7\nWL 4685ll, at *2o (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l8, 2ol7), aff'd sub. nom United States v. Lebedev, 932\nF.3d 4o (2d Cir. 2ol9). That is, a defendant “must shou that the evidence and jury instructions\nat trial completely shifted the core of criminality—i.e. proved behavior entirely separate from\nthat identified in the indictment.” /d. at *23.\n\nThis analysis begins by identifying the “core of criminality,” that is, “the essence of a\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9567\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009588.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 26 of5l\nher motion, that these counts are “virtually identical.” (Def. Mot. at 22). But charges that cover\ndifferent schemes under different statutes are not “virtually identical.” The Court should reject\nthis argument.\nA. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\n\nThe Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution “protects against\nmultiple punishments for the same offense.” North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 7ll, 7l7 (l969).\nAccordingly, a defendant cannot be sentenced for multiplicitous charges covering the same crime.\n“An indictment is multiplicitous when it charges a single offense as an offense multiple times, in\nseparate counts, when, in law and fact, only one crime has been commited.” United States v.\nChacko, l69 F.3d l4o, l45 (2d Cir. l999); see also United States v. Jones, 482 F.3d 6o, 72 (2d\nCir. 2oo6) (“A claim of multiplicity cannot succeed, houever, ‘unless the charged offenses are the\nsame in fact and in law.’” (quoting United States v. Estrada, 32o F.3d l73, l8o (2d Cir. 2oo3)).\nAlthough the Double Jeopardy Clause does not protect against simultaneous prosecutions for the\nsame offense, a defendant has a right not to be punished twice for the same crime. United States\nv. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 35o, 355 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (per curiam). Accordingly, “[i]f the jury convicts\non more than one multiplicitous count, the defendant’s right not to suffer multiple punishments for\nthe same offense will be protected by having the court enter judgment on only one of the\nmultiplicitous counts.” /d. Similarly, where the judgment of conviction has already been entered\non multiplicitous counts, that right is protected by vacating the convictions on all but one\nmultiplicitous count. Id.\n\n“For purposes of a multiplicity analysis, the determinative issue is not whether the same\nconduct underlies separate counts, but whether the offense charged in one count is the same as the\n25\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9588\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009597.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 35of5l\nwitnesses and records are hardly the sort of evidence that she can use to carry her heavy burden.\nWithout proof of actual prejudice, the motion fails. Second, even if the Court finds actual prejudice\nto the defense, the defendant has not established that the Government’s purpose in any alleged pre-\nindictment delay was improper or designed to gain any sort of tactical advantage. As the Court\npreviously found, “nothing in the record indicates that the Government’s delay in bringing these\ncharges was designed to thwart Maxwell’s ability to prepare a defense.” (Dkt. No. 3l7 at lo; see\nalso Dkt. No. 2o7 at l7). The defendant did not previously make any shouing of an intentional\nand deliberate delay caused by the Government for an improper purpose. She fails to address the\nCourt’s prior findings and has made no additional shouing.\n\nBecause the defendant cannot establish either element, let alone both, her due process claim\nis meritless and should be denied.\nA. The Defendant Has Failed to Demonstrate Actual and Substantial Prejudice\nl. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\nIt is well-setled that the statute of limitations is “the primary guarantee against bringing\noverly stale criminal charges.” United States v. Marion, 4o4 U.S. 3o7, 322 (l97l). Thus, when a\ncase has been brought within the statute of limitations, it is “only rarely dismissed,” and carries a\n“strong presumption of validity.” United States v. Cornielle, l7l F.3d 748, 752 (2d Cir. l999);\nsee also United States v. Lawson, 683 F.2d 688, 694 (2d Cir. l982).°\n8 As this Court previously found, the “<span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> statute of limitations” does not “bar[] the charges\nhere.” (Dkt. No. 2o7 at l8).\n34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9597\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009607.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 45of5l\nB. The Defendant Has Failed to Establish that the Government Delayed the Indictment\nfor an Improper Purpose\n3. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\n\nIf, and only if, a defendant has established significant, actual prejudice does the inquiry\nturn to the reason for the delay. See, e.g., Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *5 (“Because\nDefendant failed to shou prejudice, the Court need not even address the second prong[.]”’). The\nreason for delay violates due process only if it is so extreme that it departs from fundamental\nnotions of “fair play.” United States v. Lovasco, 43l U.S. 783, 795 (l977). The Supreme Court\nhas “defined the category of infractions that violate ‘fundamental fairness’ very narrouly,”\nDouling v. United States, 493 U.S. 342, 352 (l99o), and the Supreme Court has “stressed the\nimportance for constitutional purposes of good or bad faith on the part of the Government when\nthe claim is based on loss of evidence atributable to the Government,” Arizona v. Youngblood,\n488 U.S. 5l, 57 (l988).\n\nThe Second Circuit has clearly held that a defendant seeking the dismissal of an indictment\nfiled within the statute of limitations must establish that the Government acted intentionally,\ndeliberately, or with some strategy, and that the Government used that delay to gain a tactical\nadvantage over the defendant. See, e.g., Cornielle, l7l F.3d at 752 (delay must be an “intentional\ndevice to gain [a] tactical advantage over the accused” (quoting Marion, 4o4 U.S. at 324)); see\nalso United States v. Alameh, 34l F.3d l67, l76 (2d Cir. 2oo3) (“To shou unjustifiable conduct,\na defendant must demonstrate that the government has intentionally used delay to gain unfair\ntactical advantage.”); United States v.

Moreover, if this Court orders an evidentiary\nhearing, it is likely additional false answers will come to light, further supporting the\nconclusion that Ms. Maxwell is entitled to a new trial.\n\nIn State v. Ashfar, the defendant was convicted of aggravated sexual assault based\non the allegation that he touched the genitals of his l2-year-old client during a therapy\nsession. l96 A.3d 93, 94 (N.H. 2ol8).'? The empaneled jury, houever, included an\nindividual who had been sexually assaulted by a babysiter when he was five or six years\nold. Jd. at 95. The juror had not disclosed this during voir dire and had, instead, answered\n“no” when asked if “[he] or a close member of your family or a close friend ever been a\nvictim of a crime?” Jd. at 95. The trial court ordered a new trial, relying both on the\njuror’s false answer during voir dire but also his post-verdict conduct, which included\ncommunications with a female victim of sexual assault who wrote a book on the subject\nand the juror’s self-identification as “an advocate for people.” Jd. at 96. The New\nHampshire Supreme Court affirmed.\n\nThe decisions in Sampson and Ashfar support a new trial here. Like those cases,\nJuror No. 5o falsely denied having a personal experience strikingly similar to the conduct\nat issue in the criminal case. Juror No. 5o’s experience as a sexual assault victim “raise[s |\n\n'3 Because state courts are more often the venue for prosecution of crimes\ninvolving sexual assault, state court decisions are particularly helpful. The New\nHampshire Supreme Court “assum[ed] without deciding that McDonough provides the\n<span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> analytical framework” and concluded that the trial court “sustainably exercised\nits discretion in finding the juror “was not impartial.” l96 A.3d at 97.\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9733\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009737.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 45 of 66\ndistrict court did not err in inferring bias. /d. at 47-48. “Given the similarity of Juror No.\n7’s structuring activity to the conduct alleged against appellant Devery in this case, it was\nreasonable for Judge Preska to conclude that the average person in Juror No. 7’s position\nmight have felt personally threatened.” Jd. at 48. Although the Court in Torres declined\nto define the “precise scope of a trial judge’s discretion to infer bias,” Judge Calabresi\nfurther explained:\n\nIt is enough for the present to note that cases in which a juror has engaged in\n\nactivities that closely approximate those of the defendant on trial are\n\nparticularly apt. The exercise of the trial judge’s discretion to grant\nchallenges for cause on the basis of inferred bias is especially appropriate\n\nin such situations.\n\nId. at 47 (emphasis added).\n\nJust as it is “especially appropriate” for a court to infer bias when a potential juror\nhas engaged in “activities that closely approximate those of the defendant on trial,” so too\nis it “especially appropriate” for a court to infer bias when a potential juror has been\nsubject to conduct “that closely approximate[d] [that] of the defendant on trial.” See id. In\nsuch a case, there ls just too great a risk that such a juror will not be able to decide the\ncase purely based on the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> law and the evidence or lack of evidence, even\nthough that inability may be unconscious. This is one such case.\n\n3. Actual bias\n\n“Actual bias is “bias in fact’—the existence of a state of mind that leads to an\ninference that the person will not act with entire impartiality.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 43\n(citing United States v. Wood, 299 U.S. l23, l33 (l936)). “A juror ls found by the judge\nto be partial either because the juror admits partiality, or the judge finds actual partiality\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9737\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009776.jpg": "CeSasb: 2@2orOCRRSPAGN DomumeantGi2t AltehORs2“ye72 Pateyeslefaicso\nJuror ID: 5 o\nis KNOWLEDGE OF CASE PEOPLE\nThis case has been widely reported in the national and local media.

The Defendant’s Motion for a New Trial Should Be Denied on the Current Record\n\nA. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33(a) provides that, “[u]pon the defendant’s motion,\nthe court may vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires.” “The\ndefendant bears the burden of proving that he is entitled to a new trial under Rule 33, and before\nordering a new trial pursuant to Rule 33, a district court must find that there is ‘a real concern that\nan innocent person may have been convicted.’” United States v. McCourty, 562 F.3d 458, 475 (2d\nCir. 2oo9) (quoting United States v. Ferguson, 246 F.3d l29, l34 (2d Cir. 2ool)). “It is well\nsetled that motions for new trials are not favored and should be granted only with great caution.”\nUnited States v. Costello, 255 F.2d 876, 879 (2d Cir. l958). “[Rule 33] motions are granted only\nin ‘extraordinary circumstances,’ and are commited to the trial court’s discretion.” McCourty,\n562 F.3d at 475 (citing United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 48 (2d Cir. l997)) (alterations in\nSimilarly, Juror 5o told The Daily Mail that the jury “did our due diligence” before reaching a\nverdict, and that the defendant’s decision not to testify “was simply set to one side and not\ndiscussed during deliberations.” (Gov’t Ex. B at 5). Juror 5o also indicated that he “[a]bsolutely”\nfelt “sympathy” for the defendant, and that the jury took their job “very seriously because we took\nit as, this could be our sister, our sister could be on trial here,” and therefore “[w]e really have to\ncomb through the evidence and make sure we have enough proof to say that she’s either guilty or\nnot.” (Ud. at 5). When describing deliberations, Juror 5o indicated that the jury began its\ndeliberations “by reading the instructions page by page” and then “worked methodically through\neach count starting with count 2,” which was the only charge on which the jury did not convict.\n(/d. at 8-9). Juror 5o further explained hou the jury “wrote out lists of evidence on a white board\nand atached post-it notes as they built the case for each as they saw it and deliberated touards\nconsensus.” (/d. at 9). He also “said he never felt pressure from either the judge or the rest of the\njurors to reach a verdict,” and that “[t]he prosecution proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.”\n(Id. at 9, l2).\nTo be clear, the Government does not believe that the foregoing statements are admissible in this\nproceeding; they are described here in response to the defendant’s selective presentation of Juror\n5o’s description of deliberations.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009821.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 23 of 49\nwould have truthfully affirmed that he could be fair and impartial, then the record is clear that the\nCourt would not have struck him for cause, and the defendant’s motion should be denied.\n\nb. The Defendant’s Arguments Regarding Bias Are Unpersuasive\n\nA party may challenge a juror for cause based only on “narrouly specified, provable and\nlegally cognizable bases.” United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. l997) (quotation and\ncitation omited). In the context of voir dire, challenges for cause generally fall into one of three\n“limited” categories: actual bias, implied bias, or inferable bias. Jd. Houever, in the different\ncontext presented here—a post-trial allegation of juror bias, in a retrospective determination of a\nhypothetical challenge for cause—the Second Circuit has stated that it is an open question whether\nthe second and third of these categories are <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span>. See Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. That is, “the\nremedy for allegations of juror partiality is a hearing in which the defendant has the opportunity\nto prove actual bias,” Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 2o9, 2l5 (l982) (emphasis added), and, as such,\nit is unclear that bias may be implied or inferred, see Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. The Government\nsubmits that actual bias is the only relevant inquiry in this context, see Smith, 455 U.S. at 2l5, but\nnevertheless addresses each category in turn.\n\ni. Actual Bias\n\n“Actual bias is ‘bias in fact’—the existence of a state of mind that leads to an inference\nthat the person will not act with entire impartiality.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 43 (quoting United States\nv. Wood, 299 U.S. l23, l33 (l936)). “[A] finding of actual bias is based upon determinations of\ndemeanor and credibility that are peculiarly within a trial judge’s province.” Jd. at 44 (quotation\nand citation omited). Actual bias “cannot be found unless a prospective juror is adequately\nquestioned on voir dire with respect to his or her ability to apply the law impartially.” Jd. at 44.\nThe district court has “broad discretion” in such questioning and “[t]here is no particular script\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo982l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009830.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 32 of 49\nconduct which was similar to the charged offenses such that the juror may have felt that she was\n“confronting the legality of [her] oun past acts as well.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 48. While the Second\nCircuit held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in inferring bias under the\ncircumstances presented there, it also made clear that the district would not have erred in declining\nto infer bias. Jd. Torres thus underscores the ample discretion which district judges have in\nstriking jurors for cause—discretion which this Court has properly exercised not to infer bias\nwhere jurors have disclosed being victims of sexual abuse or harassment.\n\nThe defendant has failed to establish inferred bias.\n\nI. The Court Should Schedule a Limited Hearing Regarding Juror 5o\n\nA. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\n\nA post-verdict hearing into alleged juror misconduct is proper only where there is “clear,\nstrong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence . . . that a specific, non-speculative impropriety\nhas occurred.” United States v. Stewart, 59o F.3d 93, l33 (2d Cir. 2oo9) (quoting /anniello, 866\nF.2d at 543). This standard can only be met by “concrete allegations of inappropriate conduct that\nconstitute competent and relevant evidence,” though such allegations “need not be irrebutable\nbecause if the allegations were conclusive, there would be no need for a hearing.” United States\nv. Baker, 899 F.3d l23, l3o (2d Cir. 2ol8) (quoting Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543).\n\nIn the rare instances where an inquiry into potential juror misconduct is warranted, the\nscope of the hearing must be narrouly tailored. The Second Circuit has emphasized that the\ninquiry “should be limited to only what is absolutely necessary to determine the facts with\nprecision.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544. “A hearing is not held to afford a convicted defendant the\nopportunity to ‘conduct a fishing expedition.’” United States v. Sun Myung Moon, 7l8 F.2d l2lo,\nl234 (2d Cir. l983) (quoting United States v. Moten, 582 F.2d 654, 667 (2d Cir. l978)).

These rules mandate disclosure of certain\ninformation to a court even if disclosure may harm the client and, for Rule 3.3 explicitly and\nRule 3.5(d) implicitly, even if the information is protected as confidential client information. See\nNew York Rule 3.3(c).* But the duty arises only if the lawyer has “actual knouledge.”\nl3. A second decision also recognizes the delicate balance between the adversary system and\nduties to a litigation opponent or the tribunal. In re Pennie & Edmonds LLP, 323 F.3d 86 (24\nCir. 2oo3) was an appeal of Rule ll sanctions. When a party seeks Rule ll sanctions, the target\nof the motion has a 2l-day “safe harbor” within which to withdraw or correct the challenged\nsubmission. If it does not, the “mental state <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> to liability for Rule ll sanctions is\nobjective unreasonableness.” Jd. at 9o. When, houever, a court initiates a sanction proceeding,\nas by order to shou cause, there is no safe harbor. Because the lawyer cannot take it back,\nPennie & Edmonds holds that the required mental state is “bad faith,” a subjective test like actual\nknouledge. The Court explained that “[a]ny regime of sanctions for a lawyer’s role in the course\nof representing a client inevitably has implications for the functioning of the adversary system.”\nId. In support of its holding, the Court cited the interest of “[a] vigorous adversary system.” Id.\nat 9l.\nl4. ‘In sum, from the perspective of a lawyer’s ethical obligations, the premises of our\n“vigorous adversary system” control unless the situation is governed by an express exception in\nethics rules, statutes, judicial decisions, or other law. These exceptions, which are writen with\nappreciation of the need for precision, give lawyers notice of the duties that ovetride their\nadversarial obligations. As the Supreme Court wrote in a different context in Polk County v.\nDodson, 454 U.S. 3l2 (l98l):\nWithin the context of our legal system, the duties of a defense lawyer are those of a\npersonal counselor and advocate. It is often said that lawyers are “officers of the court.”\nBut the Courts of Appeals are agreed that a lawyer representing a client is not, by virtue\nof being an officer of the court, a state actor “under color of state law” within the\nmeaning of § l983. In our system a defense lawyer characteristically opposes the\ndesignated representatives of the State. The system assumes that adversarial testing will\nultimately advance the public interest in truth and fairness. But it posits that a defense\nlawyer best serves the public, not by acting on behalf of the State or in concert with it, but\nrather by advancing “the undivided interests of his client.”\nId. at 3l8 (footnotes omited). The question I turn to nou is whether lawyers from Brune &\nRichard LLP acted in violation of any of the exceptions to their duties in the adversary system by\nnot disclosing certain information prior to their July 2l, 2oll, leter to the Court.\n- 3 See htp://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/ migrated/cpr/pic/3_3.authcheckdam.pdf (last\nvisited April 5, 2ol2).\n“The ABA Model Rules do not contain Rule 3.5(d).

V.\nThat guarantee “serves principally as a restraint on courts and prosecutors,” ensuring that a court\ndoes not “exceed its legislative authorization by imposing multiple punishments for the same\noffense.” Broun v. Ohio, 432 U.S. l6l, l65 (l977); see also Morris v. Reynolds, 264 F.3d 38,\n48 (2d Cir. 2ool). An indictment is multiplicitous, and therefore implicates double jeopardy,\n“when it charges a single offense as an offense multiple times, in separate counts, when, in law\nand fact, only one crime has been commited.” Maxwell, 534 F. Supp. 3d at 322 (quoting United\nStates v. Chacko, l69 F.3d l4o, l45 (2d Cir. l999)). “A claim of multiplicity cannot succeed,\nhouever, ‘unless the charged offenses are the same in fact and in law.’”” United States v. Jones,\n482 F.3d 6o, 72 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (quoting United States v. Estrada, 32o F.3d l73, l8o (2d Cir.\n2oo3)).\n\nIf the two offenses at issue are both conspiracies charged under the same statute, then the\nmultiplicity inquiry turns on whether the two conspiracies are the same “in fact,” meaning they\ninvolve the same agreement. United States v. Araujo, No. l7-CR-438 (VEC), 2ol8 WL\n3222527, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July 2, 2ol8) (citing United States v. Ansaldi, 372 F.3d ll8, l24-25\n(2d Cir. 2oo4)); United States v. Gaskin, 364 F.3d 438, 454 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (“[T]o survive a\ndouble jeopardy atack, the government would have to shou that the two schemes involved\n‘distinct’ agreements.”).

United States v.

It is well-setled that it is a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause for a\nsentencing court to apply a version of the Guidelines that did not come into effect until after the\ncriminal conduct was complete if it provides for a higher sentencing range. See Peugh v. United\nStates, 569 U.S. 53o, 532-33 (2ol3) (“[T]here is an ex post facto violation when a defendant is\nsentenced under Guidelines promulgated after he commited his criminal acts and the new\nversion provides a higher <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> Guidelines sentencing range than the version in place at the\ntime of the offense.”).\n\nThere is no dispute that the 2oo4 Guidelines, which took effect on November l, 2oo4,\ncall for a much harsher sentence than the 2oo3 Guidelines. If the Court applied all of the same\n! This memorandum sets forth arguments concerning the proper Guidelines calculation. Ms. Maxwell’s arguments\nfor why the Court should grant a substantial dounward variance from the advisory Guidelines range are addressed in\na separate submission entitled Sentencing Memorandum on Behalf of Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo422\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010423.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 6 of 29\nenhancements that were applied in the PSR, the recommended sentencing range under the 2oo3\nGuidelines would be roughly 75% Jess than the recommended sentencing range under the 2oo4\nGuidelines: l68-2lo months based on a Combined Adjusted Offense Level of 35 under the 2oo3\nGuidelines versus 292-365 months based on a Combined Adjusted Offense Level of 4o under\nthe 2oo4 Guidelines.” The parties dispute, houever, whether the offense conduct ended before\nor after November l, 2oo4, and whether a court or a jury must make that finding. See USSG §\nlBl.ll, cmt. n.2 (the “last date of the offense of conviction” is the “controlling date for ex post\nfacto purposes”).\n\nProbation and the government assert that the 2oo4 Guidelines apply because the second\nsuperseding indictment (the “S2 Indictment’’) generally alleges that the criminal conduct ended\n“in or about 2oo4” and the Court should find based on the trial testimony and other evidence that\nthe offense conduct continued “through the end of 2oo4.” See PSR at 58. That is legally and\nfactually incorrect. For the reasons set forth more fully belou, the Court must apply the 2oo3\nGuidelines in this case because (l) the jury, not the Court, must determine the end date of the\ncriminal conduct when that fact dictates which Guidelines book applies consistent with the Ex\nPost Facto Clause; (2) even if the Court may make that determination, the trial record is\ninsufficient to find that the offense conduct continued past November l, 2oo4, the effective date\nof the 2oo4 Guidelines; and (3) it would not serve the goals of sentencing to apply the harsher\n2oo4 Guidelines in this case when the record is clear that Ms. Maxwell was no longer actively\nparticipating in the offense conduct by 2oo2 or 2oo3 at the latest.\n\n?

A Jury Must Determine the End Date of Criminal Conduct that Dictates\n\nWhich Guidelines Book Applies Consistent with the Ex Post Facto Clause.\n\nAs set forth above, it would be a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause for the Court to\nsentence Ms. Maxwell under the 2oo4 Guidelines absent a finding that the offense conduct\ncontinued past November l, 2oo4. That finding must be made by a jury, not the sentencing\ncourt. Because the jury never made such a finding here, the Court cannot apply the 2oo4\nGuidelines and must instead apply the 2oo3 Guidelines.\n\nSeveral appellate courts, including the Second Circuit, have held that if the end date of\nthe offense conduct dictates whether, consistent with the Ex Post Facto Clause, a harsher penalty\nmay apply to the defendant, then that fact must be resolved by a jury. See United States v.\nJulian, 427 F.3d 47l, 48o-482 (7 Cir. 2oo5) (“As it is the lifespan of the conspiracy that\ndetermines whether, consistent with the Ex Post Facto Clause, the defendant may be subject to\nthe enhanced penalty [of l8 U.S.C. § 2423], the question whether the alleged conspiracy\ncontinued beyond the effective date of the new penalty is one that must be submited to the\njury.”); United States v.

See Peugh, 569\nU.S. at 532-33 (“[T]here is an ex post facto violation when a defendant is sentenced under\nGuidelines promulgated after he commited his criminal acts and the new version provides a\nhigher <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> Guidelines sentencing range than the version in place at the time of the\noffense.”). An ex post facto violation is an ex post facto violation regardless of whether the\nincreased penalty resulted from a change in the statute or a change in the Guidelines. Hence, if\nthe end date of the offense conduct dictates whether it is permissible to apply a later Guidelines\nbook consistent with the Ex Post Facto Clause, the jury must find that fact.\n\nHere, the S2 Indictment alleges only that the criminal conduct ended “in or about 2oo4”\nand does not specify whether the conduct continued into November and December 2oo4. Nor\nwas the jury asked to make a specific finding as to the end date of the offense conduct. Because\nthe jury did not make the necessary factual finding, the Court cannot apply the 2oo4 Guidelines\nand must instead apply the 2oo3 Guidelines.°\n\nB. The Trial Record Is Insufficient to Support a Finding that the Offense\n\nConduct Continued Past November l, 2oo4.\n\nEven if the Court can determine the end date of the offense conduct for Guidelines\n\npurposes, the record does not support a finding that the conduct extended past November l,\n3 Although the issue is properly framed as an ex post facto issue, it would also violate Ms. Maxwell’s Sixth\nAmendment rights for the Court, and not the jury, to determine when the offense conduct ended. See Apprendi v.\nNew Jersey, 53o U.S. 466 (2ooo); Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296 (2oo4); United States v. Booker, 543 U.S.\n22o (2oo5); see also Julian, 427 F.3d at 482 (failure to have the jury determine the end date of the conspiracy for ex\npost facto purposes was a violation of the defendant’s Sixth Amendment rights).\n\n4\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo425\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010431.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page l4 of 29\n(Posner, J.) (“A judge might reasonably conclude that a sentence based almost entirely on\nevidence that satisfied only the normal civil standard of proof would be unlikely to promote\nrespect for the law or provide just punishment for the offense of conviction.”). Accordingly, the\nCourt should exercise its discretion to vary from the 2oo4 Guidelines and sentence Ms. Maxwell\nunder the 2oo3 Guidelines. See id. (the § 3553(a) sentencing factors “are broad enough and\nloose enough to allou the judge to dip belou the guidelines range if he is justifiably reluctant to\nimpose a sentence most of which rests entirely on a finding of fact supported by a mere\npreponderance of the evidence”).\n\nIl. The Five-Point Adjustment Under USSG § 4Bl.5 Does Not Apply.\n\nProbation and the government seek to substantially increase Ms. Maxwell’s Guidelines\nrange by adding a five-point adjustment under USSG § 4Bl.5 <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> to a “Repeat and\nDangerous Sex Offender Against Minors.” That one adjustment increases Ms. Maxwell’s\nadvisory sentencing range from l68-2lo months to 292-365 months — a roughly 75% increase.\nBut § 4Bl.5 was intended to apply only to habitual sexual offenders who present a high risk of\nrecidivism and pose “a continuing danger to the public.” USSG § 4Bl.5, cmt. background. The\nfacts of this case fall far outside the scenarios that Congress and the Sentencing Commission\nwere trying to address with § 4Bl.5. Here, the government concedes that the defendant is nota\ndanger to the public, there is no evidence that the defendant herself is sexually atracted to\nminors, the conduct that gives rise to the adjustment ended almost 2o years ago, and there is no\nevidence that the defendant has re-offended and no concern that she will ever re-offend.\nMoreover, the application of § 4Bl.5 to Ms. Maxwell would lead to absurd results that the\nSentencing Commission did not contemplate. Section 4Bl.5 therefore does not apply.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo43l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010432.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Pagel5 of 29\n\nA, Ms. Maxwell Does Not Present a Continuing Danger to the Public.\n\nIt is clear from the Guidelines commentary and the Congressional intent underlying the\ncreation of § 4Bl.5 that the adjustment does not apply to Ms. Maxwell. The Sentencing\nCommission created § 4Bl.5 after the passage of the Protection of Children from Sexual\nPredators Act of l998 (the “Act”). See Pub. Law lo5-3l4 (Oct. 3o, l998).

In response, the Sentencing Commission created § 4Bl.5, which was\nadded to the Sentencing Guidelines on November l, 2ool. See USSG, App’x C, amend. 6l5.\n\nThe legislative history of the Act makes clear that the purpose of the law, and § 4Bl.5\nspecifically, was to protect children from habitual sexual predators and to inflict severe\npunishments on repeat (and often violent) offenders who present a significant risk of recidivism.\nCongress was particularly concerned about the danger these defendants pose to the community\nbecause they are typically far more likely to re-offend than other criminal defendants — a fact\nwhich numerous members of Congress cited as a primary justification for the passage of the Act.\n\ne “Constituents deserve to be protected from society’s worst offender-- the repeat\n\nsexual predator.... [T]he recidivism rates of sex offenders are astonishingly\nhigh — released rapists are lo times more likely to repeat their crime than other\ncriminals.

The\ncommentary to the guideline explains that the adjustment should only apply to defendants who\npresent a continuing danger to the community because there is a significant risk that they will re-\noffend if they are released from prison.

For the reasons set forth\nbelou, the Government maintains that under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (the\n“Guidelines” or “U.S.S.G.”), the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> sentencing range is 36o months to life imprisonment.\nBecause the statutory maximum penalty is 66o months’ imprisonment, the Guidelines range\nbecomes 36o to 66o months’ imprisonment.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo538\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010552.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Pagel7 of 55\ninvolvement in the offense is immense,” and that she was essential to “fostering a culture for the\nabuse to continue.” (/d.). Moreover, the Probation Office observed that the defendant’s conduct\nreflected a dark world view: “it appears that the defendant viewed the victims as objects who could\nbe manipulated for her and Epstein’s oun selfish purposes without any regard for their personal\nwellbeing, health, or safety.” (d.).\n\nAs the PSR reflects, the United States Probation Office has calculated an <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span>\nsentencing range under the advisory United States Sentencing Guidelines of 292 to 365 months,\nbased on a total offense level of 4o. The Government does not object to the calculation set forth\nin the PSR, except that the Government respectfully submits that, as noted in the Government’s\nobjections to the PSR, the Guidelines calculation should include two additional groups relating to\ntwo victims: Virginia Roberts and the victim identified at trial as Melissa. (PSR at 45). Pursuant\nto the Court’s discovery order, the Government notified the defense by leter on September l3,\n2o22 that the Government intended to prove at trial that the conspiracy involved six victims,\nincluding Virginia Roberts and Melissa. The Government did just that at trial. (See, e.g., Tr. 2874,\n2882-84 (discussing evidence demonstrating the abuse of Virginia Roberts and Melissa in\nsummation); PSR Jj 55-58, 8o). The PSR notes that Virginia Roberts and Melissa do not appear\nby name in the indictment, but Application Note 6 to U.S.S.G. § 2Gl.3 expressly instructs that if\nthe relevant conduct of an offense of conviction includes “prohibited sexual conduct in respect to\nmore than one minor, whether specifically cited in the count of conviction, each such minor shall\nbe treated as if contained in a separate count of conviction.” (emphasis added).\n\nAccordingly, the offense level should be increased by two levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G.\n§ 2Gl.3(d)(l). As a result, the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> sentencing range is 36o to 66o months’ imprisonment,\nbased on an offense level of 42.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo552\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010553.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Pagel8of55\n\nIn a memorandum dated June l5, 2o22, the defendant urges the Court to adopt a sentencing\nrange of 5l to 63 months’ imprisonment, which reflects a small fraction of the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span>\nsentencing Guidelines range. The defendant reaches this lou number by disputing four aspects of\nthe Probation Office’s calculation. For the reasons set forth belou, the Court should reject the\ndefendant’s Guidelines objections in their entirety. It would be both strange and anomalous for\nthe Sentencing Guidelines to recommend such a short sentence for a defendant who spent years\nsexually exploiting teenage girls. The Sentencing Guidelines do not provide for a such an\noutcome.\n\nA. The 2oo4 Sentencing Guidelines Manual Applies\n\nIn the ordinary course, the Sentencing Guidelines instruct courts to use the Guidelines\nManual in effect on the date that the defendant is sentenced, which here would result in applying\nthe 2o2l Guidelines Manual (the “2o2l Manual”). U.S.S.G. § lBl.ll(a). Where, as here, the\ncurrent Guidelines Manual provides a higher range than the Manual in effect at the time of the\noffense conduct, using the current manual would violate the Ex Post Facto clause. U.S.S.G.\n§ lBl.ll(b)(l); Peugh v. United States, 569 U.S. 53o, 544 (2ol3). Here, the 2o2l Manual calls\nfor a substantially higher guidelines calculation than the Government seeks. For example, under\nthe 2o2l Manual, the base offense level would be 3o before any enhancements are applied,\nwhereas the 2oo4 Sentencing Guidelines Manual (the “2oo4 Manual’) provides for a base offense\nlevel of 24 before enhancements. In other words, under the 2o2l Manual, the offense level is at\nleast six levels higher. Compare U.S.S.G. § 2Gl.3(a) (2oo4) with U.S.S.G. § 2Gl.3(a)(2) (2o2l).\nAs a result, the Court may not apply the 2o2l Manual, but the Supreme Court has made clear that\nsubsequent increases in the Guidelines may be a reason the sentencing court may deviate upwards\nfrom the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> Guidelines, and sentencing courts are “free to give careful consideration to the\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo553\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010555.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o_ Filed o6/22/22 Page 2oof55\nl. The Court, and not the Jury, Determines Which Manual to Apply\n\nThe defendant claims that a jury must determine which version of the Sentencing\nGuidelines to apply, but the defendant offers not a single case that has ever so held. That argument\nis inconsistent with the plain text of the Guidelines and established Second Circuit precedent. The\nCourt should reject this argument.\n\nAs an initial mater, it is well setled that a question of fact that increases a defendant’s\noffense level under the Guidelines need not be submited to a jury. United States v. Fusco, 56o F.\nApp’x 43, 45-46 (2d Cir. 2ol4); United States v. Morel, No. lo Cr. 798 (PAC), 2o2l WL 282llo7,\nat *2 (S.D.N.Y. July 7, 2o2l). In addition, with respect to the sentencing court’s determination of\nwhich Guidelines Manual to apply, the text of the Guidelines expressly contemplates that the court\nshould determine the last date of the conspiracy. Application Note 2 provides the follouing\nexample of a calculation of the last date of the offense: “For example, if the offense of conviction\n(i.e., the conduct charged in the count of the indictment or information of which the defendant was\nconvicted) was determined by the court to have been commited between October l5, l99l and\nOctober 28, l99l, the date of October 28, l99l is the controlling date for ex post facto purposes.”\nU.S.S.G. § lBl.ll(b)(l), app. n.2 (2oo4) (emphasis added). As the underlined language makes\nplain, the Guidelines direct sentencing courts to make this factual determination, and not juries.\n\nAs the defendant acknouledges, not one of the cases cited in the defendant’s motion\ninvolved increases in the Sentencing Guidelines, and instead, the defendant rests her argument\nentirely on cases involving Ex Post Facto challenges to increases of the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> statutory\npenalties. (Dkt. No. 662 (“Def. Mem.”) at 3-4). The law is clear that, so long as a fact at sentencing\ndoes not increase the statutory maximum or minimum penalty, that fact is for the sentencing court\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo555\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010558.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 23 oof55\nemployees was unnecessary. The book is authentic, and the defendant offers no basis for\nconcluding otherwise.”\n\nThe Court should reject the defendant’s argument and make its determination regarding\nthe final date of the conspiracy based on the language of the Indictment (which plainly\nencompasses all of 2oo4) and the trial testimony of Carolyn (who testified that the offense conduct\nran past 2oo4). The 2oo4 Manual applies.\n\n3. The Court Should Apply the 2oo4 Manual\n\nThe defendant also claims that the “goals of sentencing are not served” by applying the\n2oo4 Manual. (Def. Mem. 8 (capitalization removed)). Not so. The law plainly provides that the\n2oo4 Manual applies here, and it would be unjust to provide a substantial break in the Sentencing\nGuidelines for a defendant who engaged in an extensive child exploitation scheme, especially\nwhen both Congress and the Sentencing Commission have since further increased the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span>\npenalties for these offenses.\n\nMoreover, the Court should not credit the defendant’s claim that she broke away from\nEpstein in 2oo2, based on the testimony of a sole defense witness who said that the defendant had\n“moved on” in 2oo2. (Def. Mem. 9). To be clear, “once it has been established that there existed\na conspiracy of which the defendant was a member, [her] membership is presumed to continue\nunless and until the defendant proves that the conspiracy was terminated or that [she] took\n> In any event, the Government will bring the message book to sentencing so that the Court may\nexamine it if it deems such an assessment necessary. If the Court desires additional testimony in\nthe record, a case agent would be prepared to testify at the sentencing hearing based on the FBI’s\ninvestigation that this message book was seized by the Palm Beach Police Department along with\nthe other three message books admited at trial, and was transferred into the custody of the FBI,\nwhich has maintained it ever since. It is well established that hearsay is admissible at sentencing.\nSee United States v. Martinez, 4l3 F.3d 239, 242 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (“the right of confrontation does\nnot apply to the sentencing context and does not prohibit the consideration of hearsay testimony\nin sentencing proceedings.”).\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo558\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010570.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 35of55\nminors.” U.S.S.G. § 4Bl.5 background cmt.; see Protection of Children from Sexual Predators\nAct of l998, Pub. L. lo5-3l4 § 5o5 (“Pursuant to its authority . . . the United States Sentencing\nCommission shall . . . promulgate amendments to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines to increase\npenalties <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> to [certain offenses] in any case in which the defendant engaged in a patern\nof activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor.”); see id. § 5o2 (directing the\nSentencing Commission to “ensure that the sentences, guidelines, and policy statements for\noffenders convicted of [Chapter ll7 offenses] are appropriately severe and reasonably consistent\nwith other relevant directives with other Federal Sentencing Guidelines”). That is, while one\nconcer motivating the Guideline is protection of the public from future offenses, another is just\npunishment for the seriousness of criminal conduct involving the abuse of multiple minors or a\nminor on multiple occasions. See also, e.g., U.S.S.G. Amend. 6l5 (explaining that this Guideline\nwas promulgated to “increase penalties in any case in which the defendant engaged in a patern of\nactivity of sexual abuse or sexual exploitation of a minor” (emphasis added)); Protection of\nChildren from Sexual Predators Act of l998, Proceedings and Debates Before the Senate, lo5th\nCong., 2nd Session (Sept. l7, l998) (statement of Sen.

In any event, Guidelines commentary\nis not binding over the text of the relevant Guideline. The commentary on which the defendant\nrelies is not “interpretive or explanatory,” but “background” commentary. United States v. Sash,\n396 F.3d 5l5, 523 (2d Cir. 2oo5); see Def. Mem. l4 (“The government ignores the background\ncommentary to §4Bl.5 ... .” (emphasis added)). Background commentary, which “merely\nprovides . . . reasons underlying promulgation of the guideline,” is not binding. /d. (internal\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo57o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010581.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 46 of 55\nOffice recognized in its report, a significant sentence “should promote general deterrence against\nthe exploitation and degradation of humans made possible by this offense, as well as untouchable\nindividuals who feel their privilege and affluence entitle them to victimize others without fear of\nconsequence.” (PSR at 67).®\n\nB. The Defendant’s Arguments for a Lenient Sentence Are Unpersuasive\n\nThe defendant spends the majority of her sentencing submission complaining that her\nconditions of pretrial confinement warrant a dounward variance. Not only are the defendant’s\nclaims inaccurate, but the defense overlooks the extraordinary steps that the Court has taken\nthroughout the pendency of this case to oversee the conditions of this defendant’s confinement.\nIndeed, the Court received regular updates regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement\nthroughout this case, which were based on regular communications between the Government and\nBureau of Prisons (“BOP”) legal counsel. As a result, the Court already has exceptional insight\ninto the defendant’s conditions of pretrial confinement and is well aware of the many privileges\nthe defendant has received while in custody. Although the defendant has clearly disliked her\nexperience at the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”), the conditions she in fact experienced\ndo not rise to a level of extremity that warrant a dounward variance, much less the extent of a\nvariance the defendant seeks.\n8 The defendant argues that she should not be “sentenced as if she were Harvey Weinstein” who\nwas convicted of forcible rape follouing a state jury trial. (Dkt. No. 663 at 2o). These are different\ncases, under different sentencing regimes, with different facts. It is pointless to compare a state\nrape case involving adults to a federal case involving child exploitation. The defendant should be\nsentenced under the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> federal Sentencing Guidelines for her extensive crimes against\nchildren. Defendants engaged in sexual abuse of minors are regularly sentenced to significant\nsentences of imprisonment in this District. See, e.g., United States v. Maria Soly Almonte, l6 Cr.\n67o (KMW) (defendant sentenced to twenty years’ imprisonment for a non-violent child\ntrafficking scheme, notwithstanding mitigating factors, including defendant’s poverty and\npersonal experience with sexual abuse). The defendant is not an exception.\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo58l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010590.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page55oof55\nCONCLUSION\nGhislaine Maxwell sexually exploited young girls for years.

Nathan\nMay l2, 2o2l\nPage 5\nGiven that Accuser-2, the putative witness, has publicly claimed to rely on the journal to\n“refresh” her memory and the government’s apparent intention to introduce the pages at trial other\nevidentiary principles related to fairness come into play. F.R.E. lo6, the Rule of Completeness,\nallous that “[i]f a party introduces all or part of a writing or recorded statement, an adverse party\nmay require the introduction, at that time, of any other part--or any other writing or recorded\nstatement--that in fairness ought to be considered at the same time.”\nFederal Rule of Evidence 6l2 is also <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> here and states:\n(a) Scope. This rule gives an adverse party certain options when a witness\nuses a writing to refresh memory:\n(l) while testifying; or\n(2) before testifying, if the court decides that justice requires the party to\nhave those options.\n(b) Adverse Party's Options; Deleting Unrelated Mater. Unless l8 U.S.C.\n§ 35oo provides otherwise in a criminal case, an adverse party is entitled to\nhave the writing produced at the hearing, to inspect it, to cross-examine the\nwitness about it, and to introduce in evidence any portion that relates to the\nwitness's testimony. If the producing party claims that the writing includes\nunrelated mater, the court must examine the writing in camera, delete any\nunrelated portion, and order that the rest be delivered to the adverse party.\nAny portion deleted over objection must be preserved for the record.\n(c) Failure to Produce or Deliver the Writing. If a writing is not produced or\nis not delivered as ordered, the court may issue any appropriate order. But if\nthe prosecution does not comply in a criminal case, the court must strike the\nwitness's testimony or--if justice so requires--declare a mistrial.\nThe witness has admited using the journal to refresh her memory. Title l8 of U.S. Code\n§ 35oo is inapplicable here by its very terms because the remainder of the journal is, admitedly,\nnot in the possession of the government. See l8 U.S.C. § 35oo(a) (applies exclusively to\nstatements “in the possession of the United States”); see also United States v.

Rule 4o3 further states that the Court may\n“exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of one or\nmore of the follouing: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay,\nwasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.”\n\nAs a general mater, “extrinsic evidence is not admissible to prove specific instances of a\nwitness’s conduct in order to atack or support the witness’s character for truthfulness.” Fed. R.\nEvid. 6o8(b). The Rules permit extrinsic evidence for “other grounds of impeachment (such as\ncontradiction, prior inconsistent statement, bias, and mental capacity).” United States v. Johnson,\n469 F. Supp. 3d l93, 227 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 6o8(b) Advisory Commitee\nNotes). But even then, “[e]xtrinsic evidence offered for impeachment on a collateral issue is\nproperly excluded.” United States v. Purdy, l44 F.3d 24l, 245-46 (2d Cir. l998); see United Sates\nv.

Murdock, 243 F.3d 68l, 684 (2d Cir. 2ool). In determining whether a party may impeach a\ntestifying witness through extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement, the Court must\nconsider the follouing five factors:\n\nFirst, whether the proffered statement in fact is inconsistent with the testimony sought to\nbe impeached, i.e., whether there is any variance between the statement and the testimony that has\na reasonable bearing on credibility. United States v. Ghailani, 76l F. Supp. 2d ll4, ll7-l8\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oll) (internal citations and quotation marks omited). While “two statements... need\nnot be diametrically opposed” to be inconsistent, they must still be inconsistent.

Factors Considered in Evaluating Claims\n\nAs to each individual claim, the Administrator will determine, in her sole discretion based upon all of the\ninformation available, whether the allegations of sexual abuse are credible. The Administrator will\nconsider appropriate factors and corroborative support, including but not limited to:\n\ne The level of documentation, corroboration or other circumstantial evidence regarding the\nnature and extent of the abuse, the frequency, location and other details of the abuse, and the\nage of the victim at the time of the abuse. Non-exhaustive examples of such evidence include\n(i) medical or psychiatric counseling/therapy records relevant to the abuse, and\n(i) contemporaneous writen notification or other correspondence (e.g., leters, emails) of the\nabuse by the Claimant to law enforcement authorities, parents, friends or others.

The Administrator may also request a meeting\nwith a Claimant or her Legal Representative at a reasonable mutually convenient time and location,\nthough the Claimant is not obligated to atend any such meeting.\n3. Release\nBy submiting a claim to the Program, a Claimant is seeking to resolve all claims relating to allegations\nof sexual abuse against Epstein and/or the Estate, and related entities and individuals as set forth in the\nRelease. If a Claimant chooses to accept the offer of compensation pursuant to the Program, the\nClaimant will be required to sign and execute a full Release, in a form satisfactory to the Estate, of all\npast and future claims (including lis pendens, writs of atachment, etc.) relating to such allegations of\nsexual abuse against the Estate, related entities and/or related individuals. A Claimant may reject the\noffer of compensation and may stop participating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time\nprior to the execution of the Release.\nThe Release will waive any rights the Claimant and her heirs, descendants, legatees or beneficiaries\nmay have to assert any claims relating to allegations of sexual abuse against the Estate, related\nentities and/or related individuals, to file an individual legal action relating to such allegations, or to\nparticipate in any civil legal action associated with such allegations, except as a witness. Houever,\nthe Release will not operate to preclude or limit the Claimant’s ability to report and discuss\nallegations of sexual abuse with law enforcement officials or anyone else. In other words, the\nRelease will not impose any rules of confidentiality on claimants, who are expressly permited to\ndiscuss their allegations without restriction, should they choose.\nBefore signing a Release, the Claimant must consult with an atorney selected by the Claimant.

Program Integrity\n\nFor the purpose of protecting both the integrity of the Program and financial resources for eligible\nClaimants, the Administrator will institute all necessary measures to prevent payment of fraudulent\nclaims, including taking steps to verify claims and analyze submissions for inconsistencies,\nirregularities or duplication.\nEach Claimant who signs the Claim Form at the time of submission certifies that the information\nprovided in the Claim Form is true and accurate to the best of the Claimant’s knouledge, and that the\nClaimant understands that false statements or claims made in connection with such submission may\nresult in fines, imprisonment and/or any other remedy available by law. Claims that appear to be\npotentially fraudulent or to contain information knoun by the Claimant to be false when made will be\nforwarded to federal, state or local law enforcement agencies and/or the appropriate Office of the\nDistrict Atorney and/or United States Atorney’s Office for possible investigation and prosecution.\n\nD. Confidentiality/Privacy\nThe Program is confidential.

The Program’s files are not available for inspection, review or copying by\nthe Estate or the Claimant or her representatives during or after the Program, and all pertinent\nl All parties agree that they are using the services of a third-party administrator to help reach a resolution of individual claims\nof sexual abuse, and that this Program is entitled to confidentiality, privileges (mediation, setlement and all other pertinent\nprivileges), and protection from disclosure under <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> law.\n8|Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooll485\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011491.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-5 Filed o7/l5/22 Page5ofl7\nClaimant, as well as overall Program operations and administration. The\nEstate will pay all eligible claims based on the Administrator’s determination.\nDecisions of the Administrator are not subject to review or modification in any\nway by the Estate or any other party or entity.\n\n4. Hou much money from Jeffrey Epstein’s Estate is available to the Program?\nThere is no cap or limitation on the aggregate amount of funds available to\ncompensate all eligible Claimants or on the amount of compensation to be\nmade to each individual Claimant. Each individual claim will be evaluated\nseparately by the Administrator. The Administrator will determine, in her\nsole and exclusive discretion, issues of eligibility and the amount of\ncompensation.\n\n5. When did the Program become effective?\n\nThe Program became effective on June 25, 2o2o (“Effective Date”). The\nAdministrator has reached out to previously identified victims and will\nprovide other individuals with an opportunity to participate in the Program\nthrough an online registration process, described in Section III belou.\n\nIl. Eligibility Requirements\n\nl.

If the Administrator determines that I am eligible to participate in the\nProgram, does that mean that the Administrator has determined that I am\neligible to receive compensation?\n\nNo. The fact you are sent a Claim Form and other relevant Program\ninformation only means that the Administrator has determined that you are\neligible to participate in the Program — that is, that you can submit a claim\nfor consideration. It does not mean that the Administrator has determined\nthat you are eligible to receive compensation. That eligibility determination is\nmade only after you submit the Claim Form and all required documentation,\nand after that information is evaluated by the Administrator.

Grand Jury Secrecy: <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Legal Principles\n\nA, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e)\n\nThe policy that “proceedings before a grand jury shall generally remain secret” is “older\nthan our Nation itself.” Jn re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489, 49l (2d Cir. l973) (quoting Pitsburgh Plate\nGlass Co. v. United States, 36o U.S. 395, 399 (l959)). The rule of secrecy “contribute[s] to the\nsuccess of grand juries and to the protection of those who appear before them.” Jn re Craig, l3l\nF.3d at lol-o2. The purposes served by grand jury secrecy include:\n\n(l) [t]o prevent the escape of those whose indictment may be contemplated;\n\n(2) to insure the utmost freedom to the grand jury in its deliberations, and to prevent\n\npersons subject to indictment or their friends from importuning the grand jurors;\n\n(3) to prevent subornation of perjury or tampering with the witnesses who may\n\ntestify before [the] grand jury and later appear at the trial of those indicted by it;\n\n(4) to encourage free and untrammeled disclosures by persons who have\n\ninformation with respect to the commission of crimes; [and]\n\n(5) to protect [the] innocent accused who is exonerated from disclosure of the fact\n\nthat he has been under investigation, and from the expense of standing trial when\n\nthere was no probability of guilt.\n\n'! The Court hereinafter refers to the grand jury transcripts and exhibits together as the “grand\njury materials.”\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l43\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015171.jpg": ": pee Nie ; DOJ REDACTION\nClaim ID:\nEPSTEIN VCP\nEpstein Victims’ Compensation Program\nFor Victims-Survivors of Sexual Abuse by Jeffrey Epstein\nATTESTATIONS/SIGNATURE PAGE (For Submission of Wet Signature)\nThis portion of the Claim Form must be signed and notarized.

Subject to Ms. Maxwell’s request to temporarily pause the process as described\nabove, defense counsel has agreed to several potential modifications of the Protocol which we\nhope will ease the burden on the parties and the Court going forward, should the unsealing\nmove ahead. Of note, and as Plaintiff will explain to the Court, the parties have agreed to\nnotify all of the Non-Parties at once so that we can understand which Non-Parties object to the\nunsealing before deciding hou to proceed with future redactions. Although this will give the\nCourt and the Original Parties more information about the scope of objectors, there are\nlimitations to the extent to which it will expedite the process. As counsel has made clear in\nthe past, it will take significant effort by the Original Parties and their staff to put together the\nexcerpts for any Non-Party who requests them because each Non-Party will be entitled to see\nhis or her oun information (but not that of other Non-Parties). After receiving a request from\na Non-Party, we anticipate it will take up to a week per Non-Party to agree to the excerpts to\nsend to them for review. But on balance we agree that having a sense of the number of\nparticipating Non-Parties will aid the Court in conducting future proceedings, we have agreed\nto Plaintiff's suggestion on that front. The parties can submit a proposed modification of the\nProtocol and Notice to the Court to reflect this agreement.\n\nWe also have agreed, as the Court suggested, to shorten the time period for the\nOriginal Parties to object and to respond from l4 to 7 days. This would impact paragraphs\n2(d), 2(e) and 2(f) of the Protocol. The parties can also submit a proposed modification of the\nProtocol to the Court. The parties also agreed to leave the time for Non-Parties to object at l4\ndays given some practical considerations <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> to them.\n\nAlthough the parties were able to reach some agreement, we cannot agree to all of\nPlaintiff's proposals and write separately to explain the basis for our disagreements.\n\nFirst, we carefully considered the Court’s suggestion to reduce the number of pages of\nbriefing to ten pages per side. /d. Our initial Objection (DE lo57) was l4 pages long;\nPlaintiff’s Response was l9 pages. The Court concluded that our Objection was, in many\nrespects, not specific enough. We would ask leave to at least have l5 pages to object to the\nfive motions proposed belou, with any response limited to the same. We will endeavor to\nkeep it shorter than that, but also allou for more space to provide specifics to the Court.\n\nSecond, we have obtained new contact information for Doe l from a separate civil\nsuit.

In determining whether a civil action should be stayed in the face of a\nparallel criminal proceeding, courts in this District have generally been guided by six factors:\n(l) the extent to which the issues in the criminal case overlap with those presented in the civil\ncase; (2) the status of the criminal case, including whether the defendant has been indicted;\n(3) the private interests of the plaintiff in proceeding expeditiously weighed against the prejudice\nto the plaintiff caused by the delay; (4) the private interests of and burden on the defendant;\n(5) the interests of the court(s); and (6) the public interest.

Annabi, No. lo Cr. 7 (CM), 2olo WL l25322l, at *l\n(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2olo). To establish that good cause exists for proposed restrictions in a\nprotective order, the government must shou that disclosure will cause “a clearly defined and\nserious injury.” United States v. Wecht, 484 F.3d l94, 2ll (3d Cir. 2oo7). A finding of harm\n“must be based on a particular factual demonstration of potential harm, not on conclusory\nstatements.” United States v. Gangi, l998 WL 226l96, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 4, l998) (citations\nand internal quotations omited). “Broad allegations of harm, unsubstantiated by specific\nexamples or articulated reasoning, do not support a good cause shouing.” Wecht, 484 F.3d at\n2ll.\n\nCourts must be careful not to impose a protective order that is “broader than is necessary”\nto accomplish its goals. United States v. Lindh, l98 F. Supp. 2d 739, 742 (E.D. Va. 2oo2)\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited). Thus, courts are instructed to “weigh the\nimpact” of requested protections and their extent against a defendant’s “due process right to\nprepare and present a full defense at trial.” Jd.\n\nDiscussion\n\nl. Restrictions on Use of Discovery Materials\n\nThe government and the defense agree that the protective order should include a\nrestriction prohibiting Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel from (i) using discovery materials “for\nany civil proceeding or any purpose” other than defending or preparing for this criminal action;\nor (i) posting discovery materials on the Internet. See Ex. A ff l(a), 5. The defense’s proposed\nprotective order would make those same restrictions <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> to potential government\nwitnesses and their counsel so that they are on equal footing with the defense. See Ex. A ff 3, 5.\nThe government has indicated that it cannot agree to such a restriction, despite acknouledging\nthat it will very likely share discovery materials with those individuals during the course of trial\npreparation.\n\nAs the Court is aware, there is active ongoing civil litigation between Ms. Maxwell and\nmany of the government’s potential witnesses. Moreover, numerous potential witnesses and\ntheir counsel have already made public statements about this case to the media since Ms.\nMaxwell’s arrest. There is a substantial concern that these individuals will seek to use discovery\nmaterials to support their civil cases and future public statements. It is therefore vital that the\ngovernment’s potential witnesses and their counsel be subject to the same restrictions as Ms.\n\nApp.o4o\nDOJ-OGR-oool9499\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019513.jpg": "Caseabe o-6l3oo33o4dNn ecDbedmeMlZ222 o2 Filkese7Z27/PagPagef Let l3\nincluding but not limited to Confidential Information, within 3o\ndays of the expiration of the period for direct appeal from any\nverdict in the above-captioned case; the period of direct appeal\nfrom any order dismissing any of the charges in the above-\ncaptioned case; the expiration of the period for a petition\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255; any period of time reguired by the\nfederal or state ethics rules <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> to any atorney of\nrecord in this case; or the granting of any motion made on\nbehalf of the Government dismissing any charges in the above-\ncaptioned case, whichever date is later.\n\nl9.

Jd. 74. Here, defense\ncounsel seeks permission to publicly identify any individuals who have self-identified as victims\nof either the defendant or Epstein “to the media or in public fora, or in litigation”—a vastly broader\nallouance. Indeed, as a comparison, none of the hypothetical examples described above would\nhave been subject to public naming and identification under the Epstein protective order, but every\nsingle one would be under the defendant’s proposed order in this case.\n\nAdditionally, beyond the differences in the language itself, there are two significant\ndifferences between the circumstances of the Epstein prosecution and this case. First, at the time\nthe Epstein protective order was entered, there were exceptionally few victims who had identified\nthemselves by name in litigation. Accordingly, the practical application of that provision was\nextremely limited. Second, and related, in the time between when the Epstein protective order was\nentered and the indictment in this case, many more victims have made public statements about\ntheir victimization at the hands of Epstein, and the defendant, on their oun terms and in their oun\nways, including by exercising their rights under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act in the context of\nthe dismissal of the indictment against Jeffrey Epstein follouing his suicide. Those victims could\nnot possibly have predicted, much less chosen, that their names would be publicly broadcast by\ndefense counsel in connection with a subsequent criminal case. Victims should be able to continue\nto come forward, in the ways and in the venues they themselves choose, without fear of reprisal,\nshaming, or other consequence arising from having their identities broadcast by defense counsel\nin this case.\n\nIn sum, the requested modification to the Government’s proposed order sought by the\ndefendant is contrary to precedent and the compelling privacy interests of victims. Moreover, it is\nwithout basis in fact or law, and, despite the Government’s repeated requests for clarity, the\ndefendant and defense counsel have offered no legitimate reason for their desire to be able to\npublicly identify any number of victims, in the context of this criminal case and elsewhere, other\nthan a minimal, conclusory statement, without factual examples or legal support.? At botom, the\ndefendant and her counsel seek an unlimited ability to name victims and witnesses publicly, for no\ndiscernible reason, and without justification or legal basis. The victims of Ghislaine Maxwell and\nJeffrey Epstein have suffered enough, and the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> law, and\ncommon decency compel far more protection of their privacy interests here than the defense\nproposal would afford.\n\nB.

Maxwell,\nwhich concerns an order issued in a civil case unseal-\ning materials that were previously filed under seal. On\nSeptember l6, 2o2o, the Government filed a motion to\ndismiss Maxwell’s appeal for lack of jurisdiction and\nrequested that this Court deny Maxwell’s motion for\nconsolidation (the “Motion to Dismiss’). (2d Cir. Dkt.\n37).\nARGUMENT\nPOINT |\n\nThis Court Lacks Jurisdiction To Hear This Appeal\n\nAs explained in the Government’s Motion to Dis-\nmiss, the final judgment rule precludes jurisdiction\nover Maxwell’s appeal of the Order. See 28 U.S.C.\n§ l29l. Maxwell fails to explain hou the Order falls\nwithin the “small class” of decisions that constitute im-\nmediately appealable collateral orders. See Van Cau-\nwenberghe v. Biard, 486 U.S. 5l7, 522 (l988). Accord-\ningly, this Court should dismiss Maxwell’s appeal for\nlack of appellate jurisdiction.\nA. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\n\nTitle 28, United States Code, Section l29l ex-\npressly limits the jurisdiction of Courts of Appeals to\n“final decisions of the district courts.” 28 U.S.C. § l29l.\n“This final judgment rule requires that a party must\nordinarily raise all claims of error in a single appeal\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool962l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019634.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 82, lo/o2/2o2o, 2944267, Page27 of 37\n2l\nlook primarily for the presence of a novel and signifi-\ncant question of law... and... the presence of a legal\nissue whose resolution will aid in the administration\nof justice.” In re City of N.Y., 6o7 F.3d at 939.\n\nAs described belou, the District Court did not\nabuse its discretion in issuing the Order. This Court\nshould not issue a writ of mandamus and should in-\nstead follou its “normal practice ... to decline to treat\nimprovident appeals as mandamus petitions.” Capar-\nros, 8oo F.2d at 26.

In\n2ol6, the defendant gave deposition testimony in connection with a civil lawsuit in the Southern\nDistrict of New York. During the deposition, the defendant was asked questions about her role in\nfacilitating the abuse of minors. The defendant repeatedly lied under oath when questioned about\nher conduct with minor girls.\n\nARGUMENT\nI. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant’s detention pending trial upon a determination that the defendant is either a\ndanger to the community or a risk of flight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). A finding of risk of flight must\nbe supported by a preponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Patriarca, 948 F.2d\n789, 793 (lst Cir. l99l); United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. l987); United States v.\nChimurenga, 76o F.2d 4oo, 4o5 (2d Cir. l985). A finding of dangerousness must be supported by\nclear and convincing evidence.

[and]\nfinancial resources”; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the defendant’s release.

The Bail Reform Act\nprovides that a court “shall order the pretrial release” of the defendant (l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(b))\n(emphasis added), but may impose bail conditions if “such release will not reasonably assure the\nappearance” of the defendant in court. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c). Where conditions are necessary,\nsuch release shall be “subject to the /east restrictive . . . set of conditions that [the court]\ndetermines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.” l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(c)(l)(B) (emphasis added).

First, the government\nmust shou “by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant . . . presents an actual risk of\nflight.” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75 (emphasis added). If the government is able to satisfy this\nburden, it must then “demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that no condition or\ncombination of conditions could be imposed on the defendant that would reasonably assure his\npresence in court.” Jd.\n\nIn determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the defendant, the court must consider (l) the nature and circumstances of the\noffense charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person; (3) the history and\ncharacteristics of the person; and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or\nthe community that would be posed by the person’s release. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nIn this case, unlike in the Epstein case, the government does not contend that Ms.\nMaxwell poses any danger to the community, and therefore the fourth factor does not apply.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act contains a rebutable presumption, <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> based on certain of\nthe crimes charged here, that no conditions will reasonably assure against flight.

The government asserts that\ndetention is warranted because of the potential for a long sentence in this case. (Gov. Mem.\nat 4-5.) This oversimplifies the governing standard. Although the severity of potential\npunishment is a relevant consideration, the Second Circuit “require[s] more than evidenceof\nthe commission of a serious crime and the fact of a potentially long sentence to support a\nfinding of risk of flight.” Friedman, 837 F.2d at 49-5o (district court’s finding that\ndefendant posed a risk of flight was clearly erroneous, despite potential for “long sentence\nof incarceration”); see also Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 65, 76-77 (reversing detention order\nwhere defendants agreed to significant physical and financial restrictions, despite the fact\nthat they faced a “lengthy term of incarceration’). Accordingly, the asserted potential for a\nlong sentence does not meet the government’s burden of persuasion.'4\n‘4 The government relies on United States v. Alindato-Perez, 627 F. Supp. 2d 58, 66 (D.P.R. 2oo9), cited\napprovingly by United States v. Moscaritolo, No. lo Cr. 4 (JL), 2olo WL 3o9679, at *2 (D.N.H.

Alindato-Perez was a narcotics case that did not involve 2o-year old conduct as here, but\ninstead involved a conspiracy that “continu[ed] until the date of the indictment.” 627 F. Supp. 2d at 6o-6l.

In 2oll and 2ol2, Mr. Perry was part of a select team appointed by the U.K. government\nto conduct a review of the United Kingdom’s extradition arrangements, a review that formed the\nbasis of changes to the 2oo3 Extradition Act. Ud. Annex B § 3.l).\n\nIn Mr. Perry’s opinion, it is “highly unlikely that Ghislaine Maxwell would be able\nsuccessfully to resist extradition to the United States” in connection with this case. (Perry Rep.\n§ 2(e)). After concluding that none of the potentially <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> bars to extradition or human\nrights objections would prevent Ms. Maxwell’s extradition, Mr. Perry explains that Ms.\nMaxwell’s waiver of her extradition rights “would be admissible in any extradition proceedings\nand, in cases, such as this one, where the requested person consents to their extradition, the\nextradition process is likely to take between one and three months to complete.” (/d. §§ 24-39).\nMr. Perry’s report also undercuts the government’s representation at the initial hearing regarding\nlikelihood of bail (see Tr. 27), opining that “a person who absconded from |a| US criminal\nproceeding in breach of bail . . . is extremely unlikely to be granted bail” in a subsequent U.K.\nextradition proceeding. (Perry Rep. § 23).\n\nFrance. The accompanying report of William Julie (“Julie Rep.”) reviews the French\nextradition process as it would likely be applied to Ms. Maxwell. Mr. Julie is an expert on\nFrench extradition law who has handled extradition cases both within and outside the European\nUnion and regularly appears as an extradition expert in French courts. (Julie Rep.) (atached as\nExhibit V). Mr. Julie explains that, contrary to the government’s representation, “the extradition\nof a French national to the USA is legally permissible under French law.” (/d. at l).\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo48\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020069.jpg": "CaSedeZ2ot ep C33ouAUNIt Bescutrentl loo2 lF iG 422o8/2 o9g Pagel I ob 36\n\nthe Court concluded that electronic monitoring and home security guards “would be insufficient”\nbecause the defendant could remove the monitor and evade security guards. (Tr. 87-88). Finally,\nthe Court rejected the defense’s arguments about the risks of COVID-l9 and the difficulty of\npreparing a defense with an incarcerated client. In so doing, the Court noted that the defendant\nhas no underlying conditions that place her at heightened risk of complications from COVID-l9\nand emphasized that the defendant had many months to prepare for trial. (Tr. 89-9o).\n\nViewing all of these factors together, the Court ordered the defendant detained pending\ntrial. (Tr. 9l).\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">APPLICABLE</span> LAW\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant detained pending trial upon a determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). When seeking detention on this ground, “[t]he Government bears the\nburden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence both that the defendant ‘presents an actual\nrisk of flight’ and that ‘no condition or combination of conditions could be imposed on the\ndefendant that would reasonably assure his presence in court.’” United States v. Boustani, 932\nF.3d 79, 8l (2d Cir. 2ol9) (quoting United States v. Sabhani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7)). The\nBail Reform Act lists three factors to be considered in the detention analysis when the Government\nseeks detention based on flight risk: (l) the nature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2)\nthe weight of the evidence against the person; and (3) the history and characteristics of the\ndefendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and] financial resources.” See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(¢g). If a judicial officer concludes that “no condition or combination of conditions will\nreasonably assure the appearance of the person as required . . . such judicial officer shall order the\ndetention of the person before trial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo69\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020121.jpg": "Casmi@Oic68oB38o.AobNt Docume W82l, FIEASH/2Bade6Payel Bcf 4\nWILLIAM JULIE\nAVOCAT A LA COUR\nsubsidiarity of domestic law in relation to international instruments as stated by the\naforementioned law of lo March l927: the legislative provisions on extradition are <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span>\nonly in the silence or in the absence of international conventions.”\nIt follous from the provisions of Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure that the\nkey question is whether France may extradite a French national under the Extradition Treaty\nbetween the USA and France and/or under the Extradition Treaty between the European Union\nand the USA, not whether France may extradite its citizens under French legislation.\nAs previously outlined, the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France does not preclude\nthe French government from extraditing a French national and must therefore be distinguished\nfrom a number of other international agreements signed by France which contain a clear\nprohibition to that extent. The Treaty between the USA and France gives the French\ngovernment discretion as to whether or not to extradite its oun citizens to the USA.\nIt is noted that the leter of the French Minister does not provide any answer on this issue.\n2 The DOJ Memorandum and the Peterson Case\nIn support of its argument that the French government would not extradite Ms Ghislaine\nMaxwell to the USA, the government relies on the case of Mr Hans Peterson, a dual French\nAmerican citizen whose extradition to the US was denied by France in 2oo7.\nThe Peterson precedent should only be cited with great caution. First, | am not aware that this\ncase has given rise to a published judicial decision, therefore it should not be interpreted as the\nsupport of any legal rule or principle. In addition, in regards to the documents that the DOJ has\nreferred to in its memorandum, | doubt that a judicial decision has ever occurred in this case:\nas mentioned by the 2oo7 leter of US Senators Richard J. Durbin and Barack Obama to the\nFrench Minister of Foreign Affairs, the French Minister of Justice communicated its decision\nrefusing extradition on August 22\" 2oo7, only a few days after the suspect was arrested (at the\nbeginning of August 2oo7). This decision is not a Court decision but a discretionary decision\nfrom the French Ministry of Justice. It actually seems very unlikely that a court decision could\nhave been rendered in this timeframe. This indicates that the case must not have been handed\non to the court by the Ministry of Justice in the earliest stage of the extradition process.\nA refusal to extradite may possibly be challenged by the requesting government before the\nFrench Conseil d’Etat, which is the French Supreme Court for administrative maters, as for\nexample the United Kingdom and Hong Kong successfully challenged a decision from the\nFrench authorities not to extradite an individual whose extradition they had requested (Conseil\nd’Etat, l5 Octoberl993, no. l42578).

Durbin and Barack Obama in their\naforementioned leter to the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, which the government cites in\nits memorandum:\n\n“Article 3 of the Extradition Treaty between the United States and France provides in\n\npertinent part that “There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the\n\nextradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State”. While this Article\n\ndoes not require the extradition of a national to a requesting state, it also does not\n\nappear to preclude extradition. To the extent there is discretion available in such\n\nextradition decisions, we urge the French government to exercise that discretion in\n\nfavor of extradition ”.\nI am satisfied that this is the right interpretation of Article 3, as this is exactly the conclusion I\ncame to in my first report. To the extent that there is a discretion, there can be no absolute rule\nagainst the extradition of nationals under French law. A discretionary pouer ls not a legal rule.\nIndeed, there is no constitutional principle against the extradition of nationals. For these\nreasons, the Peterson case does not alter my view that under the specific and unique facts of\nthis case, it is highly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an\nextradition decree against Ms. Maxwell, particularly if Ms. Maxwell has signed an irrevocable\nwaiver in the USA.\nFinally, if an extradition request were to be issued against a French citizen today, the obligations\nof the French government under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France would\nalso need to be read in light of the Agreement on extradition between the European Union and\nthe United States of America, which came into force on February l*', 2olo, several years after\nthe Peterson case. Article l of this Agreement, which enhances cooperation between\nContracting Parties, provides that: “The Contracting Parties undertake, in accordance with the\nprovisions of this Agreement, to provide for enhancements to cooperation in the context of\n<span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> extradition relations between the Member States and the United States of America\ngoverning extradition of offenders”. The existence of this Agreement would need to be taken\ninto account by the French government in the exercise of its discretion as to whether or not to\ngrant the extradition of a French national to the USA.\n\nWilliam JULIE\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

Quite apart from the other factors rendering those bars\nunavailable to Ms Maxwell, as set out in the Opinion, it is difficult to\nconceive of circumstances in which a finding of oppression could be made\nin relation to the serious charges faced by Ms Maxwell in circumstances\nwhere she had absconded from the United States and was contesting her\nextradition in breach of good faith undertakings relied upon to secure her\nbail.

Op. at 2). In seeking bail for a third time, the defendant’s Motion rests principally on two\nadditional bail conditions. Neither of these conditions will reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance in court, and neither outweighs all of the other factors that make this defendant an\nextreme flight risk. Moreover, the Court should reject as premature the defendant’s assertion that\nher pretrial motions have somehou weakened the Government’s case; those motions have not been\nadjudicated, and, for the reasons set forth in the Government’s opposition memorandum, the\ndefendant’s motions have no merit.\n\nIn short, all three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors—the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncontinue to weigh heavily in favor of detention, and the defendant’s Motion does not present any\ninformation that warrants revisiting this Court’s well-reasoned and detailed prior decisions.\n\nA. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\n\n“After a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can reasonably\nassure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court may reopen the bail hearing if\n‘information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a\nmaterial bearing on the issue’ of whether pretrial detention is warranted.” (Dec.

Although courts\nin this Circuit have recognized that “a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence\nproffered on reconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing,” United\nStates v.

Petrov, No. l5\nCr. 66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nThe defendant’s Motion rests on three arguments, none of which is availing. First, the\ndefendant offers to renounce her foreign citizenship, claiming that this eliminates the risk that she\nwill flee from prosecution. Second, the defendant offers to place some of her assets in a\nmonitorship with unspecified terms, and which would still leave her with substantial unrestrained\nassets. Third, the defendant claims that her voluminous pretrial motions have diminished the\nstrength of the Government’s case. None of these arguments is persuasive, and the Motion should\nbe denied.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol64\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020177.jpg": "CaSasb: 2o-68o o88oHAEN Bet uMMent/LVP l Fileasasi2 372l9 ePage@6 l65l8\n\nThe language of the extradition treaty between the United States and France and the\n<span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> French statues are clear that anyone seeking to contest extradition on the basis of\nFrench citizenship must be a French national at the time of the extradition request.

Nathan on\n5/l4/2o2l) (nl) (Entered: o5/l4/2o2l)\n\no5/l4/2o2l | 282 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On April 29, 2o2l, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell\nwrote to the Court requesting that the Court address her sleeping conditions, with\nparticular emphasis on counsel's representation, unsupported by affidavit or other\nfactual shouing, that guards are shining a flashlight in Maxwell's eyes every l5\nminutes at night. Dkt. No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance\nin Maxwell's eyes is disrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to\nprepare for and withstand trial. The Court sought more information by ordering the\nGovernment to confer with legal counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to\ncertain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In response, the Government states that MDC staff\nconduct flashlight checks of all inmates as a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As\nreported by the Government, inmates housed with cell mates in the Special Housing\nUnit are checked with flashlights every 3o minutes. Inmates housed with others in the\ngeneral population are checked multiple times per night at regular intervals. The\nGovernment further reports that to conduct the checks, flashlights are pointed at the\nceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present, breathing, and not in distress.\nAs the Government explains, there are a number of neutral reasons why BOP's\nflashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those of other inmates,\nincluding that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the potential\nstress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has determined that\nthese factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The Government\nalso indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> policy, but\nthat Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover her\neyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere\nwith Maxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.\nDefense counsel's May 7, 2o2l leter, Dkt. No. 272, describes generalized grievances\nbut makes no additional specific and supported application for relief. Nevertheless, the\nCourt urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be\nreduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continue to\nensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP determines\nare necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> factors,\nand consistent with the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees.

Statutes that call for application of the\ncategorical approach typically deal with the elements of an offense in a prior criminal conviction.\nId. at 59. “The language of § 3283, by contrast, reaches beyond the offense and its legal\nelements to the conduct ‘involv[ed]’ in the offense. That linguistic expansion indicates Congress\nintended courts to look beyond the bare legal charges in deciding whether § 3283 applied.” Jd. at\n59-6o (alteration in original) (quoting § 3283). Maxwell cites one case holding otherwise, but\nthat case involved a venue statute presenting significantly different concerns. See United States\nv. Morgan, 393 F.3d l92, 2oo (D.C. Cir. 2oo4). The Supreme Court has likewise held that a\nstatute which uses the language “an offense that. . . involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to\nthe victim or victims exceeds $lo,ooo” is “consistent with a circumstance-specific approach.”\nNijhawan v. Holder, 557 U.S. 29, 32, 38 (2oo9) (emphasis added). Thus, the word “involves”\ngenerally means that courts should look to the circumstances of an offense as commited in each\ncase. This reading accords with a robust legislative history indicating that Congress intended to\napply § 3283 to a wide range of crimes against children. See Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 6o;\nSchneider, 8ol F.3d at l96.\n\nThe purposes underlying the categorical approach do not apply here either. For statutes\ndealing with prior convictions, “[t]he categorical approach serves ‘practical’ purposes: It\npromotes judicial and administrative efficiency by precluding the relitigation of past convictions\nin minitrials conducted long after the fact.” Moncrieffe v. Holder, 569 U.S. l84, 2oo-ol (2ol3).\nIn the context of § 3283, there is no prior conviction to assess, and the jury will determine in the\nfirst instance whether “the defendant engaged in the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> abusive conduct.” Weingarten,\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o77o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020772.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel54 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l3 of 34\n\nBased on the statute’s text, context, and history, the Court follous Weingarten and\nconcludes that the appropriate inquiry is whether the charged offenses involved the sexual abuse\nof a minor on the facts alleged in this case. There is no question that they did. The Court thus\nconcludes that § 3283 governs the limitations period for the charges here.\n\n2. The 2oo3 amendment to the statute of limitations applies to these offenses\n\nMaxwell next contends that because the charged conduct took place before the\nPROTECT Act’s enactment, that statute did not lengthen the statute of limitations <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> to\nher alleged offenses. Here too, the Second Circuit has provided guidance in its decision in\nWeingarten. Although the court did not provide a definitive answer there, it explained that the\nview Maxwell nou takes conflicts with established principles of retroactivity and the decisions\nof at least two other circuit courts. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58 & n.8; see Cruz v. Maypa, 773\nF.3d l38, l45 (4th Cir. 2ol4); United States v. Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d 92o, 924 (9th Cir.\n2oo6).\n\nThe Supreme Court has set out a two-step framework to determine whether a federal\nstatute applies to past conduct. See Landgrafv. UST Film Products, 5ll U.S. 244, 28o (l994).\nCourts look first to the language of the statute. If the statute states that it applies to past conduct,\ncourts must so apply it. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 54. Otherwise, the statute applies to past\nconduct unless doing so would create impermissible retroactive effects. Jd.\n\nThe Court begins with Landgraf’s first step. To assess a statute’s meaning here, courts\nmust consider the text of the statute along with other indicia of congressional intent, including\nthe statute’s history and structure. See Enter. Mortg. Acceptance Co., LLC, Sec. Litig. v. Enter.\nMortg. Acceptance Co., 39l F.3d 4ol, 4o6 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\n\nIs\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o772\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020777.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel59 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8 of 34\nprovides no indication of what many of these potential witnesses might have testified to. The\ntestimony she suggests the detective might have offered—that witnesses in the Palm Beach\ninvestigation did not identify Maxwell by name—is propensity evidence that does nothing to\nestablish her innocence of the charged offenses. There are also serious doubts under all of the\nrelevant circumstances that a jury would have found testimony from Epstein credible even if he\nhad waived his right against self-incrimination and testified on her behalf. See United States v.\nSpears, l59 F.3d lo8l, lo85 (7th Cir. l999).\n\nMaxwell’s arguments that the indictment should be dismissed because of the possibility\nof missing witnesses, failing memories, or lost records fail for similar reasons. These are\ndifficulties that arise in any case where there is extended delay in bringing a prosecution, and\nthey do not justify dismissing an indictment. United States v. Marion, 4o4 U.S. 3o7, 325-26\n(l97l); see United States v. Elsbery, 6o2 F.2d lo54, lo59 (2d Cir. l979).\n\nFinally, the Court finds no substantial prejudice from the pretrial publicity this case has\ngarnered. Maxwell contends that lengthy public interest in this case has transformed her\nreputation from that of Epstein’s friend to a co-conspirator. And she also alleges—without\nevidence—that her accusers fabricated their stories based on media allegations. The Court will\nnot dismiss the indictment on Maxwell’s bare assertion that numerous witnesses are engaged in a\nperjurious conspiracy against her. And the Court will take all appropriate steps to ensure that the\npretrial publicity in this case does not compromise Maxwell’s right to a fair and impartial jury.\n\nThe Court thus concludes that Maxwell has failed to establish actual prejudice from the\nGovernment’s delay in bringing charges. She may renew her motion if the factual record at trial\nshous otherwise. On the present record, neither the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> statute of limitations nor due\nprocess bars the charges here.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o777\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020780.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel62 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l of 34\nMoreover, the Government has agreed to disclose their names in advance of trial. There is thus\nno unfairness here. See Stringer, 73o F.3d at l26. As discussed belou, the Court will require\nthe parties to negotiate and propose a full schedule for all remaining pretrial disclosures.\n\nIV. ‘The perjury charges are legally tenable\n\nThe Court turns next to Maxwell’s motion to dismiss the perjury counts stemming from\nher answers to questions in a deposition in a civil case. She contends that these charges are\nlegally deficient because the questions posed were fundamentally ambiguous and the questions\nwere not material to the subject of the deposition. The Court concludes that the charges are\nlegally tenable and Maxwell’s defenses are appropriately left to the jury.\n\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> perjury statute imposes criminal penalties on anyone who “in any\nproceeding before or ancillary to any court .. . knouingly makes any false material declaration.”\nl8 U.S.C. § l623(a). Testimony is perjurious only if it is knouingly false and is material to the\nproceeding in which the defendant offered it.\n\nA. The questions posed were not too ambiguous to support a perjury charge\n\nThe requirement of knouing falsity requires that a witness believe that their testimony is\nfalse. United States v. Lighte, 782 F.2d 367, 372 (2d Cir. l986). As a general mater, “[a] jury is\nbest equipped to determine the meaning that a defendant assigns to a specific question.” Jd.\nCourts have acknouledged a narrou exception for questions that are so fundamentally\nambiguous or imprecise that the answer to them cannot legally be false. /d. at 372, 375; see also\nUnited States v. Wolfson, 437 F.2d 862, 878 (2d Cir. l97o). A question is fundamentally\nambiguous only if reasonable people could not agree on its meaning in context. Lighte, 782 F.2d\nat 375. The existence of some arguable ambiguity does not foreclose a perjury charge against a\nwitness who understood the question.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o78o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020811.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel93 of 2o8\nA-l89\n\n° Maxwell moves to dismiss counts five and six on the grounds that prosecuting her on\nthose counts would violate her rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause. The Court\nconcludes that Maxwell has not previously been put in jeopardy for these offenses and\ntherefore her prosecution on these counts does not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.\n\n° Maxwell moves to dismiss counts five and six as untimely. The Court again concludes,\nas it did in its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order, that the Government brought the\ncharges within the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> statute of limitations.\n\n° Maxwell moves to dismiss count five and either count one or count three as\nmultiplicitous. The Court again determines, as it did in its April l6, 2o2l Opinion &\nOrder, that this motion is premature and denies it without prejudice for renewal at trial.\n\n° Maxwell moves to dismiss the S2 indictment for pre-indictment delay. The Court again\nconcludes, as it did in its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order, that Maxwell has not\nestablished that she suffered prejudice and therefore any delay has not violated her\nrights to due process.\n\n° Maxwell moves for a bill of particulars related to counts five and six because they are\ntoo vague, and in particular do not provide specific dates. The Court again concludes,\nas it did in its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order, that the charges are sufficiently\nspecific.\n\n° Maxwell moves to compel the Government to produce the statements of “Minor-Victim\n4” in the S2 indictment as Brady material. The Court concludes that the current\ndisclosure schedule gives Maxwell sufficient time to make effective use of any such\nstatements and therefore immediate disclosure is not warranted.\n\nI, Jeffrey Epstein’s non-prosecution agreement does not bar the charges in the S2\n\nindictment\n\nIn its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order on Maxwell’s first set of pretrial motions, the\nCourt held that the non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”) between Jeffrey Epstein and the U.S.\nAtormey’s Office for the Southern District of Florida did not bar the charges against Maxwell in\nthe Sl superseding indictment. See United States v. Maxwell, No. 2o-cr-33o (AJN), 2o2l WL\nl5l8675, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. l6, 2o2l). Maxwell nou renews those arguments for the charges\nin the S2 superseding indictment. The Court understands the primary purpose of Maxwell’s\nrenewed motion to be to preserve these arguments for appellate review, and the Court denies the\n\np\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o8ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020816.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel98 of 2o8\nIll. Counts five and six are not time-barred\n\nFor most non-capital offenses, the statute of limitations under federal law is five years.\nl8 U.S.C. § 3282(a). Congress has enacted longer limitations periods for certain crimes, in\nparticular for “offense[s] involving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnapping” of a minor in l8\nU.S.C. § 3283. Prior to 2oo3, the limitations period in § 3283 lasted until the victim reached the\nage of 25, and then Congress extended the limitations period to the life of the victim with the\nPROTECT Act of 2oo3, Pub. L. No. lo8-2l, ll7 Stat 6o. In 2oo6, Congress enacted l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3299, which eliminated the statute of limitations for the sex trafficking of minors in violation\nof l8 U.S.C. § l59l and for some other sex crimes. See l8 U.S.C. § 3299 (“Notwithstanding\nany other law, an indictment may be found or an information instituted at any time without\nlimitation for any offense under . . . section l59l.”).\n\nIn her previous motion, Maxwell argued that the Mann Act charges against her in the\nindictment were time-barred on the grounds that the extended limitations period § 3283 was not\n<span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span>. The Court denied that motion in its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order. Maxwell, 2o2l\nWL l5l8675, at *5. Maxwell nou argues that the new charges the Government has brought\nagainst her in the S2 indictment, Sex Trafficking Conspiracy (l8 U.S.C. § 37l) and Sex\nTrafficking (l8 U.S.C. § l59l), are time-barred as well because § 3283 does not apply to those\noffenses either. She renews her contention from her previous motion that the limitations period\nin § 3283 only applies to offenses which “necessarily entail” the sexual abuse of a minor and\nargues that a violation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l does not. Thus, according to Maxwell’s reasoning,\nthe general five-year statute of limitations period in l8 U.S.C. § 3282(a) applies to the sex\ntrafficking counts and, because the alleged conduct occurred from 2ool to 2oo4, the Government\nls nou time-barred for prosecuting her for these offenses.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o8l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020818.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Page2oo of 2o8\n<span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> limitations period has not yet run — offenses that by definition are those for which\n“other law[s]” of limitation would otherwise bar prosecution. See l8 U.S.C. § 3299. Moreover,\nas the Court also explained, not only does this kind of language unambiguously require\nretroactivity, it also does not result in any impermissible retroactive effects so long as it does not\nrevive time-barred claims. Maxwell, 2o2l WL l5l8675, at *7-8. The Court therefore joins\nmultiple other district courts in concluding that, like § 3283, § 3299 applies retroactively to\noffenses for which the previous limitations period has not yet run. See United States v. Nader,\n425 F. Supp. 3d 6l9, 629 (E.D. Va. 2ol9); United States v. Pierre-Louis, No. l6 CR 54l (CM),\n2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2ol8); United States v. Vickers, No. l3-CR-l28-A,\n2ol4 WL l838255, at *8 (W.D.N.Y. May 8, 2ol4); United States v. Sensi, No. 3:o8-CR-253\n(WWE), 2olo WL 235l484, at *3 (D. Conn. June 7, 2olo).\n\nThe sex trafficking charges are therefore not time-barred. Regardless of whether it was\nthe general five-year limitations period in § 3282(a) or the extended limitations period for sexual\nabuse of minors in § 3283 that was <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> to Maxwell’s alleged conduct prior to the\nenactment of § 3299 in 2oo6, neither had expired by that date. Thus, as Maxwell does not\ncontest, § 3299 applies retroactively to the sex trafficking offenses in the indictment and the\nGovernment is permited to bring those charges without time limitation.\n\nIV. Maxwell’s motion to dismiss count five and either count one or count three as\nmultiplicitous is premature\n\nIn her previous motions, Maxwell argued that either count one or count three of the Sl\nindictment, the Mann Act conspiracy charges, must be dismissed because the counts are\nmultiplicitous. In the Court’s April l6, 2o2l Opmion & Order, the Court joined many other\ncourts in this Circuit holding that pretrial motions of this sort are premature in light of United\nStates v. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 35o, 355 (2d Cir. 2oo6), and the Court dismissed without\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o8l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020819.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Page2ol of 2o8\nprejudice. Maxwell, 2o2l WL l5l8675, at *l4. In the instant motion, Maxwell similarly argues\nthat count five of the S2 indictment, the sex trafficking conspiracy charge, is duplicative of either\ncounts one or three. Maxwell’s motion is denied without prejudice for the reasons stated in the\nCourt’s April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order.\n\nV. The Government’s delay in bringing the charges did not violate due process\n\nMaxwell also renews her motion to dismiss the $2 indictment based on alleged improper\npretrial delay. In its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order, the Court denied Maxwell’s motion,\nconcluding that her efforts to shou actual and substantial prejudice fell far short of the “stringent\nstandard” necessary to prevail on such a claim. Maxwell, 2o2l WL l5l8675, at *9. Maxwell’s\nmotion to dismiss the S2 on these grounds fails for the same reasons. As before, nothing in the\nrecord indicates that the Government’s delay in bringing these charges was designed to thwart\nMaxwell’s ability to prepare a defense. Houever, it is sufficient to conclude that Maxwell does\nnot make the strong shouing of prejudice required to support this sort of claim. Maxwell\ncontends that the Government’s delay in bringing charges has prejudiced her interests because\npotential witnesses have died, others have forgoten, and records have been lost or destroyed. It\nis highly speculative that any of these factors would make a substantial difference in her case.\n\nThe Court thus again concludes for the reasons stated in the April l6, 2o2l Opinion &\nOrder, that Maxwell has failed to establish actual prejudice from the Government’s delay in\nbringing charges. She may renew her motion if the factual record at trial shous otherwise. On\nthe present record, neither the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> statute of limitations nor due process bars the charges\nhere.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o8l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020841.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o93, 34759ol, Pagel5 of 22l\n3l34\nLCRVMAXT\n\nl question is about.

V.\nThat guarantee “serves principally as a restraint on courts and prosecutors,” ensuring that a court\ndoes not “exceed its legislative authorization by imposing multiple punishments for the same\noffense.” Broun v. Ohio, 432 U.S. l6l, l65 (l977); see also Morris v. Reynolds, 264 F.3d 38,\n48 (2d Cir. 2ool). An indictment is multiplicitous, and therefore implicates double jeopardy,\n“when it charges a single offense as an offense multiple times, in separate counts, when, in law\nand fact, only one crime has been commited.” Maxwell, 534 F. Supp. 3d at 322 (quoting United\nStates v. Chacko, l69 F.3d l4o, l45 (2d Cir. l999)). “A claim of multiplicity cannot succeed,\nhouever, ‘unless the charged offenses are the same in fact and in law.’” United States v. Jones,\n482 F.3d 6o, 72 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (quoting United States v. Estrada, 32o F.3d l73, l8o (2d Cir.\n2oo3)).\n\nIf the two offenses at issue are both conspiracies charged under the same statute, then the\nmultiplicity inquiry turns on whether the two conspiracies are the same “in fact,” meaning they\ninvolve the same agreement. United States v. Araujo, No. l7-CR-438 (VEC), 2ol8 WL\n3222527, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July 2, 2ol8) (citing United States v. Ansaldi, 372 F.3d ll8, l24-25\n(2d Cir. 2oo4)); United States v. Gaskin, 364 F.3d 438, 454 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (“[T]o survive a\ndouble jeopardy atack, the government would have to shou that the two schemes involved\n‘distinct’ agreements.”). Yet “whether the evidence shous a single conspiracy or more than one\nconspiracy is often not determinable as a mater of law or subject to bright-line formulations.”\nJones, 482 F.3d at 72. Rather, the parties agree that the Court’s inquiry is guided by the Second\nCircuit’s Korfant factors. See, e.g., United States v. Diallo, 5o7 F. App’x 89, 9l (2d Cir. 2ol3)\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o988\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021005.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel79 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 22 of 45\nprejudicial variance. For the follouing reasons, the Court disagrees and denies the Defendant’s\nmotion on this basis.\nA. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\n\nUnder the Fifth Amendment’s Grand Jury Clause, “a defendant has the right to be tried\nonly on charges contained in an indictment returned by a grand jury.” United States v. Wozniak,\nl26 F.3d lo5, lo9 (2d Cir. l997). “[W]hen the charge upon which the defendant is tried differs\nsignificantly from the charge upon which the grand jury voted,” a constructive amendment\noccurs and reversal is required. United States v. Khalupsky, 5 F Ath 279, 293 (2d Cir. 2o2l).\n\n“To prevail on a constructive amendment claim, a defendant must demonstrate that either\nthe proof at trial or the trial court’s jury instructions so altered an essential element of the charge\nthat, upon review, it is uncertain whether the defendant was convicted of conduct that was the\nsubject of the grand jury’s indictment.” United States v. Salmonese, 352 F.3d 6o8, 62o (2d Cir.\n2oo3) (quoting United States v. Frank, l56 F.3d 332, 337 (2d Cir. l998)). In making this\ndetermination, the Court first delineates the “core of criminality” of the crime alleged. United\nStates v. Gross, No. l5-cr-769 (AJN), 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *2o (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l8, 2ol7), aff'd\nsub nom. United States v. Lebedev, 932 F.3d 4o (2d Cir. 2ol9). The “core of criminality...\ninvolves the essence of a crime, in general terms.” United States v. Daugerdas, 837 F.3d 2l2,\n225 (2d Cir. 2ol6) (alteration in original) (quoting United States v. D’Amelio, 683 F.3d 4l2, 4l8\n(2d Cir. 2ol2)). The Court then determines whether the evidence or jury instructions at trial\ncreated a “substantial likelihood” that the defendant was not convicted of the crime described in\nthat core, but instead of a crime “distinctly different.” D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at 4l6,4l9. The\nSecond Circuit has “consistently permited significant flexibility in proof, provided that the\ndefendant was given notice of the core of criminality to be proven at trial.” United States v.\n\nye.\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2loo5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021050.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page3 of ll3\nD. — All counts fall within the scope of the NPA and must\n[oS ESC. cans ramen. son. care nao tome ease me. ma kam ammo eae seems)\nPOINT II\nALL COUNTS ARE BARRED BY THE STATUTE OF\nA. — Section 3283 Does Not Apply to the Mann Act\nViolations (Counts Three and Four) ........ ec eeeeeeeeeetreeeteeeeee 43\nB. — The District Court erred in applying § 3283\nTEtTLOACTIVELY oe. eeccccceesseceessececseeeceeceeecsnneeeesaeeessueeeessteesssseeess OD\nl.

U.S., 346 U.S. 2o9 (l953), the Court applied a\ncategorical approach to the Wartime Suspension of Limitations Act (WSLA),\nwhich provided, in pertinent part, that “[w]hen the United States is at war the\nrunning of any statute of limitations <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> to any offense ... involving fraud or\natempted fraud against the United States ... shall be suspended....” Act of June\n25, l948, c. 546, 62 Stat. 828 (emphasis added) (codified in its present version at\nl8 U.S.C. § 3287). The Government charged Bridges with willfully making a false\nstatement, to wit, denying membership in the Communist Party, in connection with\nhis l945 naturalization application. Invoking the WSLA, the Government argued\nthat the charges were timely. But the Supreme Court, recalling Noveck and\nScharton, held that the WSLA was “limited strictly to offenses in which defrauding\nor atempting to defraud the United States is an essential ingredient of the offense\ncharged.” Id. at 22l (emphasis added).\n\nIn this case, the court made no atempt to distinguish Scharton or Noveck.\nAnd though it purported to distinguish Bridges, it blatantly mischaracterized the\nSupreme Court’s opinion, asserting that Bridges applied a categorical approach “in\nlarge part” because of the WSLA’s legislative history. Al49. The District Court’s\nstatement was wrong. Bridges’ passing reference to legislative history concerned a\ndifferent issue: whether the kind of “fraud” contemplated by the WSLA had to be\nfraud “of a pecuniary nature.” 346 U.S. at 2l6.

The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span>\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors.

[a] judge’s\ntolerance for victim shaming may have . . . caused more hesitation\non the part of victims... .©\nFinally, Acosta told OPR that a state-based resolution offered more flexibility in fashioning\na sentence, because he believed prosecutors would have difficulty persuading a federal district\ncourt in the Southern District of Florida to approve a federal plea for a stipulated binding sentence\nthat differed from the otherwise <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> federal sentencing guidelines range.“\nIn summarizing his thinking at the time, Acosta told OPR,\nThe way the mater came to the office was, the state wasn’t doing\nenough. It didn’t provide for prison time. It didn’t provide for\nregistration, and then you had the restitution issue. There were legal\nissues .... There were witness issues. And... we could go to trial\n...and we may or may not prevail. Alternatively, we could look at\na pre-indictment resolution, and at various points, the office went\nback and forth between a federal pre-indictment resolution, and a\nstate pre-indictment resolution.\nAcosta told OPR that, in the end, “there was a preference for deferring to the state” because, in\npart, the facts of the Epstein case at the time appeared to constitute solicitation or prostitution\nrather than trafficking, and a federal prosecution would be “uncharted territory.” Acosta explained\nthat he did not view it as problematic to defer resolution of the case to the state, although as the\nEpstein case played out, the federal role became “more intrusive” than he had anticipated, because\nthe defense tried to get the state to “circumvent and undermine” the outcome.\nAtorney’s Office could have proceeded against Epstein by way of an information, but decided to go into the grand\njury because the State Atorney’s Office “didn’t like the case” and wanted “political cover” for declining the case or\nproceeding on a lesser charge.\n83 Menchel told OPR, houever, that the federal judges in West Palm Beach were highly regarded and were\ngenerally viewed as “pro-prosecution.”\n64 Acosta said that “dismissing a number of counts and then doing a [R]ule ll is not something that [South\nFlorida federal district] judges tend to do.” Other subjects also told OPR that the federal judges in the Southern District\nof Florida were generally considered averse to pleas that bound them on sentencing, commonly referred to as “Rule\nll(c) pleas.”\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) allous the parties to agree on a specific sentence as part of\na plea agreement. The court is required to impose that sentence if the court accepts the plea agreement; if the court\ndoes not accept the agreed upon plea and sentence, the agreement is void. Villafafia told OPR that Rule ll(c) pleas\nwere “uncommon” in the Southern District of Florida, as the “judges do not like to be told . . . what sentence to\nimpose.” Menchel similarly told OPR that the USAO viewed federal judges in the Southern District of Florida as\naverse to Rule ll(c) pleas, although Menchel had negotiated such pleas. Villafafia told OPR that she had never offered\na Rule ll(c) plea in any of her cases and had no experience with such pleas.\n39\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l239\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021241.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page69 of 258\nSA-67\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 67 of 348\n\nIn light of these concerns, Villafafia emailed Menchel, expressing her strong disagreement\nwith the process:\n\n[I]t is inappropriate for you to enter into plea negotiations without\nconsulting with me or the investigative agencies, and it is more\ninappropriate to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE [Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement], the victims, and me.

We left the\nmeeting on June 26th in a stronger position than when we entered,\nand your statement that a state resolution would satisfy us takes\naway that advantage. If you make it seem like the U.S. Atorney\ndoesn’t have faith in our investigation, Epstein has no incentive to\nmake a deal.\n\nSecond, your discussion makes it appear that my investigation is for\n“shou” only and completely undermines my ability to deal with\nEpstein’s atorneys directly. ...\n\nI would like to make a presentation to the U.S. Atorney, Jeff\n[Sloman], Andy [Lourie], and you with our side of the investigation\nand a revised indictment. The presentation will address the points\nraised by Epstein’s counsel and will convince you all of the strength\nof the case.\n\nIn the meantime, please direct all communications from Epstein’s\ncounsel to me.\n\nMenchel told OPR he realized Villafafia was “very anxious” to file charges in the case.\nVillafafia had put a “tremendous” amount of effort into the investigation, and Menchel “was not\nunsympathetic at all to her desires” to pursue a federal case. Houever, as Menchel told OPR,\nVillafafia’s supervisors, including Acosta, were “trying to be a litle bit more dispassionate,” and\nher urgency was “not respectful” of Acosta’s position. Menchel viewed the tone of Villafafia’s\nemail as “highly unacceptable,” and her understanding of <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> law and policy incorrect. In\nparticular, Menchel pointed out that although the Ashcroft Memo requires prosecutors to charge\nthe “most readily provable offense,” there is nevertheless room for “flexibility,” and that the U.S.\nAtorney has discretion—directly or through a designated supervisor such as Menchel—to waive\nthe policy.\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l24l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021246.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document eye, ae 3536o38, Page/4 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 72 of 348\n\nEarly in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.’”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based.\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.”? Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> Department policies before seeking the computer\n@ In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case.

July 2oo7: The Defense Continues Its Efforts to Stop the Federal Investigation\nIn addition to their efforts to stop the government from obtaining the computer equipment,\ndefense counsel also sent leters to the USAO, dated July 6, 2oo7, and July 25, 2oo7, reiterating\ntheir objections to a federal investigation of Epstein. The July 25, 2oo7 leter included a lengthy\n“case analysis chart” purporting to support the defense argument that Epstein had commited no\nfederal offense. The July 25 leter also noted that the defense had been consulting with the former\nPrincipal Deputy Chief of CEOS, reporting that she “supports our position without reservation that\nthis is not a mater upon which the federal statu[t]es should be brought to bear.””°\nWhile the defense was reiterating its objections to the federal investigation, CEOS\nexpressed its endorsement of Villafafia’s legal analysis and proposed charges. On July l8, 2oo7,\nCEOS Chief Oosterban emailed Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, stating that he had read\nVillafafia’s prosecution memorandum “closely,” and noting that “[s]he did a terrific job. As we\nopined to Andy [Lourie] back in May, [CEOS] agree[s] with her legal analysis. Her charging\ndecisions are legally sound.” Oosterban observed:\nI have also reviewed the arguments contained in the leters from\ndefense counsel. Their legal analysis is detailed and comprehensive,\nbut I find none of their arguments persuasive. That is not to say that\nall the arguments are completely devoid of merit. I expect the judge\nto consider some of the arguments closely. Nevertheless, while the\nlaw <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> here is not always crystal clear, the balance of\navailable precedent favors us. From the prosecution memorandum\nit is clear that Marie has anticipated the strongest legal arguments,\nscrutinized the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> law, and has charged the case accordingly.\nAnd, while with this prosecution the government clearly faces a\nstrong and determined defense team, it is a challenge well worth\nfacing. I also happen to knou that there is absolutely no concern. . .\nabout facing the challenges this case presents.\nIn closing, Oosterban renewed his offer to have CEOS “help you with this prosecution,” and to\nsend “whatever and whoever you need” to assist.\n4 Villafafia forwarded Black’s leter to Menchel, explaining the circumstances relating to the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from Epstein’s home, the steps she had taken to make the required consultations in the\nDepartment, and that she and Lourie had worked together on her response to Black.\na The news that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief was advising the Epstein team led to an email\nexchange between Sloman and CEOS Chief Oosterban, who commented, “By the way, let me knou if you want me\nto put something in writing to you with our position and detailing all of the child prostitution cases she supervised\nwith similar facts.”\n47\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l247\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021250.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OG 3536o38, Page/8 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 76 of 348\n\nSloman also told OPR that he did not knou hou the decision to offer a two-year plea offer\nwas reached, but he believed that Acosta made the decision based on recommendations from\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. He opined to OPR that the decision was likely based on an\nassessment by Menchel and Lourie of the litigation risks presented by the case.*! Sloman added\nthat he did not knou hou a two-year sentence might have related to specific charges or to either\nstate or federal sentencing guidelines. Lourie likewise told OPR he did not recall hou the two-year\nterm was decided upon, or by whom, but he speculated that it may have been presented by the\ndefense as the most Epstein would accept, and that the decision would have been reached by\nAcosta follouing “extended consideration, research, and discussion,” among Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. **\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall discussing a two-year plea deal with Acosta or\nwho reached the decision that two years was an appropriate sentence. Menchel also told OPR,\nhouever, that he recalled believing that if the USAO had filed the contemplated federal charges,\nEpstein would have felt he had “nothing to lose” and “undoubtedly” would have chosen to take\nthe case to trial. Menchel recalled believing there was a real risk that the USAO might lose at trial,\nand in so doing, might cause more trauma to the victims, particularly those who were reluctant to\ntestify. Menchel told OPR that he did not believe that anyone at the time looked at two years “as\na fair result in terms of the conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not\nif we took this case to trial, would we risk losing everything,” and “if we. . . felt we could have\ngoten more time, we would have, without having to press it to the trial.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “I had decided and endorsed” the two-year resolution “at some\npoint,” and that it resulted from “back and forth” discussion “over the course of some days or a\nweek or two.” As noted earlier in this Report, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in this case merely\nas a “backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he explained to OPR was “a polite way of saying[,\n‘Jencouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]”®’ Acosta said that he understood two years’\nimprisonment to have represented the sentence Epstein faced under one of the original charges the\nPBPD was considering at the outset of the state investigation.** Acosta also told OPR that he\n\nthe atorney for the government has a continuing obligation to assist the court in\n\nits determination of the sentence to be imposed. The prosecutor must be familiar\n\nwith the guidelines generally and with the specific guideline provisions <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span>\n\nto his or her case. In discharging these duties, the atorney for the government\n\nshould . . . endeavor to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information\n\nupon which the sentencing decisions will be based.\n8l In Sloman’s view, Menchel and Lourie were “two of the finest trial lawyers” in the USAO.\n82 Lourie noted that Sloman and Menchel were “two extraordinarily experienced people in [Acosta’s] front\noffice who had tried . . . gobs and gobs of cases.”\nBS In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney asserted that OPR’s use of Acosta’s quote, “a litle\nbit more,” “unfairly minimized” Acosta’s and the USAO’s efforts to achieve justice in this case. Acosta’s atorney\nalso asserted that the phrase was “clearly soft-spoken understatement,” that the terms obtained were “substantially\nmore onerous than the state’s alternative resolution,” and that Acosta was “clearly declining the invitation to take the\nState to task and soft-pedaling an obvious distinction.”\n\nSA OPR examined this assertion and was unable to verify that the proposed two-year term of imprisonment\ncorresponded with the charges that the PBPD considered at the outset of the state investigation or with the charge in\n5o\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l25o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021261.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document O87 3536o38, Page89 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 87 of 348\nShe believed that access to the computer evidence would strengthen the government’s negotiating\nposition, but that her supervisors “did not seem to recognize that.” Villafafia said she did not\nunderstand why her supervisors were uninterested in determining what the computers contained.\nInstead, they instructed Villafafia to “keep calling the judge” to ask for a delay in the litigation\nproceedings.\n\nSloman told OPR that he recalled an issue about the computers, but did not recall “what\nthe thinking was at the time” about pursuing that evidence or why Villafafia was “ordered to stand\ndoun.” Acosta, Menchel, and Lourie all told OPR that they did not recall Villafafia’s effort to\nobtain the computer evidence or that there had been litigation relating to it. Lourie, houever, told\nOPR that the computers might have contained “very pouerful evidence” that possibly “could have\nchanged our advice to [Acosta], or his decision making.” In his OPR interview, Menchel was\nuncertain whether the computer evidence would have been useful, but also acknouledged to OPR,\n“You always want more as a prosecutor.”\n\nOn August 3l, 2oo7, in preparation for the upcoming September 7, 2oo7 meeting with\ndefense counsel that he planned to atend, CEOS Chief Oosterban traveled to West Palm Beach\nto meet with Villafafia and the case agents and to examine the case file. He explained to OPR that\nhe wanted to see the file before meeting with the defense so that he could best “represent[] the\ninterests of the prosecution team,” and that he was in favor of going forward with the case.\nAccording to Villafafia, during his review of the file, Oosterban told her that the case was “really\ngood” and offered to assist Villafafia at trial.\n\nOn September 6, 2oo7, the day before the meeting with defense counsel, Sloman sent\nVillafafia an email asking, “Please refresh my recollection. What is the ‘deal’ on the table?”\nSloman told OPR that his question reflected the fact that in his capacity as FAUSA, he was\ninvolved in “a hundred other things” at that time.?® Villafafia sent Sloman the term sheet and\nexplained to him, ““You and Mat [Menchel] and I had also discussed a possible federal plea to an\nInformation charging a 37l conspiracy, with a Rule ll plea with a two-year cap, but I think Mat\nmust have asked Alex about it and it was nixed.” Villafafia continued:\n\nThere are three concerns that I hope we can address tomorrou. First,\n\nthat there is an absolute drop-dead date for accepting or rejecting\n\nbecause it is strategically important that we indict before the end of\n\nSeptember, which means .. . September 25th. Second, the agents\n\nand I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which\n\nas Drew [Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the\n\nlaw. And third, I do not want to make any promises about allouing\n\nEpstein to self-surrender because I still believe that we have a good\n\nchance of geting him detained.”\n38 Sloman noted that with the atention given to the Epstein investigation, “it seems like... this was the only\ncase [in the office], but there were other cases.”\n99 As Villafafia explained in her OPR interview, when a violent crime defendant self-surrenders, the government\nmay have difficulty winning an argument for pretrial detention or bond. Contrary to Villafafia’s assertion in the email,\nthe CVRA, even when <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span>, required only victim consultation, not victim approval, and as is explained in\n\n6l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l26l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021319.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 4S 3536o38, Pagel47 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l45 of 348\nCHAPTER TWO\nPART TWO: <span class=\"highlight\">APPLICABLE</span> STANDARDS\nI. OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR finds professional misconduct when an atorney intentionally violates or acts in\nreckless disregard of a knoun, unambiguous obligation imposed by law, rule of professional\nconduct, or Department regulation or policy. In determining whether an atorney has engaged in\nprofessional misconduct, OPR uses the preponderance of the evidence standard to make factual\nfindings.\n\nAn atorney intentionally violates an obligation or standard when the atorney (l) engages\nin conduct with the purpose of obtaining a result that the obligation or standard unambiguously\nprohibits; or (2) engages in conduct knouing its natural or probable consequence, and that\nconsequence is a result that the obligation or standard unambiguously prohibits. An atorney acts\nin reckless disregard of an obligation or standard when (l) the atorney knous or should knou,\nbased on his or her experience and the unambiguous nature of the obligation or standard, of an\nobligation or standard; (2) the atorney knous or should knou, based on his or her experience and\nthe unambiguous applicability of the obligation or standard, that the atorney’s conduct involves a\nsubstantial likelihood that he or she will violate, or cause a violation of, the obligation or standard;\nand (3) the atorney nonetheless engages in the conduct, which is objectively unreasonable under\nall the circumstances. Thus, an atorney’s disregard of an obligation is reckless when it represents\na gross deviation from the standard of conduct that an objectively reasonable atorney would\nobserve in the same situation.\n\nIf OPR determines that an atorney did not engage in professional misconduct, OPR\ndetermines whether the atorney exercised poor judgment, engaged in other inappropriate conduct,\nmade a mistake, or acted appropriately under all the circumstances. An atorney exercises poor\njudgment when, faced with alternative courses of action, he or she chooses a course of action that\nis in marked contrast to the action that the Department may reasonably expect an atorney\nexercising good judgment to take. Poor judgment differs from professional misconduct in that an\natorney may act inappropriately and thus exhibit poor judgment even though he or she may not\nhave violated or acted in reckless disregard of a clear obligation or standard. In addition, an\natorney may exhibit poor judgment even though an obligation or standard at issue is not\nsufficiently clear and unambiguous to support a professional misconduct finding. A mistake, on\nthe other hand, results from an excusable human error despite an atorney’s exercise of reasonable\ncare under the circumstances.\n\nAn atorney who makes a good faith atempt to ascertain the obligations and standards\nimposed on the atorney and to comply with them in a given situation does not commit professional\nmisconduct. Evidence that an atorney made a good faith atempt to ascertain and comply with\nthe obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not limited to, the fact that the atorney\nreviewed materials that define or discuss one or more potentially <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> obligations and\nstandards, consulted with a supervisor or ethics advisor, notified the tribunal or the atorney\nrepresenting a party or person with adverse interests of an intended course of conduct, or took\n\nll9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021320.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 4G 3536o38, Pagel48 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l46 of 348\naffirmative steps the atorney reasonably believed were required to comply with an obligation or\nstandard.\nIl. <span class=\"highlight\">APPLICABLE</span> STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nA, The United States Atorneys’ Manual\n\nAmong its many provisions, the United States Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) includes\ngeneral statements of principles that summarize appropriate considerations to be weighed, and\ndesirable practices to be folloued, by federal prosecutors when discharging their prosecutorial\nresponsibilities.'8? The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. [d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\nenforcement responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that reference to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\nprosecutions.\n\nl. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a\nFederal Prosecution\n\nFederal prosecutors do not open a case on every mater referred to them.

Whatever the reason,\nwhen it appears that the Federal interest in prosecution is less\nsubstantial than the interest of state or local authorities,\nconsideration should be given to referring the case to those\nauthorities rather than commencing or recommending a Federal\nprosecution.\nAnother comment cautions that in assessing whether to defer to state or local authorities, “the\nFederal prosecutor should be alert to any local conditions, atitudes, relationships or other\ncircumstances that might cast doubt on the likelihood of the state or local authorities conducting a\nthorough and successful prosecution.”\n\nUSAM § 9-27.26o identifies impermissible considerations relating to the decision whether\nto initiate or decline a federal prosecution. Specifically, the decision may not be based on\nconsideration of the person’s race, religion, sex, national origin, or political association, activities,\nor beliefs; the prosecutor’s “oun personal feelings” about the person or the victim; or the possible\neffect of the decision on the prosecutor’s oun professional or personal circumstances. When\nopting to decline federal prosecution, the prosecutor should ensure that the reasons for that decision\nare communicated to the investigating agency and reflected in the office files. USAM § 9-27.27o.\n\n2. USAM § 9-2.o3l: The Petite Policy\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not prohibit prosecutions of a defendant by both state and\nfederal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the\nDepartment has a long-standing policy, knoun as the Petite policy, governing federal prosecutions\ncharged after the initiation of a prosecution in another jurisdiction based on the same or similar\nconduct.!°? The general principles <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> to the prosecution or declination decision are set\nforth in USAM § 9-2.o3l, “Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy (‘Petite Policy’),” which\ncontains guidelines for a federal prosecutor’s exercise of discretion in determining whether to bring\na federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or\nfederal proceeding. The policy applies “whenever there has been a prior state or federal\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”\n\nIn circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new\nfederal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist. The prerequisites are as follous:\n\n(l) The mater must involve a substantial federal interest. The determination whether\n\na substantial federal interest is involved is made on a case-by-case basis. Maters\nl92 See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S. 22, 27-29 (l977); Petite v.

Generally, the U.S. Atorney\nhas authority to approve a non-prosecution agreement. USAM § 9-27.6oo comment. Houever,\nUSAM § 9-27.64o directs that a government atorney should not enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation without first obtaining the approval of the\nappropriate Assistant Atorney General, or his or her designee, when the person is someone who\n“is likely to become of major public interest.”\nThese USAM provisions do not address the uses of non-prosecution agreements in\ncircumstances other than when needed to obtain cooperation.\n5. USAM Provisions Relating to Grants of Immunity\nNothing in the USAM directly prohibits the government from using the criminal exposure\nof third parties in negotiating with a criminal defendant. Instead, the provision that addresses\nimmunity relates only to the exchange of limited immunity for the testimony of a witness who has\nasserted a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. See USAM 8§ 9-23.loo ef seq.\n6. USAM/C.F.R. Provisions Relating to Financial Conflicts of Interest\nDepartment employees are expected to be aware of, and to comply with, all ethics-related\nlaws, rules, regulations, and policies. See, generally, USAM § l-4.ooo et seq. Specifically, a\ngovernment atorney is prohibited by criminal statute from participating personally and\nsubstantially in any particular mater in which he has a financial interest or in which such an\ninterest can be imputed to him. See l8 U.S.C. § 2o8 and 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.4ol-4o2. In addition,\na Department employee should seek advice from an ethics official before participating in any\nmater in which his impartiality could be questioned. If a conflict of interest exists, in order for\nthe employee to participate in the mater, the head of the employee’s component, with the\nconcurrence of an ethics official, must make a determination that the interest of the government in\nthe employee’s participation outweighs the concern that a reasonable person may question the\nintegrity of the Department’s programs and operations. The determination must be made in\nwriting. See 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.5ol-5o2.\nB. Other Department Policies\nl. Department Policies Relating to the Disposition of Charges\nThe Atorney General has the responsibility for establishing prosecutorial priorities for the\nDepartment. Over the span of several decades, each successive Atorney General has articulated\nthose priorities in policy memoranda issued to all federal prosecutors. As <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> here, on\nSeptember 22, 2oo3, Atorney General John Ashcroft issued a memorandum regarding\n“Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and\nSentencing” (Ashcroft Memo). The Ashcroft Memo, which explicitly superseded all previous\nDepartmental guidance on the subject, set forth policies “designed to ensure that all federal\nl25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l325\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021326.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON ED 3536o38, Pagel54 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l52 of 348\nprosecutors adhere to the principles and objectives” of the Sentencing Reform Act of l984, the\nSentencing Guidelines, and the PROTECT Act “in their charging, case disposition, and sentencing\npractices.” !°°\n\nThe Ashcroft Memo directed that, “in all federal cases, federal prosecutors must charge\nand pursue the most serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts of\nthe case,” except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or designated\nsupervisory authority in certain articulated limited circumstances. The Ashcroft Memo cautioned.\nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either\nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial. The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all exception that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “designated\nsupervisory atorney.” As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“narticularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy. In\naddition, the policy applies to “readily provable” charges, thus inherently allouing a prosecutor\nlS The Ashcroft Memo was issued before the Supreme Court decided United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 22o\n(2oo5), which struck doun the provision of the federal sentencing statute that required federal district judges to impose\na sentence within the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> Federal Sentencing Guidelines range. Those Guidelines were the product of\nthe United States Sentencing Commission, which was created by the Sentencing Reform Act of l984. The\nProsecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today (PROTECT) Act of 2oo3, Pub.\nL. lo8-2l, ll7 Stat. 65o, was directed at preventing child abuse. It included a variety of provisions designed to\nimprove the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against children. Among other things, the PROTECT Act\nprovided for specific sentencing considerations for certain sex-related offenses, such as those involving multiple\noccasions of prohibited sexual conduct or those involving material with depictions of violence or with specified\nnumbers of images.\n\nl26\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l326\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021329.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON TES 3536o38, Pagel57 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l55 of 348\nwhen prosecutors have used third parties as leverage in plea negotiations. Numerous courts have\nmade clear, houever, that a plea is not invalid when entered under an agreement that includes a\npromise of leniency touards a third party or in response to a prosecutor’s threat to prosecute a third\nparty if a plea is not entered. See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 9o9 F.2d 738, 74l-42 (2d Cir.\nl99o) (rejecting claim that plea was involuntary because of pressure placed upon a defendant by\nthe government’s insistence that a defendant’s wife would not be offered a plea bargain unless he\npled guilty); Martin v. Kemp, 76o F.2d l244, l248 (llth Cir. l985) (in order to satisfy “heavy\nburden” of establishing that the government had not acted “in good faith,” a defendant challenging\nvoluntariness of his plea on grounds that the prosecutor had threatened to bring charges against\nthe defendant’s pregnant wife had to establish that government lacked probable cause to believe\nthe defendant’s wife had commited a crime at the time it threatened to charge her); Stinson v.\nState, 839 So. 2d 9o6, 9o9 (Fla. App. 2oo3) (“In cases involving .. . a promise not to prosecute a\nthird party, the government must act in good faith . . . [and] must have probable cause to charge\nthe third party.”).\n\nThe second context concerns situations in which courts have enforced prosecutors’\npromises of leniency to third parties. For example, in State v. Frazier, 697 So. 2d 944 (Fla. App.\nl997), as consideration for the defendant’s guilty plea, the prosecutor agreed and announced in\nopen court that the government would dismiss charges against the defendant’s niece and nephew,\nwho had all been charged as a result of the same incident. When the state reneged and atempted\nto prosecute the niece and nephew, the trial court dismissed the charges against them, and the state\nappealed. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that under contract law\nprinciples, the niece and nephew were third-party beneficiaries of the plea agreement and were\ntherefore entitled to enforce it.\n\nApart from voluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a\nprosecutor’s promise not to prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of\nprosecutorial discretion.\n\nD. State Bar Rules\n\nDuring the period relevant to this Report, the five subject atorneys were members of the\nbar in several different states and were subject to the rules of professional conduct in each state in\nwhich they held membership.!”’ In determining which rules apply, OPR applied the local rules of\nthe U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida (Local Rules) and the choice-of-law\nprovisions of each <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> bar.

Atorney Admission Rule 6(b)(2)(A) makes clear that\natorneys practicing before the court are subject to the Florida Bar’s Rules of Professional Conduct\n(FRPC). Moreover, the choice-of-law provisions contained within the relevant state’s rules of\nprofessional conduct make the FRPC <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> to their conduct.\nl. FRPC 4-l.l —- Competence\nFRPC 4-l.l requires that a lawyer provide competent representation to a client.?°\nCompetent representation requires the legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation\nreasonably necessary for the representation. A comment to the rule clarifies that the factors\nrelevant to determining a lawyer’s competence to handle a particular mater include “the relative\ncomplexity and specialized nature of the mater, the lawyer’s general experience, the lawyer’s\ntraining and experience in the field in question, the preparation and study the lawyer is able to give\nthe mater, and whether it is feasible to refer the mater to, or associate or consult with, a lawyer\nof established competence in the field.” The comment further notes that “[i]n many instances the\nrequired proficiency is that of a general practitioner.” With respect to particular maters,\ncompetence requires inquiry into and analysis of the factual and legal elements of the problem.\nThe comment to Rule 4-l.l explains that “[t]he required atention and preparation are determined\nin part by what is at stake; major litigation and complex transactions ordinarily require more\nextensive treatment than maters of lesser complexity and consequence.”\n2. FRPC 4-l.3 — Diligence\nFRPC 4-l.3 specifies that a lawyer should act with reasonable diligence and promptness in\nrepresenting a client. A comment to this rule explains, “A lawyer should pursue a mater on behalf\nof a client despite opposition, obstruction, or personal inconvenience to the lawyer and take\nwhatever lawful and ethical measures are required to vindicate a client’s cause or endeavor.” A\nlawyer must exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but is not required “to press for every\nadvantage that might be realized for a client.”\n3. FRPC 4-4.l — Candor in Dealing with Others\nFRPC 4-4.l prohibits a lawyer from knouingly making a false statement of material fact\nor law to a third person during the course of representation of a client. A comment to this rule\nexplains that “[mJisrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or\nomissions that are the equivalent of affirmative false statements,” and “[w]hether a particular\nstatement should be regarded as one of fact can depend on the circumstances.”\ntee See also 28 U.S.C. § 53oB(a), providing that government atorneys are subject to state laws and state and\nlocal federal court rules governing atorneys in each state where the government atorney engages in his duties.\n2oo The federal prosecutor does not have an individual “client,” but rather represents the people of the United\nStates. See generally 28 U.S.C. § 547 (duties of U.S. Atorney); 28 C.F.R. § o.5(b) (the Atorney General represents\nthe United States in legal maters).\nl3o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l33o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021336.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONG 3536o38, Pagel64 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l62 of 348\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his decision was\nmotivated by improper factors, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under federal law and under the\nUSAM to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate. As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were motivated or\ninfluenced by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\nconviction may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” Jd. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment).”° The\n“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain circumstances, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate Assistant Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for cooperation.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\ncircumstances other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully\nmemorialized in writing. Although this requirement was not <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> for the reasons given above, the NPA complied\nby fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l336\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021337.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONG 3536o38, Pagel65 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l63 of 348\nagreement that did not require Epstein’s cooperation nor did the USAM require Acosta to obtain\nDepartmental approval before doing so.\nC. The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.?°°\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM §§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).\n2o8 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villatafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules. An atorney may\natain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the\nrequirements of the standard.\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l337\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021366.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l99 3536o38, Pagel94 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l92 of 348\nentitled to significant weight, and OPR credits them. OPR finds, therefore, that the emails in\nquestion do not themselves establish that Villafafia (or any other subject) acted to improperly\nbenefit Epstein, was motivated by favoritism or other improper influences, or sought to silence\nvictims.\n\nG. The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta, Lourie, or Villafaia Agreed to\nthe NPA’s Provision Promising Not to Prosecute “Potential Co-conspirators”\nin Order to Protect Any of Epstein’s Political, Celebrity, or Other Influential\nAssociates\n\nOPR examined the decision by the subjects who negotiated the NPA—Villafafia, Lourie,\nand Acosta—to include in the agreement a provision in which the USAO agreed not to prosecute\n“any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” in addition to four named individuals, to determine\nwhether that provision resulted from the subjects’ improper favoritism touards Epstein or an\nimproper effort to shield from prosecution any of Epstein’s knoun associates. Other than various\ndrafts of the NPA and of a federal plea agreement, OPR found litle in the contemporaneous\nrecords mentioning the provision and nothing indicating that the subjects discussed or debated it—\nor even gave it much consideration. Drafts of the NPA and of the federal plea agreement shou\nthat the final broad language promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”\nevolved from a more narrou provision sought by the defense. The provision expanded as Villafafia\nand defense counsel exchanged drafts of, first, a proposed federal plea agreement and, then, of the\nNPA, with apparently litle analysis and no substantive discussion within the USAO about the\nprovision.”3”\n\nAs the NPA drafting process concluded, Villafafia circulated to Lourie and another\nsupervisor a draft that contained the non-prosecution provision, telling Lourie it was “some of\n[defense counsel’s] requested language regarding promises not to prosecute other people,” and\ncommenting only, “I don’t think it hurts us.” In a reply email, Lourie responded to another issue\n237 As set forth in OPR’s factual discussion, early in the negotiations over a federal plea agreement, the defense\nsought a non-prosecution provision <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> to only four female named assistants of Epstein and to unnamed\nemployees of one of his companies. Villafafia initially countered with “standard language” referring to unnamed\n“co-conspirators” so as to avoid “highlight[ing] for the judge all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that\nwe could charge.” Nonetheless, drafts of the NPA sent by Lefkouitz after Villafafia’s email continued to include\nlanguage referring to the four named assistants and unnamed employees. Villafafia, houever, internally circulated\ndrafts of a federal plea agreement that included language stating, “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability\nof the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal conduct by\nthose persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement.” The federal plea agreement draft revised\nby Lourie and Acosta on September 2o, 2oo7, included that language. When the defense team reverted to negotiation\nof state charges, Villafafia advised them, “In the context of a non-prosecution agreement, the [USAO] may be more\nwilling to be specific about not pursuing charges against others.” The next day, Lefkouitz sent a revised draft NPA\nreferring to the four named assistants, “any employee” of the named company, and “any unnamed co-conspirators for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” The language was finally revised by Villafafia\nto prohibit prosecution of “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to [the four named\nassistants].”\n\nIn commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel and Lourie both noted that the non-prosecution\nprovision could bind only the USAO, and Lourie further opined that it was limited to certain specified federal charges\nand a time-limited scope of conduct. Although the non-prosecution provision in the NPA did not explicitly contain\nsuch limitations, those limitations were included in other parts of the agreement.\n\nl66\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l366\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021372.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l98 3536o38, Page2oo of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l98 of 348\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind... . the\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the []state.. .\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\n\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\n\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein\nwould have become final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. In\nAcosta’s view, “the federal responsibility” in this unique situation was merely to serve as a “back-\nstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no miscarriage of justice.”*’ Acosta told OPR\nthat he understood the PBPD would not have brought Epstein to the FBI’s atention if the State\nAtorney had pursued charges that required Epstein’s incarceration. Acosta therefore decided that\nthe USAO could avert a “manifest injustice” by forcing the state to do more and require Epstein\nto serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender.\n\nAcosta’s reasoning was flawed and unduly constricted. Acosta’s repeated references to a\n“miscarriage of justice” or “manifest injustice” echoes the “manifestly inadequate” language used\nin the Petite policy to define the circumstances in which the federal government may proceed with\na criminal case after a completed state prosecution. Nothing in the Petite policy, houever, requires\nsimilar restraint when the federal government pursues a case in the absence of a completed state\nprosecution, even if the state is already investigating the same offense. The goal of the Petite\npolicy is to prevent multiple prosecutions for the same offense, not to compel the federal\ngovernment to defer to a parallel state interest in a case, particularly one in which state officials\ninvolved in the state prosecution expressed significant concerns about it, and there were questions\nregarding the state prosecutor’s commitment to the case. Acosta told OPR that “there are any\nnumber of instances where the federal government or the state government can proceed, and state\ncharges are substantially less and different, and . . . the federal government . . . stands aside and\nlets the state proceed.” The fact that the federal government can allou the state to proceed with a\nprosecution, houever, does not mean the federal government is compelled to do so, particularly in\na mater in which a distinct and important federal interest exists. Indeed, the State Atorney told\nOPR that the federal government regularly takes over cases initiated by state investigators,\ntypically because federal charges result in “the best sentence.”\n\nEpstein was facing a substantial sentence under the federal sentencing guidelines.”**\nDespite the Ashcroft Memo’s directive that federal prosecutors pursue “the most serious readily\nprovable offense,” Acosta’s decision to push “the state to do a litle bit more” does not approach\nthat standard. In fact, Acosta conceded during his OPR interview that the NPA did not represent\nan “appropriate punishment” in the federal system, nor even “the best outcome in the state system,”\nand that if the investigation of Epstein had originated with the FBI, rather than as a referral from\nthe PBPD, the outcome might have been different. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to\noth Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\nams Villafafia estimated that the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> sentencing guidelines range was l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment.\n\nl72\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l372\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021380.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 3o6 3536o38, Page2o8 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o6 of 348\n“[’m reconstructing memories of... l2 years ago. I can speculate that at some point, the mater\ncame up, and I or someone else said... what would the original charges have likely brought? And\nsomeone said this amount.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall who initially proposed this\nmethod, but he believed that it likely did not result from a single specific discussion but rather\nfrom conversations over a course of time. Acosta could not recall specifically with whom he had\nthese discussions, other than that it would have been Lourie, Menchel, or Sloman. Villafafia was\nnot asked for her views on a two-year sentence, and she had no input into the decision before it\nwas made. Villafafia told OPR that she examined the state statutes and could not validate that a\nstate charge would have resulted in a 24-month sentence. OPR also examined <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> state\nstatutes and the Florida sentencing guidelines, but could not confirm that Epstein was, in fact,\nfacing a potential two-year sentence under charges contemplated by the PBPD.\n\nOn the other hand, during his OPR interview, Lourie “guess[ed]” that “somehou the\ndefense conveyed .. . we’re going to trial if it’s more than two years.” Menchel similarly told\nOPR that he did not knou hou the two year sentence was derived, but “obviously it was a number\nthat the office felt was palatable enough that [Epstein] would take” it. Sloman told OPR that he\nhad no idea hou the two-year sentence proposal was reached.\n\nThe contemporaneous documentary record, houever, provides no indication that Epstein’s\nteam proposed a two-year sentence of incarceration or initially suggested, before the USAO made\nits offer, that Epstein would accept a two-year term of incarceration. As late as July 25, 2oo7—\nonly days before the USAO provided the term sheet to defense counsel—Epstein’s counsel\nsubmited a leter to the USAO arguing that the federal government should not prosecute Epstein\nat all. Furthermore, after the initial “term sheet” was presented and negotiations for the NPA\nprogressed, Epstein’s team continued to strongly press for less or no time in jail.\n\nThe USAO had other charging and sentencing options available to it. The most obvious\nalternative to the two-year sentence proposal was to offer Epstein a plea to a federal offense that\ncarried a harsher sentence. If federally charged, Epstein was facing a substantial sentence under\nthe federal sentencing guidelines, l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment. Houever, it is unlikely that\nhe would have agreed to a plea that required a guidelines sentence, even one at the louer end of\nthe guidelines. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues had been concerned that Epstein\nwould opt to go to trial if charged and presented with the option of pleading to a guidelines\nsentence, and as previously discussed, there were both evidentiary and legal risks atendant upon\na trial in this case. If federally charged, Epstein’s sentencing exposure could have been managed.\nby offering him a plea under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c) for a stipulated sentence,\nwhich requires judicial approval. Acosta rejected this idea, houever, apparently because of a\nperception that the federal district courts in the Southern District of Florida did not view Rule ll(c)\npleas favorably and might refuse to accept such a plea and thus limit the USAO’s options.\n\nAnother alternative was to offer Epstein a plea to conspiracy, a federal charge that carried\na maximum five-year sentence. Shortly after Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum\nto her supervisors, Lourie recommended to Acosta charging Epstein by criminal complaint and\noffering a plea to conspiracy “to make a plea atractive.” Similarly, before learning that Menchel\nhad already discussed a state-based resolution with Epstein’s counsel, Villafafia had considered\noffering Epstein a plea to one count of conspiracy and a substantive charge, to be served\nconcurrently with any sentence he might receive separately as a result of the state’s outstanding\n\nl8o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l38o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021405.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 33l 3536o38, Page233 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23l of 348\nChief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.””°! Sloman forwarded this\nemail to Acosta. Villafafia recalled that Sloman responded to her email by telephone, possibly\nafter he had spoken to Acosta, and stated, “[Y]Jou can’t do that nou.” Villafafia did not recall\nSloman explaining at the time the reason for that instruction.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve\nbeen advised that . . . pre-charge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Sloman did not\nrecall any discussions, before the NPA was signed, about contacting the victims or conferring with\nthem regarding the potential resolution of the case. Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that\nwe had to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA,” and “we did not have to seek\napproval from victims to resolve a case. We did have an obligation to notify them of the resolution\nin... filed cases.” Sloman said that no one other than Villafafia raised the notification issue, and\nbecause the USAO envisioned a state court resolution of the mater, Sloman “did not think that we\nhad to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA.” Lourie told OPR that he had no\nmemory of Villafafia being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.”” Similarly, the\natorney who assumed Lourie’s supervisory duties after Lourie transitioned to his detail in the\nDepartment told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim notification and he\n“assumed that was being handled.”?”?\n\nAcosta did not recall the September 6, 2oo7 email, but told OPR that “there is no\nrequirement to notify [the victims], because it’s not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state\nprosecution.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall any “pre-NPA discussions” regarding\nvictim notification or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the\nvictims before entering into the NPA.*™ Ultimately, Acosta acknouledged to OPR, “[C]learly,\ngiven the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had [consulted with the victims].”\n\nCEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR that he disagreed with the USAO’s stance that the\nCVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was\nnot “‘an abuse of discretion” or “an ethical issue,” but rather reflected a “serious and legitimate\n29l Villafafia told OPR that she referred to Oosterban in the email because “the was the head of CEOS and\nbecause I think they were tired of hearing me nag them [to notify the victims].” As previously noted, Villafafia’s\nstatement that victim approval had to be obtained was incorrect. Even when <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span>, the CVRA only requires\nconsultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement. Moreover, Villafafia’s comments concerning the\npre-charge application of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement\nto OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent leters to victims in August 2oo6.\neee Lourie noted that during this period, he had left Florida and was no longer the supervising AUSA in the\noffice, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “historical knouledge” of the case.\n\n223 The AUSA who for a time served as Villafafia’s co-counsel on the Epstein investigation similarly did not\n“knou anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the\ncase. The AUSA stated that he stopped working on the case “months earlier” and that he “didn’t have anything to do\nwith the [NPA] negotiations.”\n294 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto... instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n2o5\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021449.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Pagel9 of 2l7\nSA-273\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 273 of 348\nCHAPTER THREE\nPART TWO: <span class=\"highlight\">APPLICABLE</span> STANDARDS\nI.

Consultation With a Government Atorney\n\n(l) In General. A victim has the reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the\nGovernment in the case. The victim’s right to confer, houever, shall not be\nconstrued to impair prosecutorial discretion. Federal prosecutors should be\navailable to consult with victims about major case decisions, such as dismissals,\nrelease of the accused pending judicial proceedings (when such release is for\nnoninvestigative purposes), plea negotiations, and pretrial diversion. Because\nvictims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government, and may disclose\nwhatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only\nnonsensitive data and public information. Consultations should comply with the\nprosecutor’s obligations under <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> rules of professional conduct.\nRepresentatives of the Department should take care to inform victims that neither\nthe Department’s advocacy for victims nor any other effort that the Department\nmay make on their behalf constitutes or creates an atorney-client relationship\nbetween such victims and the lawyers for the Government.\nDepartment personnel should not provide legal advice to victims.\n(2) Prosecutor Availability. Prosecutors should be reasonably available to consult\nwith victims regarding significant adversities they may suffer as a result of delays\nin the prosecution of the case and should, at the appropriate time, inform the court\nof the reasonable concerns that have been conveyed to the prosecutor.\n(3) Proposed Plea Agreements. Responsible officials should make reasonable\nefforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views about,\nprospective plea negotiations. In determining what is reasonable, the responsible\nofficial should consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving\nnotice and considering views in the context of the particular case, including, but not\nlimited to, the follouing factors:\n\n(a) The impact on public safety and risks to personal safety.\n\n(b) The number of victims.\n\n(c) Whether time is of the essence in negotiating or entering a proposed plea.\n\n252\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l454\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021461.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 385 3536o39, Page3l of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 285 of 348\ndid not find evidence shouing that the subjects intended to silence victims or to prevent them from\nhaving input into the USAO’s intent to resolve the federal investigation.\n\nAlthough the contemporaneous records provide some information about victim notification\ndecisions made after the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, the records contain litle about\nthe subjects’ views regarding consultation with victims before the NPA was signed. In a\nSeptember 6, 2oo7 email primarily addressing other topics, as the plea negotiations were beginning\nin earnest and almost three weeks before the NPA was signed, Villafafia raised the topic of victim\nconsultation with Sloman: “The agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their\napproval, which as [CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law. . . .\n[A]nd the [PBPD] Chief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.’”*™\nSloman forwarded the email to Acosta with a note stating, “fyi.” Villafafia recalled that after she\nsent the email, Sloman told her by telephone, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.’*° Villafafia also told\nOPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve been advised that . . . pre-\ncharge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Villafafia also recalled a discussion with\nAcosta, Menchel, and Sloman, during which she stated that she would need to get victims’ input\non the terms being proposed to the defense, and she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential.\nYou can’t disclose them.”*°°\n\nNone of the other subjects recalled a specific discussion before the NPA was signed about\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations. Menchel told OPR he believed the USAO was not required to\nconsult with victims during the preliminary “general discussion” phase of setlement negotiations;\nmoreover, he left the USAO before the terms of the NPA were fully developed.\n\nSloman told OPR that he “did not think that we had to consult with victims prior to entering\ninto the NPA” and ‘“‘we did not have to seek approval from victims to resolve a case.” Sloman\nbelieved the USAO was obligated only to notify victims about resolution of “the cases that we\nhandled, filed cases.” Sloman recalled that because the USAO envisioned a state court resolution\nof the mater, he did not “think that that was a concern of ours at the time to consult with [the\nvictims] prior to entering into... the NPA.”\n\nLourie told OPR that he did not recall any discussions about informing the victims about\nthe terms of the NPA or any instructions to Villafafia that she not discuss the NPA with the victims.\nHe stated that everything the USAO did was “‘to try and get the best result as possible for the\nvictims. .. . [O]nce you step back and look at the whole forest .. ., you will see that... . [I]f you\nlook at each tree and say, well, you didn’t do this right for the victim, you didn’t tell the victim\nthis and that, you’re missing the big picture.”\n\n4o4 As noted, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not require consultation with victims\nbecause no criminal charges had been filed. In addition, Villafafia’s reference to victim “approval” was inaccurate\nbecause the CVRA, even when <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span>, requires only “consultation” with victims about prosecutorial decisions.\n\n4o5 Villafafia did not recall Sloman explaining the reason for the decision.\n\nlo8 Villatafia also told OPR that she recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations\ncould cause victims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.” Villafafia was\nuncertain of the date of the conversation, but Menchel’s presence requires it to have occurred before August 3, 2oo7.\n\n259\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l46l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021468.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3599 3536o39, Page38 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 292 of 348\nstrongly objected to the government’s plan to notify victims of the state proceedings, which he\ndescribed as “highly inappropriate” and an “intrusion into state affairs, when the identified\nindividuals are not even victims of the crime for which Mr. Epstein is being sentenced.”\n\nThereafter—at a time when the USAO believed Epstein’s plea to be imminent—Villafafia\ndrafted, and Sloman signed, the December 6, 2oo7 leter to Lefkouitz rejecting the defense\narguments regarding notification and reiterating the USAO’s position that the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation be invited to appear at the state plea hearing. The leter took an expansive\nview of the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> statutes by contending that both the CVRA and the VRRA required the\nUSAO to notify the victims of the state proceedings:\n\n[T]hese sections are not limited to proceedings in a federal district\ncourt. Our Non-Prosecution Agreement resolves the federal\ninvestigation by allouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense.\nThe victims identified through the federal investigation should be\nappropriately informed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does\nnot require the U.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal\nobligations.*\"°\n\nThe leter also asserted that the VRRA obligated the USAO to provide the victims with\ninformation concerning restitution to which they may be entitled and “the earliest possible” notice\nof the status of the investigation, the filing of charges, and the acceptance of a plea. Along with\nthe leter, Sloman forwarded a revised draft victim notification leter to Lefkouitz for his\ncomments. This draft victim notification leter stated that the federal investigation had been\ncompleted, Epstein would plead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of\nimprisonment at sentencing, and Epstein would compensate victims for monetary damages claims\nbrought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The draft victim notification leter provided specific information\nconcerning the upcoming change of plea hearing and invited the victims to atend or provide a\nwriten statement to the State Atorney’s Office. When Lefkouitz asked Sloman to delay sending\nvictim notifications until after a discussion of their contents, Sloman instructed Villafafia, who was\npreparing leters for transmital to 3o victims, to “Hold the leter.” During his OPR interview,\nSloman recalled that he had “wanted to push the leter out,” but he “must have had a conversation\nwith somebody” about whether the CVRA applied, and based on that conversation he directed\nVillafafia to hold the leter.\n\nIn his response leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz contended that the government had\nmisinterpreted both the CVRA and VRRA because neither applied to the “public proceeding in\nthis mater [which] will be in state court for the purpose of the entry of a plea on state charges.”\n4l6 Sloman told Lefkouitz the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is simply informing the\nvictims of their rights.” Sloman also addressed the defense atorneys’ objection to advising the victims that they could\ncontact Villafafia or the FBI case agent with questions or concerns by referencing the CVRA, noting, “Again, federal\nlaw requires that victims have the ‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.’”\n\n266\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l468\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021470.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 359o4 3536o39, Page4o of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 294 of 348\nparticular charges and victims at issue. Once the hearing was scheduled, Sloman told Villafafia to\ncontact PBPD Chief Reiter about notifying the victims, and on June 28, 2oo8, she reported back\nto Sloman that Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”*'* Villafafia recalled that she\nsent Reiter a list of the girls identified as victims during the federal investigation, and Reiter said\nhe would “contact as many as he could.” The contemporaneous records do not shou hou many\nor which victims, if any, Reiter contacted, and no victims were present in the courtroom. No victim\nwho provided information to OPR, either in person or through her atorney, recalled receiving\nnotice of the plea hearing from federal or state officials. At the time Epstein pled guilty in state\ncourt, no one in the USAO knew exactly who, if anyone, Reiter or the State Atorney’s Office had\nnotified about the proceeding. Accordingly, Villafafia, who was present in the courtroom for the\nhearing, had no knouledge to whom Belohlavek referred when she told the court that the victims\nwere “in agreement with the terms of this plea.”*!”\n\nOPR considered whether Acosta’s decision to defer to the State Atorney’s Office the\ndecision to notify victims of the scheduled date for Epstein’s plea hearing constituted professional\nmisconduct. OPR could not conclude that the CVRA or VRRA provisions in question, requiring\nnotice of any public proceeding involving the crime against the victim or that the victim is entitled\nto atend, unambiguously required federal prosecutors to notify victims of state court proceedings.\nFurthermore, as discussed previously, OLC had issued guidance stating that the CVRA did not\napply to cases in which no federal charges had been filed.*”° Moreover, the section of the VRRA\nrequiring notice of court proceedings that the victim is “entitled to atend” referred specifically to\nproceedings under 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b)(4), which, at the time of the Epstein case, had become\npart of the CVRA (l8 U.S.C. § 377l (a)(2)).77\"\n\nBecause Acosta had no clear or unambiguous duty to inform victims identified in the\nfederal investigation of the state plea hearing, OPR concludes that his decision to defer to the State\nAtorney the decision to notify victims of the state’s plea hearing and the responsibility for doing\nso did not constitute professional misconduct.*”\n\n4l8 Sloman replied, “Good.” In her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make\noral notifications to the victims regarding the upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification\ncould only come from a state investigator, and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n4l9 Plea Hearing Transcript at 42.\n42o OLC 2oo5 CVRA Informal Guidance; see also United States v.

OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances.

United States,\n483 U.S. lo7, l2o-2l (l987). Permiting “post-verdict\nscrutiny of juror conduct” would undermine pillars\nthat undergird the jury trial right, including “full and\nfrank discussion in the jury room, jurors’ willingness\nto return an unpopular verdict, and the community’s\ntrust in a system that relies on the decisions of laypeo-\nple.” Jd. Such inquiries may instead “lead to evil con-\nsequences: subjecting juries to harassment, inhibiting\njuryroom deliberation, burdening courts with merit-\nless applications, increasing temptation for jury tam-\npering and creating uncertainty in jury verdicts.”\nUnited States v. Ianniello, 866 F.2d 54o, 543 (2d Cir.\nl989).\n\nAccordingly, a defendant seeking Rule 33 relief\nbased on alleged juror misrepresentations during voir\ndire must satisfy a stringent two-part test.

Brady & Giglio\n\nThe Government has an obligation under the Due Process Clause to make a timely\ndisclosure of any exculpatory or impeaching evidence that is material and in its possession. See\nBrady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (l963); Giglio v. United States, 4o5 U.S. l5o (l972); see also\nUnited States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d l32, l39-4o (2d Cir. 2ool). Evidence is “material” in this sense\nonly if “its suppression undermines confidence in the outcome ofa trial.” United States v. Bagley,\n473 U.S. 667, 678 (l985). “The rationale underlying Brady is not to supply a defendant with all\nthe evidence in the Government’s possession which might conceivably assist the preparation of\nhis defense, but to assure that the defendant will not be denied access to exculpatory evidence only\nknoun to the Government.” United States v. LeRoy, 687 F.2d 6lo, 6l9 (2d Cir. l982) (citing\nUnited States v. Ruggiero, 472 F.2d 599, 6o4 (2d Cir. l973)).\n\nImpeachment evidence is material only “where the witness at issue supplied the only\nevidence linking the defendant(s) to the crime, or where the likely impact on the witness’s\ncredibility would have undermined a critical element of the prosecution’s case.” United States v.\nPayne, 63 F.3d l2oo, l2lo (2d Cir. l995) (internal quotation marks and citations omited).\nSimilarly, “where the undisclosed evidence merely furnishes an additional basis on which to\nchallenge a witness whose credibility has already been shoun to be questionable or is subject to\nextensive atack by reason of other evidence, the undisclosed evidence may properly be viewed as\ncumulative, and hence not material.” United States v. Persico, 645 F.3d 85, ll (2d Cir. 2oll)\n(citing cases). With regard to the timing of disclosing material under Giglio, the Second Circuit,\nin Coppa, rejected the argument that such material should be disclosed when defendants make a\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- ooo22o74\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022077.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document35 Filed o4/24/2o Page l5 of 34\nB. The Requested Records Are Not “Material” to Preparing a Defense and Are\nSought for the Impermissible Purpose of Jury Nullification\n\nAll of the records Thomas seeks in his motion are not “material to preparing a defense”\nunder Rule l6, and are not exculpatory under Brady, because they are irrelevant to countering the\nGovernment’s false statements case or advancing a legitimate defense. Instead, Thomas seeks\nevidence of staffing shortages, working conditions, the implementation of BOP policies,\nsupervisory lapses, and instances in which other BOP employees were not prosecuted so that he\ncan engage in atempted jury nullification by arguing that those conditions “led” to the criminal\nconduct that he is charged with and are a reason to acquit him. (Mot. 5, 7, 9, l4). Thomas is not\nentitled to records—and certainly would not be entitled to introduce any such evidence at trial—\nthat would aid in that nullification effort because Rule l6 only entitles a defendant to discovery\nfor purposes of bolstering a defense to the Government’s case in chief, not the merits of the\ndecision to prosecute.\n\nl. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\n\nAn item or record that the Government does not intend to use in its case-in-chief at trial is\ndiscoverable under Rule l6(a)(l)(E) only if it “is material to preparing the defense.” Fed. R. Crim.\nP. l6(a)(l)(E). “It is [a defendant’s] burden to make a prima facie shouing that documents sought\nunder Rule l6(a)(l)(E)(i) are material to preparing the defense.” United States v. Rigas, 258 F.\nSupp. 2d 299, 3o7 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo3) (citing United States v. McGuinness, 764 F. Supp. 888, 894\n(S.D.N.Y. l99l)). As noted above, an item is “material to preparing the defense” under Rule l6\n“if it could be used to counter the Government’s case or bolster a defense.” Stevens, 985 F.2d at\nll8o-8l. The defendant must “offer more than the conclusory allegation that the requested\nevidence is material.” Rigas, 258 F. Supp. 2d at 3o7 (internal citation omited).\n\nAs the Supreme Court held in United States v. Armstrong, while Rule l6 authorizes\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o77\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022083.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 2l of 34\nsupra) defenses, is not legally required and would impose a nearly insurmountable obligation on\nthe Government of marshaling and reviewing information and data in the possession of an entirely\nseparate entity.\n\nl. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\n\nAs described above, Rule l6, Brady, and Giglio apply to materials in the Government’s\n“possession.” As a general mater, while “[a]n individual prosecutor is presumed . . . to have\nknouledge of all information gathered in connection with his office’s investigation of the\ncase, .. . knouledge on the part of persons employed by a different office of the government does\nnot in all instances warrant the imputation of knouledge to the prosecutor.” United States v.\nAvellino, l36 F.3d 249, 255 (2d Cir. l998) (citations omited). The imposition of such “an\nunlimited duty on a prosecutor to inquire of other offices not working with the prosecutor’s office\non the case in question would inappropriately require us to adopt a monolithic view of government’\nthat would ‘condemn the prosecution of criminal cases to a state of paralysis.” Jd. (citation &\nquotation marks omited); see also Kyles v. Whitley, 5l4 U.S. 4l9, 437 (l995) (Government’s\ndiscovery and disclosure obligations extend only to information in the custody of the prosecutor\nor “others acting on the government’s behalf in the case”). Thus, discovery and disclosure\nobligations only extend “information knoun to persons who are a part of the ‘prosecution\nteam’ ... who perform investigative duties or make strategic decisions about the prosecution of\nthe case,” including “police officers and federal agents who submit to the direction of the\nprosecutor and participate in the investigation.” United States v. Barcelo, 628 F. App’x 36, 38 (2d\nCir. 2ol5) (citation omited). Brady is not a basis to compel the Government to gather information\nin the possession of third parties on behalf of the defense.

Moreover, Thomas’s request for draft versions of the Report—which do not yet\nexist—fails for two additional reasons.\n\nFirst, drafts of the Inspector General’s Report, which has not been completed and will\nlikely make recommendations about reforms at the BOP, are protected from disclosure under the\ndeliberative process privilege, which “covers ‘documents reflecting advisory opinions,\nrecommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions\nand policies are formulated.’” Dep ’t of Interior v. Klamath Water Users Protective Ass’n, 532\nU.S. l, 8 (2ool) (quoting V.L.R.B. v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 42l U.S. l32, l5o (l975)). The\nprivilege is <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> in criminal and civil cases involving the government. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Fernandez, 23l F.3d l24o, l246-47 (9th Cir. 2ooo) (government’s death penalty\nevaluation form and prosecution memoranda were shielded from discovery under the deliberative\nprocess privilege); In re Sealed Case, l2l F.3d 729, 737-4o (D.C. Cir. l997) (indicating that the\nprivilege applies to grand jury subpoenas); United States v. Frank, 8 F. Supp. 2d 253, 284\n(S.D.N.Y. l998) (internal memoranda covered by privilege). “In order for the privilege to apply,\nthe agency record at issue must be (l) an inter-agency or intra-agency memorandum or leter; (2)\npre-decisional; and (3) deliberative.” Nat’l Res. Def. Council v. U.S. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 954 F.3d\nl5o, l55 (2d Cir. 2o2o). “Tt is well-setled that draft documents, by their very nature, are typically\npre-decisional and deliberative [because] [t]hey reflect only the tentative view of their authors;\nviews that might be altered or rejected upon further deliberation by their authors or by their\nsuperiors.” Color of Change v.

As such, given that the prosecution has already produced\nin discovery all of the materials it provided to the DOJ-OIG atorneys preparing the Report, the\nunderlying materials for the Report would be merely cumulative of information in the defendants’\npossession. Any analysis of those materials by the atorneys preparing the Inspector General’s\nReport is not subject to disclosure pursuant to Rule l6 and cannot constitute Brady material. See\nUnited States v. Lewis, 35 F.3d l48, l5o (4th Cir. l994) (noting generally that “nothing contained\nin [an] OIG report would ordinarily have been discoverable”).\n\nAt botom, Thomas has not cited a single authority requiring the production of a draft,\nunpublished report by an inspector general or related work product, and such production is not\nrequired by Rule l6, Brady, Giglio, or any other disclosure obligation.\n\nE. Thomas Has Not Carried His Burden With Respect to Discovery of Material\n\nin Support of a Selective Prosecution Claim\n\nThomas seeks “information and statistics that shou the conduct in which the defendant is\nbeing charged with a crime were . . . rampant throughout the BOP” and that the application of\ncriminal laws to him is “possibl[y] discriminatory.” (Mot. 7.) This request, which is effectively a\ndemand for discovery in furtherance of a selective prosecution claim, should be denied not only\nfor the reasons set forth in Section II.B, but also because Thomas has not made the requisite\nshouing that is necessary to obtain discovery for a selective prosecution claim. Indeed, Thomas\nhas failed to put forth any evidence that his prosecution was the result of discriminatory effect or\ndiscriminatory purpose.\n\nl. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law\n\n“A selective-prosecution claim is not a defense on the merits to the criminal charge itself,\nbut an independent assertion that the prosecutor has brought the charge for reasons forbidden by\nthe Constitution.” Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. at 468.

It didn’t provide for prison time. It didn’t provide for\nregistration, and then you had the restitution issue. There were legal\nissues .... There were witness issues.

Alternatively, we could look at\na pre-indictment resolution, and at various points, the office went\nback and forth between a federal pre-indictment resolution, and a\nstate pre-indictment resolution.\nAcosta told OPR that, in the end, “there was a preference for deferring to the state” because, in\npart, the facts of the Epstein case at the time appeared to constitute solicitation or prostitution\nrather than trafficking, and a federal prosecution would be “uncharted territory.” Acosta explained\nthat he did not view it as problematic to defer resolution of the case to the state, although as the\nEpstein case played out, the federal role became “more intrusive” than he had anticipated, because\nthe defense tried to get the state to “circumvent and undermine” the outcome.\nAtorney’s Office could have proceeded against Epstein by way of an information, but decided to go into the grand\njury because the State Atorney’s Office “didn’t like the case” and wanted “political cover” for declining the case or\nproceeding on a lesser charge.\n83 Menchel told OPR, houever, that the federal judges in West Palm Beach were highly regarded and were\ngenerally viewed as “pro-prosecution.”\nom Acosta said that “dismissing a number of counts and then doing a [R]ule ll is not something that [South\nFlorida federal district] judges tend to do.” Other subjects also told OPR that the federal judges in the Southern District\nof Florida were generally considered averse to pleas that bound them on sentencing, commonly referred to as “Rule\nll(c) pleas.”\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) allous the parties to agree on a specific sentence as part of\na plea agreement. The court is required to impose that sentence if the court accepts the plea agreement; if the court\ndoes not accept the agreed upon plea and sentence, the agreement is void. Villafafia told OPR that Rule ll(c) pleas\nwere “uncommon” in the Southern District of Florida, as the “judges do not like to be told . . . what sentence to\nimpose.” Menchel similarly told OPR that the USAO viewed federal judges in the Southern District of Florida as\naverse to Rule ll(c) pleas, although Menchel had negotiated such pleas. Villafafia told OPR that she had never offered\na Rule ll(c) plea in any of her cases and had no experience with such pleas.\n39\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o77\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023079.tif": "In light of these concerns, Villafafia emailed Menchel, expressing her strong disagreement\nwith the process:\n\n[I]t is inappropriate for you to enter into plea negotiations without\nconsulting with me or the investigative agencies, and it is more\ninappropriate to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE [Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement], the victims, and me. These plea negotiations violate\nthe Ashcroft memo, the U.S. Atorney[s’] Manual, and all of the\nvarious iterations of the victims’ rights legislation. Strategically,\nyou have started the plea negotiations as though we are in a position\nof weakness, anxious to make the case go away, by telling the\ndefense that we will demand no federal conviction. We left the\nmeeting on June 26th in a stronger position than when we entered,\nand your statement that a state resolution would satisfy us takes\naway that advantage. If you make it seem like the U.S. Atorney\ndoesn’t have faith in our investigation, Epstein has no incentive to\nmake a deal.\n\nSecond, your discussion makes it appear that my investigation is for\n“shou” only and completely undermines my ability to deal with\nEpstein’s atorneys directly. ...\n\nI would like to make a presentation to the U.S. Atomey, Jeff\n[Sloman], Andy [Lourie], and you with our side of the investigation\nand a revised indictment. The presentation will address the points\nraised by Epstein’s counsel and will convince you all of the strength\nof the case.\n\nIn the meantime, please direct all communications from Epstein’s\ncounsel to me.\n\nMenchel told OPR he realized Villafafia was “very anxious” to file charges in the case.\nVillafafia had put a “tremendous” amount of effort into the investigation, and Menchel “was not\nunsympathetic at all to her desires” to pursue a federal case. Houever, as Menchel told OPR,\nVillafafia’s supervisors, including Acosta, were “trying to be a litle bit more dispassionate,” and\nher urgency was “not respectful” of Acosta’s position. Menchel viewed the tone of Villafafia’s\nemail as “highly unacceptable,” and her understanding of <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> law and policy incorrect. In\nparticular, Menchel pointed out that although the Ashcroft Memo requires prosecutors to charge\nthe “most readily provable offense,” there is nevertheless room for “flexibility,” and that the U.S.\nAtorney has discretion—directly or through a designated supervisor such as Menchel—to waive\nthe policy.\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o79\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023084.tif": "Early in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.” Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> Department policies before seeking the computer\nR In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case.

July 2oo7: The Defense Continues Its Efforts to Stop the Federal Investigation\n\nIn addition to their efforts to stop the government from obtaining the computer equipment,\ndefense counsel also sent leters to the USAO, dated July 6, 2oo7, and July 25, 2oo7, reiterating\ntheir objections to a federal investigation of Epstein. The July 25, 2oo7 leter included a lengthy\n“case analysis chart” purporting to support the defense argument that Epstein had commited no\nfederal offense. The July 25 leter also noted that the defense had been consulting with the former\nPrincipal Deputy Chief of CEOS, reporting that she “supports our position without reservation that\nthis is not a mater upon which the federal statu[t]es should be brought to bear.”\n\nWhile the defense was reiterating its objections to the federal investigation, CEOS\nexpressed its endorsement of Villafafia’s legal analysis and proposed charges. On July l8, 2oo7,\nCEOS Chief Oosterban emailed Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, stating that he had read\nVillafafia’s prosecution memorandum “closely,” and noting that “[s]he did a terrific job. As we\nopined to Andy [Lourie] back in May, [CEOS] agree[s] with her legal analysis. Her charging\ndecisions are legally sound.” Oosterban observed:\n\nI have also reviewed the arguments contained in the leters from\n\ndefense counsel. Their legal analysis is detailed and comprehensive,\n\nbut I find none of their arguments persuasive. That is not to say that\n\nall the arguments are completely devoid of merit. I expect the judge\n\nto consider some of the arguments closely. Nevertheless, while the\n\nlaw <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> here is not always crystal clear, the balance of\n\navailable precedent favors us. From the prosecution memorandum\n\nit is clear that Marie has anticipated the strongest legal arguments,\n\nscrutinized the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> law, and has charged the case accordingly.\n\nAnd, while with this prosecution the government clearly faces a\n\nstrong and determined defense team, it is a challenge well worth\n\nfacing. I also happen to knou that there is absolutely no concern. . .\n\nabout facing the challenges this case presents.\nIn closing, Oosterban renewed his offer to have CEOS “help you with this prosecution,” and to\nsend “whatever and whoever you need” to assist.\n™ Villafafia forwarded Black’s leter to Menchel, explaining the circumstances relating to the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from Epstein’s home, the steps she had taken to make the required consultations in the\nDepartment, and that she and Lourie had worked together on her response to Black.\nl% The news that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief was advising the Epstein team led to an email\nexchange between Sloman and CEOS Chief Oosterban, who commented, “By the way, let me knou if you want me\nto put something in writing to you with our position and detailing all of the child prostitution cases she supervised\nwith similar facts.”\n\n47\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o85\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023088.tif": "Sloman also told OPR that he did not knou hou the decision to offer a two-year plea offer\nwas reached, but he believed that Acosta made the decision based on recommendations from\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. He opined to OPR that the decision was likely based on an\nassessment by Menchel and Lourie of the litigation risks presented by the case.*! Sloman added\nthat he did not knou hou a two-year sentence might have related to specific charges or to either\nstate or federal sentencing guidelines. Lourie likewise told OPR he did not recall hou the two-year\nterm was decided upon, or by whom, but he speculated that it may have been presented by the\ndefense as the most Epstein would accept, and that the decision would have been reached by\nAcosta follouing “extended consideration, research, and discussion,” among Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. **\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall discussing a two-year plea deal with Acosta or\nwho reached the decision that two years was an appropriate sentence. Menchel also told OPR,\nhouever, that he recalled believing that if the USAO had filed the contemplated federal charges,\nEpstein would have felt he had “‘nothing to lose” and “undoubtedly” would have chosen to take\nthe case to trial. Menchel recalled believing there was a real risk that the USAO might lose at trial,\nand in so doing, might cause more trauma to the victims, particularly those who were reluctant to\ntestify. Menchel told OPR that he did not believe that anyone at the time looked at two years “as\na fair result in terms of the conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not\nif we took this case to trial, would we risk losing everything,” and “if we . . . felt we could have\ngoten more time, we would have, without having to press it to the trial.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “I had decided and endorsed” the two-year resolution “at some\npoint,” and that it resulted from “back and forth” discussion “over the course of some days or a\nweek or two.” As noted earlier in this Report, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in this case merely\nas a “backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he explained to OPR was “a polite way of saying[,\n‘Jencouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]”*? Acosta said that he understood two years’\nimprisonment to have represented the sentence Epstein faced under one of the original charges the\nPBPD was considering at the outset of the state investigation.*4 Acosta also told OPR that he\n\nthe atorney for the government has a continuing obligation to assist the court in\n\nits determination of the sentence to be imposed. The prosecutor must be familiar\n\nwith the guidelines generally and with the specific guideline provisions <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span>\n\nto his or her case. In discharging these duties, the atorney for the government\n\nshould . . . endeavor to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information\n\nupon which the sentencing decisions will be based.\n8l In Sloman’s view, Menchel and Lourie were “two of the finest trial lawyers” in the USAO.\n8 Lourie noted that Sloman and Menchel were “two extraordinarily experienced people in [Acosta’s] front\noffice who had tried .. . gobs and gobs of cases.”\n83 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney asserted that OPR’s use of Acosta’s quote, “a litle\nbit more,” “unfairly minimized” Acosta’s and the USAO’s efforts to achieve justice in this case. Acosta’s atorney\nalso asserted that the phrase was “clearly soft-spoken understatement,” that the terms obtained were “substantially\nmore onerous than the state’s alternative resolution,” and that Acosta was “clearly declining the invitation to take the\nState to task and soft-pedaling an obvious distinction.”\n\n8 OPR examined this assertion and was unable to verify that the proposed two-year term of imprisonment\ncorresponded with the charges that the PBPD considered at the outset of the state investigation or with the charge in\n5o\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o88\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023099.tif": "She believed that access to the computer evidence would strengthen the government’s negotiating\nposition, but that her supervisors “did not seem to recognize that.” Villafafia said she did not\nunderstand why her supervisors were uninterested in determining what the computers contained.\nInstead, they instructed Villafafia to “keep calling the judge” to ask for a delay in the litigation\nproceedings.\n\nSloman told OPR that he recalled an issue about the computers, but did not recall “what\nthe thinking was at the time” about pursuing that evidence or why Villafafia was “ordered to stand\ndoun.” Acosta, Menchel, and Lourie all told OPR that they did not recall Villafafia’s effort to\nobtain the computer evidence or that there had been litigation relating to it. Lourie, houever, told\nOPR that the computers might have contained “very pouerful evidence” that possibly “could have\nchanged our advice to [Acosta], or his decision making.” In his OPR interview, Menchel was\nuncertain whether the computer evidence would have been useful, but also acknouledged to OPR,\n“You always want more as a prosecutor.”\n\nOn August 3l, 2oo7, in preparation for the upcoming September 7, 2oo7 meeting with\ndefense counsel that he planned to atend, CEOS Chief Oosterban traveled to West Palm Beach\nto meet with Villafafia and the case agents and to examine the case file. He explained to OPR that\nhe wanted to see the file before meeting with the defense so that he could best “represent[] the\ninterests of the prosecution team,” and that he was in favor of going forward with the case.\nAccording to Villafafia, during his review of the file, Oosterban told her that the case was “really\ngood” and offered to assist Villafafia at trial.\n\nOn September 6, 2oo7, the day before the meeting with defense counsel, Sloman sent\nVillafafia an email asking, “Please refresh my recollection. What is the ‘deal’ on the table?”\nSloman told OPR that his question reflected the fact that in his capacity as FAUSA, he was\ninvolved in “a hundred other things” at that time.”® Villafafia sent Sloman the term sheet and\nexplained to him, “You and Mat [Menchel] and I had also discussed a possible federal plea to an\nInformation charging a 37l conspiracy, with a Rule ll plea with a two-year cap, but I think Mat\nmust have asked Alex about it and it was nixed.” Villafafia continued:\n\nThere are three concerns that I hope we can address tomorrou. First,\n\nthat there is an absolute drop-dead date for accepting or rejecting\n\nbecause it is strategically important that we indict before the end of\n\nSeptember, which means . . . September 25th. Second, the agents\n\nand I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which\n\nas Drew [Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the\n\nlaw. And third, I do not want to make any promises about allouing\n\nEpstein to self-surrender because I still believe that we have a good\n\nchance of geting him detained.”\n%8 Sloman noted that with the atention given to the Epstein investigation, “it seems like . . . this was the only\ncase [in the office], but there were other cases.”\n9 As Villafafia explained in her OPR interview, when a violent crime defendant self-surrenders, the government\nmay have difficulty winning an argument for pretrial detention or bond. Contrary to Villafafia’s assertion in the email,\nthe CVRA, even when <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span>, required only victim consultation, not victim approval, and as is explained in\n\n6l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o99\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023157.tif": "CHAPTER TWO\nPART TWO: <span class=\"highlight\">APPLICABLE</span> STANDARDS\nl. OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR finds professional misconduct when an atorney intentionally violates or acts in\nreckless disregard of a knoun, unambiguous obligation imposed by law, rule of professional\nconduct, or Department regulation or policy. In determining whether an atorney has engaged in\nprofessional misconduct, OPR uses the preponderance of the evidence standard to make factual\nfindings.\n\nAn atorney intentionally violates an obligation or standard when the atorney (l) engages\nin conduct with the purpose of obtaining a result that the obligation or standard unambiguously\nprohibits; or (2) engages in conduct knouing its natural or probable consequence, and that\nconsequence is a result that the obligation or standard unambiguously prohibits. An atorney acts\nin reckless disregard of an obligation or standard when (l) the atorney knous or should knou,\nbased on his or her experience and the unambiguous nature of the obligation or standard, of an\nobligation or standard; (2) the atorney knous or should knou, based on his or her experience and\nthe unambiguous applicability of the obligation or standard, that the atorney’s conduct involves a\nsubstantial likelihood that he or she will violate, or cause a violation of, the obligation or standard;\nand (3) the atorney nonetheless engages in the conduct, which is objectively unreasonable under\nall the circumstances. Thus, an atorney’s disregard of an obligation is reckless when it represents\na gross deviation from the standard of conduct that an objectively reasonable atorney would\nobserve in the same situation.\n\nIf OPR determines that an atorney did not engage in professional misconduct, OPR\ndetermines whether the atorney exercised poor judgment, engaged in other inappropriate conduct,\nmade a mistake, or acted appropriately under all the circumstances. An atorney exercises poor\njudgment when, faced with alternative courses of action, he or she chooses a course of action that\nis in marked contrast to the action that the Department may reasonably expect an atorney\nexercising good judgment to take. Poor judgment differs from professional misconduct in that an\natorney may act inappropriately and thus exhibit poor judgment even though he or she may not\nhave violated or acted in reckless disregard of a clear obligation or standard. In addition, an\natorney may exhibit poor judgment even though an obligation or standard at issue is not\nsufficiently clear and unambiguous to support a professional misconduct finding. A mistake, on\nthe other hand, results from an excusable human error despite an atorney’s exercise of reasonable\ncare under the circumstances.\n\nAn atorney who makes a good faith atempt to ascertain the obligations and standards\nimposed on the atorney and to comply with them in a given situation does not commit professional\nmisconduct. Evidence that an atorney made a good faith atempt to ascertain and comply with\nthe obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not limited to, the fact that the atorney\nreviewed materials that define or discuss one or more potentially <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> obligations and\nstandards, consulted with a supervisor or ethics advisor, notified the tribunal or the atorney\nrepresenting a party or person with adverse interests of an intended course of conduct, or took\n\nll9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l57\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023158.tif": "affirmative steps the atorney reasonably believed were required to comply with an obligation or\nstandard.\nI. <span class=\"highlight\">APPLICABLE</span> STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nA. The United States Atorneys’ Manual\n\nAmong its many provisions, the United States Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) includes\ngeneral statements of principles that summarize appropriate considerations to be weighed, and\ndesirable practices to be folloued, by federal prosecutors when discharging their prosecutorial\nresponsibilities.!8° The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. /d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\nenforcement responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that reference to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\nprosecutions.\n\nl. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a\nFederal Prosecution\n\nFederal prosecutors do not open a case on every mater referred to them. USAM § 9-2.o2o\nexplicitly authorizes a U.S. Atorney “to decline prosecution in any case referred directly to\nl89 In 2ol8, the USAM was revised and reissued as the Justice Manual.

Whatever the reason,\n\nwhen it appears that the Federal interest in prosecution is less\n\nsubstantial than the interest of state or local authorities,\n\nconsideration should be given to referring the case to those\n\nauthorities rather than commencing or recommending a Federal\n\nprosecution.\nAnother comment cautions that in assessing whether to defer to state or local authorities, “the\nFederal prosecutor should be alert to any local conditions, atitudes, relationships or other\ncircumstances that might cast doubt on the likelihood of the state or local authorities conducting a\nthorough and successful prosecution.”\n\nUSAM § 9-27.26o identifies impermissible considerations relating to the decision whether\nto initiate or decline a federal prosecution. Specifically, the decision may not be based on\nconsideration of the person’s race, religion, sex, national origin, or political association, activities,\nor beliefs; the prosecutor’s “oun personal feelings” about the person or the victim; or the possible\neffect of the decision on the prosecutor’s oun professional or personal circumstances. When\nopting to decline federal prosecution, the prosecutor should ensure that the reasons for that decision\nare communicated to the investigating agency and reflected in the office files. USAM § 9-27.27o.\n\n2. USAM § 9-2.o3l: The Petite Policy\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not prohibit prosecutions of a defendant by both state and\nfederal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the\nDepartment has a long-standing policy, knoun as the Petite policy, governing federal prosecutions\ncharged after the initiation of a prosecution in another jurisdiction based on the same or similar\nconduct.!°? The general principles <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> to the prosecution or declination decision are set\nforth in USAM § 9-2.o3l, “Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy (‘Petite Policy’),” which\ncontains guidelines for a federal prosecutor’s exercise of discretion in determining whether to bring\na federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or\nfederal proceeding. The policy applies “whenever there has been a prior state or federal\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”\n\nIn circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new\nfederal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist. The prerequisites are as follous:\n\n(l) The mater must involve a substantial federal interest. The determination whether\n\na substantial federal interest is involved is made on a case-by-case basis. Maters\nl92 See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S. 22, 27-29 (l977); Petite v.

Generally, the U.S. Atorney\nhas authority to approve a non-prosecution agreement. USAM § 9-27.6oo comment. Houever,\nUSAM § 9-27.64o directs that a government atorney should not enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation without first obtaining the approval of the\nappropriate Assistant Atorney General, or his or her designee, when the person is someone who\n“is likely to become of major public interest.”\nThese USAM provisions do not address the uses of non-prosecution agreements in\ncircumstances other than when needed to obtain cooperation.\n5. USAM Provisions Relating to Grants of Immunity\nNothing in the USAM directly prohibits the government from using the criminal exposure\nof third parties in negotiating with a criminal defendant. Instead, the provision that addresses\nimmunity relates only to the exchange of limited immunity for the testimony of a witness who has\nasserted a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. See USAM 8§ 9-23.loo et seq.\n6. USAM/C.F.R. Provisions Relating to Financial Conflicts of Interest\nDepartment employees are expected to be aware of, and to comply with, all ethics-related\nlaws, rules, regulations, and policies. See, generally, USAM § l-4.ooo et seg. Specifically, a\ngovernment atorney is prohibited by criminal statute from participating personally and\nsubstantially in any particular mater in which he has a financial interest or in which such an\ninterest can be imputed to him. See l8 U.S.C. § 2o8 and 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.4ol-4o2. In addition,\na Department employee should seek advice from an ethics official before participating in any\nmater in which his impartiality could be questioned. If a conflict of interest exists, in order for\nthe employee to participate in the mater, the head of the employee’s component, with the\nconcurrence of an ethics official, must make a determination that the interest of the government in\nthe employee’s participation outweighs the concern that a reasonable person may question the\nintegrity of the Department’s programs and operations. The determination must be made in\nwriting. See 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.5ol-5o2.\nB. Other Department Policies\nl. Department Policies Relating to the Disposition of Charges\nThe Atorney General has the responsibility for establishing prosecutorial priorities for the\nDepartment. Over the span of several decades, each successive Atorney General has articulated\nthose priorities in policy memoranda issued to all federal prosecutors. As <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> here, on\nSeptember 22, 2oo3, Atorney General John Ashcroft issued a memorandum regarding\n“Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and\nSentencing” (Ashcroft Memo). The Ashcroft Memo, which explicitly superseded all previous\nDepartmental guidance on the subject, set forth policies “designed to ensure that all federal\nl25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l63\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023164.tif": "prosecutors adhere to the principles and objectives” of the Sentencing Reform Act of l984, the\nSentencing Guidelines, and the PROTECT Act “in their charging, case disposition, and sentencing\npractices.”!9>\n\nThe Ashcroft Memo directed that, “in all federal cases, federal prosecutors must charge\nand pursue the most serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts of\nthe case,” except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or designated\nsupervisory authority in certain articulated limited circumstances. The Ashcroft Memo cautioned\nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either\nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial. The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all exception that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “designated\nsupervisory atorney.” As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“particularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy. In\naddition, the policy applies to “readily provable” charges, thus inherently allouing a prosecutor\nl95 The Ashcroft Memo was issued before the Supreme Court decided United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 22o\n(2oo5), which struck doun the provision of the federal sentencing statute that required federal district judges to impose\na sentence within the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> Federal Sentencing Guidelines range. Those Guidelines were the product of\nthe United States Sentencing Commission, which was created by the Sentencing Reform Act of l984. The\nProsecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today (PROTECT) Act of 2oo3, Pub.\nL. lo8-2l, ll7 Stat. 65o, was directed at preventing child abuse. It included a variety of provisions designed to\nimprove the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against children. Among other things, the PROTECT Act\nprovided for specific sentencing considerations for certain sex-related offenses, such as those involving multiple\noccasions of prohibited sexual conduct or those involving material with depictions of violence or with specified\nnumbers of images.\n\nl26\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l64\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023167.tif": "when prosecutors have used third parties as leverage in plea negotiations. Numerous courts have\nmade clear, houever, that a plea is not invalid when entered under an agreement that includes a\npromise of leniency touards a third party or in response to a prosecutor’s threat to prosecute a third\nparty if a plea is not entered. See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 9o9 F.2d 738, 74l-42 (2d Cir.\nl99o) (rejecting claim that plea was involuntary because of pressure placed upon a defendant by\nthe government’s insistence that a defendant’s wife would not be offered a plea bargain unless he\npled guilty); Martin v.

[and] must have probable cause to charge\nthe third party.’’).\n\nThe second context concerns situations in which courts have enforced prosecutors’\npromises of leniency to third parties. For example, in State v. Frazier, 697 So. 2d 944 (Fla. App.\nl997), as consideration for the defendant’s guilty plea, the prosecutor agreed and announced in\nopen court that the government would dismiss charges against the defendant’s niece and nephew,\nwho had all been charged as a result of the same incident. When the state reneged and atempted\nto prosecute the niece and nephew, the trial court dismissed the charges against them, and the state\nappealed. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that under contract law\nprinciples, the niece and nephew were third-party beneficiaries of the plea agreement and were\ntherefore entitled to enforce it.\n\nApart from voluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a\nprosecutor’s promise not to prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of\nprosecutorial discretion.\n\nD.

A comment to the rule clarifies that the factors\nrelevant to determining a lawyer’s competence to handle a particular mater include “the relative\ncomplexity and specialized nature of the mater, the lawyer’s general experience, the lawyer’s\ntraining and experience in the field in question, the preparation and study the lawyer is able to give\nthe mater, and whether it is feasible to refer the mater to, or associate or consult with, a lawyer\nof established competence in the field.” The comment further notes that “[i]n many instances the\nrequired proficiency is that of a general practitioner.” With respect to particular maters,\ncompetence requires inquiry into and analysis of the factual and legal elements of the problem.\nThe comment to Rule 4-l.l explains that “[t]he required atention and preparation are determined\nin part by what is at stake; major litigation and complex transactions ordinarily require more\nextensive treatment than maters of lesser complexity and consequence.”\n2.

As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were motivated or\ninfluenced by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\nconviction may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” /d. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment).?°° The\n“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain circumstances, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate Assistant Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for cooperation.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\ncircumstances other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully\nmemorialized in writing.

The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.”\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM §8§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).\n2o6 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules. An atorney may\natain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the\nrequirements of the standard.\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l75\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023204.tif": "entitled to significant weight, and OPR credits them.

The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta, Lourie, or Villafatia Agreed to\nthe NPA’s Provision Promising Not to Prosecute “Potential Co-conspirators”\nin Order to Protect Any of Epstein’s Political, Celebrity, or Other Influential\nAssociates\n\nOPR examined the decision by the subjects who negotiated the NPA—Villafafia, Lourie,\nand Acosta—to include in the agreement a provision in which the USAO agreed not to prosecute\n“any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” in addition to four named individuals, to determine\nwhether that provision resulted from the subjects’ improper favoritism touards Epstein or an\nimproper effort to shield from prosecution any of Epstein’s knoun associates. Other than various\ndrafts of the NPA and of a federal plea agreement, OPR found litle in the contemporaneous\nrecords mentioning the provision and nothing indicating that the subjects discussed or debated it—\nor even gave it much consideration. Drafts of the NPA and of the federal plea agreement shou\nthat the final broad language promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”\nevolved from a more narrou provision sought by the defense. The provision expanded as Villafafia\nand defense counsel exchanged drafts of, first, a proposed federal plea agreement and, then, of the\nNPA, with apparently litle analysis and no substantive discussion within the USAO about the\nprovision.7°”\n\nAs the NPA drafting process concluded, Villafafia circulated to Lourie and another\nsupervisor a draft that contained the non-prosecution provision, telling Lourie it was “some of\n[defense counsel’s] requested language regarding promises not to prosecute other people,” and\ncommenting only, “I don’t think it hurts us.” In a reply email, Lourie responded to another issue\n237 As set forth in OPR’s factual discussion, early in the negotiations over a federal plea agreement, the defense\nsought a non-prosecution provision <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> to only four female named assistants of Epstein and to unnamed\nemployees of one of his companies. Villafafia initially countered with “standard language” referring to unnamed\n“co-conspirators” so as to avoid “highlight[ing] for the judge all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that\nwe could charge.” Nonetheless, drafts of the NPA sent by Lefkouitz after Villafafia’s email continued to include\nlanguage referring to the four named assistants and unnamed employees. Villafafia, houever, internally circulated\ndrafts of a federal plea agreement that included language stating, “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability\nof the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal conduct by\nthose persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement.” The federal plea agreement draft revised\nby Lourie and Acosta on September 2o, 2oo7, included that language. When the defense team reverted to negotiation\nof state charges, Villafafia advised them, “In the context of a non-prosecution agreement, the [USAO] may be more\nwilling to be specific about not pursuing charges against others.” The next day, Lefkouitz sent a revised draft NPA\nreferring to the four named assistants, “any employee” of the named company, and “any unnamed co-conspirators for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” The language was finally revised by Villafafia\nto prohibit prosecution of “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to [the four named\nassistants].”\n\nIn commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel and Lourie both noted that the non-prosecution\nprovision could bind only the USAO, and Lourie further opined that it was limited to certain specified federal charges\nand a time-limited scope of conduct. Although the non-prosecution provision in the NPA did not explicitly contain\nsuch limitations, those limitations were included in other parts of the agreement.\n\nl66\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023210.tif": "[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind. . . the\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the []state .. .\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\n\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein\nwould have become final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. In\nAcosta’s view, “the federal responsibility” in this unique situation was merely to serve as a “back-\nstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no miscarriage of justice.”*4’ Acosta told OPR\nthat he understood the PBPD would not have brought Epstein to the FBI’s atention if the State\nAtorney had pursued charges that required Epstein’s incarceration. Acosta therefore decided that\nthe USAO could avert a “manifest injustice” by forcing the state to do more and require Epstein\nto serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender.\n\nAcosta’s reasoning was flawed and unduly constricted. Acosta’s repeated references to a\n“miscarriage of justice” or “manifest injustice” echoes the “manifestly inadequate” language used\nin the Petite policy to define the circumstances in which the federal government may proceed with\na criminal case after a completed state prosecution. Nothing in the Petite policy, houever, requires\nsimilar restraint when the federal government pursues a case in the absence of a completed state\nprosecution, even if the state is already investigating the same offense. The goal of the Petite\npolicy is to prevent multiple prosecutions for the same offense, not to compel the federal\ngovernment to defer to a parallel state interest in a case, particularly one in which state officials\ninvolved in the state prosecution expressed significant concerns about it, and there were questions\nregarding the state prosecutor’s commitment to the case. Acosta told OPR that “there are any\nnumber of instances where the federal government or the state government can proceed, and state\ncharges are substantially less and different, and .. . the federal government . . . stands aside and\nlets the state proceed.” The fact that the federal government can allou the state to proceed with a\nprosecution, houever, does not mean the federal government is compelled to do so, particularly in\na mater in which a distinct and important federal interest exists. Indeed, the State Atorney told\nOPR that the federal government regularly takes over cases initiated by state investigators,\ntypically because federal charges result in “the best sentence.”\n\nEpstein was facing a substantial sentence under the federal sentencing guidelines.***\nDespite the Ashcroft Memo’s directive that federal prosecutors pursue “the most serious readily\nprovable offense,” Acosta’s decision to push “the state to do a litle bit more” does not approach\nthat standard. In fact, Acosta conceded during his OPR interview that the NPA did not represent\nan “appropriate punishment” in the federal system, nor even “the best outcome in the state system,”\nand that if the investigation of Epstein had originated with the FBI, rather than as a referral from\nthe PBPD, the outcome might have been different. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to\n247 Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n\n248 Villafafia estimated that the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> sentencing guidelines range was l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment.\nl72\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023218.tif": "“T’m reconstructing memories of ... l2 years ago. I can speculate that at some point, the mater\ncame up, and I or someone else said . .. what would the original charges have likely brought? And\nsomeone said this amount.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall who initially proposed this\nmethod, but he believed that it likely did not result from a single specific discussion but rather\nfrom conversations over a course of time. Acosta could not recall specifically with whom he had\nthese discussions, other than that it would have been Lourie, Menchel, or Sloman. Villafafia was\nnot asked for her views on a two-year sentence, and she had no input into the decision before it\nwas made. Villafafia told OPR that she examined the state statutes and could not validate that a\nstate charge would have resulted in a 24-month sentence. OPR also examined <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> state\nstatutes and the Florida sentencing guidelines, but could not confirm that Epstein was, in fact,\nfacing a potential two-year sentence under charges contemplated by the PBPD.\n\nOn the other hand, during his OPR interview, Lourie “guess[ed]” that “somehou the\ndefense conveyed . . . we’re going to trial if it’s more than two years.” Menchel similarly told\nOPR that he did not knou hou the two year sentence was derived, but “obviously it was a number\nthat the office felt was palatable enough that [Epstein] would take” it. Sloman told OPR that he\nhad no idea hou the two-year sentence proposal was reached.\n\nThe contemporaneous documentary record, houever, provides no indication that Epstein’s\nteam proposed a two-year sentence of incarceration or initially suggested, before the USAO made\nits offer, that Epstein would accept a two-year term of incarceration. As late as July 25, 2oo7—\nonly days before the USAO provided the term sheet to defense counsel—Epstein’s counsel\nsubmited a leter to the USAO arguing that the federal government should not prosecute Epstein\nat all. Furthermore, after the initial “term sheet” was presented and negotiations for the NPA\nprogressed, Epstein’s team continued to strongly press for less or no time in jail.\n\nThe USAO had other charging and sentencing options available to it. The most obvious\nalternative to the two-year sentence proposal was to offer Epstein a plea to a federal offense that\ncarried a harsher sentence. If federally charged, Epstein was facing a substantial sentence under\nthe federal sentencing guidelines, l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment. Houever, it is unlikely that\nhe would have agreed to a plea that required a guidelines sentence, even one at the louer end of\nthe guidelines. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues had been concerned that Epstein\nwould opt to go to trial if charged and presented with the option of pleading to a guidelines\nsentence, and as previously discussed, there were both evidentiary and legal risks atendant upon\na trial in this case. If federally charged, Epstein’s sentencing exposure could have been managed\nby offering him a plea under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c) for a stipulated sentence,\nwhich requires judicial approval. Acosta rejected this idea, houever, apparently because of a\nperception that the federal district courts in the Southern District of Florida did not view Rule ll(c)\npleas favorably and might refuse to accept such a plea and thus limit the USAO’s options.\n\nAnother alternative was to offer Epstein a plea to conspiracy, a federal charge that carried\na maximum five-year sentence. Shortly after Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum\nto her supervisors, Lourie recommended to Acosta charging Epstein by criminal complaint and\noffering a plea to conspiracy “to make a plea atractive.” Similarly, before learning that Menchel\nhad already discussed a state-based resolution with Epstein’s counsel, Villafafia had considered\noffering Epstein a plea to one count of conspiracy and a substantive charge, to be served\nconcurrently with any sentence he might receive separately as a result of the state’s outstanding\n\nl8o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023243.tif": "Chief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.””?! Sloman forwarded this\nemail to Acosta. Villafafia recalled that Sloman responded to her email by telephone, possibly\nafter he had spoken to Acosta, and stated, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.” Villafafia did not recall\nSloman explaining at the time the reason for that instruction.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve\nbeen advised that . . . pre-charge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Sloman did not\nrecall any discussions, before the NPA was signed, about contacting the victims or conferring with\nthem regarding the potential resolution of the case. Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that\nwe had to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA,” and “we did not have to seek\napproval from victims to resolve a case. We did have an obligation to notify them of the resolution\nin... filed cases.” Sloman said that no one other than Villafafia raised the notification issue, and\nbecause the USAO envisioned a state court resolution of the mater, Sloman “did not think that we\nhad to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA.” Lourie told OPR that he had no\nmemory of Villafafia being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.””” Similarly, the\natorney who assumed Lourie’s supervisory duties after Lourie transitioned to his detail in the\nDepartment told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim notification and he\n“assumed that was being handled.”???\n\nAcosta did not recall the September 6, 2oo7 email, but told OPR that “there is no\nrequirement to notify [the victims], because it’s not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state\nprosecution.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall any “pre-NPA discussions” regarding\nvictim notification or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the\nvictims before entering into the NPA.”** Ultimately, Acosta acknouledged to OPR, “[C]learly,\ngiven the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had [consulted with the victims].”\n\nCEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR that he disagreed with the USAO’s stance that the\nCVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was\nnot “an abuse of discretion” or “an ethical issue,” but rather reflected a “serious and legitimate\n29l Villafafia told OPR that she referred to Oosterban in the email because “he was the head of CEOS and\nbecause I think they were tired of hearing me nag them [to notify the victims].” As previously noted, Villafafia’s\nstatement that victim approval had to be obtained was incorrect. Even when <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span>, the CVRA only requires\nconsultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement. Moreover, Villafafia’s comments concerning the\npre-charge application of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement\nto OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent leters to victims in August 2oo6.\n\n292 Lourie noted that during this period, he had left Florida and was no longer the supervising AUSA in the\noffice, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “historical knouledge” of the case.\n293 The AUSA who for a time served as Villafafia’s co-counsel on the Epstein investigation similarly did not\n“knou anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the\ncase. The AUSA stated that he stopped working on the case “months earlier” and that he “didn’t have anything to do\nwith the [NPA] negotiations.”\n2o4 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto ... instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n2o5\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23243\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023285.tif": "CHAPTER THREE\nPART TWO: <span class=\"highlight\">APPLICABLE</span> STANDARDS\nl.

Consultation With a Government Atorney\n\n(l) In General. A victim has the reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the\nGovernment in the case. The victim’s right to confer, houever, shall not be\nconstrued to impair prosecutorial discretion. Federal prosecutors should be\navailable to consult with victims about major case decisions, such as dismissals,\nrelease of the accused pending judicial proceedings (when such release is for\nnoninvestigative purposes), plea negotiations, and pretrial diversion. Because\nvictims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government, and may disclose\nwhatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only\nnonsensitive data and public information. Consultations should comply with the\nprosecutor’s obligations under <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> rules of professional conduct.\nRepresentatives of the Department should take care to inform victims that neither\nthe Department’s advocacy for victims nor any other effort that the Department\nmay make on their behalf constitutes or creates an atorney-client relationship\nbetween such victims and the lawyers for the Government.\nDepartment personnel should not provide legal advice to victims.\n(2) Prosecutor Availability. Prosecutors should be reasonably available to consult\nwith victims regarding significant adversities they may suffer as a result of delays\nin the prosecution of the case and should, at the appropriate time, inform the court\nof the reasonable concerns that have been conveyed to the prosecutor.\n(3) Proposed Plea Agreements. Responsible officials should make reasonable\nefforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views about,\nprospective plea negotiations. In determining what is reasonable, the responsible\nofficial should consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving\nnotice and considering views in the context of the particular case, including, but not\nlimited to, the follouing factors:\n\n(a) The impact on public safety and risks to personal safety.\n\n(b) The number of victims.\n\n(c) Whether time is of the essence in negotiating or entering a proposed plea.\n\n252\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2329o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023297.tif": "did not find evidence shouing that the subjects intended to silence victims or to prevent them from\nhaving input into the USAO’s intent to resolve the federal investigation.\n\nAlthough the contemporaneous records provide some information about victim notification\ndecisions made after the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, the records contain litle about\nthe subjects’ views regarding consultation with victims before the NPA was signed. In a\nSeptember 6, 2oo7 email primarily addressing other topics, as the plea negotiations were beginning\nin earnest and almost three weeks before the NPA was signed, Villafafia raised the topic of victim\nconsultation with Sloman: “The agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their\napproval, which as [CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law. . . .\n[A]nd the [PBPD] Chief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.’4%\nSloman forwarded the email to Acosta with a note stating, “fyi.” Villafafia recalled that after she\nsent the email, Sloman told her by telephone, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.”*°° Villafafia also told\nOPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve been advised that . . . pre-\ncharge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Villafafia also recalled a discussion with\nAcosta, Menchel, and Sloman, during which she stated that she would need to get victims’ input\non the terms being proposed to the defense, and she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential.\nYou can’t disclose them.’4°°\n\nNone of the other subjects recalled a specific discussion before the NPA was signed about\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations. Menchel told OPR he believed the USAO was not required to\nconsult with victims during the preliminary “general discussion” phase of setlement negotiations;\nmoreover, he left the USAO before the terms of the NPA were fully developed.\n\nSloman told OPR that he “did not think that we had to consult with victims prior to entering\ninto the NPA” and “we did not have to seek approval from victims to resolve a case.” Sloman\nbelieved the USAO was obligated only to notify victims about resolution of “the cases that we\nhandled, filed cases.” Sloman recalled that because the USAO envisioned a state court resolution\nof the mater, he did not “think that that was a concern of ours at the time to consult with [the\nvictims] prior to entering into .. . the NPA.”\n\nLourie told OPR that he did not recall any discussions about informing the victims about\nthe terms of the NPA or any instructions to Villafafia that she not discuss the NPA with the victims.\nHe stated that everything the USAO did was “to try and get the best result as possible for the\nvictims. . . .

In addition, Villafafia’s reference to victim “approval” was inaccurate\nbecause the CVRA, even when <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span>, requires only “consultation” with victims about prosecutorial decisions.\n\n4o5 Villafafia did not recall Sloman explaining the reason for the decision.\n\n4o6 Villafafia also told OPR that she recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations\ncould cause victims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.” Villafafia was\nuncertain of the date of the conversation, but Menchel’s presence requires it to have occurred before August 3, 2oo7.\n\n259\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23297\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023304.tif": "strongly objected to the government’s plan to notify victims of the state proceedings, which he\ndescribed as “highly inappropriate” and an “intrusion into state affairs, when the identified\nindividuals are not even victims of the crime for which Mr. Epstein is being sentenced.”\n\nThereafter—at a time when the USAO believed Epstein’s plea to be imminent—Villafafia\ndrafted, and Sloman signed, the December 6, 2oo7 leter to Lefkouitz rejecting the defense\narguments regarding notification and reiterating the USAO’s position that the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation be invited to appear at the state plea hearing. The leter took an expansive\nview of the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> statutes by contending that both the CVRA and the VRRA required the\nUSAO to notify the victims of the state proceedings:\n\n[T]hese sections are not limited to proceedings in a federal district\ncourt. Our Non-Prosecution Agreement resolves the federal\ninvestigation by allouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense.\nThe victims identified through the federal investigation should be\nappropriately informed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does\nnot require the U.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal\nobligations. *!®\n\nThe leter also asserted that the VRRA obligated the USAO to provide the victims with\ninformation concerning restitution to which they may be entitled and “the earliest possible” notice\nof the status of the investigation, the filing of charges, and the acceptance of a plea. Along with\nthe leter, Sloman forwarded a revised draft victim notification leter to Lefkouitz for his\ncomments. This draft victim notification leter stated that the federal investigation had been\ncompleted, Epstein would plead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of\nimprisonment at sentencing, and Epstein would compensate victims for monetary damages claims\nbrought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The draft victim notification leter provided specific information\nconceming the upcoming change of plea hearing and invited the victims to atend or provide a\nwriten statement to the State Atorney’s Office. When Lefkouitz asked Sloman to delay sending\nvictim notifications until after a discussion of their contents, Sloman instructed Villafafia, who was\npreparing leters for transmital to 3o victims, to “Hold the leter.” During his OPR interview,\nSloman recalled that he had “wanted to push the leter out,” but he “must have had a conversation\nwith somebody” about whether the CVRA applied, and based on that conversation he directed\nVillafafia to hold the leter.\n\nIn his response leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz contended that the government had\nmisinterpreted both the CVRA and VRRA because neither applied to the “public proceeding in\nthis mater [which] will be in state court for the purpose of the entry of a plea on state charges.”\nAl6 Sloman told Lefkouitz the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is simply informing the\nvictims of their rights.” Sloman also addressed the defense atorneys’ objection to advising the victims that they could\ncontact Villafafia or the FBI case agent with questions or concerns by referencing the CVRA, noting, “Again, federal\nlaw requires that victims have the ‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.””\n\n266\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023306.tif": "particular charges and victims at issue. Once the hearing was scheduled, Sloman told Villafafia to\ncontact PBPD Chief Reiter about notifying the victims, and on June 28, 2oo8, she reported back\nto Sloman that Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”*!® Villafafia recalled that she\nsent Reiter a list of the girls identified as victims during the federal investigation, and Reiter said\nhe would “contact as many as he could.” The contemporaneous records do not shou hou many\nor which victims, if any, Reiter contacted, and no victims were present in the courtroom. No victim\nwho provided information to OPR, either in person or through her atorney, recalled receiving\nnotice of the plea hearing from federal or state officials. At the time Epstein pled guilty in state\ncourt, no one in the USAO knew exactly who, if anyone, Reiter or the State Atorney’s Office had\nnotified about the proceeding. Accordingly, Villafafia, who was present in the courtroom for the\nhearing, had no knouledge to whom Belohlavek referred when she told the court that the victims\nwere “in agreement with the terms of this plea.””*!”\n\nOPR considered whether Acosta’s decision to defer to the State Atorney’s Office the\ndecision to notify victims of the scheduled date for Epstein’s plea hearing constituted professional\nmisconduct. OPR could not conclude that the CVRA or VRRA provisions in question, requiring\nnotice of any public proceeding involving the crime against the victim or that the victim is entitled\nto atend, unambiguously required federal prosecutors to notify victims of state court proceedings.\nFurthermore, as discussed previously, OLC had issued guidance stating that the CVRA did not\napply to cases in which no federal charges had been filed.*”” Moreover, the section of the VRRA\nrequiring notice of court proceedings that the victim is “entitled to atend” referred specifically to\nproceedings under 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b)(4), which, at the time of the Epstein case, had become\npart of the CVRA (l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(2)).7!\n\nBecause Acosta had no clear or unambiguous duty to inform victims identified in the\nfederal investigation of the state plea hearing, OPR concludes that his decision to defer to the State\nAtorney the decision to notify victims of the state’s plea hearing and the responsibility for doing\nso did not constitute professional misconduct.*””\nal8 Sloman replied, “Good.” In her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make\noral notifications to the victims regarding the upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification\ncould only come from a state investigator, and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n\n4l9 Plea Hearing Transcript at 42.\n42o OLC 2oo5 CVRA Informal Guidance; see also United States v.

OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances.

The BOP’s\nfailures are troubling not only because the BOP did not adequately safeguard an individual in its custody,\nbut also because they led to questions about the circumstances surrounding Epstein’s death and effectively\ndeprived Epstein’s numerous victims of the opportunity to seek justice through the criminal justice process.\nThe fact that these failures have been recurring ones at the BOP does not excuse them and gives additional\nurgency to the need for DOJ and BOP leadership to address the chronic problems plaguing the BOP.\nUnless otherwise noted, the OIG applies the preponderance of the evidence standard in determining\nwhether DO] personnel have commited misconduct. The U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board applies this\nsame standard when reviewing a federal agency's decision to take adverse action against an employee\nbased on such misconduct. See 5 U.S.C. 8 77ol(c)(l)(B) and 5 C.F.R. 8 l2ol.56(b)(l)(i).\nIn Chapter 2 of this report, we provide background information, including identification and a description of\nsignificant entities and individuals; a summary of our methodology; and the <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> laws, federal\nregulations, and BOP policies. In Chapter 3, we outline a timeline of key events. In Chapter 4, we set forth\nour findings of fact relating to the BOP’s custody and care of Epstein before his death. In Chapter 5, we set\nforth our findings of fact related to the events of August 8-lo, 2ol9, including Epstein’s death. In Chapter 6,\nwe set forth our findings of fact related to the BOP’s failure to ensure that there was a functional security\ncamera system at MCC New York, which resulted in limited recorded video evidence relevant to Epstein’s\ndeath. Finally, Chapter 7 contains our conclusions and recommendations.\n\n4\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2337l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023372.jpg": "Chapter 2: Background\nI. Significant Entities and Individuals\nJeffrey Epstein was born in l953 and, prior to his arrest, worked at various jobs in the financial industry and\nultimately developed considerable wealth. On July 2, 2ol9, a federal grand jury of the U.S. District Court for\nthe Southern District of New York returned an indictment that charged Epstein with engaging in sex\ntrafficking and a sex trafficking conspiracy, in violation of l8 U.S.C. 88 37l, l59l(a), (b)(2), and 2. These\ncharges were based on allegations that between 2oo2 and 2oo5, Epstein paid girls as young as l4 years old\nhundreds of dollars in cash each for engaging in sex acts with him at his Florida and New York residences.\nThe indictment further alleged that Epstein also paid each of these minor victims hundreds of dollars in cash\nto recruit other girls to engage in sex acts with Epstein.\nOn July 6, 2ol9, Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey upon his return to the United States\nfrom France and was transported to the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) Metropolitan Correctional Center,\nlocated at l5o Park Rou in New York, New York (MCC New York). Follouing a detention hearing on July l5,\n2ol9, the court ordered that Epstein be detained pending trial based on the court's finding that he was a\ndanger to the community and a flight risk.\nMCC New York is a federal administrative detention facility operated by the BOP that primarily provides\npretrial detention services for the U.S. District Courts for the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York.\nThe BOP temporarily closed MCC New York in October 2o2l due to substandard conditions that are\nunrelated to this investigation. When it was operational, MCC New York housed approximately 75o inmates\nat any given time. Prior to its closure, the majority of MCC New York’s inmate residents were individuals\nwith pending criminal charges (as opposed to individuals who had been convicted of offenses and were\nserving a sentence of imprisonment), but whom the court had determined under <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> law should\nremain in custody pending trial either because they represent a danger to the community, a substantial\nflight risk, or both. MCC New York has several different housing units. Epstein was initially assigned to MCC\nNew York’s general inmate population, but on July 7, 2ol9, he was moved to the Special Housing Unit (SHU)\npending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness of his notoriety\namong the other inmates. The SHU is a housing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely\nseparated from the general inmate population and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours per\nday, to ensure their oun safety as well as the safety of staff and other inmates.\nCorrectional Officer (CO) Tova Noel and Material Handler Michael Thomas began working together in MCC\nNew York SHU at l2 a.m. on August lo, 2ol9.4 During their shift, they each created and submited falsified\nofficial BOP forms documenting inmate counts (often referred to as “count slips”), and Noel completed and\nsigned more than 75 separate entries on an official BOP form documenting 3o-minute rounds (often\n* Noel worked her regular shift in the SHU from 4 p.m. to l2 a.m. on August 9, 2ol9, folloued by an overtime shift in the\nSHU from l2 a.m. to 8 a.m. on August lo, 2ol9. Thomas did not work his regular shift as a Material Handler ina\ndifferent location of MCC New York and instead worked an overtime shift in the SHU from l2 a.m. to 8 a.m. on\nAugust lo, 2ol9.\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23372\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023374.jpg": "requested to provide information.© The BOP employees and contractors we interviewed included\nemployees involved in various aspects of the emergency response, who worked at MCC New York in the\ndays leading up to the response and follouing the response, as well as other individuals with information\npertinent to our investigation. Additionally, the OIG participated in interviews of l5 inmates who had been\nhoused at MCC New York during time periods relevant to our investigation, including three who were\nhoused in the L Tier of the SHU on the day Epstein died.’ Those three L-Tier inmates were housed in cells\nopposite Epstein’s cell and therefore had a direct line of sight to Epstein’s cell on the night of August 9-lo.\nThe OIG also reached out to one of Epstein’s atorneys to discuss the possibility of providing information,\nbut ultimately the atorney declined to be interviewed, citing atorney-client privilege (the atorney-client\nprivilege survives a client's death) and issues related to ongoing litigation involving Epstein’s estate.\nThe OIG also collected over l27,ooo documents, as well as MCC New York video and photographs. Among\nthese were BOP documents, including staff rosters; daily logs and reports; investigative and incident reports;\ndocumentation regarding inmate counts and 3o-minute rounds; inmate housing assignment\ndocumentation; inmate transfer documents; Psychology Department reports and medical records relating\nto Epstein; Epstein’s institutional phone call records; MCC New York records of Epstein’s visits with his\natorneys; electronic communications, including text messages and emails of BOP employees and\ncontractors; MCC New York security camera surveillance video; records from contractors regarding the MCC\nNew York security camera system; service records for MCC New York's security camera system; MCC\nNew York photographs, including photographs taken of efforts to revive Epstein on the morning of\nAugust lo, 2ol9; BOP policies and program statements; MCC New York Post Orders; and financial records.\nThe OIG also conducted forensic analysis of the computers located in the SHU and BOP cellular telephones.\nIn addition, the OIG reviewed FBI investigative records, including interview reports (FD-3o2), notes from\nwitness interviews and other meetings, and electronic communications. The OIG also reviewed Epstein’s\nautopsy report and interviewed the Medical Examiner who performed the autopsy on Epstein.\nll. <span class=\"highlight\">Applicable</span> Law, Regulations, and BOP Policies\nA.

Three inmates agreed to be\ninterviewed.

Suicide Response\nRecognizing that failure to appropriately respond to an emergency can jeopardize the safety of staff and\ninmates and the security of the institution, the BOP’s Standards of Employee Conduct require that\n“employees respond immediately, effectively, and appropriately during all emergency situations.” The MCC\nNew York General Housing Unit Post Orders outline the required response to a suspected inmate suicide.\nThese orders require that MCC New York staff notify the Operations Lieutenant and Control Center of the\nsituation. The orders further provide that, once there is adequate staff present, immediate action must be\ntaken to open the inmate's airway and initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation, even if MCC New York staff\nbelieve that the inmate “has been dead for a period of time.” MCC New York staff are to continue\ncardiopulmonary resuscitation until they are relieved by medical staff or another rescuer. The BOP policy\ngoverning crime scenes and the collection of evidence provides that the need to immediately atend to an\napparent suicide victim, undertake lifesaving measures, and ensure inmate and staff safety take precedence\nover efforts to preserve a crime scene.\"?\n5. Inmate Discipline\nFederal regulations, 28 C.F.R. 88 54l.l-54l.8, and BOP policy (Program Statement 527o.o9, Inmate Discipline\nProgram) establish an inmate discipline program, which is designed to ensure the safety, security, and\norderly operation of correctional facilities, as well as the protection of the public. The inmate discipline\nprogram applies to all inmates in BOP custody, including inmates with pending criminal charges. One of the\nguiding principles of this program is that BOP staff are to take disciplinary action when and to such a degree\nas necessary to regulate the behavior of inmates to promote a safe and orderly institution. “Tatooing or\nself-mutilation” is among the prohibited acts sanctioned through the inmate discipline program. This\nprohibited act falls within the second most severe category of offenses on a 4-tier scale. The BOP defines\n“tatooing or self-mutilation” as “[t]o put indelible paterns on the skin; to injure, disfigure or make imperfect\nby removing or irreparably damaging parts of the body (wrist cuting falls within this offense).”\"* The\ndefinition does not make an explicit reference to suicide atempts other than inclusion of “wrist cuting.”\nAmong other things, BOP policy addressing the inmate discipline program identifies the prohibited acts,\ndescribes the process for adjudicating violations, and lists <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> penalties for each category of offense.\nAs relevant to this mater, the discipline process begins when a staff member observes an inmate commit a\nprohibited act and issues a report documenting the incident. A BOP supervisor then investigates the alleged\ninmate misconduct, which includes taking a statement from the inmate regarding the incident. If an inmate\nappears to be mentally ill at any stage of the disciplinary process, a mental health staff member will\nexamine the inmate and assess the inmate’s competency to participate in the disciplinary process. If the\ninmate is found to be competent and the prohibited act falls into the first or second most severe category,\nthe mater is referred to a discipline hearing officer, who will hold a hearing and make a determination as to\nwhether the inmate commited the prohibited act and, if so, impose any of the sanctions that correspond to\nthe severity of the prohibited act. At the hearing, the inmate is advised of his or her rights and permited to\nl3 BOP Program Statement 55lo.l4, Crime Scene Management and Evidence Control, is a restricted policy that is not\nreleased to the public in its entirety.\n4 BOP Elements of Prohibited Acts.\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23379\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023388.jpg": "Chapter 4: Custody and Care of Epstein Prior to His Death\nI. Epstein’s Arrest and Detention on July 6\nOn July 2, 2ol9, a grand jury of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York returned a two-\ncount indictment that charged Epstein with commiting sex trafficking and a sex trafficking conspiracy, in\nviolation of l8 U.S.C. 88 37l, l59l(a), (b)(2), and 2, based on allegations that he sexually exploited and\nabused dozens of minor girls, some as young as l4 years old, at his homes in New York and Florida. The\nindictment alleged that from at least 2oo2 through 2oo5, Epstein enticed and recruited girls, many of whom\nhe knew were underage, to visit his homes and perform sex acts in exchange for paying each girl hundreds\nof dollars in cash. The indictment further alleged that Epstein, working with employees and associates,\ncreated a vast network of underage victims to sexually exploit in New York and Florida by paying some\nvictims hundreds of dollars in cash each to recruit other minor girls to be similarly abused by Epstein. In\naddition to the two criminal charges, the indictment also contained forfeiture allegations, which sought to\nforfeit to the United States any property that was either used to commit or was a proceed of the charged\nsex trafficking offense, including Epstein’s New York residence.\nOn Saturday, July 6, 2ol9, Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey upon his return to the\nUnited States from France. He was transported to the Metropolitan Correctional Center located in\nNew York, New York (MCC New York), where he was initially placed in the general inmate population. MCC\nNew York is a federal administrative detention facility operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). The\nBOP temporarily closed MCC New York in October 2o2l due to substandard conditions that are unrelated to\nthis investigation. When it was operational, MCC New York housed primarily pretrial detainees who had not\nyet been convicted of any offense, but whom the court had determined under <span class=\"highlight\">applicable</span> law should remain\nin custody pending trial either because they represent a danger to the community, a substantial flight risk,\nor both. Due to the significant media atention surrounding his arrest and his notoriety among other MCC\nNew York inmates, the follouing day Epstein was moved to MCC New York's Special Housing Unit (SHU), a\nhousing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate\npopulation and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours per day, to ensure their oun safety as\nwell as the safety of staff and other inmates. On Monday, July 8, 2ol9, Epstein appeared in federal court\nand pleaded not guilty to the charges. The court ordered that Epstein remain in custody pending a\ndetention hearing scheduled for July l5, 2ol9.\nAt the detention hearing, Epstein sought to be placed in home detention at his New York residence with\nelectronic monitoring and other conditions. The prosecutors sought to have Epstein detained at MCC\nNew York pending trial. The court reviewed the parties’ filings and heard argument on the mater of pre-\ntrial release on July l5, 2ol9. On July l8, 2ol9, the court ordered that Epstein be detained pending trial. In\nits ruling, the court noted that because Epstein had been indicted for a violation of the federal sex trafficking\nstatute that involved minor victims, there was a presumption in favor of detention under federal law. The\ncourt found that the United States had shoun by clear and convincing evidence that Epstein threatened the\nsafety of another person and of the community based on testimony from two victims, the allegations of\nrepeated sexual abuse of minors, and the lewd photographs of young-looking women or girls that were\nfound during an authorized search of Epstein’s New York residence in July 2ol9. The court also relied on the\nrecommendation of U.S. Pretrial Services, the seriousness of the offenses with which Epstein had been\ncharged, evidence reflecting Epstein’s harassment and intimidation of and tampering with witnesses\ninvolved in a prior Florida state criminal investigation, and Epstein’s lack of compliance with his legal\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23388\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023744.tif": "I.
