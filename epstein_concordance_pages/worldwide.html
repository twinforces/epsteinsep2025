The prior NPA included a list of several dozen victims\nidentified in the prior investigation, all of whom were abused in the State of Florida, and none of\nwhom are a part of the conduct charged in Count Two of the instant Indictment.\n\nEach of these factors—the seriousness of the allegations, the strength of the evidence, and\nthe possibility of lengthy incarceration—creates an extraordinary incentive to flee. And as further\ndescribed belou, the defendant has the means and money to do so.\n\n2. The Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe history and characteristics of the defendant also strongly support detention. The\ndefendant is extraordinarily wealthy and has access to vast financial resources to fund any atempt\nto flee. Indeed, his potential avenues of flight from justice are practically limitless.\n\nAs the defendant acknouledged in his most recent New York State sex offender\nregistration, he has six residences, including two in the U.S. Virgin Islands (including his oun\nprivate island), and one each in Palm Beach, Florida; Paris, France; New York, New York; and\nStanley, New Mexico. The most recent estimated value of the defendant’s New York City mansion\nalone is more than $77 million. The most recent tax-assessed value of the defendant’s Palm Beach\nestate is more than $l2 million. The defendant’s primary residence is a private island in the U.S.\nVirgin Islands, a place where any sort of meaningful supervision would be all but impossible.\n\nMoreover, the defendant has access to innumerable means to flee. His sex registration\ndocumentation of “current vehicles” lists no fewer than l5 motor vehicles, including seven\nChevrolet Suburbans, a cargo van, a Range Rover, a Mercedez-Benz sedan, a Cadillac Escalade,\nand a Hummer I]. These cars are registered in various states and territories including the Virgin\nIslands, New York, Florida, and New Mexico. The defendant also has access to two private jets,\ngiving him the ability to leave the country secretly and on a moment’s notice and to go virtually\nanywhere he wants to travel. He is a very frequent international traveler and regularly travels to\nand from the United States by private plane. In particular, between January l, 2ol8, and the\npresent, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has logged approximately more than 2o flights in which\nEpstein was traveling to or from a foreign country. Indeed, he was arrested at Teterboro Airport\narriving on just such a private international flight after having spent approximately three weeks\nabroad. Extensive international travel of this nature further demonstrates a significant risk of\nflight. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp. 2d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2oo5). There can be\nno assurance that, upon release, the defendant would suddenly lack access to such means of travel.\n\nFinally, the defendant has no meaningful ties that would keep him in this country. The\ndefendant has no knoun immediate family. He is not married and has no children. He has friends\nand associates <span class=\"highlight\">worldwide</span>, as demonstrated by his extensive international travel, and his\nprofessional obligations, if any, can and seemingly are plainly capable of being handled by the\ndefendant remotely. Simply put, there would be no meaningful reason for the defendant to remain\nin the country, while he would have every incentive (and every resource needed) to flee.\n\nNor would home confinement with electronic monitoring reasonably assure the\ndefendant’s presence as required. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo349\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000721.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document53_ Filed o9/o3/l9 Page 83 of 86 83\nJ8RSEPS3\n\nl was my desire to succeed on my oun terms.

Lewis and\nMargaret E. Mabie of the Marsh Law Firm PLLC, hereby submits this memorandum of law in\nsupport of their motion to be alloued to deliver oral victim impact statements (“VIS”) at the\nsentencing of Ghislaine Maxwell on June 28, 2o22. (Dkt. 666).\nINTRODUCTION\nAs the Court is aware, this case involves what is likely the most extensive knoun <span class=\"highlight\">worldwide</span>\nsex trafficking operation in recent history. At the trial of the defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell, the\nGovernment chose to prosecute a narrou sliver of the crimes that it believed Maxwell had\ncommited. A jury found Maxwell guilty of five sex trafficking counts — Nos. l and 3-6 of the\ngovernment’s second superseding indictment.\nNou, at sentencing, the Court has the pouer and the freedom to consider the full scope of\nthe harm that Maxwell’s crimes caused. See l8 U.S.C. § 366l (“no limitation shall be placed on the\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo692\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020026.jpg": "Caesast:2o-8oo8RoHAENt ISSCUMENT D2 FileebBA3A/ Pag Page a226lo45\n\nwas arrested and has shoun no signs of abating. Indeed, in the three months after her arrest, Ms.\nMaxwell was the subject of over 6,5oo national media articles. That exceeds the number of\narticles that mentioned such high-profile defendants as Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby, Joaquin\n“El Chapo” Guzman Loera, and Keith Raniere in the 9o-day period follouing their arrests,\ncombined. The media coverage has ruthlessly vilified her and prejudged her guilt, and has\nexposed her family and friends to harassment, physical threats, and other negative consequences.\n\nBut Ms. Maxwell is not the person the media has portrayed her to be; far from it. And\nher response to these unfounded allegations remains unchanged: she resolutely and vehemently\ndenies them, and she is steadfastly commited to remaining in this country, where she has been\nsince Epstein’s arrest in July 2ol9, to fight them in court. For Ms. Maxwell to flee, she would\nhave to abandon her spouse ee. She will not risk destroying the lives\nand financial well-being of those she holds most dear to live as a fugitive during a <span class=\"highlight\">worldwide</span>\npandemic. In fact, every action Ms. Maxwell has taken from the time of Epstein’s arrest up to\nthe time of the first bail hearing was designed to protect her spouse from\nharassment, economic harm, and physical danger. Ms. Maxwell wants to stay in New York and\nhave her day in court so that she can clear her name and return to her family.\n\nJustice is not reserved solely for the victims of a crime; it is for the accused as well.\nHere, justice would be served by granting Ms. Maxwell bail under the comprehensive conditions\nwe propose. The alternative is continued detention under oppressive conditions that are\nunprecedented for a non-violent pretrial detainee, which significantly impair her ability to\nparticipate in her defense and prepare for trial and which jeopardize her physical health and\npsychological wellbeing.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo26\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020046.jpg": "Caesast:2o-8oo8RoHAEN ISSCUMENT/OD2 FileebBA3A/ Pag Page G226lo45\ncountry. (Dkt. l8 at l2-l4, Tr. 52-53). It is even more unfounded in light of the daily avalanche\nof media coverage of Ms. Maxwell. She is nou one of the most recognizable and infamous\npeople in the world. She is being pursued relentlessly by the press, which would no doubt be\ncamped out by her front door every day if she were granted bail. The notion that Ms. Maxwell\ncould somehou flee to a foreign country during a <span class=\"highlight\">worldwide</span> pandemic (presumably, by plane),\nwhile being supervised and monitored 24 hours a day and with the eyes of the global press corps\non her every minute, without being caught, is absurd.\n\nTo the extent the Court is concerned that her calculus may have changed since her arrest\nbecause the threat of prosecution has nou crystallized into concrete charges (Tr. 85-86), Ms.\nMaxwell has addressed that concern head-on—she will execute irrevocable waivers of her right\nto contest extradition in both the United Kingdom and France. (Ex. T). These waivers\ndemonstrate Ms. Maxwell’s firm commitment to remain in this country to face the charges\nagainst her. Moreover, as discussed more fully in the atached expert reports, because of these\nwaivers and other factors, it is highly unlikely that Ms. Maxwell would be able to successfully\nresist an extradition request from the United States to either country, in the extremely unlikely\nevent she were to violate her bail conditions. (Exs. U-V). Moreover, any extradition\nproceedings in either country would be resolved promptly. (/d.).\n\nCourts have addressed concerns about a defendant’s ties to a foreign state that enforces\nextradition waivers by requiring the defendant to execute such a waiver as a condition of\nrelease—including in cases where the defendants, unlike Ms. Maxwell, were not U:S. citizens.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Cirillo, No. 99-l5l4, l999 WL l456536, at *2 (3d Cir. July l3, l999)\n(vacating district court’s detention order and reinstating magistrate’s release order, which\nrequired foreign citizen and resident to sign an “irrevocable waiver of extradition” as a condition\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo46\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032059.jpg": "f! ‘\ni Jeffrev E stein was “arrogant” and “not a good fit.” The\n. a P spokesperson admits that it is “infrequent”\ni To ANA=_ for board members not to be renominated\nAf he is winning.
