Jeffrey Epstein, l9 Cr. 49o (RMB)\n\nDear Judge Berman:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the defendant’s Motion for\nPretrial Release (the “Release Motion’), dated July ll, 2ol9 (Dkt. 6), and in further support of its\nMemorandum in Support of Detention (the “Detention Memo”), submited to Magistrate Judge\nPitman on July 8, 2ol9, which is atached hereto and incorporated herein (Ex. A).\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">PRELIMINARY</span> STATEMENT\n\nThe defendant is a serial sexual predator who is charged with abusing underage girls for\nyears. A grand jury has returned an indictment alleging that he sexually exploited dozens of\nminors, including girls as young as l4 years old, in New York and Florida. To this day, he is a\nregistered sex offender designated by New York State in the highest category of risk to reoffend,\ndespite unsuccessfully atempting to have that classification louered. And any doubt that the\ndefendant is unrepentant and unreformed was eliminated when law enforcement agents discovered\nhundreds or thousands of nude and seminude photographs of young females in his Manhatan\nmansion on the night of his arrest, more than a decade after he was first convicted of a sex crime\ninvolving a juvenile.\n\nThe defendant also faces substantial evidence of his guilt, founded on the corroborated\ntestimony of numerous victims, and this case presents the very real possibility that he will go to\nprison for the rest of his life. The defendant has at his disposal a vast fortune, the details of which\nremain largely concealed from the Court. He also has a history of obstruction and manipulation\nof witnesses, including, as detailed herein, as recently as within the past year, when media reports\nabout his conduct reemerged. And he continues to shou a shocking lack of understanding of the\ngravity of the harm he has perpetrated, including through the minimization of his conduct and\ncasual disparagement of victims in his arguments.\n\nAgainst this backdrop of significant—and rapidly-expanding—evidence, serious charges,\nand the prospect of a lengthy prison sentence, the defendant proposes to be released on conditions\nthat are woefully inadequate. The Release Motion misconstrues and misunderstands the relevant\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo329", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000388.jpg": "Jase ba9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti8- Filed o7/l6/l9 Page 2 of l8 2\n\nl (Case called)\n\n2 THE COURT: Good afternoon.\n\n3 I think I'm prety much up to speed as to where you\n\n4 are in the sense that I am aware that you have been before\n\n5 Magistrate Judge Pitman earlier this morning and up to some few\n6 minutes ago for purposes of presentment, arraignment, and some\n7 <span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span> discussion of bail.

(Epstein Dkt. 63 at l-3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at l-3).\nThis memorandum, as directed by the Court, addresses the specific facts and factors highlighted\nin the Court’s Orders relevant to the particular grand jury materials at issue here. (Epstein Dkt. 63\nat l-3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at l-3). In order to ensure that “[t]ransparency in this process ... not be\nat the expense of [the Government’s] obligation under the law to protect victims” (Epstein Dkt. 6l\nat 2; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at 2), the Government also respectfully requests leave to file a supplemental\nsubmission once the Government and the Court have received any filings from the victims or\nothers referenced in the transcripts.\nIl. The Court’s Orders\n\nAs the Court recognized (Epstein Dkt. 63 at l-2; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at l-2), the Second\nCircuit has held that “there are certain ‘special circumstances’ in which release of grand jury\nrecords is appropriate even outside the boundaries of the rule.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo2 (2d\nCir. l997); see also In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489, 494 (2d Cir. l973) (supplemental opinion)\n(Friendly, C.J.) (recognizing that there are certain “special circumstances” in which release of\ngrand jury records is appropriate even outside of the boundaries of Rule 6(e)).! The Second Circuit\nenumerated a list of non-exhaustive factors for trial courts to consider when deciding such motions:\n' There is currently a Circuit split. See Pitch v. United States, 953 F.3d l226, l233 & n.6 (llth Cir.\n2o2o) (en banc) (describing the Circuit split); Jn re Petition for Order Directing Release of\nRecords, 27 F.4th 84, 9o-9l (lst Cir. 2o22) (same). In light of this split, when the Government\nsought similar relief seeking to unseal grand jury transcripts in the Southern District of Florida\nfrom 2oo5 and 2oo7 relating to Epstein, the Honorable Robin L.

In July 2ol9, Epstein was indicted for\noffenses relating to sexual misconduct, amid overwhelming media atention focused on the\nnature of the charges and Epstein’s wealth and lifestyle.

Many of these stories and online posts were\nthreatening and harassing to our client and those close to her.\n\nBut sometimes the simplest point is the most critical one: Ghislaine Maxwell is not\nJeffrey Epstein. She was not named in the government’s indictment of Epstein in 2ol9, despite\nthe fact that the government has been investigating this case for years. Instead, the current\nindictment is based on allegations of conduct that allegedly occurred roughly twenty-five years\nago. Ms. Maxwell vigorously denies the charges, intends to fight them, and is entitled to the\npresumption of innocence. Far from “hiding,” she has lived in the United States since l99l, has\nlitigated civil cases arising from her supposed ties to Epstein, and has not left the country even\nonce since Epstein’s arrest a year ago, even though she was aware of the pending, and highly\npublicized, criminal investigation. She should be treated like any other defendant who comes\nbefore this Court, including as to bail.

On this renewed application, Ms. Maxwell has put\nbefore the Court a significant bail package, supported by detailed submissions, which warrant\nher release on strict conditions. She and her spouse have commited to signing a bond in the full\namount of their net worth, regardless of the ounership of the underlying assets. She has\nproffered seven additional sureties, consisting of her family and close friends, many of whom are\nUS. citizens and long-time residents, who have come forward at great personal risk and have\npledged meaningful assets. The government does not challenge the good faith and bona fides of\nthese proposed sureties. She has provided a detailed report from a respected accounting firm,\nwhich was further reviewed by a former IRS special agent, seting forth a statement of her\nfinancial condition, supported by voluminous documentation. The government does not\nchallenge the report’s findings, nor its underlying documentation. She has agreed, in writing, to\ngive up any right she has or could have to contest extradition and submit to all other standard\ntravel restrictions. And she has noted that a key representation made by the government at the\ninitial bail hearing as to the strength of its evidence is simply not accurate it\nPO and there is no “significant contemporaneous documentary\nevidence” that corroborates its case.\n\nWith regard to any other defendant, this record would readily support release on strict\nbail conditions, perhaps even on consent. But this is Ghislaine Maxwell, the apparent substitute\nfor Jeffrey Epstein. So, instead, in its response the government urges the Court to disregard the\nsignificant additional evidence proffered to the Court and further argues that a defendant cannot\nbe eligible for bail (apparently on any conditions), unless she can provide an absolute guarantee\nagainst all risks. But this is not the legal standard. United States v.

The Court accordingly denies\nDefendant’s request to reopen the original bail hearing and denies her renewed motion for bail.\n\nA. The presumption in favor of detention applies\n\nThe Court is required to presume that no condition or combination of conditions of\npretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The Bail Reform Act\nprovides that if a defendant is charged with commiting an offense involving a minor victim\nunder l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, “it shall be presumed that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of the\ncommunity if the judicial officer finds that there is probable cause to believe that the person\ncommited.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). The Defendant’s indictment by a grand jury suffices to\nestablish that there is probable cause to believe that she commited the offenses charged in the\nindictment. See, e.g., United States v. Contreras, 776 F.2d 5l, 53-54 (2d Cir. l985) (noting that\nthat an indictment returned by a properly constituted grand jury “conclusively determines the\nexistence of probable cause” and that “the return of an indictment eliminates the need for a\n<span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span> examination at which a probable cause finding is made by a judicial officer pursuant\nto Rule 5(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.” (citations omited)). In light of the\ncrimes charged in the indictment, the Court begins with the presumption that no condition or\ncombination of conditions of pretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance.\n\nWhen the presumption applies, the Defendant bears a limited burden of production\n“tending to counter the § 3l42(e) presumption of flight,” Contreras, 776 F.2d at 53 n.l. The\nDefendant’s burden of production only requires that she “introduce a certain amount of evidence\ncontrary to the presumed fact.” United States v.

The government does not challenge the good faith and bona fides of\nthese proposed sureties. She has provided a detailed report from a respected accounting firm,\nwhich was further reviewed by a former IRS special agent, seting forth a statement of her\nfinancial condition, supported by voluminous documentation. The government does not\nchallenge the report’s findings, nor its underlying documentation. She has agreed, in writing, to\ngive up any right she has or could have to contest extradition and submit to all other standard\ntravel restrictions. And she has noted that a key representation made by the government at the\ninitial bail hearing as to the strength of its evidence is simply not accurate hi\nPo and there is no “significant contemporaneous documentary\nevidence” that corroborates its case.\n\nWith regard to any other defendant, this record would readily support release on strict\nbail conditions, perhaps even on consent. But this is Ghislaine Maxwell, the apparent substitute\nfor Jeffrey Epstein. So, instead, in its response the government urges the Court to disregard the\nsignificant additional evidence proffered to the Court and further argues that a defendant cannot\nbe eligible for bail (apparently on any conditions), unless she can provide an absolute guarantee\nagainst all risks. But this is not the legal standard. United States v. Orta, 76o F.2d 887, 888 n.4,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo22ll", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002239.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page 7 of 22\ndetention without bail is warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The Court accordingly denies\nDefendant’s request to reopen the original bail hearing and denies her renewed motion for bail.\n\nA. The presumption in favor of detention applies\n\nThe Court is required to presume that no condition or combination of conditions of\npretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The Bail Reform Act\nprovides that if a defendant is charged with commiting an offense involving a minor victim\nunder l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, “it shall be presumed that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of the\ncommunity if the judicial officer finds that there is probable cause to believe that the person\ncommited.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). The Defendant’s indictment by a grand jury suffices to\nestablish that there is probable cause to believe that she commited the offenses charged in the\nindictment. See, e.g., United States v. Contreras, 776 F.2d 5l, 53-54 (2d Cir. l985) (noting that\nthat an indictment returned by a properly constituted grand jury “conclusively determines the\nexistence of probable cause” and that “the return of an indictment eliminates the need for a\n<span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span> examination at which a probable cause finding is made by a judicial officer pursuant\nto Rule 5(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.” (citations omited)). In light of the\ncrimes charged in the indictment, the Court begins with the presumption that no condition or\ncombination of conditions of pretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance.\n\nWhen the presumption applies, the Defendant bears a limited burden of production\n“tending to counter the § 3l42(e) presumption of flight,” Contreras, 776 F.2d at 53 n.l. The\nDefendant’s burden of production only requires that she “introduce a certain amount of evidence\ncontrary to the presumed fact.” United States v.

Rather than\nwait a short time until residents of counties constituting the Manhatan Division of this District\ncould appear for grand jury service, the government, in its apparent determination to mark the\nanniversary of its indictment of Jeffrey Epstein with a July 2, 2o2o announcement of the\nindictment and arrest of Ghislaine Maxwell, sought and obtained an indictment of Ms. Maxwell\nthrough a grand jury drawn from the White Plains Division. In doing so, the government\nprocured Ms. Maxwell’s indictment using a grand jury pool that excluded residents of the\ncommunity in which Ms. Maxwell allegedly commited the offenses with which she is charged,\nand in which she will be tried, in favor of a grand jury drawn from a community in which Black\nand Hispanic residents are significantly underrepresented by comparison. The government thus\nviolated Ms. Maxwell’s Sixth Amendment right to be indicted by a grand jury drawn from a fair-\ncross section of the community.!\n\nIt was unnecessary for the government to take this step. According to an email from a\ncourt official filed in connection with a similar challenge to the government’s practice, a\nManhatan grand jury was seated as early as June 25, 2o2o—four days before Ms. Maxwell was\nindicted. See Exhibit A to Reply Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss, U.S. v. Balde,\nNo. l:2o-cr-oo28l-KPF (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No. 7o-l (filed Dec. 23, 2o2o). Had the government\nwaited until that time, it might have been unable to meet its arbitrary July 2 deadline, and its\npress conference touting the indictment and arrest of Ms. Maxwell might have had slightly less\n' The fact that Ms. Maxwell herself is neither Black nor Hispanic does not deprive of her of standing to raise this\nchallenge. “[T]he Sixth Amendment entitles every defendant to object to a venire that is not designed to represent a\nfair cross section of the community, whether or not the systematically excluded groups are groups to which he\nhimself belongs.” Holland v.

OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct.

ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\na 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na <span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span> inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstetn’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation imto those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nvill\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2542", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002578.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 6 of 38\n<span class=\"highlight\">PRELIMINARY</span> STATEMENT\n\nGhislaine Maxwell respectfully submits this Memorandum in Support of her Motion to\nDismiss the Superseding Indictment for Breach of the Non-Prosecution Agreement (“Motion”).\n\nOne does not need to engage in complex analysis to understand what has happened here:\nthe government has sought to substitute our client for Jeffrey Epstein, even if it means\nstretching—and ultimately exceeding—the bounds of the law.

Alexander Acosta, then United States Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida (“SDFL”), and approved by senior levels of Main Justice, including the Office\nof the Deputy Atorney General.

Counts\nOne through Four charge Ms. Maxwell with offenses allegedly commited between l994 and\nl997. But the applicable statute of limitations, l8 U.S.C. § 3282, expired five years after the\nalleged conduct.\n\nIn an atempt to get around its statute of limitations problem, the government has invoked\nl8 U.S.C. § 3283, as that statute was amended in 2oo3—many years after the alleged conduct\noccurred.

OPR also collected\nand reviewed materials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein. OPR also\nexamined extensive publicly available information, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and\nother court records, and reviewed media reports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books\nrelating to the Epstein case.\n\nIn addition to this extensive documentary review, OPR conducted more than 6o interviews\nof witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI administrative personnel;\ncurrent and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former Department atorneys and senior\nmanagers, including a former Deputy Atorney General and a former Assistant Atorney General\nfor the Criminal Division; and the former State Atorney and former Assistant State Atorney in\ncharge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed several victims and atorneys\nrepresenting victims, and reviewed writen submissions from victims, concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and the FBI.\n\nOPR identified former U.S. Atorney Acosta, three former USAO supervisors, and the\nAUSA as subjects of its investigation based on <span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span> information indicating that each of\nthem was involved in the decision to resolve the case through the NPA or in the negotiations\nleading to the agreement. OPR deems a current or former Department atorney to be a subject of\nits investigation when the individual’s conduct is within the scope of OPR’s review and may result\nin a finding of professional misconduct. OPR reviewed prior public statements made by Acosta\nand another subject. All five subjects cooperated fully with OPR’s investigation. OPR requested\nthat all of the subjects provide writen responses detailing their involvement in the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions relating to victim\nnotification and consultation. OPR received and reviewed writen responses from all of the\nsubjects, and subsequently conducted extensive interviews of each subject under oath and before\na court reporter. Each subject was represented by counsel and had access to relevant\ncontemporaneous documents before the subject’s OPR interview. The subjects reviewed and\nprovided comments on their respective interview transcripts and on OPR’s draft report. OPR\n6 The federal government was closed from December 22, 2ol8, to January 25, 2ol9. After initiating its\ninvestigation, OPR also subsequently received other leters from U.S. Senators and Representatives inquiring into the\nstatus of the OPR investigation.\n\nvi\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l84", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003186.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo of 348\ninvestigate, litigate, or provide legal advice.? OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\na 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na <span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span> inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an imvestigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nvill\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l86", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003198.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22 of 348\nCHAPTER THREE: ISSUES RELATING TO THE GOVERNMENT’S INTERACTIONS\nA.

Overall,\nmany of the victims were troubled about the existence of the\ninvestigation. They displayed feelings of embarrassment and\nhumiliation and were reluctant to talk to investigators. Some\nvictims who were identified through the investigation refused even\nto speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and\ngeting to the truth were always at the forefront of our handling of\nthe investigation.\nThe case agent told OPR that although she encountered victims who were “strong” and\n“believable,” she did not encounter any who vigorously advocated for the prosecution of Epstein.\nRather, “they were embarrassed,” “didn’t want their parents to knou,” and “wanted to forget.””*\nAs of September 24, 2oo7, the date the NPA was signed, Villafafia informed Epstein\natorney Lefkouitz that she had compiled a <span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span> list of victims including “34 confirmed\nminors” and 6 other potential minor victims who had not yet been interviewed by the FBI.7*4\nAlthough the government had contacted many victims before the NPA was signed, Villafafia\nacknouledged during the CVRA litigation that “individual victims were not consulted regarding\nthe agreement.”\nB. Before the NPA Is Signed, Villafafia Expresses Concern That Victims Have\nNot Been Consulted\nBefore the NPA was signed, Villafafia articulated to her supervisors concerns about the\ngovernment’s failure to consult with victims.\nl. July 2oo7: Villafafia’s Email Exchanges with Menchel\nIn July 2oo7, Villafafia learned that Menchel had discussed with defense counsel Sanchez\na possible state resolution to the federal investigation of Epstein. Villafafia was upset by this\ninformation, and sent a strongly worded email to Menchel voicing her concerns. (A full account\nof their email exchange is set forth at Chapter Two, Part One, Section IV.A.2.) In that email, she\ntold him that it was “inappropriate [for you] to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE, the victims, and me. These plea negotiations violate . . . all of the\n283 The case agent also noted that the victim who became CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 had expressed in her\nApril 2oo7 video-recorded FBI interview her opinion that “nothing should happen to Epstein.”\n284 The “victims’ list” for purposes of the NPA was intended to include the names of all individuals whom the\ngovernment was prepared to name in a charging document “as victims of an offense enumerated in l8 U.S.C. § 2255.”\nAlthough the charges Villafafia proposed on May l, 2oo7, were based on crimes against l3 victims, thereafter, as\nexplained in Chapter Two of this Report, she continued to revise the proposed charges, adding and removing victims\nas the federal investigation developed further evidence. At the time the NPA was signed, the proposed charges were\nbased on crimes against l9 victims, but others had been identified for potential inclusion.\n2o2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003405.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 229 of 348\nvarious iterations of the victims’ rights legislation.”** Villafafia explained to OPR her reference\nto the victims:\n\n[M]y concern was that [Menchel] was violating the CVRA which\n\nrequires the atorneys for the government, which[] includes me[,] to\n\nconfer with the victims, and the [VRRA], which requires the agents\n\nto keep the victims apprised of what’s happening with the case. So\n\nin essence, I felt like he was exposing both myself and the agents to\n\nallegations of not abiding by our obligations by engaging in these\n\nplea negotiations without leting us knou about it.7®°\n\nIn his reply to Villafafia’s email, and after noting that he found her email “totally\ninappropriate,” Menchel denied that he had violated any Departmental policy, and he noted that\n“Ta]s Chief of the Criminal Division, I am the person designated by the U.S. Atorney to exercise\nappropriate discretion in deciding whether certain pleas are appropriate and consistent with”\nDepartmental policy. Perceiving Menchel’s rebuke as a criticism of her judgment, Villafafia\nresponded, “[R]aising concerns about the forgoten voices of victims in this case should not be\nclassified as a lapse in judgment” and that her “first and only concern in this case. . . is the victims.”\nMenchel told OPR that he did not view his conversation with Sanchez as a plea offer,\nasserted that he was not obligated to consult with victims during <span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span> setlement\nnegotiations, and noted that he left the USAO before the NPA was fully negotiated or signed.\nMenchel told OPR that “you have discussions . . . with [the] defense all the time, and the notion\nthat even just having a general discussion is something that must be veted with victims . . . is not\neven... in the same universe as to hou I think about this.” Menchel also observed that on the\nvery day that Villafafia criticized him for engaging in setlement negotiations without consulting\nher, the FBI, or the victims, Villafafia had herself sent an email to Sanchez offering “to discuss the\npossibility of a federal resolution of Mr. Epstein’s case that could run concurrently with any state\nresolution,” without having spoken to the victims about her proposal.7*”\n288 Villafafia told OPR that “some victims, I felt strongly, would have objected to [a state-only disposition].”\nVillafafia stated to OPR that at the time Menchel engaged in such negotiations, he would only have been aware of the\nvictim information contained in her prosecution memorandum, which included information about the “effects on the\nvictims” but did not likely contain information as to “hou they would like the case resolved.” Villafafia asserted that\nMenchel “never reached out to any of the victims to find out what their position would be.” Menchel told OPR that\nthe allegations in Villafafia’s email that he violated the Ashcroft Memo, USAM, and the CVRA were “way out of line\nin terms of what the law is and the policies are.”\n286 As discussed, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not apply before charges were\nfiled against a defendant.\n287 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel asserted that her email to Sanchez was intended\nonly to determine whether Epstein was interested in opening plea negotiations.\n2o3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003413.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 237 of 348\nand thanking Acosta for agreeing on October l2, 2oo7, not to “contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this\nmater.”°°7 Shortly thereafter, Sloman drafted a response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Acosta\nrevised to clarify the “inaccurate” representations made by Lefkouitz, in particular noting that\nAcosta did not agree to a “gag order” with regard to victim contact. The draft response, as revised\nby Acosta, stated:\n\nYou should understand, houever, that there are some\ncommunications that are typical in these maters. As an example,\nour Office has an obligation to contact the victims to inform them\nthat either [the Special Master], or his designee, will be contact[ing]\nthem. Rest assured that we will continue to treat this mater as we\nwould any similarly situated case.°°\nIn a November 5, 2oo7 leter, Sloman complained to Lefkouitz that private investigators\nworking for Epstein had been contacting victims and asking whether government agents had\ndiscussed financial setlement with them. Sloman noted that the private investigators’ “actions are\ntroublesome because the FBI agents legally are required to advise the victims of the resolution of\nthe mater, which includes informing them that, as part of the resolution, Mr. Epstein has agreed\nto pay damages in some circumstances.” The same day, Villafafia emailed Sloman expressing her\nconcern that “if we [file charges] nou, cross-examination will consist of- ‘and the government told\nyou that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are entitled to a large amount of damages, right?””>”\nC. October — November 2oo7: The FBI and the USAO Continue to Investigate,\nand the FBI Sends a Notice Leter to One Victim Stating That the Case is\n“Under Investigation”\nAlthough Villafafia and the FBI case agents decided to stop informing victims about the\nNPA, the FBI continued its investigation of the case, which included locating and interviewing\npotential victims. In October and November 2oo7, the FBI interviewed l2 potential new victims,\n8 of whom had been identified in a “<span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span>” victim list in use at the time Epstein signed the\n3o2 Villafafia later emailed Sloman stating that she planned to meet with the case agents to have a “general\ndiscussion about staying out of the civil litigation.”\nao8 Sloman’s draft also stated that Acosta had informed the defense in a previous conference call that the USAO\nwould not accept a “gag order.” OPR recovered only a draft version of the communication and was unable to find\nany evidence that the draft leter was finalized or sent to defense counsel.\n3o9 Subsequent records also referred to the prosecutors’ concerns about creating impeachment evidence and that\nsuch concerns played a role in their decision not to notify victims of the NPA until after Epstein pled guilty. In August\n2oo8, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafafia, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding\nthat the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA]... because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA]\napplied.” Acosta responded: “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as\npotential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they were doing this for the money and we did not want to\ndiscuss liability with them, which was [a] key part of [the] agree[ment].”\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003443.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 267 of 348\nF. 2olo - 2oll: Department and Congressional Actions Regarding\nInterpretation of the CVRA\n\nIn connection with the Department’s 2olo effort to update its 2oo5 Guidelines, the Office\nof the Deputy Atorney General convened a Victim of Crimes Working Group that asked OLC to\nrevisit its 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span> review concerning the definition of “crime victim” under the CVRA\nand solicited input concerning the issue from Department components and federal law enforcement\nagencies. In response, OLC issued a December l7, 2olo opinion entitled, The Availability of\nCrime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4. Based on the CVRA’s\nlanguage, relevant case law, and memoranda opinions from Department components, OLC\nreaffirmed its 2oo5 conclusion that CVRA rights do not vest until a criminal charge has been filed\n(by complaint, information, or indictment) and the rights cease to be available if “all charges are\ndismissed either voluntarily or on the merits (or if the [g]overnment declines to bring formal\ncharges after the filing of a complaint).”?”\n\nAfter OLC issued its opinion, the Department revised the 2oo5 Guidelines in October 2oll\nbut did not change its fundamental position that the CVRA rights did not vest until after criminal\ncharges were filed. The 2oll revision did, houever, add language concerning victim consultation\nbefore a defendant is charged: “In circumstances where plea negotiations occur before a case has\nbeen brought, Department policy is that this should include reasonable consultation prior to the\nfiling of a charging instrument with the court.”*” The use of the word “should” in the 2oll\nGuidelines indicates that “personnel are expected to take the action . . . unless there is an\nappropriate, articulable reason not to do so.”°°° Nevertheless, the required consultation “may be\ngeneral in nature” and “does not have to be specific to a particular plea offer.”°*! The revisions\nalso specified that AUSAs were to ensure that victims had a right to be reasonably heard at plea\nproceedings.**\n\nOn November 2, 2oll, U.S. Senator Jon Kyl, a co-sponsor of the CVRA, sent a leter to\nAtorney General Eric Holder, arguing that the 2oll Guidelines revisions “conflict[ed] quite\nclearly with the CVRA’s plain language” because the 2oll Guidelines did “not extend any rights\nto victims until charges have been filed.” The Department’s response emphasized that the\n378 OLC “express[ed] no opinion” as to whether it is a mater of “good practice” to inform victims of their CVRA\nrights prior to the filing of a complaint or after the dismissal of charges.\nae See 2oll Guidelines, Art. V, § G.2, available at htps://(www_justice.gov/sites/default/files/olp/docs/\nag guidelines2ol2. pdf. In its 2oll online training video regarding the Guidelines, the Department encouraged such\nconsultation when reasonable, but it also continued to maintain that there was no CVRA right to confer for pre-\nindictment plea negotiations.\n\n38o See 2oll Guidelines, Art. I, J B.2.\n58 See 2oll Guidelines, Art. V, J G.2.\n382 The 2oo5 Guidelines contained no specific provision requiring AUSAs to ensure that victims were able to\nexercise their right to be reasonably heard at plea proceedings, only at sentencing. See 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV,\n4 C.3.b.(2). Houever, the 2oo5 Guidelines generally require AUSAs to use their best efforts to comply with the\nCVRA, and the CVRA specifically affords victims the right to be heard at plea proceedings. The 2oll revision\nremedied this omission.\n\n24l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3443", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003461.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 285 of 348\ndid not find evidence shouing that the subjects intended to silence victims or to prevent them from\nhaving input into the USAO’s intent to resolve the federal investigation.\n\nAlthough the contemporaneous records provide some information about victim notification\ndecisions made after the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, the records contain litle about\nthe subjects’ views regarding consultation with victims before the NPA was signed. In a\nSeptember 6, 2oo7 email primarily addressing other topics, as the plea negotiations were beginning\nin earnest and almost three weeks before the NPA was signed, Villafafia raised the topic of victim\nconsultation with Sloman: “The agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their\napproval, which as [CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law. . . .\n[A]nd the [PBPD] Chief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.’”4**\nSloman forwarded the email to Acosta with a note stating, “fyi.” Villafafia recalled that after she\nsent the email, Sloman told her by telephone, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.”*°° Villafafia also told\nOPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve been advised that . . . pre-\ncharge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Villafafia also recalled a discussion with\nAcosta, Menchel, and Sloman, during which she stated that she would need to get victims’ input\non the terms being proposed to the defense, and she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential.\nYou can’t disclose them.’4°6\n\nNone of the other subjects recalled a specific discussion before the NPA was signed about\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations. Menchel told OPR he believed the USAO was not required to\nconsult with victims during the <span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span> “general discussion” phase of setlement negotiations;\nmoreover, he left the USAO before the terms of the NPA were fully developed.\n\nSloman told OPR that he “did not think that we had to consult with victims prior to entering\ninto the NPA” and “we did not have to seek approval from victims to resolve a case.” Sloman\nbelieved the USAO was obligated only to notify victims about resolution of “the cases that we\nhandled, filed cases.” Sloman recalled that because the USAO envisioned a state court resolution\nof the mater, he did not “think that that was a concern of ours at the time to consult with [the\nvictims] prior to entering into... the NPA.”\n\nLourie told OPR that he did not recall any discussions about informing the victims about\nthe terms of the NPA or any instructions to Villafafia that she not discuss the NPA with the victims.\nHe stated that everything the USAO did was “to try and get the best result as possible for the\nvictims. . . . [O]nce you step back and look at the whole forest . . ., you will see that... . [I]f you\nlook at each tree and say, well, you didn’t do this right for the victim, you didn’t tell the victim\nthis and that, you’re missing the big picture.”\nae As noted, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not require consultation with victims\nbecause no criminal charges had been filed. In addition, Villafafia’s reference to victim “approval” was inaccurate\nbecause the CVRA, even when applicable, requires only “consultation” with victims about prosecutorial decisions.\n‘o5 Villafaia did not recall Sloman explaining the reason for the decision.\n\n4o6 Villafafia also told OPR that she recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations\ncould cause victims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.” Villafafia was\nuncertain of the date of the conversation, but Menchel’s presence requires it to have occurred before August 3, 2oo7.\n259\nDOJ-OGR- oooo346l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003809.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l2-2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 7 of 3o\nApp.-o8lo\n6\nG4LMGIUC\n\nl enforce the confidentiality appropriately.\n\n2 Nou, with those <span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span> thoughts in mind I am\n\n3 going to deny the motion at this time because I knou that there\n4 is a statement, some kind of a statement from the mediator in\n\n5 the Florida action.

OPR also collected\nand reviewed materials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein. OPR also\nexamined extensive publicly available information, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and\nother court records, and reviewed media reports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books\nrelating to the Epstein case.\n\nIn addition to this extensive documentary review, OPR conducted more than 6o interviews\nof witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI administrative personnel;\ncurrent and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former Department atorneys and senior\nmanagers, including a former Deputy Atorney General and a former Assistant Atorney General\nfor the Criminal Division; and the former State Atorney and former Assistant State Atorney in\ncharge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed several victims and atorneys\nrepresenting victims, and reviewed writen submissions from victims, concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and the FBI.\n\nOPR identified former U.S. Atorney Acosta, three former USAO supervisors, and the\nAUSA as subjects of its investigation based on <span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span> information indicating that each of\nthem was involved in the decision to resolve the case through the NPA or in the negotiations\nleading to the agreement. OPR deems a current or former Department atorney to be a subject of\nits investigation when the individual’s conduct is within the scope of OPR’s review and may result\nin a finding of professional misconduct. OPR reviewed prior public statements made by Acosta\nand another subject. All five subjects cooperated fully with OPR’s investigation. OPR requested\nthat all of the subjects provide writen responses detailing their involvement in the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions relating to victim\nnotification and consultation. OPR received and reviewed writen responses from all of the\nsubjects, and subsequently conducted extensive interviews of each subject under oath and before\na court reporter. Each subject was represented by counsel and had access to relevant\ncontemporaneous documents before the subject’s OPR interview. The subjects reviewed and\nprovided comments on their respective interview transcripts and on OPR’s draft report. OPR\n6 The federal government was closed from December 22, 2ol8, to January 25, 2ol9. After initiating its\ninvestigation, OPR also subsequently received other leters from U.S. Senators and Representatives inquiring into the\nstatus of the OPR investigation.\n\nvi\nDOJ-OGR- oooo43o6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004308.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll of 349\ninvestigate, litigate, or provide legal advice.? OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\na 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na <span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span> inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstetn’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation imto those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nvill\nDOJ-OGR- oooo43o8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004320.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 23 of 349\nCHAPTER THREE: ISSUES RELATING TO THE GOVERNMENT’S INTERACTIONS\nA.

According to Villafafia, she asked that it include a mechanism for the\nvictims to be provided monetary compensation through l8 U.S.C. § 2255 in lieu of the restitution\nthat would have been available if Epstein were pleading guilty to federal charges.*° Acosta told\nOPR that he “developed and approved” the term sheet.”\n\nBefore the document was presented to defense counsel, two terms were dropped from\nVillafafia’s draft—one providing that the agreement would apply only to already-identified\nvictims, and another requiring the deal to be accepted, and Epstein to plead guilty, within the\nmonth.

Villafafia did not have significant experience prosecuting corporate entities.\n86 A civil remedy for personal injuries suffered by victims of certain crimes is provided for in the federal\ncriminal code at l8 U.S.C. § 2255. Subsection (a) of the statute, as in effect from July 27, 2oo6, to\nMarch 6, 2ol3, provided as follous:\n\nAny person who, while a minor, was a victim of a violation of section\n\n224l(c), 2242, 2243, 225l, 225lA, 2252, 2252A, 226o, 242l, 2422, or 2423 of\n\nthis title and who suffers personal injury as a result of such violation, regardless\n\nof whether the injury occurred while such person was a minor, may sue in any\n\nappropriate United States District Court and shall recover the actual damages such\n\nperson sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable atorney’s fee. Any\n\nperson as described in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to have sustained\n\ndamages of no less than $l5o,ooo in value.\nVillafafia also told OPR that she asked that the terms include the requirement that Epstein plead to an offense that\nrequired him to register as a sexual offender; houever, sex offender status was also mentioned in Menchel’s July 3,\n2oo7 email to Villafafia recounting his <span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span> discussions with Sanchez.\n\n52\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4376", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004516.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l9 of 349\n(6) The right to full and timely restitution as provided in law.\n(7) The right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay.\n(8) The right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the\nvictim’s dignity and privacy.\n\nAlthough many of the nghts included in the CVRA already existed in federal law as part\nof the VRRA, the CVRA afforded crime victims standing to assert their rights in federal court or\nby administrative complaint to the Department, and obligated the court to ensure that such nghts\nwere afforded. The passage of the CVRA repealed the nights portion of the VRRA (42 U.S.C.\n§ lo6o6), but kept intact the portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to\nprovide certain victim services, such as counseling and medical care referrals (42 U.S.C.\n§ lo6o7(c)). Department training emphasizes that the VRRA obligates the Department to provide\nvictim services, which atach upon the detection of a crime, while the CVRA contains court-\nenforceable rights that atach upon the filing of a charging instrument.\n\nIn 2ol5, Congress amended the CVRA and added the follouing two rights:*©°\n\n(9) The right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea bargain\nor deferred prosecution agreement.\n\n(lo) The right to be informed of the rights under this section and the\nservices described in section 5o3(c) of the Victims’ Rights and\nRestitution Act of l99o (42 U.S.C. lo6o7(c)) and provided contact\ninformation for the Office of the Victims’ Rights Ombudsman of the\nDepartment of Justice.\n\nIl.

April l, 2oo5 Office of Legal Counsel “<span class=\"highlight\">Preliminary</span> Review”\n\nIn 2oo5, Department management requested informal guidance from the Department’s\nOffice of Legal Counsel (OLC) regarding interpretation of the CVRA’s definition of “crime\nvictim.””°? On April l, 2oo5, OLC provided “<span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span> and informal” guidance by email,\nconcluding that “the status of a ‘crime victim’ may be reasonably understood to commence upon\nthe filing of a complaint, and that the status ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or\nprosecute the Federal offense that directly caused the victim’s harm.”*®\n266 H. Rep. No. ll4-7 (Jan. 27, 2ol5).\nor OLC is responsible for providing legal advice to the President, Department components, and other executive\nbranch agencies.\n\n268 The OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance is summarized in a Memorandum Opinion to the Acting Deputy Atorney\nGeneral from Deputy Assistant Atorney General John E.

Overall,\nmany of the victims were troubled about the existence of the\ninvestigation. They displayed feelings of embarrassment and\nhumiliation and were reluctant to talk to investigators. Some\nvictims who were identified through the investigation refused even\nto speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and\ngeting to the truth were always at the forefront of our handling of\nthe investigation.\nThe case agent told OPR that although she encountered victims who were “strong” and\n“believable,” she did not encounter any who vigorously advocated for the prosecution of Epstein.\nRather, “they were embarrassed,” “didn’t want their parents to knou,” and “wanted to forget.””*\nAs of September 24, 2oo7, the date the NPA was signed, Villafafia informed Epstein\natorney Lefkouitz that she had compiled a <span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span> list of victims including “34 confirmed\nminors” and 6 other potential minor victims who had not yet been interviewed by the FBI.7*4\nAlthough the government had contacted many victims before the NPA was signed, Villafafia\nacknouledged during the CVRA litigation that “individual victims were not consulted regarding\nthe agreement.”\nB. Before the NPA Is Signed, Villafafia Expresses Concern That Victims Have\nNot Been Consulted\nBefore the NPA was signed, Villafafia articulated to her supervisors concerns about the\ngovernment’s failure to consult with victims.\nl. July 2oo7: Villafafia’s Email Exchanges with Menchel\nIn July 2oo7, Villafafia learned that Menchel had discussed with defense counsel Sanchez\na possible state resolution to the federal investigation of Epstein. Villafafia was upset by this\ninformation, and sent a strongly worded email to Menchel voicing her concerns. (A full account\nof their email exchange is set forth at Chapter Two, Part One, Section IV.A.2.) In that email, she\ntold him that it was “inappropriate [for you] to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE, the victims, and me. These plea negotiations violate . . . all of the\n283 The case agent also noted that the victim who became CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 had expressed in her\nApril 2oo7 video-recorded FBI interview her opinion that “nothing should happen to Epstein.”\n284 The “victims’ list” for purposes of the NPA was intended to include the names of all individuals whom the\ngovernment was prepared to name in a charging document “as victims of an offense enumerated in l8 U.S.C. § 2255.”\nAlthough the charges Villafafia proposed on May l, 2oo7, were based on crimes against l3 victims, thereafter, as\nexplained in Chapter Two of this Report, she continued to revise the proposed charges, adding and removing victims\nas the federal investigation developed further evidence.

So\n\nin essence, I felt like he was exposing both myself and the agents to\n\nallegations of not abiding by our obligations by engaging in these\n\nplea negotiations without leting us knou about it.7°°\n\nIn his reply to Villafafia’s email, and after noting that he found her email “totally\ninappropriate,” Menchel denied that he had violated any Departmental policy, and he noted that\n“Ta]s Chief of the Criminal Division, I am the person designated by the U.S. Atorney to exercise\nappropriate discretion in deciding whether certain pleas are appropriate and consistent with”\nDepartmental policy. Perceiving Menchel’s rebuke as a criticism of her judgment, Villafafia\nresponded, “[R]aising concerns about the forgoten voices of victims in this case should not be\nclassified as a lapse in judgment” and that her “first and only concern in this case. . . is the victims.”\nMenchel told OPR that he did not view his conversation with Sanchez as a plea offer,\nasserted that he was not obligated to consult with victims during <span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span> setlement\nnegotiations, and noted that he left the USAO before the NPA was fully negotiated or signed.\nMenchel told OPR that “you have discussions . . . with [the] defense all the time, and the notion\nthat even just having a general discussion is something that must be veted with victims . . . is not\neven ... in the same universe as to hou I think about this.” Menchel also observed that on the\nvery day that Villafafia criticized him for engaging in setlement negotiations without consulting\nher, the FBI, or the victims, Villafafia had herself sent an email to Sanchez offering “to discuss the\npossibility of a federal resolution of Mr. Epstein’s case that could run concurrently with any state\nresolution,” without having spoken to the victims about her proposal.”*”\n288 Villafafia told OPR that “some victims, I felt strongly, would have objected to [a state-only disposition].”\nVillafafia stated to OPR that at the time Menchel engaged in such negotiations, he would only have been aware of the\nvictim information contained in her prosecution memorandum, which included information about the “effects on the\nvictims” but did not likely contain information as to “hou they would like the case resolved.” Villafafia asserted that\nMenchel “never reached out to any of the victims to find out what their position would be.” Menchel told OPR that\nthe allegations in Villafafia’s email that he violated the Ashcroft Memo, USAM, and the CVRA were “way out of line\nin terms of what the law is and the policies are.”\n286 As discussed, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not apply before charges were\nfiled against a defendant.\n287 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel asserted that her email to Sanchez was intended\nonly to determine whether Epstein was interested in opening plea negotiations.\n2o3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4527", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004535.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 238 of 349\nand thanking Acosta for agreeing on October l2, 2oo7, not to “contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this\nmater.”°°7 Shortly thereafter, Sloman drafted a response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Acosta\nrevised to clarify the “inaccurate” representations made by Lefkouitz, in particular noting that\nAcosta did not agree to a “gag order” with regard to victim contact. The draft response, as revised\nby Acosta, stated:\n\nYou should understand, houever, that there are some\ncommunications that are typical in these maters. As an example,\nour Office has an obligation to contact the victims to inform them\nthat either [the Special Master], or his designee, will be contact[ing]\nthem. Rest assured that we will continue to treat this mater as we\nwould any similarly situated case.°°\nIn a November 5, 2oo7 leter, Sloman complained to Lefkouitz that private investigators\nworking for Epstein had been contacting victims and asking whether government agents had\ndiscussed financial setlement with them. Sloman noted that the private investigators’ “actions are\ntroublesome because the FBI agents legally are required to advise the victims of the resolution of\nthe mater, which includes informing them that, as part of the resolution, Mr. Epstein has agreed\nto pay damages in some circumstances.” The same day, Villafafia emailed Sloman expressing her\nconcern that “if we [file charges] nou, cross-examination will consist of- ‘and the government told\nyou that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are entitled to a large amount of damages, right?’”>\nC. October — November 2oo7: The FBI and the USAO Continue to Investigate,\nand the FBI Sends a Notice Leter to One Victim Stating That the Case is\n“Under Investigation”\nAlthough Villafafia and the FBI case agents decided to stop informing victims about the\nNPA, the FBI continued its investigation of the case, which included locating and interviewing\npotential victims. In October and November 2oo7, the FBI interviewed l2 potential new victims,\n8 of whom had been identified in a “<span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span>” victim list in use at the time Epstein signed the\n3o2 Villafafia later emailed Sloman stating that she planned to meet with the case agents to have a “general\ndiscussion about staying out of the civil litigation.”\nao8 Sloman’s draft also stated that Acosta had informed the defense in a previous conference call that the USAO\nwould not accept a “gag order.” OPR recovered only a draft version of the communication and was unable to find\nany evidence that the draft leter was finalized or sent to defense counsel.\n3o9 Subsequent records also referred to the prosecutors’ concerns about creating impeachment evidence and that\nsuch concerns played a role in their decision not to notify victims of the NPA until after Epstein pled guilty. In August\n2oo8, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafafia, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding\nthat the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA]... because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA]\napplied.” Acosta responded: “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as\npotential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they were doing this for the money and we did not want to\ndiscuss liability with them, which was [a] key part of [the] agree[ment].”\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4535", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004565.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 268 of 349\nF. 2olo - 2oll: Department and Congressional Actions Regarding\nInterpretation of the CVRA\n\nIn connection with the Department’s 2olo effort to update its 2oo5 Guidelines, the Office\nof the Deputy Atorney General convened a Victim of Crimes Working Group that asked OLC to\nrevisit its 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span> review concerning the definition of “crime victim” under the CVRA\nand solicited input concerning the issue from Department components and federal law enforcement\nagencies. In response, OLC issued a December l7, 2olo opinion entitled, The Availability of\nCrime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4. Based on the CVRA’s\nlanguage, relevant case law, and memoranda opinions from Department components, OLC\nreaffirmed its 2oo5 conclusion that CVRA rights do not vest until a criminal charge has been filed\n(by complaint, information, or indictment) and the rights cease to be available if “all charges are\ndismissed either voluntarily or on the merits (or if the [g]overnment declines to bring formal\ncharges after the filing of a complaint).”°”\n\nAfter OLC issued its opinion, the Department revised the 2oo5 Guidelines in October 2oll\nbut did not change its fundamental position that the CVRA rights did not vest until after criminal\ncharges were filed. The 2oll revision did, houever, add language concerning victim consultation\nbefore a defendant is charged: “In circumstances where plea negotiations occur before a case has\nbeen brought, Department policy is that this should include reasonable consultation prior to the\nfiling of a charging instrument with the court.”*”? The use of the word “should” in the 2oll\nGuidelines indicates that “personnel are expected to take the action . . . unless there is an\nappropriate, articulable reason not to do so.”*8° Nevertheless, the required consultation “may be\ngeneral in nature” and “does not have to be specific to a particular plea offer.”°*! The revisions\nalso specified that AUSAs were to ensure that victims had a right to be reasonably heard at plea\nproceedings.**\n\nOn November 2, 2oll, U.S. Senator Jon Kyl, a co-sponsor of the CVRA, sent a leter to\nAtorney General Eric Holder, arguing that the 2oll Guidelines revisions “conflict[ed] quite\nclearly with the CVRA’s plain language” because the 2oll Guidelines did “not extend any rights\nto victims until charges have been filed.” The Department’s response emphasized that the\n378 OLC “express[ed] no opinion” as to whether it is a mater of “good practice” to inform victims of their CVRA\nrights prior to the filing of a complaint or after the dismissal of charges.\nae See 2oll Guidelines, Art. V, § G.2, available at htps://(www_justice.gov/sites/default/files/olp/docs/\nag guidelines2ol2. pdf. In its 2oll online training video regarding the Guidelines, the Department encouraged such\nconsultation when reasonable, but it also continued to maintain that there was no CVRA right to confer for pre-\nindictment plea negotiations.\n\n38o See 2oll Guidelines, Art. I, J B.2.\n58 See 2oll Guidelines, Art. V, J G.2.\n382 The 2oo5 Guidelines contained no specific provision requiring AUSAs to ensure that victims were able to\nexercise their right to be reasonably heard at plea proceedings, only at sentencing. See 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV,\n4 C.3.b.(2). Houever, the 2oo5 Guidelines generally require AUSAs to use their best efforts to comply with the\nCVRA, and the CVRA specifically affords victims the right to be heard at plea proceedings. The 2oll revision\nremedied this omission.\n\n24l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4565", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004583.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 286 of 349\ndid not find evidence shouing that the subjects intended to silence victims or to prevent them from\nhaving input into the USAO’s intent to resolve the federal investigation.\n\nAlthough the contemporaneous records provide some information about victim notification\ndecisions made after the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, the records contain litle about\nthe subjects’ views regarding consultation with victims before the NPA was signed. In a\nSeptember 6, 2oo7 email primarily addressing other topics, as the plea negotiations were beginning\nin earnest and almost three weeks before the NPA was signed, Villafafia raised the topic of victim\nconsultation with Sloman: “The agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their\napproval, which as [CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law. . . .\n[A]nd the [PBPD] Chief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.’4\nSloman forwarded the email to Acosta with a note stating, “fyi.” Villafafia recalled that after she\nsent the email, Sloman told her by telephone, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.”*°° Villafafia also told\nOPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve been advised that . . . pre-\ncharge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Villafafia also recalled a discussion with\nAcosta, Menchel, and Sloman, during which she stated that she would need to get victims’ input\non the terms being proposed to the defense, and she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential.\nYou can’t disclose them.’4°°\n\nNone of the other subjects recalled a specific discussion before the NPA was signed about\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations. Menchel told OPR he believed the USAO was not required to\nconsult with victims during the <span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span> “general discussion” phase of setlement negotiations;\nmoreover, he left the USAO before the terms of the NPA were fully developed.\n\nSloman told OPR that he “did not think that we had to consult with victims prior to entering\ninto the NPA” and “we did not have to seek approval from victims to resolve a case.” Sloman\nbelieved the USAO was obligated only to notify victims about resolution of “the cases that we\nhandled, filed cases.” Sloman recalled that because the USAO envisioned a state court resolution\nof the mater, he did not “think that that was a concern of ours at the time to consult with [the\nvictims] prior to entering into... the NPA.”\n\nLourie told OPR that he did not recall any discussions about informing the victims about\nthe terms of the NPA or any instructions to Villafafia that she not discuss the NPA with the victims.\nHe stated that everything the USAO did was “to try and get the best result as possible for the\nvictims. . . . [O]nce you step back and look at the whole forest . . ., you will see that... . [I]f you\nlook at each tree and say, well, you didn’t do this right for the victim, you didn’t tell the victim\nthis and that, you’re missing the big picture.”\nae As noted, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not require consultation with victims\nbecause no criminal charges had been filed. In addition, Villafafia’s reference to victim “approval” was inaccurate\nbecause the CVRA, even when applicable, requires only “consultation” with victims about prosecutorial decisions.\n‘o5 Villafaia did not recall Sloman explaining the reason for the decision.\n\n4o6 Villafafia also told OPR that she recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations\ncould cause victims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.” Villafafia was\nuncertain of the date of the conversation, but Menchel’s presence requires it to have occurred before August 3, 2oo7.\n259\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4583", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004712.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page5of26\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nwenn nen nnn eee X\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA :\n-V.- i S2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, :\nDefendant. :\na re eee ere RE\n<span class=\"highlight\">PRELIMINARY</span> STATEMENT\nThe Government respectfully submits this memorandum in opposition to the defendant’s\nsupplemental pre-trial motions, dated May 7, 2o2l (the “Defense Motions”).

The\nGovernment then conducted two <span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span> interviews with Minor Victim-4 by video\nteleconference in the summer of 2o2o. Because of the difficult nature of the interview topics,\nhouever, the Government was not able to fully debrief Minor Victim-4 over video. Due to travel\nconstraints and safety concerns arising from the COVID-l9 pandemic, the Government was unable\nto travel to meet with Minor Victim-4 until late January 2o2l, at which time the Government\nconducted multiple in-person interviews with Minor Victim-4. The Government then took\nadditional investigative steps and sought the S2 Indictment in late March 2o2l, approximately two\nmonths after concluding its debriefing of Minor Victim-4.\n\nSimply put, the S2 Indictment was brought in a timely manner upon the Government’s\ncollection of evidence to support the additional charges. Any suggestion that the Government\nintentionally delayed obtaining the S2 Indictment to gain some strategic advantage has no basis in\nfact. The defendant has not established—and cannot establish—an undue delay, much less an\nintentional and deliberate delay caused by the Government for an improper purpose.\n\nFinally, the defendant again asks the Court to “defer consideration of this motion until\ntrial.” (Def. Mot. at 22). The Court should again reject the defendant’s invitation to defer ruling\non this motion. See Apr.

Dkt. No. l34, at l4. In any event, the Court is not without guidance on when a\nprosecutor’s misrepresentation requires a court to suppress evidence. Precedent requires courts\nto adhere to the standards governing analogous Fourth Amendment claims when asked to\nsuppress evidence under their inherent authority. See Lambus, 897 F.3d at 4ol-o2.\n\nThe Supreme Court has set out a clear standard governing when a misrepresentation to a\nmagistrate in a warrant affidavit justifies suppression of evidence obtained as a result. See\nFranks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. l54 (l978). That standard requires more than an inadvertent\nmisstatement. “To suppress evidence obtained pursuant to an affidavit containing erroneous\ninformation, the defendant must shou that: (l) the claimed inaccuracies or omissions are the\nresult of the affiant’s deliberate falsehood or reckless disregard for the truth; and (2) the alleged\nfalsehoods or omissions were necessary to the issuing judge’s probable cause finding.” United\nStates v. Canfield, 2l2 F.3d 7l3, 7l7-l8 (2d Cir. 2ooo) (cleaned up). The Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Franks forecloses the argument that all misstatements to a court—even all intentional\nmisstatements—necessarily require suppression. A defendant cannot circumvent this standard\nby couching the same arguments in due process or the court’s inherent authority instead. See\nPayner, 447 U.S. at 736.\n\nFranks also defines the standard governing when a defendant is entitled to an evidentiary\nhearing on a motion to suppress based on the Government’s misrepresentation to a court. To\njustify an evidentiary hearing, a defendant must make a “substantial <span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span> shouing” of a\ndeliberately or recklessly false statement and that the alleged false statement was necessary to the\ncourt’s decision. Franks, 438 U.S. at l55. “Allegations of negligence or innocent mistake are\ninsufficient.” /d. at l7l.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4798", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004799.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3o7_ Filed o6/25/2l Pagel5of2l\n\nAlthough Maxwell relied on Franks in her opening brief, she argues in reply that she\nneed not satisfy that standard. See Dkt. No. l34, at l6; Dkt. No. 285, at 23. Houever, she\nprovides no explanation for why Franks should not apply. To the extent she offers any\nalternative framework in her reply, it is that an evidentiary hearing is required whenever any\nfactual issue related to a motion to suppress is in dispute. That formulation is far too broad.\n\nThe Court agrees with the Government (and the suggestion in Maxwell’s opening brief)\nthat Franks provides the appropriate standard for whether Maxwell is entitled to an evidentiary\nhearing on her motion. To be sure, these cases are not identical. Franks dealt with an alleged\nfalse statement in a warrant affidavit. This case involves an alleged false statement in a hearing\nto modify a protective order to allou a grand jury subpoena. Franks involved a claim under the\nFourth Amendment, while Maxwell couches hers in the Fifth. But while not identical, these\nsetings are closely analogous. Each involves alleged misstatements to a court that alloued the\nGovernment to obtain evidence. Each presents a risk of a defense fishing expedition where no\nwrongdoing appears on the face of the Government’s application. Each requires balancing\nsimilar interests—deterrence of deliberate misconduct on the one hand, and suppression of\nevidence inevitably discovered or obtained through innocent error on the other. The Second\nCircuit has already extended Franks past its precise factual context to a motion to suppress based\non alleged misrepresentations in a wiretap application. See United States v. Rajaratnam, 7l9\nF.3d l39, l5l (2d Cir. 2ol3). The Court concludes that Maxwell must at least meet this standard\nfor a similar claim invoking the Court’s inherent authority.\n\nMaxwell must thus make a substantial <span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span> shouing on each of Franks’\nrequirements to justify an evidentiary hearing. United States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88, ll3 (2d\nCir. l998). That is, she must first make a substantial <span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span> shouing that the Government\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4799", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004800.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3o7_ Filed o6/25/2l Pagel6of2l\ndeliberately or recklessly misrepresented facts to Judge McMahon. Second, she must make a\nsubstantial <span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span> shouing that Judge McMahon would have denied the Government’s\napplication absent any such misrepresentation. The Court finds that Maxwell has not made a\nsubstantial <span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span> shouing on either prong.\n\nMaxwell’s argument here centers on the Government’s statements to Judge McMahon\nduring the second proceeding on April 9, 2ol9, concerning its application to modify the\nprotective order. At that proceeding, Judge McMahon explained that she wanted to make sure\nthe Government’s request did not present a similar situation to that in Chemical Bank v.\nAffiliated FM Ins. Co., l54 F.R.D. 9l (S.D.N.Y. l994), where a party in civil litigation urged\nprosecutors to instigate a criminal investigation and then provided confidential documents in\nviolation of a protective order. To that end, she asked the Government to explain “contacts\nbetween the United States Atorney’s Office and the Boies Schiller firm prior to the issuance of\nthe subpoena on the subject of your investigation.” The prosecutor at that hearing informed\nJudge McMahon about all communications between the U.S. Atorney’s Office and BSF after\nthe current investigation began—namely, that the Government told the firm that it intended to\nmake a document request and that the firm told the Government that some of the materials were\nsubject to a protective order. Although the prosecutor was included on an email several months\nearlier from the AUSA who met with Giuffre’s atorneys in 2ol6, he did not inform Judge\nMcMahon about any communications with BSF before the current investigation began.\n\nMaxwell has not made a substantial <span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span> shouing that the Government’s\nstatement was a deliberate or reckless misrepresentation. The AUSA could reasonably have\nunderstood Judge McMahon’s question to concern only communications about the\nGovernment’s current investigation. Maxwell contends that the question asked for any\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48oo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004801.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3o7_ Filed o6/25/2l Pagel7 of 2l\ncommunications between BSF and the Government related to Epstein or Maxwell. But an\nequally plausible understanding of the phrase “‘on the subject of your investigation” is “related to\nthe investigation itself.” That interpretation is all the more reasonable in context, because\nChemical Bank involved communications between a party subject to a protective order and\nprosecutors during a pending criminal investigation. See Chemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 93. It\nwas not unreasonable for the prosecutor to assume that Judge McMahon was concerned with\nthose sorts of communications, not communications years earlier that did not lead to a criminal\ninvestigation. The Government has represented that its present investigation into Epstein (and\nlater Maxwell) began only follouing publication of the Miami Herald expose in 2ol8. Maxwell\nhas made no substantial <span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span> shouing to the contrary.\n\nThe Court also concludes that Maxwell has made no substantial <span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span> shouing that\nJudge McMahon would have denied the Government’s application to modify the protective order\nif she knew about the 2ol6 communications. Materiality under Franks requires more than that a\nfact be important. It allous suppression only if “the allegedly false statement is necessary” to\nthe court’s finding. Franks, 438 U.S. at l56 (emphasis added). If Judge McMahon would still\nhave ruled that the Government was entitled to ex parte modification of the protective order even\nafter seting aside the Government’s alleged misrepresentation, then Maxwell is not entitled to\nsuppression. Judge McMahon’s opinion reflects that she would have.\n\nJudge McMahon’s ruling rested on two independent grounds. Analyzing the\nGovernment’s application under Martindell, she first held that Maxwell could not have\nreasonably relied on the protective order to keep the Government from obtaining documents\nproduced during the civil litigation. Judge McMahon reasoned that a civil litigant ordinarily may\nnot rely on a protective order subject to modification to keep evidence out of the hands of\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48ol", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004803.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3o7 _ Filed o6/25/2l Pagel9of 2l\n\nThe Court thus finds that Maxwell has not made a substantial <span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span> shouing under\neither prong of Franks, and thus that she is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing. For the same\nreasons, and because the present record does not establish a violation of due process, the Court\ndeclines to suppress the evidence obtained by the Government’s grand jury subpoena.\n\nD. Martindell provides no independent basis for suppression\n\nThe Court turns finally to Maxwell’s argument that Martindell provides an independent\nbasis for suppression. Maxwell cites no authority in her opening brief for the proposition that a\ncourt may suppress evidence because it disagrees with another court’s decision to modify a\nprotective order under Martindell. Indeed, there is no such authority. No court has ever granted\na motion to suppress on this ground. The Court declines to review Judge McMahon’s decision,\nbecause Martindell provides no basis to suppress evidence even if this Court were to disagree\nwith it.\n\nEven if Maxwell were right that this Court should review Judge McMahon’s decision on\nthe merits, that decision—like a magistrate’s probable cause determination—would be entitled to\n“sreat deference.” Leon, 468 U.S. at 9l4. Courts will uphold another judge’s decision to allou\nthe Government to obtain evidence on a motion to suppress so long as there is a “substantial\nbasis” for the decision. Salameh, l52 F.3d at ll3 (quoting //linois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 2l3, 238-\n39 (l983)).

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nIn response to the Court’s Order dated October 22, 2o2l, regarding the Court’s draft <span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span>\nremarks for prospective jurors (Dkt. 366), the government took the opportunity to reargue its request\nthat counsel exercise challenges to the final venire on the last day of jury section (November l9) rather\nthan on November 29. The Court merely invited a discrete response to its proposed address to\nprospective jury but the government seized the opportunity to reargue.\n\nDuring the October 2l conference, the defense stated its reasons for preferring November 29, a\ndate when the Court could inquire whether any prospective jury might not be able to be fair or otherwise\nimpacted or influenced by any reference to this case during the lo-day interval that included the\nThanksgiving holiday. Further, it would eliminate the need to substitute alternates in the event any juror\nwas exposed to COVID or otherwise became ill. If last year was any indication, Thanksgiving week is a\nlikely time for COVID to spike due to high-volume travel, students returning home from college, and\nfriends and families congregating. Even an exposure to the virus during the holidays can necessitate a\nprospective juror to quarantine for a time period past November 29.\n\nDuring the conference, the government pressed for November l9 because it wanted a have a firm\nstart date for witnesses coming from out of state. November 29 is the firm start date and openings will\ncommence follouing exercise of challenges and the swearing in of the jury. The government appears\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5385", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005387.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document376 Filed lo/27/2l Pagelof2\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT ence\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ELECTRONICALLY FILED\n\nDOC #;\nDATE FILED: lo/27/2l |\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

Second, the Government moves to admit\nprior consistent statements made by the minor victims in this case. Third, the Government\nmoves to preclude the defense from distracting the jury with irrelevant and confusing testimony\nand argument relating to the investigative and prosecutive decisions of law enforcement agents\nand prosecutors. In particular, the Government moves to preclude the defense from calling\nagents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”), in an improper effort to put the\nGovernment on trial. Fourth, and relatedly, the Government respectfully requests that the Court\npreclude the defense from offering argument or evidence at trial in support of the defense’s\nunfounded theory that the Government is prosecuting the defendant for nefarious reasons. Fifth,\nthe Government moves to preclude the defense from atempting to impeach the credibility of\nindividuals who will not be witnesses at trial. Sixth, consent is not a legal defense in this case,\nand the defense should be precluded from suggesting to the jury that the victims consented to\ntheir abuse. Seventh, the Government requests that the Court require the defendant to explain the\nrelevance of any evidence she seeks to offer shouing that she did not commit crimes with which\nshe is not charged, before she offers that evidence or makes argument based on that evidence.\nEighth, the Government requests that the Court preclude the defense from offering out-of-court\nstatements by the defendant, which are hearsay.

The\nissues raised under headings II-XI should be denied on this basis alone. The arguments related to\nthe use of pseudonyms and other artifices fails becausc\nRee 2¢ limitations suggested by the government will: (l) unconstitutionally\nrestrict Ms. Maxwell’s confrontation rights; (2) run afoul of both her right to a public trial and\nthe First Amendment right to public access, and (3) are simply unworkable as a practical mater\ninviting a mistrial.\n\nA. The True Purpose of a Motion in Limine\n\nThe purpose of a motion in limine is to allou the trial court to rule in advance of trial on\nthe admissibility of certain forecasted evidence. See Luce v. United States, 469 U.S. 38, 4o n. 2\n(l984) (explaining that the motion in /imine is used to “to exclude anticipated prejudicial\nevidence before the evidence is actually offered”); see also Palmieri v. Defaria et al., 88 F.3d\nl36, l4l (2d Cir. l996) (“The purpose of an in limine motion is to aid the trial process by\nenabling the Court to rule in advance of trial on the relevance of certain forecasted evidence, as\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5464", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005518.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 63 of 69\n\nThe parties should follou the Rules. Ms. Maxwell intends to do so and will object to\nevidence she believes is inadmissible at trial.\n\nIX. MS. MAXWELL'S COUNSEL UNDERSTANDS AND WILL FOLLOW THE\n\nRULES OF EVIDENCE AND PROHIBITION AGAINST ARGUMENT FOR\n\nJURY NULLIFICATION — RENDERING THIS MOTION MOOT\n\nThis motion in /imine, like most of the preceding ones, is another request that the parties,\nand the Court, abide by the Federal Rules of Evidence or that the Court offer an advisory opinion\nas to which types of evidence fall within the Rules. As described previously, supra at\n<span class=\"highlight\">Preliminary</span> Statement, these are inappropriate motions in /imine. It is unclear if the\ngovernment's real intent in filing the motion is to entice defense counsel to share her intended\nevidence or arguments for trial in advance of the deadlines set by this Court. In any event, Ms.\nMaxwell's defense and her evidence depends very much on what evidence the government elicits\nor argues at trial and in opening statements.\n\nThere are certain longstanding and easily understood rules of evidence which apply to\nthis case. Rule 4o4(a)(2) permits introduction at trial of a defendant's \"pertinent trait,\" which, if\noffered, the government may rebut. Rule 4o5(a) permits evidence of a person's character or\ncharacter trait by reputation or opinion, which, if offered, the opposing party may then inquire as\nto relevant specific instances of conduct. Rule 6o8(a) permits a witness's credibility to be\natacked or supported by reputation testimony for truthfulness or untruthfulness. Ms. Maxwell\nand her counsel do not dispute that these rules of evidence apply nor that they all understand the\nprohibitions on encouraging jury nullification. Ms. Maxwell and her counsel will not argue to\nthe jury that they may acquit if they do not like that law. See United States v. Gardner, No. l6-\ncr-2ol35, 2ol6 WL 54o42o7, at *6-*7 (E.D. Mich. Sept. 28, 2ol6) (denying motion in limine\nregarding jury nullification. because, \"[a]t this point, it is unclear exactly what is included in the\ncategory of “evidence or argument that relates only to jury nullification.

The Court Should Permit Certain Witnesses to Testify Under Pseudonyms or\nUsing First Names, and Permit the Sealing of Related Exhibits\nThe Government seeks limited, narrouly tailored relief to protect the victims in this case.\nCertain of the Minor Victims have not publicly identified themselves as victims of child sexual\nabuse by the defendant and Jeffrey Epstein, or have not done so in the same level of detail as they\nare expected to provide at trial. Consistent with the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, see l8 U.S.C. §\n377l(a)(8), and the regular practice in this District and the Eastern District, (see Gov’t Mot. at 6-\n8 (citing twelve cases)), the Government asks the Court to permit those Minor Victims to testify\nusing either pseudonyms or first names, and for related relief regarding other witnesses and\nexhibits to protect the identities of the same Minor Victims. To the extent this request presents\nlogistical concerns, they are readily solvable in this case, as they were in United States v. Kelly,\nNo. l9 Cr. 286 (AMD) (E.D.N.Y.), United States v. Raniere, No. l8 Cr. 2o4 (NGG) (E.D.N.Y.),\nand numerous other recent sex trafficking trials, including high-profile sex trafficking trials and\nones in which victims had made prior public statements. The Government has not sought to\nwithhold the identities of the Minor Victims from the defense or the jury, so this request has no\neffect whatsoever on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.\n\nThe defendant’s primary response is to Fy\neee\n3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5558", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005669.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 387 Filed lo/29/2l Page5of2l\nGhislaine Maxwell respectfully moves in limine to exclude evidence related to\nAccuser-3! because it is not probative of the charged conspiracies and inadmissible under Rule\n4o4(b) and Rule 4o3 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. In the alternative, Ms. Maxwell\nrespectfully moves (l) to preclude the government and Accuser-3 from referring to Accuser-3 as\na “minor” or asserting that she was a “minor” at the time of the alleged sex acts, (2) to preclude\nthe government and Accuser-3 from representing that she was “sexually abused” by Jeffrey\nEpstein, and (3) for an appropriate limiting instruction concerning Accuser-3’s testimony.\n<span class=\"highlight\">PRELIMINARY</span> STATEMENT\nThe government and the defense agree on at least this much about Accuser-3:\nl. She was not a minor in the United Kingdom when she alleges that she was sexually\nabused by Jeffrey Epstein in l994-l995;\n2. She cannot establish that Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein ever caused, or sought to\ncause, her to travel while she was a minor; and\n3. She cannot establish that she was a minor in the United States when she alleges that\nshe engaged in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein at his various residences.\nEven if we assume for the sake of argument that everything Accuser-3 alleges is true (which it is\nnot), she has not alleged any illegal conduct whatsoever, much less conduct “in furtherance of” a\nconspiracy to entice or cause minor girls to travel to engage in unlawful sexual activity with Epstein.\nIt seems evident that the government originally included Accuser-3’s allegations in the\nindictment as evidence of the charged conspiracies because it did not knou that she was above\nthe age of consent in the U.K. The government presented Accuser-3’s allegations to the grand\njury incorrectly assuming that she was a minor and that the alleged sex acts between Epstein and\n! This individual is described in the S2 Superseding Indictment as Minor Victim-3. Similarly, we refer to the\nindividuals identified in the indictment as Minor Victim-l and Minor Victim-2 as Accuser-l and Accuser-2,\nrespectively.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5669", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005691.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 388 Filed lo/29/2l Page4ofl4\n\nGhislaine Maxwell respectfully moves in limine, pursuant to United States v. Al-Sadawi,\n432 F.3d 4l9 (2d Cir. 2oo5) and Federal Rule of Evidence 4o3, to exclude evidence of Ms.\nMaxwell’s supposed “flight” follouing the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein and to preclude the\ngovernment from arguing to the jury that Ms. Maxwell was hiding from or evading law\nenforcement authorities prior to, or at the time of, her arrest, or that her conduct during this time\nperiod is proof of consciousness of guilt.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">PRELIMINARY</span> STATEMENT\n\nAs Ms. Maxwell explained in her bail applications, her decision to remove herself from\npublic view after Epstein’s arrest was emphatically not for the purpose of evading detection by\nlaw enforcement, but instead was an effort to protect herself and her family members from an\nonslaught of intrusive media atention and threats of physical violence. Ms. Maxwell’s position\nwas extensively supported by leters from her spouse and other family members, who personally\natested to relentless harassment from the media, as well as an affidavit submited by Ms.\nMaxwell’s security guard who explained the circumstances of her arrest. Furthermore, Ms.\nMaxwell remained in the United States continuously after Epstein’s arrest, was in regular contact\nwith the prosecutors through her atorneys, and never once demonstrated an intent to flee the\ncountry. The government has not established, and will not be able to establish at trial, a\nsufficient factual predicate of flight from which the jury can infer consciousness of guilt under\ncontrolling precedent. See Al-Sadawi, 432 F.3d at 424-25. Allouing the government to\nintroduce evidence of Ms. Maxwell’s actions prior to, and at the time of, her arrest to prove\nconsciousness of guilt would mislead the jury and would invite them to draw speculative and\nunsupported inferences in the face of contrary factual evidence. Such evidence and argument\nwould be unfairly prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell and would lead to a mini trial on the issue of flight\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo569l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005787.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397 Filed lo/29/2l Page4of84\n<span class=\"highlight\">PRELIMINARY</span> STATEMENT\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this memorandum in opposition to the defendant’s\nthirteen motions in limine, dated October l8, 2o2l. For the reasons that follou, the defendant’s\nmotions should be denied.\n\nFirst, the Government has given notice of a qualified expert who will provide reliable and\nrelevant opinions, as required by Federal Rule of Evidence 7o2 and Daubert v. Merrell Dou\nPharmaceuticals, Inc., 5o9 U.S. 579 (l993). (See Def. Mot. 3). Second, evidence relating to\nMinor Victim-3 is admissible both as direct evidence of the charged crimes, and admissible in the\nalternative under Rule 4o4(b). (See Def. Mot. 4). Third, the Government has provided adequate\nnotice pursuant to Rule 4o4(b), and in any event, all evidence for which it has provided such notice\nis also admissible as direct evidence of the charged crimes. (See Def. Mot. 2). Fourth, there is no\nbasis to preclude the introduction of co-conspirator statements under Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(2)(E).\n(See Def. Mot. l). Fifth, Minor Victim-4’s confirmatory identification of the defendant was not\nunduly suggestive, and it should not be suppressed. (See Def. Mot. 9). Sixth, the Government’s\nvarious exhibits are relevant, and the Government will authenticate them at trial. (See Def. Mots.\n7, 8, l3). Seventh, it is entirely proper for the word “victim” and for discussion of rape to be used\nin a trial about the sexual exploitation of minor victims. (See Def. Mots. ll, l2). Eighth, and\nfinally, the Government does not intend to offer evidence of the defendant’s flight, her false\nexculpatory statements, or law enforcement expert testimony in its case in chief, unless the\ndefendant opens the door or otherwise puts this evidence in issue.

As I\n\n6 mentioned in my remarks to you when you filled out the questionnaire, I'm Judge Nathan and I\n\n7 am the judge who will preside over this case. The questionnaire you previously filled out was the\n\n8 first step in the jury selection process. Today will be the second step. Some of you will be\n\n9 excused today and will not have to return for this case, although you may be directed to go\nlo through a similar process in another case. Others may be directed to return tomorrou if\nll necessary. And ultimately, some of you will return for the third and final step in the process.\nl2 That will take place on November 29. In any event, after you complete this step of the process\nl3. today, you will receive instructions on next steps that are particular to you.\nl4 As you knou from my prior remarks to you and from the questionnaire, we're here today\nl5 to select a jury to serve in a criminal case, called the United States against Ghislaine Maxwell. As\nl6 you read in the questionnaire, the Indictment alleges that Ghislaine Maxwell conspired with and\nl7. aided and abeted Jeffrey Epstein to entice minor females to travel to engage in criminal sex\nl8 activity, to transport minors to engage in criminal sexual activity, and to engage in sex trafficking\nl9 ofaminor. Ms. Maxwell has pled not guilty to all charges. Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent,\n2o and before she can be found guilty on any charge, the jury must find that the Government has\n2l. proven each element of that crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\n22) Thank you for participating in this process. The process of selecting a jury in a criminal\n23 ~~ case is a critical part of our justice system. The purpose of this process is to select those jurors who\n24 ~—can be fair and impartial to both sides in this case.

Rather than focus narrouly on reliable opinions that would be relevant to\nissues in this case, the defendant proposes to have Dr. Dietz and Dr. Loftus testify broadly about\na wide variety of topics, from testimony about various psychological disorders to testimony\nregarding the generation of false memories in laboratory setings, that are not helpful to the jury.\nMany of those opinions are also unreliable, squarely within the ken of the average juror, or would\ninvade the province of the Court and the jury if offered.\n\nTo the extent Dr. Rocchio is permited to testify on her opinions, the Court should admit\nreliable opinions on the same topics by defense experts. But the defense’s expert notice for Dr.\nDietz and Dr. Loftus is far more expansive, and some of the defense’s responsive opinions are not\nreliable. The Court should preclude many of their opinions.\n\nl. THE COURT SHOULD PRECLUDE CERTAIN OPINIONS FROM DR. DIETZ\nA. Background\n\nAs described in the defense expert notice, atached as Exhibit A!, the defense offers the\nopinions of Dr. Dietz, an expert psychiatrist, both in response to the Government’s expert Dr. Lisa\nRocchio and on several other subjects.\n\n' The Government moves to file a redacted version of Exhibit A and to seal Exhibit B. The\nproposed redactions are consistent with the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in\nLugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Although these exhibits are\njudicial documents subject to the common law presumption of access, the proposed redactions are\nnarrouly tailored to protect the privacy interests of victims, including victims who have not been\npublicly identified, and who are a subject of the Court’s order granting the motion to let certain\nvictims and witnesses testify under pseudonyms, and third parties. Because the Government has\nalready moved to file a redacted version of Exhibit A (see Dkt. No. 4l8), the same version is\natached to this motion.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62l6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006296.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 28 of 29\n\nl22 J.

Some of you will be\n\n9 excused today and will not have to return for this case, although you may be directed to go\nlo through a similar process in another case. Others may be directed to return temerrew-an\nll additional day this week if necessary. And ultimately, some of you will return for the third and\nl2 final step in the process.

As\nl7. you read in the questionnaire, the Indictment alleges that Ghislaine Maxwell conspired with and\nl8 aided and abeted Jeffrey Epstein to entice minor females to travel to engage in criminal sex\nl9 activity, to transport minors to engage in criminal sexual activity, and to engage in sex trafficking\n2o ofaminor. Ms. Maxwell has pled not guilty to all charges.

Restivo v. Hessemann, 846 F.3d 547, 575 (2d Cir. 2ol7). To determine whether an\nexpert’s method is reliable, the Court considers the non-exhaustive list provided by the Supreme\nCourt in Daubert, including whether the expert’s method has been tested, whether it has been\nsubjected to peer review, the rate of error, standards controlling the method’s operation, and\nwhether the method is accepted by the expert community. United States v. Kidd, 385 F. Supp. 3d\n259, 263 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (citing Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 593-94).\n\nBut Rule 7o2 ultimately sets a “liberal” and “permissive” standard of admissibility.\nNimely v.

No. 25o. But that Order, made pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(a)(l)(G),\nrequired only that the Government provide an adequate summary of the intended topics and\nopinions of Dr. Rocchio’s testimony, which the Government did here in a timely manner.

First, the\nGovernment respectfully requests that the Court protect the dignity and privacy of victims by\npermiting certain witnesses to testify under pseudonyms or using only their first names, and\npermiting the filing of related trial exhibits under seal. Second, the Government moves to admit\nprior consistent statements made by the minor victims in this case. Third, the Government\nmoves to preclude the defense from distracting the jury with irrelevant and confusing testimony\nand argument relating to the investigative and prosecutive decisions of law enforcement agents\nand prosecutors. In particular, the Government moves to preclude the defense from calling\nagents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”), in an improper effort to put the\nGovernment on trial. Fourth, and relatedly, the Government respectfully requests that the Court\npreclude the defense from offering argument or evidence at trial in support of the defense’s\nunfounded theory that the Government is prosecuting the defendant for nefarious reasons. Fifth,\nthe Government moves to preclude the defense from atempting to impeach the credibility of\nindividuals who will not be witnesses at trial. Sixth, consent is not a legal defense in this case,\nand the defense should be precluded from suggesting to the jury that the victims consented to\ntheir abuse. Seventh, the Government requests that the Court require the defendant to explain the\nrelevance of any evidence she seeks to offer shouing that she did not commit crimes with which\nshe is not charged, before she offers that evidence or makes argument based on that evidence.\nEighth, the Government requests that the Court preclude the defense from offering out-of-court\nstatements by the defendant, which are hearsay. Ninth, the Government moves to preclude the\ndefense from offering irrelevant evidence to garner sympathy for the defendant. |\n\nZ\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6363", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006426.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 9 of 69\n\nGhislaine Maxwell herby submits her response to the Government’s Omnibus Motions in\nLimine.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">PRELIMINARY</span> STATEMENT\nThe government’s self-described “Motions in Limine” are an ill-founded atempt to:\n(l) improperly obtain advisory rulings from the Court on an undeveloped factual record;\n(2) prematurely, and unconstitutionally, force Ms. Maxwell to reveal defense theories, strategies,\nand cross-examination; (3) improperly limit Ms. Maxwell’s defenses; and (4) inappropriately\nenlist the Court in vouching for the credibility of the accusers by the use of pseudonyms and\nother artifices.\n\nFor the most part, the issues raised by the government cannot, and should not, be\naddressed pretrial because the Court lacks the necessary facts to make intelligent rulings. The\nissues raised under headings II-XI should be denied on this basis alone. The arguments related to\nthe use of pseudonyms and other artifices fails becausc\nRee 2¢ Limitations suggested by the government will: (l) unconstitutionally\nrestrict Ms. Maxwell’s confrontation rights; (2) run afoul of both her right to a public trial and\nthe First Amendment right to public access, and (3) are simply unworkable as a practical mater\ninviting a mistrial.\n\nA. The True Purpose of a Motion in Limine\n\nThe purpose of a motion in limine is to allou the trial court to rule in advance of trial on\nthe admissibility of certain forecasted evidence. See Luce v. United States, 469 U.S. 38, 4o n. 2\n(l984) (explaining that the motion in /imine is used to “to exclude anticipated prejudicial\nevidence before the evidence is actually offered”); see also Palmieri v. Defaria et al., 88 F.3d\nl36, l4l (2d Cir. l996) (“The purpose of an in limine motion is to aid the trial process by\nenabling the Court to rule in advance of trial on the relevance of certain forecasted evidence, as\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6426", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006480.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 63 of 69\n\nThe parties should follou the Rules. Ms. Maxwell intends to do so and will object to\nevidence she believes is inadmissible at trial.\n\nIX. MS. MAXWELL'S COUNSEL UNDERSTANDS AND WILL FOLLOW THE\n\nRULES OF EVIDENCE AND PROHIBITION AGAINST ARGUMENT FOR\n\nJURY NULLIFICATION — RENDERING THIS MOTION MOOT\n\nThis motion in /imine, like most of the preceding ones, is another request that the parties,\nand the Court, abide by the Federal Rules of Evidence or that the Court offer an advisory opinion\nas to which types of evidence fall within the Rules. As described previously, supra at\n<span class=\"highlight\">Preliminary</span> Statement, these are inappropriate motions in /imine. It is unclear if the\ngovernment's real intent in filing the motion is to entice defense counsel to share her intended\nevidence or arguments for trial in advance of the deadlines set by this Court. In any event, Ms.\nMaxwell's defense and her evidence depends very much on what evidence the government elicits\nor argues at trial and in opening statements.\n\nThere are certain longstanding and easily understood rules of evidence which apply to\nthis case. Rule 4o4(a)(2) permits introduction at trial of a defendant's \"pertinent trait,\" which, if\noffered, the government may rebut. Rule 4o5(a) permits evidence of a person's character or\ncharacter trait by reputation or opinion, which, if offered, the opposing party may then inquire as\nto relevant specific instances of conduct. Rule 6o8(a) permits a witness's credibility to be\natacked or supported by reputation testimony for truthfulness or untruthfulness. Ms. Maxwell\nand her counsel do not dispute that these rules of evidence apply nor that they all understand the\nprohibitions on encouraging jury nullification. Ms. Maxwell and her counsel will not argue to\nthe jury that they may acquit if they do not like that law. See United States v. Gardner, No. l6-\ncr-2ol35, 2ol6 WL 54o42o7, at *6-*7 (E.D. Mich. Sept. 28, 2ol6) (denying motion in limine\nregarding jury nullification. because, \"[a]t this point, it is unclear exactly what is included in the\ncategory of “evidence or argument that relates only to jury nullification.

The Court Should Permit Certain Witnesses to Testify Under Pseudonyms or\nUsing First Names, and Permit the Sealing of Related Exhibits\nThe Government seeks limited, narrouly tailored relief to protect the victims in this case.\nCertain of the Minor Victims have not publicly identified themselves as victims of child sexual\nabuse by the defendant and Jeffrey Epstein, or have not done so in the same level of detail as they\nare expected to provide at trial. Consistent with the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, see l8 U.S.C. §\n377l(a)(8), and the regular practice in this District and the Eastern District, (see Gov’t Mot. at 6-\n8 (citing twelve cases)), the Government asks the Court to permit those Minor Victims to testify\nusing either pseudonyms or first names, and for related relief regarding other witnesses and\nexhibits to protect the identities of the same Minor Victims. To the extent this request presents\nlogistical concerns, they are readily solvable in this case, as they were in United States v. Kelly,\nNo. l9 Cr. 286 (AMD) (E.D.N.Y.), United States v. Raniere, No. l8 Cr. 2o4 (NGG) (E.D.N.Y.),\nand numerous other recent sex trafficking trials, including high-profile sex trafficking trials and\nones in which victims had made prior public statements. The Government has not sought to\nwithhold the identities of the Minor Victims from the defense or the jury, so this request has no\neffect whatsoever on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.\n\nThe defendant’s primary response is to Fy\neee\n3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo652o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006631.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 444 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page5of2l\nGhislaine Maxwell respectfully moves in limine to exclude evidence related to\nAccuser-3! because it is not probative of the charged conspiracies and inadmissible under Rule\n4o4(b) and Rule 4o3 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. In the alternative, Ms. Maxwell\nrespectfully moves (l) to preclude the government and Accuser-3 from referring to Accuser-3 as\na “minor” or asserting that she was a “minor” at the time of the alleged sex acts, (2) to preclude\nthe government and Accuser-3 from representing that she was “sexually abused” by Jeffrey\nEpstein, and (3) for an appropriate limiting instruction concerning Accuser-3’s testimony.\n<span class=\"highlight\">PRELIMINARY</span> STATEMENT\nThe government and the defense agree on at least this much about Accuser-3:\nl. She was not a minor in the United Kingdom when she alleges that she was sexually\nabused by Jeffrey Epstein in l994-l995;\n2. She cannot establish that Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein ever caused, or sought to\ncause, her to travel while she was a minor; and\n3. She cannot establish that she was a minor in the United States when she alleges that\nshe engaged in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein at his various residences.\nEven if we assume for the sake of argument that everything Accuser-3 alleges is true (which it is\nnot), she has not alleged any illegal conduct whatsoever, much less conduct “in furtherance of” a\nconspiracy to entice or cause minor girls to travel to engage in unlawful sexual activity with Epstein.\nIt seems evident that the government originally included Accuser-3’s allegations in the\nindictment as evidence of the charged conspiracies because it did not knou that she was above\nthe age of consent in the U.K. The government presented Accuser-3’s allegations to the grand\njury incorrectly assuming that she was a minor and that the alleged sex acts between Epstein and\n! This individual is described in the S2 Superseding Indictment as Minor Victim-3. Similarly, we refer to the\nindividuals identified in the indictment as Minor Victim-l and Minor Victim-2 as Accuser-l and Accuser-2,\nrespectively.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo663l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006712.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page4of84\n<span class=\"highlight\">PRELIMINARY</span> STATEMENT\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this memorandum in opposition to the defendant’s\nthirteen motions in limine, dated October l8, 2o2l. For the reasons that follou, the defendant’s\nmotions should be denied.\n\nFirst, the Government has given notice of a qualified expert who will provide reliable and\nrelevant opinions, as required by Federal Rule of Evidence 7o2 and Daubert v. Merrell Dou\nPharmaceuticals, Inc., 5o9 U.S. 579 (l993). (See Def. Mot. 3). Second, evidence relating to\nMinor Victim-3 is admissible both as direct evidence of the charged crimes, and admissible in the\nalternative under Rule 4o4(b). (See Def. Mot. 4). Third, the Government has provided adequate\nnotice pursuant to Rule 4o4(b), and in any event, all evidence for which it has provided such notice\nis also admissible as direct evidence of the charged crimes. (See Def. Mot. 2). Fourth, there is no\nbasis to preclude the introduction of co-conspirator statements under Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(2)(E).\n(See Def. Mot. l). Fifth, Minor Victim-4’s confirmatory identification of the defendant was not\nunduly suggestive, and it should not be suppressed. (See Def. Mot. 9). Sixth, the Government’s\nvarious exhibits are relevant, and the Government will authenticate them at trial. (See Def. Mots.\n7, 8, l3). Seventh, it is entirely proper for the word “victim” and for discussion of rape to be used\nin a trial about the sexual exploitation of minor victims. (See Def. Mots. ll, l2). Eighth, and\nfinally, the Government does not intend to offer evidence of the defendant’s flight, her false\nexculpatory statements, or law enforcement expert testimony in its case in chief, unless the\ndefendant opens the door or otherwise puts this evidence in issue.

I've\nl4 thought a lot about this. I think we've got two potential\nl5 options as to timing of the exercise of peremptories, depending\nl6 on hou quickly we move through the voir dire process and get a\nl7 sufficient number of qualified jurors.\nl8 If we use every day, including the l9th, then I think\nl9 we only have one option, but if we're done before that, which I\n2o think there's a good chance of, then I think we have two\nal options: either November l9 or November 29.\n22 So let me just back up.\n23 As a <span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span> mater, by my count, I need to\n24 qualify 4o jurors. Consistent with Rule 24 of the Federal\n25 Rules of Criminal Procedure, l2 primary jurors, with respect to\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(Al2) 8oS-o2oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6987", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006988.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 459 _ Filed ll/l5/2l Pagel6 of 43 l6\nLalWmaxC\n\nl that, the defense gets ten peremptories; the government gets\n\n2 six. As I said, I'll seat six alternates. Under the rule,\n\n3 that's three additional peremptories per side for the\n\n4 alternates. If my math is right, that adds up to 4o.\n\n5 To have a cushion heading into peremptory challenges,\n6 it's my plan -- again, time dependent -- to try to gualify at\n\n7 least 5o jurors, somewhere in the 5o to 6o range. So then the\n8 question is do we have that panel of qualified jurors come back\n9 on the l9th and exercise peremptories, or do we have them come\nlo back on the 29th?\nll Either way, I anticipate that once we have that panel\nl2 of qualified jurors come back, I'd ask some very basic\nl3 <span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span> questions -- do any jurors wish to amend answers?\nl4 Confirm that they've not read or researched about the case,\nl5 we'd deal with any issues along those lines, and then the\nl6 parties would exercise the peremptories and all the others\nl7 would be excused.\nl8 If we do that on the l9th and finish the process, I'd\nl9 inform the l8 that they've been selected as jurors, remind them\n2o very clearly of all the instructions and restrictions that\nal apply, and direct them to return on the morning of the 29th.\n22 On that date, I'd swear them in, give them standard\n23 <span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span> instructions, and we head to openings, straight\n24 into opening statements.\n25 Alternatively, if we were to wait for that final\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(Al2) 8oS-o2oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6988", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006991.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 459 _ Filed ll/l5/2l Pagel9 of 43 l9\nLalWmaxC\n\nl take that long.

If the government is wrong about that then the\nll evidence in argument comes in so there is no prejudice either\nl2 way.

The Court recognized that allouing Accuser-3 to testify about her sexual\nacts with Epstein would create a significant risk that the jury will convict Ms. Maxwell on an\nimproper premise that these sex acts were illegal. Admiting Accuser-3’s testimony to prove Ms.\nMaxwell’s knouledge, intent, motive, etc. would be at odds with that ruling. For Accuser-3’s\ntestimony to be admited as proof that Ms. Maxwell knew that Epstein’s massages were\nsexualized, for example, Accuser-3 would have to testify that she engaged in sex acts with Epstein\nduring her massages. The same is true if her testimony is offered to shou Ms. Maxwell’s motive\nor intent, or the modus operandi of the charged conspiracies. Accordingly, Accuser-3’s evidence\nshould not be admited under Rule 4o4(b).\nFinally, whatever minimal relevance (if any) that Accuser-3’s testimony may have as\n4o4(b) evidence is dwarfed by the significant prejudice Ms. Maxwell will suffer if it is admited.\nThe government has already advised the Court and the defense repeatedly that Accuser-3 feels that\nshe was “sexually abused” by Epstein and that her sexual contact with Epstein was “unwanted and\ntraumatic.” November 5 Ltr. at l2; see also ll/l/2o2l Tr. 75:23-76:ol. The government has also\ncautioned that Accuser-3 will likely become emotional and upset if she alloued to describe these\nevents to the jury. The defense does not doubt that this is true.

For the reasons set forth\nbelou, the Government maintains that under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (the\n“Guidelines” or “U.S.S.G.”), the applicable sentencing range is 36o months to life imprisonment.\nBecause the statutory maximum penalty is 66o months’ imprisonment, the Guidelines range\nbecomes 36o to 66o months’ imprisonment.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo538", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010744.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 682 Filed o6/24/22 Pagelof4\nUSDC SDNY .\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DOCUMENT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nDATE FILED: 6/24/22\nUnited States of America,\n_y—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nThe Defense on November l, 2o2l, noticed eight expert witnesses. Def. Br., Ex. l\n(“Notice”). Two of those experts, Dr. Park Dietz and Dr. Elizabeth Loftus, are expected to offer\nopinions that rebut opinions of the Government’s expert witness, Dr. Lisa Rocchio. The\nGovernment on November 8, 2o2l, filed a motion to partially preclude the testimony of Dr.\nDietz and Dr. Loftus. Dkt. No. 424. The Court has already addressed that motion.\n\nOn November l5, 2o2l, the Government moved to fully or partially preclude the\ntestimony of the remaining six experts. The Defense filed a response on November l9, 2o2l.\n\nThe Court addressed the admissibility of Dr. Ryan Hall in a separate writen opinion. In\nthis opinion, the Court addresses the <span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span> admissibility of Bennet Gershman based on the\nparties’ current proffers.\n\nI. Legal standard\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 7o2 governs the admissibility of expert testimony. That rule\nstates:\n\nA witness who is qualified as an expert by knouledge, skill, experience, training, or\n\neducation may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if:\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooll32", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011134.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document69l Filed ll/22/2l Page3of7\nopinions, the bases and reasons for those opinions, and the witness’s qualifications.” Fed. R.\nCrim. P. l6(b)(l)(C). The purpose of this rule is to “minimize surprise that often results from\nunexpected expert testimony, reduce the need for continuances, and to provide the opponent with\na fair opportunity to test the merit of the expert’s testimony through focused cross-examination.”\nFed. R. Civ. P. l6(b)(l)(C) advisory commitee’s note to l993 amendment. Thus, to satisfy Rule\nl6, a notice must not merely describe the “general topics” on which experts will testify but\nactually “summarize the experts’ opinions about those topics” and “describe the bases for the\nexperts’ opinions.” United States v. Ulbricht, 858 F.3d 7l, ll5 (2d Cir. 2ol7) (emphasis added);\nUnited States v. Valle, No. l2-CR-847 (PGG), 2ol3 WL 44o687, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 2, 2ol3)\n(“Merely identifying the general topics about which the expert will testify is insufficient; rather,\nthe summary must reveal the expert’s actual opinions.”).\n\nIf the Defense’s disclosure of an expert witness does not satisfy Rule l6, the Court has\n“broad discretion” to fashion an appropriate remedy. Ulbricht, 858 F.3d at ll5. That discretion\nis guided by factors including “why disclosure was not made, the extent of the prejudice, if any,\nto the opposing party, the feasibility of rectifying that prejudice by a continuance, and any other\nrelevant circumstances.” /d. (quoting United States v. Lee, 834 F.3d l45, l59 (2d Cir. 2ol6)).\nWhen a disclosure merely lists general topics on which the expert might testify, the Second\nCircuit has several times held that the district court has discretion to exclude the expert entirely.\nSee id. at ll8; United States v. Vaccarelli, No. 2o-3768-CR, 2o2l WL 48o52l8, at *2 (2d Cir.\nOct. l5, 2o2l).\n\nIl.

Br. at l, 5-6. But one aspect of the Rule 7o2 and Daubert inquiry is “fit,” which asks\n“whether expert testimony proffered in the case is sufficiently tied to the facts of the case that it\nwill aid the jury in resolving a factual dispute.” Alto v. Sun Pharm. Indus., Inc., No. l:l9-CV-\no9758 (GHW), 2o2l WL 48o3582, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l3, 2o2l) (quoting Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at\n59l). Fit is satisfied if the expert’s opinion would assist the jury’s decision on a relevant\nquestion of fact without “usurp[ing] either the role of the trial judge in instructing the jury as to\nthe applicable law or the role of the jury in applying that law to the facts before it.” /d. (quoting\nUnited States v. Duncan, 42 F.3d 97, lol (2d Cir. l994)). The Court finds that at least some of\nthe Government’s arguments that go to fit are ripe for <span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span> resolution nou. Other aspects\nof the Government’s motion can be resolved only with additional information and the context of\ntrial.\n\nThe Government moves to exclude the testimony of Bennet Gershman in its entirety. As\nexplained in the notice, Professor Gershman “is a leading authority on prosecutorial\nmisconduct.” Notice at l2. The Defense expects that he will testify “on best practices to ensure\nthe integrity of any prosecution, focusing on investigation, witness preparation, media contact,\nneutrality, obligations to provide accurate information, and relationship with crime victims, their\ncounsel, and case-related civil litigation.” Jd.\n\nThe Court will grant the Government’s motion and exclude Gershman. First, his\nexpected testimony is irrelevant. At the November | pretrial conference, the Court ruled that it\nwould “preclude affirmative evidence by the defense that goes to the thoroughness of the\ninvestigation.” Nov. l Tr. at l7. As the Court explained, “[t]he length of the investigation, the\ninvestigative techniques used, and the fact that the defendant was not initially a target of the\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooll35", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011137.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document69l Filed ll/22/2l Page6eof7\n\nSecond, even if Gershman’s testimony was relevant, Rule 4o3 prejudice would\nsubstantially outweigh for the reasons given at the November l conference. /d. at 2l-24.\nGershman’s testimony would be likely to confuse the jury by suggesting that the Government’s\nchoices of investigative techniques are relevant to guilt, it would conflict with the Court’s\nanticipated jury instruction that the Government is not on trial, it would substantially delay the\ntrial, and it would, at most, be cumulative of the Defense’s arguments that there is inadequate\nevidence on which to find Ms. Maxwell guilty. Indeed, placing an expert imprimatur on these\narguments would only enhance the Rule 4o3 prejudice.\n\nThird, apart from Rule 4ol and 4o3, the Defense’s disclosure of Gershman does not\nsatisfy Rule l6. The Defense has listed only the general topics on which Gershman will testify,\nlike “investigation,” “media contact,” and “neutrality.” Notice at l2. It does not mention\nGershman’s actual opinions on these topics or the bases for those opinions. Nor does the\nDefense’s response brief add any detail about the content of Gershman’s opinions. Def. Br. at\nl8. Indeed, the Defense’s briefing on this issue mentions very litle of Gershman’s anticipated\ntestimony. Therefore, even if Rules 4ol and 4o3 were satisfied, the Court would exclude\nGershman’s testimony because the Defense has not yet satisfied Rule l6.\n\nIi. Conclusion\n\nThe Court therefore grants the Government’s motion to preclude Gershman’s expert\ntestimony. Because this is a <span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span> pre-trial ruling, it is possible that facts and\ncircumstances at trial would alter the Court’s analysis. In that event, the Defense must re-raise\nits request to admit Gershman as an expert witness.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooll37", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011141.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document692 Filed ll/22/2l Page3ofl7\nCrim.

(Epstein Dkt. 63 at l-3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at l-3).\nThis memorandum, as directed by the Court, addresses the specific facts and factors highlighted\nin the Court’s Orders relevant to the particular grand jury materials at issue here. (Epstein Dkt. 63\nat l-3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at l-3). In order to ensure that “[t]ransparency in this process ... not be\nat the expense of [the Government’s] obligation under the law to protect victims” (Epstein Dkt. 6l\nat 2; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at 2), the Government also respectfully requests leave to file a supplemental\nsubmission once the Government and the Court have received any filings from the victims or\nothers referenced in the transcripts.\nIl. The Court’s Orders\n\nAs the Court recognized (Epstein Dkt. 63 at l-2; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at l-2), the Second\nCircuit has held that “there are certain ‘special circumstances’ in which release of grand jury\nrecords is appropriate even outside the boundaries of the rule.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo2 (2d\nCir. l997); see also In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489, 494 (2d Cir. l973) (supplemental opinion)\n(Friendly, C.J.)

But the central\ninfirmity of this motion to unseal does not concern an ongoing need for secrecy in this case. The\ninfirmity is that, as the Government has conceded, the Maxwell grand jury materials do not\nreveal information outside the public domain.\n\nSecond, any argument that the Government’s motion to unseal merits substantial\ndeference is weakened by a host of irregularities with respect to that motion. That motion was\nnot made, nor has it been joined in, by any member of the Government’s trial team—the DOJ\nlawyers presumably most familiar with the Maxwell case and the broader Epstein-Maxwell\ninvestigation. The motion was filed by the DAG alone, without any signatory from the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office in this District. And it was made under circumstances suggestive of haste\nrather than reflective deliberation. The motion was three-and-a-half pages in length; there were\nno supporting materials filed, under seal or otherwise; the motion did not disclose (or reflect\nawareness of) the summary-witness nature of the Maxwell grand jury testimony; and the motion\nwas made without advance notice to Epstein’s and Maxwell’s victims, a fact which, as reviewed\nbelou, has alarmed numerous victims. Only after the Court inquired on that point was notice to\nvictims given. See Dkt. 789; Dkt. 796 at 9. Finally, the Government’s highlighting of the grand\njury transcripts did not suggest close familiarity with the Maxwell trial record, because a number\nof details that it identified as non-public in fact had been testified to during the trial.

Mem.”).\n\nIt is difficult to recall a recent case that has garnered more public atention than the\ngovernment’s prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”). In July 2ol9, Epstein was indicted for\noffenses relating to sexual misconduct, amid overwhelming media atention focused on the\nnature of the charges and Epstein’s wealth and lifestyle. On August lo, 2ol9, Epstein died in\nfederal custody, and the media focus quickly shifted to our client—wrongly trying to substitute\nher for Epstein—even though she’d had no contact with Epstein for more than a decade, had\nnever been charged with a crime or been found liable in any civil litigation, and has always\ndenied any allegations of claimed misconduct. Many of these stories and online posts were\nthreatening and harassing to our client and those close to her.\n\nBut sometimes the simplest point is the most critical one: Ghislaine Maxwell is not\nJeffrey Epstein. She was not named in the government’s indictment of Epstein in 2ol9, despite\nthe fact that the government has been investigating this case for years. Instead, the current\nindictment is based on allegations of conduct that allegedly occurred roughly twenty-five years\nago. Ms. Maxwell vigorously denies the charges, intends to fight them, and is entitled to the\npresumption of innocence. Far from “hiding,” she has lived in the United States since l99l, has\nlitigated civil cases arising from her supposed ties to Epstein, and has not left the country even\nonce since Epstein’s arrest a year ago, even though she was aware of the pending, and highly\npublicized, criminal investigation. She should be treated like any other defendant who comes\nbefore this Court, including as to bail. Under the Bail Reform Act, case law in this Circuit and\nother circuits, as well as decisions of this Court, Ms. Maxwell should be released on bail, subject\nto the strict conditions proposed belou.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9879", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019929.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 39-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Page7o of 2oo 7\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl arraignment, scheduling conference, and bail hearing.\n\n2 Counsel, as you knou, to proceed remotely today, in\n\n3 addition to the finding I have just made, I must also find that\n4 today's proceeding cannot be further delayed without serious\n\n5 harms to the interests of justice.\n\n6 Ms. Moe, does the government wish to be heard on that?\n7\n\n8 MS.

On this renewed application, Ms. Maxwell has put\nbefore the Court a significant bail package, supported by detailed submissions, which warrant\nher release on strict conditions. She and her spouse have commited to signing a bond in the full\namount of their net worth, regardless of the ounership of the underlying assets. She has\nproffered seven additional sureties, consisting of her family and close friends, many of whom are\nUS. citizens and long-time residents, who have come forward at great personal risk and have\npledged meaningful assets. The government does not challenge the good faith and bona fides of\nthese proposed sureties. She has provided a detailed report from a respected accounting firm,\nwhich was further reviewed by a former IRS special agent, seting forth a statement of her\nfinancial condition, supported by voluminous documentation. The government does not\nchallenge the report’s findings, nor its underlying documentation. She has agreed, in writing, to\ngive up any right she has or could have to contest extradition and submit to all other standard\ntravel restrictions. And she has noted that a key representation made by the government at the\ninitial bail hearing as to the strength of its evidence is simply not accurate it\nPO and there is no “significant contemporaneous documentary\nevidence” that corroborates its case.\n\nWith regard to any other defendant, this record would readily support release on strict\nbail conditions, perhaps even on consent. But this is Ghislaine Maxwell, the apparent substitute\nfor Jeffrey Epstein. So, instead, in its response the government urges the Court to disregard the\nsignificant additional evidence proffered to the Court and further argues that a defendant cannot\nbe eligible for bail (apparently on any conditions), unless she can provide an absolute guarantee\nagainst all risks. But this is not the legal standard. United States v. Orta, 76o F.2d 887, 888 n.4,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2olo8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020134.jpg": "CaGadeZOtepQ)d3GOuAuNt Bibsutre/ntl l26 lF h6G8228o/2o9o Faget 7l Ob 22\ndetention without bail is warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The Court accordingly denies\nDefendant’s request to reopen the original bail hearing and denies her renewed motion for bail.\n\nA. The presumption in favor of detention applies\n\nThe Court is required to presume that no condition or combination of conditions of\npretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The Bail Reform Act\nprovides that if a defendant is charged with commiting an offense involving a minor victim\nunder l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, “it shall be presumed that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of the\ncommunity if the judicial officer finds that there is probable cause to believe that the person\ncommited.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). The Defendant’s indictment by a grand jury suffices to\nestablish that there is probable cause to believe that she commited the offenses charged in the\nindictment. See, e.g., United States v.

After initiating its\ninvestigation, OPR also subsequently received other leters from U.S. Senators and Representatives inquiring into the\nstatus of the OPR investigation.\n\nvi\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll82", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021184.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document arya ae 3536o38, Pagel2 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo of 348\ninvestigate, litigate, or provide legal advice.” OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\n° 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na <span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span> inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nvill\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll84", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021196.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page24 of 258\nSA-22\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22 of 348\nCHAPTER THREE: ISSUES RELATING TO THE GOVERNMENT’S INTERACTIONS\nA.

The passage of the CVRA repealed the rights portion of the VRRA (42 U.S.C.\n§ lo6o6), but kept intact the portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to\nprovide certain victim services, such as counseling and medical care referrals (42 U.S.C.\n§ lo6o7(c)).

THE DEPARTMENT’S INTERPRETATION OF THE CVRA’S DEFINITION OF\n\n“CRIME VICTIM” AT THE TIME OF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION\n\nA. April l, 2oo5 Office of Legal Counsel “<span class=\"highlight\">Preliminary</span> Review”\n\nIn 2oo5, Department management requested informal guidance from the Department’s\nOffice of Legal Counsel (OLC) regarding interpretation of the CVRA’s definition of “crime\nvictim.””°? On April l, 2oo5, OLC provided “<span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span> and informal” guidance by email,\nconcluding that “the status of a ‘crime victim’ may be reasonably understood to commence upon\nthe filing of a complaint, and that the status ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or\nprosecute the Federal offense that directly caused the victim’s harm.”7°°\n266 H. Rep. No. ll4-7 (Jan. 27, 2ol5).\n\n267 OLC is responsible for providing legal advice to the President, Department components, and other executive\nbranch agencies.\n\n268 The OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance is summarized in a Memorandum Opinion to the Acting Deputy Atorney\nGeneral from Deputy Assistant Atorney General John E. Bies (Dec. l7, 2olo), published as Office of Legal Counsel,\nl92\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l392", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021402.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 358 3536o38, Page23o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 228 of 348\nfor some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall,\nmany of the victims were troubled about the existence of the\ninvestigation. They displayed feelings of embarrassment and\nhumiliation and were reluctant to talk to investigators. Some\nvictims who were identified through the investigation refused even\nto speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and\ngeting to the truth were always at the forefront of our handling of\nthe investigation.\nThe case agent told OPR that although she encountered victims who were “strong” and\n“believable,” she did not encounter any who vigorously advocated for the prosecution of Epstein.\nRather, “they were embarrassed,” “didn’t want their parents to knou,” and “wanted to forget.”?*\nAs of September 24, 2oo7, the date the NPA was signed, Villafafia informed Epstein\natorney Lefkouitz that she had compiled a <span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span> list of victims including “34 confirmed\nminors” and 6 other potential minor victims who had not yet been interviewed by the FBI.7**\nAlthough the government had contacted many victims before the NPA was signed, Villafafia\nacknouledged during the CVRA litigation that “individual victims were not consulted regarding\nthe agreement.”\nB. Before the NPA Is Signed, Villafaia Expresses Concern That Victims Have\nNot Been Consulted\nBefore the NPA was signed, Villafafia articulated to her supervisors concerns about the\ngovernment’s failure to consult with victims.\nl. July 2oo7: Villafaia’s Email Exchanges with Menchel\nIn July 2oo7, Villafafia learned that Menchel had discussed with defense counsel Sanchez\na possible state resolution to the federal investigation of Epstein. Villafafia was upset by this\ninformation, and sent a strongly worded email to Menchel voicing her concerns. (A full account\nof their email exchange is set forth at Chapter Two, Part One, Section IV.A.2.) In that email, she\ntold him that it was “inappropriate [for you] to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE, the victims, and me. These plea negotiations violate... all of the\n285 The case agent also noted that the victim who became CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 had expressed in her\nApril 2oo7 video-recorded FBI interview her opinion that “nothing should happen to Epstein.”\n284 The “victims’ list” for purposes of the NPA was intended to include the names of all individuals whom the\ngovernment was prepared to name in a charging document “‘as victims of an offense enumerated in l8 U.S.C. § 2255.”\nAlthough the charges Villafafia proposed on May l, 2oo7, were based on crimes against l3 victims, thereafter, as\nexplained in Chapter Two of this Report, she continued to revise the proposed charges, adding and removing victims\nas the federal investigation developed further evidence. At the time the NPA was signed, the proposed charges were\nbased on crimes against l9 victims, but others had been identified for potential inclusion.\n2o2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4o2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021403.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 359 | 3536o38, Page23l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 229 of 348\n\nvarious iterations of the victims’ rights legislation.”**° Villafafia explained to OPR her reference\nto the victims:\n\n[M]y concern was that [Menchel] was violating the CVRA which\n\nrequires the atorneys for the government, which[] includes me[,] to\n\nconfer with the victims, and the [VRRA], which requires the agents\n\nto keep the victims apprised of what’s happening with the case. So\n\nin essence, I felt like he was exposing both myself and the agents to\n\nallegations of not abiding by our obligations by engaging in these\n\nplea negotiations without leting us knou about it.”\n\nIn his reply to Villafafia’s email, and after noting that he found her email “totally\ninappropriate,” Menchel denied that he had violated any Departmental policy, and he noted that\n“Tals Chief of the Criminal Division, I am the person designated by the U.S. Atorney to exercise\nappropriate discretion in deciding whether certain pleas are appropriate and consistent with”\nDepartmental policy. Perceiving Menchel’s rebuke as a criticism of her judgment, Villafafia\nresponded, “[R]aising concerns about the forgoten voices of victims in this case should not be\nclassified as a lapse in judgment” and that her “first and only concern in this case... is the victims.”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not view his conversation with Sanchez as a plea offer,\nasserted that he was not obligated to consult with victims during <span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span> setlement\nnegotiations, and noted that he left the USAO before the NPA was fully negotiated or signed.\nMenchel told OPR that ‘you have discussions . . . with [the] defense all the time, and the notion\nthat even just having a general discussion is something that must be veted with victims . . . is not\neven... in the same universe as to hou I think about this.” Menchel also observed that on the\nvery day that Villafafia criticized him for engaging in setlement negotiations without consulting\nher, the FBI, or the victims, Villafafia had herself sent an email to Sanchez offering “to discuss the\npossibility of a federal resolution of Mr. Epstein’s case that could run concurrently with any state\nresolution,” without having spoken to the victims about her proposal.?*’\n\n28 Villafafia told OPR that “some victims, I felt strongly, would have objected to [a state-only disposition].”\nVillafafia stated to OPR that at the time Menchel engaged in such negotiations, he would only have been aware of the\nvictim information contained in her prosecution memorandum, which included information about the “effects on the\nvictims” but did not likely contain information as to “hou they would like the case resolved.” Villafafia asserted that\nMenchel “never reached out to any of the victims to find out what their position would be.” Menchel told OPR that\nthe allegations in Villafafia’s email that he violated the Ashcroft Memo, USAM, and the CVRA were “way out of line\nin terms of what the law is and the policies are.”\n286 As discussed, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not apply before charges were\nfiled against a defendant.\n287 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel asserted that her email to Sanchez was intended\nonly to determine whether Epstein was interested in opening plea negotiations.\n\n2o3\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4o3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021411.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 337 3536o38, Page239 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 237 of 348\nand thanking Acosta for agreeing on October l2, 2oo7, not to “contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this\nmater.”°°’ Shortly thereafter, Sloman drafted a response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Acosta\nrevised to clarify the “inaccurate” representations made by Lefkouitz, in particular noting that\nAcosta did not agree to a “gag order” with regard to victim contact. The draft response, as revised\nby Acosta, stated:\nYou should understand, houever, that there are some\ncommunications that are typical in these maters. As an example,\nour Office has an obligation to contact the victims to inform them\nthat either [the Special Master], or his designee, will be contact[ing]\nthem. Rest assured that we will continue to treat this mater as we\nwould any similarly situated case.°”°\nIn a November 5, 2oo7 leter, Sloman complained to Lefkouitz that private investigators\nworking for Epstein had been contacting victims and asking whether government agents had\ndiscussed financial setlement with them. Sloman noted that the private investigators’ “actions are\ntroublesome because the FBI agents legally are required to advise the victims of the resolution of\nthe mater, which includes informing them that, as part of the resolution, Mr. Epstein has agreed\nto pay damages in some circumstances.” The same day, Villafafia emailed Sloman expressing her\nconcern that “if we [file charges] nou, cross-examination will consist of- ‘and the government told\nyou that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are entitled to a large amount of damages, right?””>””\nC. October — November 2oo7: The FBI and the USAO Continue to Investigate,\nand the FBI Sends a Notice Leter to One Victim Stating That the Case is\n“Under Investigation”\nAlthough Villafafia and the FBI case agents decided to stop informing victims about the\nNPA, the FBI continued its investigation of the case, which included locating and interviewing\npotential victims. In October and November 2oo7, the FBI interviewed l2 potential new victims,\n8 of whom had been identified in a “<span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span>” victim list in use at the time Epstein signed the\n3o7 Villafafia later emailed Sloman stating that she planned to meet with the case agents to have a “general\ndiscussion about staying out of the civil litigation.”\n3o8 Sloman’s draft also stated that Acosta had informed the defense in a previous conference call that the USAO\nwould not accept a “gag order.” OPR recovered only a draft version of the communication and was unable to find\nany evidence that the draft leter was finalized or sent to defense counsel.\n3o8 Subsequent records also referred to the prosecutors’ concerns about creating impeachment evidence and that\nsuch concerns played a role in their decision not to notify victims of the NPA until after Epstein pled guilty. In August\n2oo8, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafafia, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding\nthat the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA]... because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA]\napplied.” Acosta responded: “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as\npotential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they were doing this for the money and we did not want to\ndiscuss liability with them, which was [a] key part of [the] agree[ment].”\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4ll", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021443.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 567 3536o39, Pagel3 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 267 of 348\nF. 2olo -— 2oll: Department and Congressional Actions Regarding\nInterpretation of the CVRA\n\nIn connection with the Department’s 2olo effort to update its 2oo5 Guidelines, the Office\nof the Deputy Atorney General convened a Victim of Crimes Working Group that asked OLC to\nrevisit its 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span> review concerning the definition of “crime victim” under the CVRA\nand solicited input concerning the issue from Department components and federal law enforcement\nagencies. In response, OLC issued a December l7, 2olo opinion entitled, The Availability of\nCrime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4. Based on the CVRA’s\nlanguage, relevant case law, and memoranda opinions from Department components, OLC\nreaffirmed its 2oo5 conclusion that CVRA rights do not vest until a criminal charge has been filed\n(by complaint, information, or indictment) and the rights cease to be available if “all charges are\ndismissed either voluntarily or on the merits (or if the [g]overnment declines to bring formal\ncharges after the filing of a complaint).”>”*\n\nAfter OLC issued its opinion, the Department revised the 2oo5 Guidelines in October 2oll\nbut did not change its fundamental position that the CVRA rights did not vest until after criminal\ncharges were filed. The 2oll revision did, houever, add language concerning victim consultation\nbefore a defendant is charged: “In circumstances where plea negotiations occur before a case has\nbeen brought, Department policy is that this should include reasonable consultation prior to the\nfiling of a charging instrument with the court.”?”? The use of the word “should” in the 2oll\nGuidelines indicates that “personnel are expected to take the action . . . unless there is an\nappropriate, articulable reason not to do so.”°°° Nevertheless, the required consultation “may be\ngeneral in nature” and “does not have to be specific to a particular plea offer.”38! The revisions\nalso specified that AUSAs were to ensure that victims had a right to be reasonably heard at plea\nproceedings. 3°”\n\nOn November 2, 2oll, U.S. Senator Jon Kyl, a co-sponsor of the CVRA, sent a leter to\nAtorney General Eric Holder, arguing that the 2oll Guidelines revisions “‘conflict[ed] quite\nclearly with the CVRA’s plain language” because the 2oll Guidelines did “not extend any rights\nto victims until charges have been filed.” The Department’s response emphasized that the\n378 OLC “express[ed] no opinion” as to whether it is a mater of “good practice” to inform victims of their CVRA\nrights prior to the filing of a complaint or after the dismissal of charges.\nice See 2oll Guidelines, Art. V, 7 G.2, available at htps://www-justice.gov/sites/default/files/olp/docs/\nag_guidelines2ol2. pdf. In its 2oll online training video regarding the Guidelines, the Department encouraged such\nconsultation when reasonable, but it also continued to maintain that there was no CVRA right to confer for pre-\nindictment plea negotiations.\n\n38o See 2oll Guidelines, Art. I, { B.2.\naBl See 2oll Guidelines, Art. V, 4 G.2.\n382 The 2oo5 Guidelines contained no specific provision requiring AUSAs to ensure that victims were able to\nexercise their right to be reasonably heard at plea proceedings, only at sentencing. See 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV,\nq C.3.b.(2). Houever, the 2oo5 Guidelines generally require AUSAs to use their best efforts to comply with the\nCVRA, and the CVRA specifically affords victims the right to be heard at plea proceedings.

Menchel told OPR he believed the USAO was not required to\nconsult with victims during the <span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span> “general discussion” phase of setlement negotiations;\nmoreover, he left the USAO before the terms of the NPA were fully developed.\n\nSloman told OPR that he “did not think that we had to consult with victims prior to entering\ninto the NPA” and ‘“‘we did not have to seek approval from victims to resolve a case.” Sloman\nbelieved the USAO was obligated only to notify victims about resolution of “the cases that we\nhandled, filed cases.” Sloman recalled that because the USAO envisioned a state court resolution\nof the mater, he did not “think that that was a concern of ours at the time to consult with [the\nvictims] prior to entering into... the NPA.”\n\nLourie told OPR that he did not recall any discussions about informing the victims about\nthe terms of the NPA or any instructions to Villafafia that she not discuss the NPA with the victims.\nHe stated that everything the USAO did was “‘to try and get the best result as possible for the\nvictims. .. . [O]nce you step back and look at the whole forest .. ., you will see that... . [I]f you\nlook at each tree and say, well, you didn’t do this right for the victim, you didn’t tell the victim\nthis and that, you’re missing the big picture.”\n\n4o4 As noted, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not require consultation with victims\nbecause no criminal charges had been filed. In addition, Villafafia’s reference to victim “approval” was inaccurate\nbecause the CVRA, even when applicable, requires only “consultation” with victims about prosecutorial decisions.\n\n4o5 Villafafia did not recall Sloman explaining the reason for the decision.\n\nlo8 Villatafia also told OPR that she recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations\ncould cause victims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.” Villafafia was\nuncertain of the date of the conversation, but Menchel’s presence requires it to have occurred before August 3, 2oo7.\n\n259\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l46l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021649.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page2 of 93\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPAGE\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Preliminary</span> Statement ....................... l\n\nStatement of Facts............ ooooooo e ee eee 2\nA.

(Dkt. No. 33) (“Mot.”). Thomas seeks an order\ncompelling the Government to collect materials that are not in its possession, not discoverable\nunder any legal basis, and not related to any legally cognizable defense. Thomas’s motion is\nentirely without merit and should be denied.!\n\nThomas concedes that the Government has produced a “multitude” of discovery directly\nrelevant to the charges against him.

Nonetheless, he seeks an order compelling the\nGovernment to collect and produce additional materials that he believes would support his\npurported defenses, namely, that he commited the offenses because of staffing issues and\nsupervisory lapses, and that he was singled out for prosecution. Specifically, Thomas seeks: (l) a\ncopy of a report being prepared by the Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector General\n(“DOJ-OIG”), which does not yet exist and would principally be based on the same primary\nmaterials that the Government produced to Thomas in December 2ol9 (Mot. 5, 8-9); (i) reports\nand documents prepared by the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) and other agencies who were not and\nare not members of the prosecution team (Mot. 6-7); (il) reports and documents related to “any\nand all [Metropolitan Correctional Center (““MCC”)] employees” who have engaged in “the same\nor similar conduct,” including an incident in “2oo5 or 2oo6” where officers failed to conduct\ncounts or rounds and an inmate commited suicide (Mot. 6); and (iv) reports, statistics, and\ndocuments related to purported staffing issues, supervisory lapses, and the application of BOP\n\n' Tova Noel did not file any pretrial motions, and has not joined in Thomas’s pretrial\nmotions.

The final term sheet was as follous:\n\nto plea agreements, which involve the formal conviction of a corporation in a\n\ncourt proceeding.\nMemorandum from Acting Deputy Atorney General Craig S.

April l, 2oo5 Office of Legal Counsel “<span class=\"highlight\">Preliminary</span> Review”\n\nIn 2oo5, Department management requested informal guidance from the Department’s\nOffice of Legal Counsel (OLC) regarding interpretation of the CVRA’s definition of “crime\nvictim.””°7 On April l, 2oo5, OLC provided “<span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span> and informal” guidance by email,\nconcluding that “the status of a ‘crime victim’ may be reasonably understood to commence upon\nthe filing of a complaint, and that the status ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or\nprosecute the Federal offense that directly caused the victim’s harm.”?\n\n266 H.

Overall,\nmany of the victims were troubled about the existence of the\ninvestigation. They displayed feelings of embarrassment and\nhumiliation and were reluctant to talk to investigators. Some\nvictims who were identified through the investigation refused even\nto speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and\ngeting to the truth were always at the forefront of our handling of\nthe investigation.\nThe case agent told OPR that although she encountered victims who were “strong” and\n“believable,” she did not encounter any who vigorously advocated for the prosecution of Epstein.\nRather, “they were embarrassed,” “didn’t want their parents to knou,” and “wanted to forget.”?*\nAs of September 24, 2oo7, the date the NPA was signed, Villafafia informed Epstein\natorney Lefkouitz that she had compiled a <span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span> list of victims including “34 confirmed\nminors” and 6 other potential minor victims who had not yet been interviewed by the FBI.7*4\nAlthough the government had contacted many victims before the NPA was signed, Villafafia\nacknouledged during the CVRA litigation that “individual victims were not consulted regarding\nthe agreement.”\nB. Before the NPA Is Signed, Villafafia Expresses Concern That Victims Have\nNot Been Consulted\nBefore the NPA was signed, Villafafia articulated to her supervisors concerns about the\ngovernment’s failure to consult with victims.\nl. July 2oo7: Villafafia’s Email Exchanges with Menchel\nIn July 2oo7, Villafafia learned that Menchel had discussed with defense counsel Sanchez\na possible state resolution to the federal investigation of Epstein. Villafafia was upset by this\ninformation, and sent a strongly worded email to Menchel voicing her concerns. (A full account\nof their email exchange is set forth at Chapter Two, Part One, Section IV.A.2.) In that email, she\ntold him that it was “inappropriate [for you] to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE, the victims, and me. These plea negotiations violate . . . all of the\n285 The case agent also noted that the victim who became CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 had expressed in her\nApril 2oo7 video-recorded FBI interview her opinion that “nothing should happen to Epstein.”\n284 The “victims’ list” for purposes of the NPA was intended to include the names of all individuals whom the\ngovernment was prepared to name in a charging document “as victims of an offense enumerated in l8 U.S.C. § 2255.”\nAlthough the charges Villafafia proposed on May l, 2oo7, were based on crimes against l3 victims, thereafter, as\nexplained in Chapter Two of this Report, she continued to revise the proposed charges, adding and removing victims\nas the federal investigation developed further evidence.

So\n\nin essence, I felt like he was exposing both myself and the agents to\n\nallegations of not abiding by our obligations by engaging in these\n\nplea negotiations without leting us knou about it.7°°\n\nIn his reply to Villafafia’s email, and after noting that he found her email “totally\ninappropriate,” Menchel denied that he had violated any Departmental policy, and he noted that\n“Ta]s Chief of the Criminal Division, I am the person designated by the U.S. Atorney to exercise\nappropriate discretion in deciding whether certain pleas are appropriate and consistent with”\nDepartmental policy. Perceiving Menchel’s rebuke as a criticism of her judgment, Villafafia\nresponded, “[R]aising concerns about the forgoten voices of victims in this case should not be\nclassified as a lapse in judgment” and that her “first and only concern in this case . . . is the victims.”\nMenchel told OPR that he did not view his conversation with Sanchez as a plea offer,\nasserted that he was not obligated to consult with victims during <span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span> setlement\nnegotiations, and noted that he left the USAO before the NPA was fully negotiated or signed.\nMenchel told OPR that “you have discussions . . . with [the] defense all the time, and the notion\nthat even just having a general discussion is something that must be veted with victims . . . is not\neven ... in the same universe as to hou I think about this.” Menchel also observed that on the\nvery day that Villafafia criticized him for engaging in setlement negotiations without consulting\nher, the FBI, or the victims, Villafafia had herself sent an email to Sanchez offering “to discuss the\npossibility of a federal resolution of Mr. Epstein’s case that could run concurrently with any state\nresolution,” without having spoken to the victims about her proposal.”°”\n285 Villafafia told OPR that “some victims, I felt strongly, would have objected to [a state-only disposition].”\nVillafafia stated to OPR that at the time Menchel engaged in such negotiations, he would only have been aware of the\nvictim information contained in her prosecution memorandum, which included information about the “effects on the\nvictims” but did not likely contain information as to “hou they would like the case resolved.” Villafafia asserted that\nMenchel “never reached out to any of the victims to find out what their position would be.” Menchel told OPR that\nthe allegations in Villafafia’s email that he violated the Ashcroft Memo, USAM, and the CVRA were “way out of line\nin terms of what the law is and the policies are.”\n286 As discussed, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not apply before charges were\nfiled against a defendant.\n287 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel asserted that her email to Sanchez was intended\nonly to determine whether Epstein was interested in opening plea negotiations.\n2o3\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2324l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023249.jpg": "and thanking Acosta for agreeing on October l2, 2oo7, not to “contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this\nmater.”°°7 Shortly thereafter, Sloman drafted a response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Acosta\nrevised to clarify the “inaccurate” representations made by Lefkouitz, in particular noting that\nAcosta did not agree to a “gag order” with regard to victim contact. The draft response, as revised\nby Acosta, stated:\n\nYou should understand, houever, that there are some\n\ncommunications that are typical in these maters. As an example,\n\nour Office has an obligation to contact the victims to inform them\n\nthat either [the Special Master], or his designee, will be contact[ing]\n\nthem. Rest assured that we will continue to treat this mater as we\n\nwould any similarly situated case.\n\nIn a November 5, 2oo7 leter, Sloman complained to Lefkouitz that private investigators\nworking for Epstein had been contacting victims and asking whether government agents had\ndiscussed financial setlement with them. Sloman noted that the private investigators’ “actions are\ntroublesome because the FBI agents legally are required to advise the victims of the resolution of\nthe mater, which includes informing them that, as part of the resolution, Mr. Epstein has agreed\nto pay damages in some circumstances.” The same day, Villafafia emailed Sloman expressing her\nconcern that “if we [file charges] nou, cross-examination will consist of- ‘and the government told\nyou that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are entitled to a large amount of damages, right?””>”\n\nC. October — November 2oo7: The FBI and the USAO Continue to Investigate,\n\nand the FBI Sends a Notice Leter to One Victim Stating That the Case is\n“Under Investigation”\n\nAlthough Villafafia and the FBI case agents decided to stop informing victims about the\nNPA, the FBI continued its investigation of the case, which included locating and interviewing\npotential victims. In October and November 2oo7, the FBI interviewed l2 potential new victims,\n8 of whom had been identified in a “<span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span>” victim list in use at the time Epstein signed the\n3o7 Villafafia later emailed Sloman stating that she planned to meet with the case agents to have a “general\ndiscussion about staying out of the civil litigation.”\n\nAo8 Sloman’s draft also stated that Acosta had informed the defense in a previous conference call that the USAO\nwould not accept a “gag order.” OPR recovered only a draft version of the communication and was unable to find\nany evidence that the draft leter was finalized or sent to defense counsel.\n\n3o9 Subsequent records also referred to the prosecutors’ concerns about creating impeachment evidence and that\nsuch concerns played a role in their decision not to notify victims of the NPA until after Epstein pled guilty. In August\n2oo8, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafafia, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding\nthat the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA]... because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA]\napplied.” Acosta responded: “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as\npotential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they were doing this for the money and we did not want to\ndiscuss liability with them, which was [a] key part of [the] agree[ment].”\n\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23249", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023279.jpg": "F. 2olo - 2oll: Department and Congressional Actions Regarding\nInterpretation of the CVRA\n\nIn connection with the Department’s 2olo effort to update its 2oo5 Guidelines, the Office\nof the Deputy Atorney General convened a Victim of Crimes Working Group that asked OLC to\nrevisit its 2oo5 <span class=\"highlight\">preliminary</span> review concerning the definition of “crime victim” under the CVRA\nand solicited input concerning the issue from Department components and federal law enforcement\nagencies. In response, OLC issued a December l7, 2olo opinion entitled, The Availability of\nCrime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4. Based on the CVRA’s\nlanguage, relevant case law, and memoranda opinions from Department components, OLC\nreaffirmed its 2oo5 conclusion that CVRA rights do not vest until a criminal charge has been filed\n(by complaint, information, or indictment) and the rights cease to be available if “all charges are\ndismissed either voluntarily or on the merits (or if the [g]overnment declines to bring formal\ncharges after the filing of a complaint).”°”*\n\nAfter OLC issued its opinion, the Department revised the 2oo5 Guidelines in October 2oll\nbut did not change its fundamental position that the CVRA rights did not vest until after criminal\ncharges were filed. The 2oll revision did, houever, add language concerning victim consultation\nbefore a defendant is charged: “In circumstances where plea negotiations occur before a case has\nbeen brought, Department policy is that this should include reasonable consultation prior to the\nfiling of a charging instrument with the court.”*”” The use of the word “should” in the 2oll\nGuidelines indicates that “personnel are expected to take the action . . . unless there is an\nappropriate, articulable reason not to do so.”*°° Nevertheless, the required consultation “may be\ngeneral in nature” and “does not have to be specific to a particular plea offer.”**! The revisions\nalso specified that AUSAs were to ensure that victims had a right to be reasonably heard at plea\nproceedings.**\n\nOn November 2, 2oll, U.S. Senator Jon Kyl, a co-sponsor of the CVRA, sent a leter to\nAtorney General Eric Holder, arguing that the 2oll Guidelines revisions “conflict[ed] quite\nclearly with the CVRA’s plain language” because the 2oll Guidelines did “not extend any rights\nto victims until charges have been filed.” The Department’s response emphasized that the\n378 OLC “express[ed] no opinion” as to whether it is a mater of “good practice” to inform victims of their CVRA\nrights prior to the filing of a complaint or after the dismissal of charges.\nae See 2oll Guidelines, Art. V, 9 G.2, available at htps://“www justice.gov/sites/default/files/olp/docs/\nag guidelines2ol2. pdf. In its 2oll online training video regarding the Guidelines, the Department encouraged such\nconsultation when reasonable, but it also continued to maintain that there was no CVRA right to confer for pre-\nindictment plea negotiations.\n\n38o See 2oll Guidelines, Art. I, J B.2.\nBL See 2oll Guidelines, Art. V, J G.2.\n382 The 2oo5 Guidelines contained no specific provision requiring AUSAs to ensure that victims were able to\nexercise their right to be reasonably heard at plea proceedings, only at sentencing. See 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV,\n4 C.3.b.(2). Houever, the 2oo5 Guidelines generally require AUSAs to use their best efforts to comply with the\nCVRA, and the CVRA specifically affords victims the right to be heard at plea proceedings.

In a\nSeptember 6, 2oo7 email primarily addressing other topics, as the plea negotiations were beginning\nin earnest and almost three weeks before the NPA was signed, Villafafia raised the topic of victim\nconsultation with Sloman: “The agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their\napproval, which as [CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law. . . .\n[A]nd the [PBPD] Chief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.”4\nSloman forwarded the email to Acosta with a note stating, “fyi.” Villafafia recalled that after she\nsent the email, Sloman told her by telephone, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.”*°° Villafafia also told\nOPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve been advised that . . . pre-\ncharge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Villafafia also recalled a discussion with\nAcosta, Menchel, and Sloman, during which she stated that she would need to get victims’ input\non the terms being proposed to the defense, and she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential.\nYou can’t disclose them.’4°6\n\nNone of the other subjects recalled a specific discussion before the NPA was signed about\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations.

In addition, Villafafia’s reference to victim “approval” was inaccurate\nbecause the CVRA, even when applicable, requires only “consultation” with victims about prosecutorial decisions.\n\n5 Villafafia did not recall Sloman explaining the reason for the decision.\n\n4o6 Villafafia also told OPR that she recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations\ncould cause victims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.” Villafafia was\nuncertain of the date of the conversation, but Menchel’s presence requires it to have occurred before August 3, 2oo7.\n\n259\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23297", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024182.jpg": "Vi y ‘ oN U.S. Department of Justice\nA PES Federal Bureau of Prisons\nSe Office of the Warden\n\nMetropolitan Correctional Center\n\nl5o Park Rou\n\nNew York, New York looo7\n\n(646) 836-63oo, (646) 836-755l (Fax)\nAugust lo, 2ol9\nSENT VIA EMAIL\nThe Honorable Colleen McMahon, Chief Judge\nThe Honorable Richard M.
