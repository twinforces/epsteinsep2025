She never asked for anything in return. These are the actions of a\nfundamentally good and decent person, with great empathy for others and a capacity for\naltruism. This is the real — the true — Ghislaine whom | knou and love as her brother.\n\nMy sister was fortunate — as | and my siblings were too - in benefiting from an\noutstanding formal education which culminated for Ghislaine with a good degree from\nOxford University. She put that achievement to good effect, using amongst other skills her\ngift for foreign languages and networking abilities to start up, invest in and develop\nnumerous businesses in the UK and in the US, employing people, making a difference,\nmaking a contribution.\n\nPerhaps her single most important contribution is to have converted a lifelong passion\nfor conservation and the oceans into a non-profit, The TerraMar Project, to create a robust\nawareness program and a thriving social network around the oceans at a time when they\nwere perhaps not so high up the conservation agenda as they are today. TerraMar ran from\n2ol2 to 2ol9 and at its peak had hundreds of thousands of visitors to its website and many\nthousands of subscribers to its programs. None of this would have happened but for\nGhislaine’s determination, her hard work and capacity for organizing and mobilizing and\nsheer perseverance as well as financial generosity in sustaining TerraMar over the years.\nThose personal efforts of hers (along with others from key corporate supporters and\nsponsors), were acknouledged when the U.N. made oceans conservation one of their l7\nSustainable Development Goals for 2ol5-3o.\n\n| believe Ghislaine still has much to contribute to the world if she is given a meaningful\nopportunity to do so.\n\nSincerely yours,\nlan Maxwell\n2|Page\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo5o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00030723.jpg": "fi ==... eee ee ee ——SS—= ee\nl53497\nl2/l4/2oo5 ae * e\n‘2 7\n<span class=\"highlight\">SUBSCRIBER</span> INFORMATION ”™ CINGUIAaLr\nCe\noo438ll863 75\nSS Se sr sr A\nFinancially Liable Party\nName: JEFFREY E EPSTEIN\nCredit Address: 457 MADISON AVE, NEW YORK NY loo22-6843\nCustomer Since: o4/o3/2oo4\nPhoto ID Type: Photo ID State:\nPhoto ID Number:\nDOB: o5/o5/l95o SSN: =\nContact Name: SARAH KELLEN\nContact Home Phone: (2l2) 75o-9895 Contact Work Phone: (2l2) 75o-9895\nContact Home Email: Contact Work Email:\nBilling Party\nAccount Number: oo438ll863\nName: JEFFREY E EPSTEIN\nBilling Address: 457 MADISON AVE, NEW YORK NY loo22-6843\nAccount Status: Active Billing Cycle: 2\nUser Information\nMSISDN: (9l7) 855-3363 IMST: 3lo38oo4ol29624\nMSISDN Active: o4/o3/2oo4 - Current IMEI/ESN: 35l985oo925lo58/\nName: SARAH KELLEN\nUser Address: 457 MADISON AVE , NEW YORK NY loo22-6843\nService Start Date: o4/o3/2oo4 Dealer Info: AINBC Lakeside Center-CC\nPayment Type: PostPaid\nContact Name: SARAH KELLEN\nContact Home Phone: (2l2) 75o-9895 Contact Work Phone: (2l2) 75o-9895\nContact Home Email: Contact Work Email:\nStatus Change History\nStatus Change Reason: Status Change Date:\n2G 3G Migration o4/o3/2oo4\nMAT\nPROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL Page l\nNot for use or disclosure outside Cingular Wireless and its Affiliates\nexcept under writen agreement.\no7/26/l7 Page 5 of 82 Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3o723\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00030784.jpg": "l53497 : . at | ®\nae Calls to Destination 3G a CiINgu ar\nRun Date: l2/l9/o5\nRun Time: 4l342759\nATLYS Voice Usage For (9l7) 855-3363\nAccount Number oo438ll863 Bill Cycle: 2\nItem Date Time Calling Number Number Called Calls To Mins Rate Charge Description Charge\nUsed\na o9/o3/o5 ll:37A * (56l)776-8679 (9l7) 655-3363 INCOMING 2 o.oo UNLIMITED N/WKND MIN\n2 o9/o3/o5 ol:l5P * (7l8) 36l-5768 (9l7) 855=3363 INCOMING l o.oo UNLIMITED N/WKND MIN |\n3 OS/o3/o5 ol:53P * \\(56l)655-2779 (9l7) 855-3363 INCOMING 2 o.oo UNLIMITED N/WKND MIN |\n4 o9/o3/o5 o2:26P * (786)246-66o7 (9l7)855-3363 INCOMING ; 2 o.oo UNLIMITED N/WKND MIN |\n3 o9/o5/o5 ol:5lP . 5l3 (9l7) 855-3363 INCOMING l 2429 $2.29 |\n6 o9/o5/o5 ol:54P 3l3 (9l7) 855-3363 INCOMING 2 2.o29 $4.58\n7 o9/o5/o5 o9:53P 5l3 (9l7) 855-3363 INCOMING i 2229 $l6.o3\n8 o9/o6/o5 o5:4lP §l3 (9l7) 855-3363 INCOMING 9 2429 32o.6l |\n9 o9/o7/o5 o5:l9A Sus (9l7) 855-3363 INCOMING af 2.29 $2.29\nlo o9/o7/o5 o5:2oA 5l3 (9l7) 855-3363 INCOMING Z 2.29 $2.29\nl 3 o9/o7/o5 o6:llA sis (9l7) 855-3363 INCOMING l 2.29 $2.29\nl2 o9/o7/o5 o7:58A ol3 (9l7)'655-3363 INCOMING 2 2,29 $4.58 |\nl3 o9/o7/o5 o8:38A 5l3 (9l7) 855-3363 INCOMING ie 2.29 $2.29\nl4 o9/o7/o5 lo:o6A 5l3 (9l7) 855-3363 INCOMING 2 2.29 $4.58\nl5 o9/o7/o5 l2: 35P 3l3 (9l7) 655-3363 INCOMING 4 2.29 $2.29\nl6 o9/o8/o5 oO7:47A 5l3 (9l7) 855-3363 INCOMING l 2.22 $2.29\noy o9/o8/o5 oO7:47A 5l3 (9l7) 855-3363 INCOMING l 2o29 $2.29\nl8 o9/o8/o5 l2:olP 5l3 (9l7)'855-3363 INCOMING l 2,29 $2.29\nl9 o9/o9/o5 o7:l2A 5l3 (9l7) 855-3363 INCOMING 2 2.29 $4.58\n2o o9/o9/o5 o7:l4A 5l3 (9l7) 855-3363 INCOMING l 2o29 $2.29\nZt o9/o9/o5 o3:loP 5l3 ($l7) 855-3363 INCOMING Z 2ueo $2.29\n22 o9/lo/o5 o5:l7A $l3 (9l7) 855-3363 INCOMING uf 2.2o $2.29\n* - indicates the first time the calling number appears on the report\nAll \"Calls to Destination\" and \"<span class=\"highlight\">Subscriber</span> Activity\" reports are recorded in Local Switch Time.\n| This data provided may be in pre-bill format.
