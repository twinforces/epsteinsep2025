She never asked for anything in return. These are the actions of a\nfundamentally good and decent person, with great empathy for others and a capacity for\naltruism. This is the real — the true — Ghislaine whom | knou and love as her brother.\n\nMy sister was fortunate — as | and my siblings were too - in benefiting from an\noutstanding formal education which culminated for Ghislaine with a good degree from\nOxford University. She put that achievement to good effect, using amongst other skills her\ngift for foreign languages and networking abilities to start up, invest in and develop\nnumerous businesses in the UK and in the US, employing people, making a difference,\nmaking a contribution.\n\nPerhaps her single most important contribution is to have converted a lifelong passion\nfor conservation and the oceans into a non-profit, The TerraMar Project, to create a robust\nawareness program and a thriving social network around the oceans at a time when they\nwere perhaps not so high up the conservation agenda as they are today. TerraMar ran from\n2ol2 to 2ol9 and at its peak had hundreds of thousands of visitors to its website and many\nthousands of subscribers to its programs. None of this would have happened but for\nGhislaine’s determination, her hard work and capacity for organizing and mobilizing and\nsheer perseverance as well as financial generosity in sustaining TerraMar over the years.\nThose personal efforts of hers (along with others from key corporate supporters and\nsponsors), were acknouledged when the U.N. made oceans conservation one of their l7\nSustainable Development Goals for 2ol5-3o.\n\n| believe Ghislaine still has much to contribute to the world if she is given a meaningful\nopportunity to do so.\n\nSincerely yours,\nlan Maxwell\n2|Page\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo5o2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00029103.jpg": "g2v27/2o87 l9:22 me, bee\n| FEB-2l-2o87 l5:3l FBI WEST PALM BEACH RA\n| FD-9o9 (Rev. 6-o2-o2) ‘U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE/FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION\nSUBPOENA\n: ye In the mater of case number(s}: 33.E-MM-~lo8o62\nTay ice fe IS te\nS ) LS ee\nTO: Bell South :\nS Custodian of Records ,\n-  YC\\ appRess: l22 East Lake Drive FEB 2l 2o7\nDecatur, GA 3oo3o\n—— ) so revernone: 4o4-378-9269\nGREETING: —— ee\n™ ..,b3 -l,\nC) _ By the service of this subpoena upon you by SA who is authorized t,¢ 27 3, _5\nyou are hereby commanded and required to disclose to © ,arepreseb7c -2, -3, -5\nthe FBI, the name, address, local and Jong distance telephone toll billing records, telephone number or other <span class=\"highlight\">subscriber</span> nuraber or\nidentity, end length of secvice of a <span class=\"highlight\">subscriber</span> to or customer of such service and the types of services the <span class=\"highlight\">subscriber</span> or customer\nutlized which may be relevant to an authorized law enforcement inquiry, involving the follouing:\n.
