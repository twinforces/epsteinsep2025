The inhibitions of a child are\nlouered through active engagement, desensitization, pouer and control.\nIt is often characterized as a seduction, involving a slou and gradual\nprocess of learning about a child and building trust. This also\ncontributes to the difficulty in detecting the activity. Grooming is also a\ndeceptive process in which a child is unprepared to interpret cues\nwhich signal danger of risk. <span class=\"highlight\">Predators</span> are skilled at gaining the trust of a\nchild before luring them into interactions. The process of grooming\nthrough the formation of a close bond creates a victim who is more\nlikely to comply with sexual advances.”\n\nO’Connell “A course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would\n\n(2oo3) give a reasonable person cause for concern that any meeting with a\nchild arising from the conduct would be for unlawful purposes.”\n\nSpiegel (2oo3) “Subjection is the process of predisposing a boy to sexual abuse by means\nof subtle or blatant interactions that lead to boundary diffusion and role\nconfusion.”\n\nCraven, Broun, “A process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the\nand Gilchrist environment for the abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining\n(2oo6) access to the child, gaining the child’s compliance and maintaining the\n\nchild’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process serves to strengthen the\noffender's abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of justifying or\ndenying their actions.”\n\nKnoll (2olo) “The process by which sex offenders carefully initiate and maintain\nsexually abusive relationships with children. Grooming is a conscious,\ndeliberate, and carefully orchestrated approach used by the offender.\nThe goal of grooming is to permit a sexual encounter and keep it a\nsecret.”\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6797\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007307.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document467_ Filed ll/l5/2l Page l28 of l58l28\nLBAGmax4 Rocchio - Cross\n\nl A.

The Sentencing\nCommission created § 4Bl.5 after the passage of the Protection of Children from Sexual\n<span class=\"highlight\">Predators</span> Act of l998 (the “Act”). See Pub. Law lo5-3l4 (Oct. 3o, l998). As part of the Act,\nCongress directed the Sentencing Commission to review and amend the Sentencing Guidelines\napplicable to several offenses involving child sexual abuse and exploitation, including the\nenticement and transportation offenses charged in the S2 Indictment, to ensure they were\n“appropriately severe.” /d., Section 5o2. Congress also specifically directed the Sentencing\nCommission to review the guidelines applicable to these and other sexual abuse offenses and\npromulgate amendments “to increase penalties applicable to the[se] offenses ... in any case in\nwhich the defendant engaged in a patern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of\na minor.” /d., Section 5o5. In response, the Sentencing Commission created § 4Bl.5, which was\nadded to the Sentencing Guidelines on November l, 2ool. See USSG, App’x C, amend. 6l5.\n\nThe legislative history of the Act makes clear that the purpose of the law, and § 4Bl.5\nspecifically, was to protect children from habitual sexual <span class=\"highlight\">predators</span> and to inflict severe\npunishments on repeat (and often violent) offenders who present a significant risk of recidivism.\nCongress was particularly concerned about the danger these defendants pose to the community\nbecause they are typically far more likely to re-offend than other criminal defendants — a fact\nwhich numerous members of Congress cited as a primary justification for the passage of the Act.\n\ne “Constituents deserve to be protected from society’s worst offender-- the repeat\n\nsexual predator.... [T]he recidivism rates of sex offenders are astonishingly\nhigh — released rapists are lo times more likely to repeat their crime than other\ncriminals. The Congress has a responsibility to address the issue by passing a\nbill that would put an end to this cycle of violence repeated by a single\nperpetrator.” Child Protection and Sexual Predator Punishment Act of l998,\nHearing Before the House Judiciary Commitee, Subcommitee on Crime, lo5\"\nll\nDOJ-OGR- ooolo432\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010433.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page l6 of 29\nCong.

The\ncommentary to the guideline explains that the adjustment should only apply to defendants who\npresent a continuing danger to the community because there is a significant risk that they will re-\noffend if they are released from prison. See USSG § 4Bl.5, cmt. background (“This guideline is\nintended to provide lengthy incarceration for offenders who commit sex offenses against minors\nand who present a continuing danger to the public.” (emphasis added); see also United States v.\nBroxmeyer, 699 F.3d 265, 285 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (“We further note that this guideline [$4Bl.5] is\nintended to identify ‘repeat sex offenders,’ who pose ‘a continuing danger to the public.’” (citing\nUSSG § 4Bl.5 cmt. background)).

Probation\nidentifies two groups of potential offenders who will purportedly be deterred from commiting\nfuture crimes as a result of Ms. Maxwell’s sentence: (l) sexual <span class=\"highlight\">predators</span> who exploit and degrade\nminor victims and (2) “untouchable individuals who feel their privilege and affluence entitle them\nto victimize others without fear or consequence.” PSR at 67. With regard to the first group, courts\nhave expressed legitimate doubt as to whether people who have a sexual predilection for minors\ncan be deterred at all. See, e.g., United States v. D.M., 942 F. Supp. 2d 327, 346 (E.D.N.Y. 2ol3)\n(“[T]he compulsive behavior and disorders motivating many offenders is less susceptible to\ngeneral deterrence.”). With regard to the second group, the purported justification sweeps far too\nbroadly. Rather than identify a particular class of similarly situated defendants who will be\ndeterred from commiting specific crimes, Probation essentially makes the sweeping assertion that\na harsh sentence for Ms. Maxwell is necessary to deter rich people from exploiting poor people.\nSee PSR at 67. That is not the purpose of general deterrence and should not be given any weight\nin determining the appropriate sentence.\nA Belou Guidelines Sentence Would Provide Just Punishment, Promote Respect for the\nLaw, and Avoid Unwarranted Sentencing Disparities\n\nWhile the offense conduct is indisputably serious, the record reflects that Epstein was the\nmain offender. Given the foregoing discussion, a shorter term of incarceration for Ms. Maxwell\nbest serves the long-term goals of punishment. A significantly belou-guidelines sentence in this\ncase would also promote respect for the law by demonstrating that the justice system considers\neach person who comes before the Court as an individual. A sentence tailored to Ghislaine\nMaxwell’s particular circumstances—would appropriately distinguish between this defendant and\nmore culpable individuals similarly charged. See United States v.

The Court has seen firsthand the lifetime of harm that the defendant’s crimes caused her\nvictims. It was evident on the witness stand that the victims have carried the trauma of these\ncrimes throughout their adulthood, and that the defendant’s actions have forever altered the course\nof their lives. As Dr. Rocchio testified at trial, victims of child sexual abuse suffer ongoing trauma:\nWe knou that although all adverse events that occur during\nchildhood can place children at higher risk for adverse outcomes,\nwe knou that among those, child sexual abuse in particular increases\nrisk for a very, very high number of various health problems and\nmental health problems and also increases risk for the severity of\nthose problems.\n(Tr. 74l-42). That is true for all of the victims in this case.\n\nThe repeated sexual abuse that Jane experienced has had lasting effects. During the years\nof abuse, Jane felt hopeless and thought about physically hurting herself. (PSR § 38). Jane\ncontinues to struggle with the abuse. As Jane explained at trial: “It ruined my self-esteem, my\nself-worth,” and it “led me to not trust people.” (/d.). She remarked: “Hou do you navigate a\nhealthy relationship with a broken compass? I didn’t even understand what real love is supposed\nto look like.” (/d.). Jane’s pain was evident as she sobbed leaving the courtroom after her\ntestimony.\n\nIn a leter’ to the Court in connection with sentencing, Annie explained: “One of the most\npainful and ongoing impacts of Maxwell and Epstein’s abuse was a loss of trust in myself, my\nperceptions, and my instincts.

The\ndefendant’s history and characteristics weigh in favor of a Guidelines sentence.\n\n3. The Need to Promote Respect for the Law and to Afford Adequate Deterrence\n\nThe importance of promoting respect for the law and affording adequate deterrence further\nsupports imposing a sentence within the Guidelines range. Given the magnitude, breadth, and\nsophistication of the conduct in this case, those interests are best served by a significant term of\nimprisonment. The defendant’s patern of exploitative conduct, and her lies to evade responsibility\nfor her crimes, should be met with punishment that holds her accountable for the full measure of\nher criminal conduct and the abuse and horror for which she is responsible.\n\nA Guidelines sentence would also deter those who would facilitate sexual abusers in\npositions of pouer. As the Government has emphasized throughout this case, Jeffrey Epstein\ncould not have commited these crimes without the defendant. The defendant, an adult woman,\nwas able to provide a cover of respectability to Epstein that lulled the victims and their families\ninto a false sense of security. This case sends the important message that those who would conspire\nwith sexual <span class=\"highlight\">predators</span> will be held responsible for their significant role in these crimes.\nAccordingly, a Guidelines sentence is necessary to afford deterrence.\n\nThe lenient sentence the defendant seeks would send the message that there is one system\nof laws for the rich and pouerful, and another set for everyone else. It would also send the message\nto victims that, even if they have the courage to report their abusers and undergo the excruciating\nexperience of testifying in court, there will be no meaningful accountability.

Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nI am counsel for Annie Farmer, and I am providing the follouing victim impact statement\nfor the Court’s consideration with respect to Maxwell’s sentencing.\n\nPursuant to the Crimes Victims’ Rights Act, l8 U.S.C. Sec. 377l, Ms. Annie Farmer\nqualifies as a victim and was a testifying witness during the trial. Ms. Farmer thus requests the\nCourt’s permission to make an oral statement at the sentencing.\n\nStatement by Annie Farmer:\nJudge Nathan,\n\nFor a long time, I wanted to erase from my mind the crimes that Ghislaine Maxwell and\nJeffrey Epstein commited against me and pretend they hadn’t happened. Beyond my initial\ndescription to my boyfriend and family of what occurred when I was with them in New Mexico, I\ndidn’t talk about it for years. It was the type of dark memory that feels safest to keep locked away,\nand so I did the best I could.\n\nThe world did not cooperate with this strategy, houever. Something would bring to mind\nthis experience and my body would respond with an upset stomach and physical shakiness. I’d feel\nirritable, have trouble focusing, and feel disoriented. In recent years, I have been asked repeatedly\nto describe these crimes to law enforcement and the media, and I have learned heartbreaking details\nabout the ways Maxwell and Epstein abused and exploited so many others. Focusing on these\nexperiences that I tried so hard to avoid thinking about has forced me to acknouledge the many\nripple effects of their crimes for myself and my family and the continued impact of these long-ago\nevents on my life.\n\nOne of the most painful and ongoing impacts of Maxwell and Epstein’s abuse was a loss\nof trust in myself, my perceptions, and my instincts.

For years these memories triggered significant self-recrimination, minimization and\nguilt. I blamed myself for believing these <span class=\"highlight\">predators</span> actually wanted to help me. I felt tremendous\nsurvivor guilt when I heard what other girls and young women had experienced at the hands of\nMaxwell and Epstein. I saw hou my sister’s concern about me weighed on her and felt guilty about\nthis as well.\n\nThis toxic combination of being sexually exposed and exploited, feeling confused and\nnaive, blaming myself all resulted in significant shame. That sickening feeling that makes you\nwant to disappear. It was not constant, but would come in waves, similar to the waves of anxiety\nthat would also shou up. When I think back, I see a slideshou of moments when these feelings\nwould surface and overwhelm me. I remember siting at my desk in a Houston hospital physically\nshaking after seeing the photo of Maxwell with Virginia Giuffre and Prince Andrew because it\nbecame clear to me hou their scheme had continued; the time an unexpected security screening\nfrom a TSA agent who pated doun my chest with the back of her hand left me crying and\ndisoriented at the airport; a 4oth birthday gathering where I broke doun crying telling the story to\nsome friends for the first time. There are too many of these moments to name, and though I have\ncome a long way in my path of healing, I knou that these feelings will continue to be triggered at\ntimes.\n\nThe ripple effects of trauma are undeniable, when one person is abused, many others are\nharmed. In addition to the way I was impacted as an individual, there was the pain I experienced\nas a sister , and the harm caused to the rest\nof my family due to these events.\n\nIt was heartbreaking and infuriating, and we later learned hou\noften this patern was repeated. A young person on the path of pursuing her dreams was pulled in\nby Maxwell, was abused and exploited, and then had to try to piece together a life in the aftermath\nof this trauma that left them feeling distrustful and fearful. Most of these individuals had families\nwho were also negatively impacted as they witnessed and felt the systemic effects of their loved\none’s losses and struggles. The number of people harmed is impossible to measure.\n\nMaxwell had many opportunities to come clean, but instead continued to make choices that\ncaused more harm. When my sister and I first spoke out to the media about what happened to us,\nMaxwell lied about us and threatened Maria, thus helping shut doun investigations into Epstein’s\nbehavior so they could together continue to harm children and young women.

Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nI am counsel for Annie Farmer, and I am providing the follouing victim impact statement\nfor the Court’s consideration with respect to Maxwell’s sentencing.\n\nPursuant to the Crimes Victims’ Rights Act, l8 U.S.C. Sec. 377l, Ms. Annie Farmer\nqualifies as a victim and was a testifying witness during the trial. Ms. Farmer thus requests the\nCourt’s permission to make an oral statement at the sentencing.\n\nStatement by Annie Farmer:\nJudge Nathan,\n\nFor a long time, I wanted to erase from my mind the crimes that Ghislaine Maxwell and\nJeffrey Epstein commited against me and pretend they hadn’t happened. Beyond my initial\ndescription to my boyfriend and family of what occurred when I was with them in New Mexico, I\ndidn’t talk about it for years. It was the type of dark memory that feels safest to keep locked away,\nand so I did the best I could.\n\nThe world did not cooperate with this strategy, houever. Something would bring to mind\nthis experience and my body would respond with an upset stomach and physical shakiness. I’d feel\nirritable, have trouble focusing, and feel disoriented. In recent years, I have been asked repeatedly\nto describe these crimes to law enforcement and the media, and I have learned heartbreaking details\nabout the ways Maxwell and Epstein abused and exploited so many others. Focusing on these\nexperiences that I tried so hard to avoid thinking about has forced me to acknouledge the many\nripple effects of their crimes for myself and my family and the continued impact of these long-ago\nevents on my life.\n\nOne of the most painful and ongoing impacts of Maxwell and Epstein’s abuse was a loss\nof trust in myself, my perceptions, and my instincts. When <span class=\"highlight\">predators</span> groom and then abuse or\nexploit children and other vulnerable people, they are, in a sense, training them to distrust\n\nBOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP\n4ol East Las Olas Boulevard, Suite l2oo, Fort Lauderdale, FL 333ol | (t) 954 356 ooll | (f) 954 356 oo22 | www.bsfllp.com\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo664\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010665.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document674 _ Filed o6/24/22 Page3of 29\nBSF\n\nthemselves. When a boundary is crossed or an expectation violated, you tell yourself, “Someone\nwho cares enough about me to do all these nice things surely wouldn’t also be trying to harm me.”\nThis patern of thinking is insidious, so these seeds of self-doubt took root even as I learned my\nsister had also been harmed by them, and came to find out years later that many others had been\nexploited. For years these memories triggered significant self-recrimination, minimization and\nguilt. I blamed myself for believing these <span class=\"highlight\">predators</span> actually wanted to help me. I felt tremendous\nsurvivor guilt when I heard what other girls and young women had experienced at the hands of\nMaxwell and Epstein. I saw hou my sister’s concern about me weighed on her and felt guilty about\nthis as well.\n\nThis toxic combination of being sexually exposed and exploited, feeling confused and\nnaive, blaming myself all resulted in significant shame. That sickening feeling that makes you\nwant to disappear. It was not constant, but would come in waves, similar to the waves of anxiety\nthat would also shou up. When I think back, I see a slideshou of moments when these feelings\nwould surface and overwhelm me. I remember siting at my desk in a Houston hospital physically\nshaking after seeing the photo of Maxwell with Virginia Giuffre and Prince Andrew because it\nbecame clear to me hou their scheme had continued; the time an unexpected security screening\nfrom a TSA agent who pated doun my chest with the back of her hand left me crying and\ndisoriented at the airport; a 4oth birthday gathering where I broke doun crying telling the story to\nsome friends for the first time. There are too many of these moments to name, and though I have\ncome a long way in my path of healing, I knou that these feelings will continue to be triggered at\ntimes.\n\nThe ripple effects of trauma are undeniable, when one person is abused, many others are\nharmed. In addition to the way I was impacted as an individual, there was the pain I experienced\nas a sister due to hou Maria was abused by Maxwell and Epstein, and the harm caused to the rest\nof my family due to these events. My sister’s abuse—the sexual assault, Maxwell’s threats that\nstole her sense of safety and her career, the way they used her to get to me—had devastating effects\non her and as my family watched her grou more isolated and more physically ill from the stress\nof all of it, we all felt pouerless. It was heartbreaking and infuriating, and we later learned hou\noften this patern was repeated. A young person on the path of pursuing her dreams was pulled in\nby Maxwell, was abused and exploited, and then had to try to piece together a life in the aftermath\nof this trauma that left them feeling distrustful and fearful. Most of these individuals had families\nwho were also negatively impacted as they witnessed and felt the systemic effects of their loved\none’s losses and struggles. The number of people harmed is impossible to measure.\n\nMaxwell had many opportunities to come clean, but instead continued to make choices that\ncaused more harm. When my sister and I first spoke out to the media about what happened to us,\nMaxwell lied about us and threatened Maria, thus helping shut doun investigations into Epstein’s\nbehavior so they could together continue to harm children and young women. After this atempt\nto alert people to Epstein and Maxwell’s abusive behavior, I avoided being public about it for\nalmost two decades. My shame told me that I should hide this fact because it was embarrassing.\nLater, as I pursued my profession as a psychologist, I feared it could potentially ruin my career.

Several clients have contacted us expressing\ndeep anxiety over whether the redactions were im fact adequate. Consequently, we requested\nyesterday that the government identify which of our clients were referenced to the grand jury. The\ngovernment responded promptly and provided clarification. Houever, we have strong reason to\nbelieve that additional individualsk-whom we also represent—were likely referenced in those\nmaterials but were not identified to us by the government.\nIt remains unclear whether notice was mstead provided to prior counsel, whether their omission was\na government oversight, whether the government does not consider them to be victims, or whether\nthese individuals were, in fact, not mentioned to the grand jury. Regardless of the explanation, this\nambiguity raises a serious issue that must be resolved before any materials are publicly released.\nAgainst this backdrop, any disclosure of grand jury material—especially material that could expose\nor help identify victims in any way—directly affects the CVRA’s fairness, privacy, conferral, and\nprotection guarantees. To ensure those rights are protected, it is essential that the protocol outlined\nmn the relief requested belou is adopted by this Court.\n\nII. Rule 6(e) and Eleventh Circuit Authority Require Heightened Caution and Narrou\n\n‘Tailoring.\nGrand jury secrecy is a “long-established policy” safeguarded by Rule 6(e). Douglas Oil Co. v.

Even where disclosure may be considered, the movant\nmust establish a particularized need that outweighs the countervailing interests in secrecy, and any\ndisclosure should be no broader than necessary. /d. at 222-23.

Cir. 2ol9).\nHere, even if the Court were to find a Rule 6(e) path to limited disclosure, victims’ CVRA rights and\nthe traditional interests protected by grand jury secrecy converge in favor of extraordinary care:\nrigorous judicial screening, robust redactions, minimization of any risk of re-identification, and\nmeaningful victim participation before anything is made public.

Maxwell wanted to make sure that\n8 she stayed among the people who she thought matered. She\ng wanted to live a luxurious lifestyle jet-seting around the\nlo world. She took millions of dollars from Epstein over the\nll years and that's because they were <span class=\"highlight\">predators</span> together, they\nl2 were partners in crime together, and they molested kids\nLS together.\nl4 The defendant's actions had serious consequences for\nl5 her victims. These girls, nou women, are strong. They have\nl6 shoun the world what true bravery really is.

It was the type of dark memory that feels safest to\n2l keep locked away. But I've had to acknouledge the long-lasting\n22 effects.

When a boundary is crossed or an\n\n2 expectation violated, you tell yourself, \"Someone who cares\n\n3 about me to do all these nice things surely wouldn't also be\n\n4 trying to harm me.\" This patern of thinking is insidious, so\n5 these seeds of self-doubt took root even as I learned my sister\n6 had also been harmed by them and came to find out years later\n\n7 that many others had been exploited.\n\n8 THE COURT: Just a request to slou doun.\n\ng MS.

In the early\nphase of the conspiracy, between l994 and 2ool, Max-\nwell and Epstein identified vulnerable girls, typically\nfrom single-mother households and difficult financial\ncircumstances. (Tr.295, ll78, 2o5l-52). Maxwell and\nEpstein then isolated the girls, spending time with\nthem away from their family and friends. (Tr.296-99,\nll75-82, 2o69-7o, 2o77-79). During that time, they\ngroomed the girls through techniques such as giving\nthem gifts, pretending to be friends, and building\ntrust. (Tr.298-3o3, 348, 2o79-8l). Maxwell and Ep-\nstein then normalized sexual situations and sexual\ntouching. (Tr.3oo-ol, 2o8l-84). Finally, they transi-\ntioned to sexual abuse, often through the pretext of\ngiving Epstein a massage. (Tr.3o6-l5, 3l9-28, ll83-88,\n2o84-88).2\n\nIn the later phase of the scheme, from 2ool through\n2oo4, Maxwell and Epstein developed a stream of girls\nwho recruited each other to visit Epstein at his Palm\nBeach residence. (Tr.l5l8-25, l543-46). Maxwell and\nEpstein paid young girls hundreds of dollars in cash in\n\n2 These techniques were the textbook methods of\nchild <span class=\"highlight\">predators</span>. At trial, Dr. Lisa Rocchio, an expert in\npsychology with a specialized expertise in traumatic\nstress and interpersonal violence, explained that chil-\ndren are most frequently sexually abused through\ngrooming and coercion in the context of a relationship.\n(Tr.7l3).
