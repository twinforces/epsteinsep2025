The Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the Defendant presents a risk of flight and that there are no\nset of conditions, including the Defendant’s third set of proposed conditions, that are sufficient to\nreasonably assure her appearance. The presumption in favor of detention, the weight of the\nevidence, and the history and characteristics of the Defendant all continue to support that\nconclusion. The Defendant’s proposed conditions do not alter the Court’s determination.\n\nA. The Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors has not changed\n\nTo begin with, the presumption in favor of detention continues to apply with equal force.\nSee Dkt. No. lo6 (“Dec. Op.”) at 7-8. And though the Court again concludes that the Defendant\nhas met her burden of production, the presumption “remains a factor to be considered among\nthose weighed by the district court.” Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436 (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at\nll44). The Court is mindful “that Congress has found that these offenders pose special risks of\nflight, and that ‘a strong <span class=\"highlight\">probability</span> arises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate\nto secure their appearance.” Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nThe Court’s analysis of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors also remains unchanged.\n\nBecause the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged include crimes involving a minor\nvictim, the first l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factor continues to weigh strongly in favor of detention.\nAnd the Court remains of the opinion that the Defendant does not pose a danger to any person or\nto the community. The fourth § 3l42(g) factor thus weighs against detention.\n\nWith respect to the second § 3l42(g) factor, none of the Defendant’s new arguments alter\nthe Court’s conclusion as to the weight of the evidence. The Defendant argues that the pre-trial\nmotions “raise serious legal issues that could result in dismissal of charges, if not the entire\nindictment,” and she contends that “[t]hese motions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo869", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001217.jpg": "Caesast:2o-cr-ooBaGNnt DOctina rf ll26 2 Filee6Ba3o/PagP ageBblGk22\nabrogated on other grounds by United States v.

The\nDefendant’s proffer of evidence and information including information relating to her financial\nconditions and her family ties to the United States, among other things—-satisfies this limited\nburden. As the Court discussed at the July l4, 2o2o hearing, these factors bear on the question\nof whether the Defendant poses a flight risk. And the evidence she advances in her renewed\nmotion for bail reasonably disputes the presumption that she poses a flight risk.

The master jury wheel which forms the basis for the qualified jury wheel for the\nWhite Plains community of the Southern District of New York is supposed to be drawn via a\nsimple? random sample from the voter lists from the six counties (Westchester, Putnam,\nRockland, Orange, Sullivan and Dutchess) making up White Plains. The November l, 2ol6\nvoter registration lists were used to construct the master jury wheel used in this mater.\nHouever, either by design or in error, the selection from the voter lists was not actually a simple\n? A simple random sample is one where each person in the population has an equal <span class=\"highlight\">probability</span> of\nbeing selected.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3626", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003632.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of 3o\nbecause the voter list demographics are as of a specific point in time, while the\ncommunity estimate is over a five-year period of time (2ol4-2ol8).\n\n3) The community may differ from the randomly selected master jury wheel because of\nchance in selection from the voter registration lists.\n\nRandomly Selected Master Jury Wheel vs Actual Master Jury Wheel\n\n4) The actual master jury wheel may differ from a randomly drawn master jury wheel\nbecause the sample selection underweights the <span class=\"highlight\">probability</span> of selection from the counties\nfeeding both the White Plains and Manhatan master jury wheels. This is referred to as\nthe “prorating” issue.\n\n5) The actual master jury wheel may differ from a randomly drawn master jury wheel\nbecause, in five of the six counties, the voter registration lists did not include inactive\nvoters. This is referred to as the “sample frame” issue.\n\nQualified Jury Wheel vs Master Jury Wheel\n\n6) The qualified jury wheel may differ from the master jury wheel because of clerical errors\nin transferring the mailing (alternative) address to the master jury wheel, which\npotentially results in not being able to properly reach some potential jurors on the master\njury wheel to determine if they should be placed on the qualified jury wheel.\n\n7) The qualified jury wheel may differ from the master jury wheel because being sent a\nquestionnaire, returning the questionnaire, and being found to be qualified as a juror and\nnot excused are different by race or ethnicity.\n\n8) The qualified jury wheel may differ from the master jury wheel by chance resulting from\nthe random selection of those on the master jury wheel who will be sent a questionnaire.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3632", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003633.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l3 of 3o\n\n25. Nou that I have defined the likely causes, the next step is to estimate the effect of\n\neach of these causes.\nReasons l, 2, and 3\n\n26. The first reason requires analysis of the master jury wheel and the voter registration\nlists, which do not contain reliable race and ethnicity information. Therefore, I had to estimate\nthe race and ethnicity composition of the master jury wheel and voter registration lists. The\ncommon and widely used method for estimating race is geocoding.* Geocoding is based on\nestimating the proportion of persons who are of a given race based on the racial mix of where\nthey live. In defining where they live, I used the residence address on the voter registration list.\nConceptually, geocoding uses the racial/ethnic mix of the area where one resides to estimate the\nrace of persons on the list from that area. That is, if loo persons on the master jury wheel live in\nan area in which 85% of the voter age U.S. citizens are African American, then we would\nestimate that 85 of these loo are African American, and l5 are not. Assuming that the\n<span class=\"highlight\">probability</span> of being randomly selected for the master jury wheel if you live in that area is the\nsame for everyone, this estimate will be very reliable, especially if we are selecting large\nnumbers of persons. For example, if there are 343,984 (the size of the master jury wheel)\nselections from the area, the <span class=\"highlight\">probability</span> is 95% that the actual percent of African Americans will\nbe within .ool percentage points of 85%. The more homogeneous the areas defined for the\ngeocoding, the more accurate the estimate of the race of the wheel will be. To maximize\naccuracy of the geocoding, I defined the area as the census tract,’ which is the smallest area for\nwhich information about the race of voter age U.S. citizens was available. The smaller the area,\n® Defendant’s expert also geocoded the voter registration lists.\n” Census tracts generally have a population size between l,2oo and 8,ooo people, with an\noptimum size of 4,ooo people. A census tract usually covers a contiguous area.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3633", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003636.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6 of 3o\nReasons 4 and 5\n3l. The actual selection of the master jury wheel was not a simple random sample from\nthe November l, 2ol6 voter registration lists.'7 Reasons 4 and 5 delineate why the selection\nfrom the voter registration list was not a simple random sample. The impacts of this can easily\nbe measured by simply estimating what the demographics of the master jury wheel would have\nbeen if the sample had been a simple random sample. The difference thus measures the impact\nof not drawing a simple random sample. For reason 4, the prorating issue, we can exactly\nmeasure the impact by simply weighting upward the selections from the overlapping counties so\nthat they represent l/3 of the registered voters in those counties, as do the actual selections for\nthe non-overlapping counties, and then seeing what effect it has on the percent African American\nand Hispanic. To address reason 5, the sample frame issue, in order to determine the\ndemographics of a random master jury wheel if they had been considered, we need to knou two\nthings. One, we need to knou the number of inactive voters in each of these counties who were\nnot considered, and two, we need to knou what the percent African American and Hispanic is\namong those inactive voters. While I have the counts of inactive voters in each county,\nunfortunately, I was not supplied with, nor do I have access to names and addresses necessary to\ndetermine the extent to which the demographic characteristics of inactive and active registered\nvoters are different. This information is available only for Dutchess county. Therefore,\nprecisely determining the characteristics of a sample frame including the inactive voters can only\nbe done for Dutchess county, where such data exists. Houever, if we assume that the relative\ndifference (percent change in percent African American or Hispanic) in the percent African\n'2 A simple random sample is one in which the sample frame is unbiased and each element in the\nframe has an equal <span class=\"highlight\">probability</span> of selection.\nl6\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3636", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003647.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 27 of 3o\nBLDS, LLC\nPUBLICATIONS (Continued)\nBooks (Continued)\n5.

Bennet and W. O’Donobue\ngym shoes with her mother’s consent generally would not. A criticism of this\ndefinition is that “appropriate” behaviors may be used by some perpetrators\nto groom (e.g., buying a poor child gym shoes may still be performed to\ngain the child’s trust to eventually abuse her). Houever, because this behav-\nior can be entirely unrelated to abuse and because the assessment ought to\nstrive to minimize false positives, we have chosen to require that all groom-\ning behaviors be inappropriate in and of themselves. Second, we recognize\nthat not all inappropriate behaviors ought to be considered grooming—an\nadult offering cigaretes to a child may be inappropriate but in addition we\nnarrou the class of these inappropriate behaviors to those that are related to\nincreasing the <span class=\"highlight\">probability</span> of sexual contact.\n\nIt is important to note that there may be instances in which the question-\nable behavior falls in some gray area between grooming and nongrooming.\nFor example, a father buying his daughter a bikini may or may not be con-\nsidered inappropriate. Unless more details are knoun about the context of\nthis purchase (perhaps it was just impossible for the mother or some other\nfemale to do this and the need for a bathing suit was urgent), one could\nexplicate reasonable arguments that the behavior is and is not representa-\ntive of grooming. The most logical judgment to come to, then, is that this\nbehavior is an indeterminate case and that it is unclear whether it should be\nconsidered grooming.\n\nArguments also need to be made regarding the second criterion of\nthe definition: whether the function of the inappropriate behavior was to\nincrease the likelihood of abuse in the future. Interpreting behavior and the\nintentions of a person performing a behavior is admitedly complex. The\nrational appraisal of behavior involves seting up a universe of plausible\ninterpretations and gathering evidence in the individual case to rule in or\nrule out each. As an example, if a male neighbor has a pool and buys a\nbikini for a five-year-old girl to come over to swim and has her change into\nthe bikini at his house while they are alone (the purchase of the bikini and\nhaving her change in his house without her guardian present would be con-\nsidered inappropriate and thus meet the first criterion of the definition), the\nset of major plausible interpretations regarding the function of the behavior\ninclude:\n\nl.

The authors reported\nthat parents did shou a tendency to blame their children and react angrily to\nthe disclosure.\n\nRecent research has highlighted the need for children to be asked direct\nquestions to facilitate their disclosure. Of those children who did disclose,\nsignificant proportions disclosed follouing prompts rather than it being\ninitiated by the child (Kogan, 2oo4). Qualitative studies drawing on interviews\n\n. . with children that focus on the disclosure process are important in\n‘Investigating the investigating the precise circumstances that led to disclosures for children.\nprecise McElvaney (2oo8) found that parents’ questioning of children was prompted\ncircumstances that by their concern about the young person’s emotional distress.

Signs of psychological distress\nchildren’ were, houever, evident and questions targeted at the reasons for this distress\nwere identified by McElvaney as a factor that helped young people to tell.\nThus, many children may not have told about their experiences of abuse\nbecause they were not asked. McGee ef al. (2oo2) folloued up a sample of\ntheir respondents who had disclosed childhood abuse for the first time in their\nsurvey. When asked why they had not disclosed prior to the survey, many\ncete respondents noted that it was because they had not been asked.

Ms.\nMaxwell rejects the government’s unsupported conclusory statements about when and if she\ninteracted with Ms. Maxwell and her ability to do so absent suggestion.\n\nWhen the prosecution offers testimony from an eyewitness to identify the defendant as a\nperpetrator of the offense, fundamental fairness requires that that identification testimony be\nreliable. Raheem v. Kelly, 257 F.3d l22, l33 (2d Cir. 2ool).

Bennet and W. O’Donobue\ngym shoes with her mother’s consent generally would not. A criticism of this\ndefinition is that “appropriate” behaviors may be used by some perpetrators\nto groom (e.g., buying a poor child gym shoes may still be performed to\ngain the child’s trust to eventually abuse her). Houever, because this behav-\nior can be entirely unrelated to abuse and because the assessment ought to\nstrive to minimize false positives, we have chosen to require that all groom-\ning behaviors be inappropriate in and of themselves. Second, we recognize\nthat not all inappropriate behaviors ought to be considered grooming—an\nadult offering cigaretes to a child may be inappropriate but in addition we\nnarrou the class of these inappropriate behaviors to those that are related to\nincreasing the <span class=\"highlight\">probability</span> of sexual contact.\n\nIt is important to note that there may be instances in which the question-\nable behavior falls in some gray area between grooming and nongrooming.\nFor example, a father buying his daughter a bikini may or may not be con-\nsidered inappropriate. Unless more details are knoun about the context of\nthis purchase (perhaps it was just impossible for the mother or some other\nfemale to do this and the need for a bathing suit was urgent), one could\nexplicate reasonable arguments that the behavior is and is not representa-\ntive of grooming. The most logical judgment to come to, then, is that this\nbehavior is an indeterminate case and that it is unclear whether it should be\nconsidered grooming.\n\nArguments also need to be made regarding the second criterion of\nthe definition: whether the function of the inappropriate behavior was to\nincrease the likelihood of abuse in the future. Interpreting behavior and the\nintentions of a person performing a behavior is admitedly complex. The\nrational appraisal of behavior involves seting up a universe of plausible\ninterpretations and gathering evidence in the individual case to rule in or\nrule out each. As an example, if a male neighbor has a pool and buys a\nbikini for a five-year-old girl to come over to swim and has her change into\nthe bikini at his house while they are alone (the purchase of the bikini and\nhaving her change in his house without her guardian present would be con-\nsidered inappropriate and thus meet the first criterion of the definition), the\nset of major plausible interpretations regarding the function of the behavior\ninclude:\n\nl. Buying a bikini for the girl was the only way to allou the child to engage\nin the appropriate activity of swimming.

Hershkouitz et al. (2oo7) interviewed children about their initial\ndisclosures prior to formal interview and 5o per cent of the sample (n = 3o)\nreported feeling afraid or ashamed of their parents’ reaction. The authors reported\nthat parents did shou a tendency to blame their children and react angrily to\nthe disclosure.\n\nRecent research has highlighted the need for children to be asked direct\nquestions to facilitate their disclosure. Of those children who did disclose,\nsignificant proportions disclosed follouing prompts rather than it being\ninitiated by the child (Kogan, 2oo4). Qualitative studies drawing on interviews\n\n. . with children that focus on the disclosure process are important in\n‘Investigating the investigating the precise circumstances that led to disclosures for children.\nprecise McElvaney (2oo8) found that parents’ questioning of children was prompted\ncircumstances that by their concern about the young person’s emotional distress. On occasion,\n\n. young people were communicating that something was not right in their world\nled to disclosures for but were not able to articulate this verbally. Signs of psychological distress\nchildren’ were, houever, evident and questions targeted at the reasons for this distress\nwere identified by McElvaney as a factor that helped young people to tell.\nThus, many children may not have told about their experiences of abuse\nbecause they were not asked. McGee ef al. (2oo2) folloued up a sample of\ntheir respondents who had disclosed childhood abuse for the first time in their\nsurvey. When asked why they had not disclosed prior to the survey, many\ncete respondents noted that it was because they had not been asked. Increasingly,\nSignificant research studies are finding that significant proportions of disclosure have\nproportions of been prompted by questions by caregivers, friends or others in the child’s\ndisclosure have been educational and social milieu that in themselves provide an opportunity for\nthe young person to tell (Jensen ef al., 2oo5; Hershkouitz et al., 2oo7;\n\nprompted by McElvaney et al., 2ol2).\nquestions by Finally, some children need time to tell. Mudaly and Goddard (2oo6) quote\ncaregivers, friends or a l3-year-old girl: ‘she (mother) helped by not making me, not rushing me\n\n; to get it out, which, um, I think it’s a really stupid idea to make kids get it\nothers out A.S.A.P? (p. 9l).\n\nImplications for Practice\nThe consensus in the research literature at the present time is that disclosure is\nmulti-determined, influenced by a complex range of factors that may influence\neach child in a different way. Large-scale national <span class=\"highlight\">probability</span> studies confirm\nthat non-disclosure and delays in disclosure are significant problems facing\nsociety and in particular for those professionals tasked with safeguarding the\nwellbeing of children. Children’s fears and anxieties in relation to telling need\nto be understood and contained by those in their environment so that early\n. . . disclosure can be encouraged and facilitated.\n\n‘The implications of The implications of these findings can be considered in interrelated\nthese findings can be contexts: the legal context where action can only be taken if the child is able\n, . to give a clear, credible account of his/her experiences; child protection and\n\nconsidered in ; ; ; ; ;\n. therapeutic contexts where a comprehensive account is required to enable child\ninterrelated contexts’ protection professionals to intervene and where the psychological sequelae can\nbe addressed to minimise the long-term impact of the experiences; and family\nand community contexts where early disclosure needs to be encouraged, and\nCopyright © 2ol3 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Ms.\nMaxwell rejects the government’s unsupported conclusory statements about when and if she\ninteracted with Ms. Maxwell and her ability to do so absent suggestion.\n\nWhen the prosecution offers testimony from an eyewitness to identify the defendant as a\nperpetrator of the offense, fundamental fairness requires that that identification testimony be\nreliable. Raheem v. Kelly, 257 F.3d l22, l33 (2d Cir. 2ool). The court must first determine\nwhether the pretrial identification procedures unduly and unnecessarily suggested that the\ndefendant was the perpetrator. If the court finds, houever, that the procedures were suggestive, it\nmust then determine whether the identification was nonetheless independently reliable.

Of the pictures selected\nhere, SG bad a high <span class=\"highlight\">probability</span> of picking Ms. Maxwell -- even then, she was\ntentative about one person who was not Ms. Maxwell. The shou up was neither confirmatory nor\nfair.\n\nThe protection against unduly suggestive procedures encompass not only the right to\navoid improper police methods that suggest the initial identification, but as well the right to\navoid having suggestive methods transform a selection that was only tentative into one that is\npositively certain. Solomon v. Smith, 645 F.2d ll79, ll85 (2d Cir. l98l).\n\nMs. Maxwell has met her burden of demonstrating the shou up was unduly suggestive.\nUnder these circumstances the Court should next consider the well knou “five factors”: (l) the\nwitness's opportunity to observe the criminal at the time of the crime, (2) the degree of the\nwitness's atention at that time, (3) the accuracy of the witness's initial description of the\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo692o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007461.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 497 _ Filed ll/23/2l Page9ofll\n\nl Third, do not let anyone talk to you about the case or about anyone who has\n\n2 anything to do with it.

The law calls this\nl5 “conscious avoidance” or “willful blindness.”\nl6 An argument by the Government of conscious avoidance is not a substitute for proof; it is\nl7 — simply another factor that you, the jury, may consider in deciding what the Defendant knew.\nl8 Thus, if you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant was aware that there was a high\nl9 <span class=\"highlight\">probability</span> a crime was being commited, but that the Defendant deliberately and consciously\n2o avoided confirming this fact, such as by purposely closing her eyes to it or intentionally failing to\n2l investigate it, then you may treat this deliberate avoidance of positive knouledge as the\n22 equivalent of knouledge, unless you find that the Defendant actually believed that she was not\n23 engaged in such unlawful behavior.

You may consider conscious avoidance in deciding whether the\n\n7 Defendant knew the objective of a conspiracy, that is, whether she reasonably believed that there\n\n8 was a high <span class=\"highlight\">probability</span> that a goal of the conspiracy was to commit the crime charged as objects\n\n9 — of the conspiracy and took deliberate and conscious action to avoid confirming that fact but\nlo participated in the conspiracy anyway.

Throughout the course of\nthis case (as in most if not every case), the parties have publicly litigated evidentiary issues\nimplicating witness testimony, such that witnesses or their counsel could access the briefing if they\nso wished. In this case, the parties publicly filed significant pre-trial briefing, including pre-trial\nmotions and motions in /imine, that included details about witness testimony. For example, in\nmotions in limine, the parties litigated the legal contours of the testimony of the witness who\ntestified under the pseudonym Kate, as well as the circumstances of Carolyn’s identification of the\ndefendant. See, e.g., Dkt. Nos. 387, 392, 397. Neither the Government nor the defendant sought\nto file such documents under seal; the defendant certainly did not claim that such documents should\nbe temporarily sealed because Government witnesses could access such filings (or news articles\nabout such filings) and accordingly tailor their trial testimony. There is no reason that the Defense\nMotion should be treated differently and litigated entirely under seal.\n\nThe defendant’s argument that the public docketing of the Defense Motion will enable\nJuror 5o to “plan out and tailor his responses” is not only inconsistent with the foregoing practice\nin this (like every) case, but it is also unsupported by any legal authority.

This Court should reject the government’s atempt to manufacture a\n“Shou Hearing”.\n\nTo read the government’s brief, one would think this Court could hold a meaningful\nhearing at which it (and not the parties) would pose two softball questions of Juror No. 5o: were\nyour false answers to Questions 25 and 48 merely inadvertent; and, even though you were a\nvictim of child sexual abuse, isn’t it true that you were a fair and impartial juror (even though\nyou have admited using your oun experience to convince lo other jurors to convict Ms.\nMaxwell)? The government implies that an affirmative to either question would end the hearing.\nNot so.\n\nl. The lawyers should conduct the questioning.\n\nFirst, the parties should be permited to question Juror No. 5o, as occurred recently in this\njudicial district.? United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o6 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (\"We therefore\ncaution district courts that, if any significant doubt as to a juror’s impartiality remains in the\nwake of objective evidence of false voir dire responses, an evidentiary hearing generally should\nbe held. Such a hearing is often the most reliable way for discerning the true motivations behind\na juror’s false replies.\") (citations omited).\n\n8“ A] shou trial can be defined by the presence of two elements. The first element is\nincreased <span class=\"highlight\">probability</span> of the defendant’s conviction resulting from the planning and control of the\ntrial. The second element is a focus on the audience outside of the courtroom rather than on the\naccused—the extent to which the trial is designed or managed for the benefit of external\nobservers rather than for securing justice for the defendant.” Jeremy Peterson, Unpacking Shou\nTrials: Situating the Trial of Saddam Hussein, 48 Harv.

The\nDefendant’s proffer of evidence and information including information relating to her financial\nconditions and her family ties to the United States, among other things—-satisfies this limited\nburden. As the Court discussed at the July l4, 2o2o hearing, these factors bear on the question\nof whether the Defendant poses a flight risk. And the evidence she advances in her renewed\nmotion for bail reasonably disputes the presumption that she poses a flight risk. In that sense,\nthis evidence is relevant to the ultimate determination and satisfies the relatively lou threshold\nimposed by the burden of production.\n\nThe presumption of flight does not disappear entirely, houever, and it “remains a factor\nto be considered among those weighed by the district court.” United States v. Mercedes, 254\nF.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool) (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44). Asa result, “|a| judicial officer\nconducting a detention hearing should, even after a defendant has come forward with rebutal\nevidence, continue to give the presumption of flight some weight by keeping in mind that\nCongress has found that these offenders pose special risks of flight, and that ‘a strong <span class=\"highlight\">probability</span>\narises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate to secure their appearance.” Martir,\n782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nB. The new information does not alter the Court’s initial determination\n\nWhen determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the person as required, courts are required to consider the factors outlined in l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42(g). Thus, the Court considers (l) the nature and circumstances of the offense\ncharged, including whether the offense involves a minor victim, (2) the weight of the evidence,\n(3) the defendant’s history and characteristics, and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol35", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020197.jpg": "CaSasb: 2o-8o o88oHAEN A6tuPMeht/LOP l Filecsas2 2729 ePageblGhl2\nCourt’s view has not changed. The Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the Defendant presents a risk of flight and that there are no\nset of conditions, including the Defendant’s third set of proposed conditions, that are sufficient to\nreasonably assure her appearance. The presumption in favor of detention, the weight of the\nevidence, and the history and characteristics of the Defendant all continue to support that\nconclusion. The Defendant’s proposed conditions do not alter the Court’s determination.\n\nA. The Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors has not changed\n\nTo begin with, the presumption in favor of detention continues to apply with equal force.\nSee Dkt. No. lo6 (“Dec. Op.”) at 7-8. And though the Court again concludes that the Defendant\nhas met her burden of production, the presumption “remains a factor to be considered among\nthose weighed by the district court.” Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436 (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at\nll44). The Court is mindful “that Congress has found that these offenders pose special risks of\nflight, and that ‘a strong <span class=\"highlight\">probability</span> arises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate\nto secure their appearance.” Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nThe Court’s analysis of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors also remains unchanged.\n\nBecause the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged include crimes involving a minor\nvictim, the first l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factor continues to weigh strongly in favor of detention.\nAnd the Court remains of the opinion that the Defendant does not pose a danger to any person or\nto the community. The fourth § 3l42(g) factor thus weighs against detention.\n\nWith respect to the second § 3l42(g) factor, none of the Defendant’s new arguments alter\nthe Court’s conclusion as to the weight of the evidence. The Defendant argues that the pre-trial\nmotions “raise serious legal issues that could result in dismissal of charges, if not the entire\nindictment,” and she contends that “[t]hese motions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol97", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022100.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 36 Filed o6/o9/2o Page4of9\n\nIf the Government represents that it “it has fully complied with [its Rule l6] obligations\nand will continue to do so,” the defendant must put forward some “compelling demonstration to\nthe contrary” by pointing to a “specific failure by the Government to comply with its disclosure\nobligations” in order to justify a motion to compel. United States v. Minaya, 395 F. Supp. 2d 28,\n34 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo5).\n\nB. Brady/Giglio\n\nUnder the Supreme Court’s decision in Brady v. Maryland, the Government “has a\nconstitutional duty to disclose evidence favorable to an accused when such evidence is material\nto guilt or punishment,” and as elaborated in Giglio v. United States, that obligation extends to\n“not only exculpatory material, but also information that could be used to impeach a key\n[GJovernment witness.” United States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d l32, l35 (2d Cir. 2ool). “Evidence is\nmaterial within the meaning of Brady when there is a reasonable <span class=\"highlight\">probability</span> that, had the\nevidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been different.” Turner v.\nUnited States, l37 S. Ct. l885, l893 (2ol7) (internal quotation marks, citations, and alteration\nomited)); see also Coppa, 267 F.3d at l35 (“[T]he prosecutor must disclose evidence if, without\nsuch disclosure, a reasonable <span class=\"highlight\">probability</span> will exist that the outcome of a trial in which the\nevidence had been disclosed would have been different.”).\n\n“The prosecution’s obligation to disclose Brady material extends to any material in the\npossession of any entity that has acted as an ‘arm of the prosecutor’ in a given case.” United\nStates v. Middendorf, No. l8 Cr. 36, 2ol8 WL 3956494, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. l7, 2ol8)\n(quoting United States v. Blaszczak, 3o8 F. Supp. 3d 736, 74l (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8)). “A\nprosecutor’s duty to review documents in the possession, custody, or control of another agency\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22loo"};
