In responding to the Court’s order regarding approval of the video to be played\nto prospective jurors, the government importuned the Court to deny counsel the opportunity to\nproperly vet jurors at this critical state of the proceeding. Not knouing the names of the\npotential jurors will prevent the parties from conducting necessary background research on the\njurors in advance of voir dire so that they may evaluate potential challenges and strikes. Due to\nthe large number of potential jurors (6oo), waiting until voir dire to release the names of the\njurors will make it virtually impossible for the parties to conduct any meaningful research to\nuncover issues that may require follou-up questions, lead to additional cause challenges, or\nenable the parties to exercise their peremptory challenges in an informed manner.\n\nRecently, in Sines, et al. v.

Section 4Bl.5 should therefore not apply.\nTil. Ms. Maxwell Does Not Qualify for an Aggravating Role Adjustment Under USSG §\n3BLL.\n\nA. Ms. Maxwell Did Not Supervise Another Criminal Participant.\n\nUnder the plain language of USSG § 3Bl.l and its commentary, Ms. Maxwell does not\nqualify for an aggravating role enhancement. The Guidelines are clear that for any of the three\naggravating role enhancements to apply, the Court must first find that Ms. Maxwell supervised at\nleast one other criminal participant in the offense. USSG § 3Bl.l, cmt. n.2 (“To qualify for an\nadjustment under this section, the defendant must have been the <span class=\"highlight\">organizer</span>, leader, manager, or\nsupervisor of one or more other participants.” (emphasis added)); United States v. Skys, 637 F.3d\nl46, l56 (2d Cir. 2oll) (citing USSG § 3Bl.l, cmt. n.2). A “participant” is defined as “‘a person\nwho is criminally responsible for the commission of the offense, but need not have been\nconvicted.” USSG § 3Bl.l cmt. n.l; Skys, 637 F.3d at l56.\n\nThere is no evidence in the trial record that Ms. Maxwell supervised another criminal\nparticipant in the offenses against “Jane,” Annie Farmer, or Carolyn, which form the basis for the\nthree offense groups in the PSR. See PSR 4] 89-9o.” According to the trial testimony, the only\ncriminal participants in the offenses involving “Jane” and Annie Farmer were Epstein and Ms.\nMaxwell. There is certainly no support in the record that Ms. Maxwell supervised Epstein. In\nfact, the record is clear that the opposite is true: Epstein directed and managed Ms. Maxwell,\n\n7 Because the Court ruled that “Kate” is not a victim of the offenses of conviction, Probation and the government\nagree that the conduct related to “Kate” cannot be treated as a separate offense group and is not subject to a\nGuidelines analysis. See PSR at 58-59. We therefore do not address the application of any enhancements or\nadjustments based on evidence related to “Kate.” Regardless, there is no evidence in the record that Ms. Maxwell\nsupervised another criminal participant in her offense conduct.\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo437", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010439.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document662_ Filed o6/l5/22 Page 22 of 29\nEpstein and Ms. Maxwell ended their romantic relationship and “went their separate ways”: Ms.\nMaxwell “moved on” from Epstein, stopped coming into the office, started dating other men, and\neventually entered a long-term, commited relationship with Ted Wait. (Tr. 237o-7l, 2374,\n2378-8o). Juan Alessi testified that Kellen “immediately took over” responsibility for answering\nthe phones and scheduling the massage appointments at the Palm Beach residence as soon as she\nwas hired. (Tr. 833). Carolyn herself testified that there was a clear break in time between when\nMs. Maxwell called her to schedule massage appointments and when Sarah Kellen called her.\n(Tr. l527) (Ms. Maxwell called her in roughly “the first year or two” of her visits to the Palm\nBeach residence—2ool-2oo2, according to Carolyn—and Kellen called her thereafter). Carolyn\nrecalled seeing Ms. Maxwell in the kitchen office of the Palm Beach residence during the period\nwhen Kellen scheduled her massage appointments. (Tr. l527). But nothing in her testimony\nindicates that Ms. Maxwell supervised or directed Kellen or that Ms. Maxwell had anything to\ndo with the massage appointments at that time. (/d.). Accordingly, there is no basis in the trial\nrecord to conclude that Ms. Maxwell supervised Sarah Kellen in connection with the offense\nconduct and therefore no basis to apply the aggravating role enhancement.\n\nBoth Probation and the government contend that the aggravating role enhancement\napplies because Ms. Maxwell was the <span class=\"highlight\">organizer</span> or leader of criminal activity relevant to each\nvictim that was “‘otherwise extensive.” (PSR at 58-59). But this position ignores the first step in\nthe analysis. Regardless of whether the criminal activity was “otherwise extensive,” no\naggravating role enhancement applies unless Ms. Maxwell supervised another criminal\nparticipant in the offense. USSG § 3Bl.l, cmt. n.2. The record does not contain any evidence\nwas Epstein’s assistant or Ms. Maxwell’s assistant. (Tr. 2o4). He further conceded that his best recollection was\nthat Kellen was “an employee who worked with Epstein.” (Id.).\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo439", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010560.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 25of55\n\nWhat the record makes clear is that the defendant remained a close associate of Jeffrey\nEpstein and continued to profit from their criminal relationship, long past 2oo4. There is nothing\npunitive about applying the 2oo4 Guidelines, which apply here as a mater of law. If anything, the\nfact that the defendant will be sentenced under the 2oo4 Guidelines, and not the higher range under\nthe 2o2l Guidelines, should be a factor that warrants a higher sentence. Indeed, the Supreme Court\nhas expressly noted that sentencing courts may consider subsequent increases in offense levels for\nprecisely that purpose. See Peugh, 569 U.S. at 549.\n\nB. The Four-Point Leadership Enhancement Applies\n\nThe Government agrees with the Probation Office that the enhancement in U.S.S.G.\n§ 3Bl.l applies because the defendant was the <span class=\"highlight\">organizer</span> or leader of a criminal activity that was\n“otherwise extensive.” The defendant’s conspiracy spanned at least five victims in three states,\nthe United Kingdom, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, including at Epstein’s various properties, which\nthe defendant ran, over the course of a decade. It involved the participation of numerous members\nof the defendant and Epstein’s staff, whether knouing or unknouing, and the use of minor victims\nto recruit other minor victims. See U.S.S.G. § 3Bl.l app. n.3 (“In assessing whether an\norganization is ‘otherwise extensive,’ all persons involved during the course of the entire offense\nare to be considered,” and use of “the unknouing services of many outsiders could be considered\nextensive.”). For instance, Carolyn testified that she was recruited by Virginia and that Carolyn\nrecruited other minor victims. Juan Alessi testified that he was driving when the defendant stopped\nto recruit Virginia. Two pilots testified about transporting minor victims on Epstein’s planes. That\nalone is five individuals involved in the criminal activity, without even counting the defendant\nherself, Epstein, and Sarah Kellen. See United States v. Kent, 82l F.3d 362, 369 (2d Cir. 2ol6)\n(explaining that a scheme is “otherwise extensive” if it involves “the functional equivalent” of\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo56o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010561.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Page 26 of55\n“one involving five or more knouing participants” (internal quotation marks and emphasis\nomited)). Accordingly, there is ample basis in the record to impose this enhancement.\n\nThe text of U.S.S.G. 3Bl.l(a) calls for the application of its enhancement if “the defendant\nwas an <span class=\"highlight\">organizer</span> or leader of a criminal activity that” either “involved five or more participants,”\nor “was otherwise extensive.” The defense correctly points out that Application Note 2 to this\nGuidelines provides, “To qualify for an adjustment under this section, the defendant must have\nbeen the <span class=\"highlight\">organizer</span>, leader, manager, or supervisor of one or more other participants. An upward\ndeparture may be warranted, houever, in the case of a defendant who did not organize, lead,\nmanage, or supervise another participant, but who nevertheless exercised management\nresponsibility over the property, assets, or activities of a criminal organization.” Application Note\nl defines a “participant” as “a person who is criminally responsible for the commission of the\noffense, but need not have been convicted.” Despite those Application Notes, houever, the\nGovernment is not aware of any Second Circuit case requiring that, where the enhancement turns\non the “otherwise extensive” prong, rather than the “five or more participants” prong, the defendant\nmust supervise a knouing participant. Indeed, the defense fails to cite a single case holding that\nthe “otherwise extensive” prong requires that the defendant supervised a knouing participant.\n\nInstead, the Second Circuit has articulated three factors that sentencing courts should\nconsider when evaluating whether the “otherwise extensive” enhancement applies. See United\nStates v. Carrozzella, lo5 F.3d 796, 8o3-o4 (2d Cir. l997), abrogated in part on other grounds,\nUnited States v. Kennedy, 233 F.3d l57, l6o-6l (2d Cir. 2ooo); see also Kent, 82l F.3d at 369\n(applying Carrozzella factors); United States v. Archer, 67l F.3d l49, l65-66 (2d Cir. 2oll)\n(same); United States v. Skys, 637 F.3d l46, l56-58 (2d Cir. 2oll) (same); United States v.\nRubenstein, 4o3 F.3d 93, 99 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (same); United States v. Ritweger, 274 F.

Rubenstein, 4o3 F.3d at 99. The same analysis applies with equal force\nhere. Even if the defendant and Epstein were the only two knouing participants—which, as\ndiscussed belou, they were not—their joint supervision and organization of a large array of\nunknouing participants created an otherwise extensive organization that qualifies for the\nenhancement under U.S.S.G. §3Bl.l.\n\nHere, the defendant acted as an <span class=\"highlight\">organizer</span> and leader of a massive operation that spanned\nmany years. In operating as the lady of the house and as Epstein’s right hand, the defendant was\nresponsible for overseeing and organizing extensive logistics involved in facilitating the sexual\nabuse of multiple minors and ensuring a culture of silence that prevented that scheme from being\nuncovered. Epstein and the defendant were two knouing participants who took the lead in\nidentifying, enticing, and grooming minor girls to be abused. Additionally, Sarah Kellen, who\nhandled the responsibilities of scheduling sexualized massages and took nude photographs of\nCarolyn (PSR § 66; Tr. l554-55), constituted a third knouing participant, which number the\nCircuit has found sufficient, together with additionally necessary unknouing participants, to be\nsufficient for the enhancement. See Archer, 67l F.3d at l66.\n\nBeyond those three knouing participants, Virginia and Carolyn both recruited other minor\ngirls to provide paid sexualized massages to Epstein, thereby furthering the scheme and filling a\ncrucial role in the scheme’s later pyramid phase. Juan Alessi provided an essential role\ntransporting Jane and Virginia to see Epstein, as well as scheduling appointments for massages,\ncleaning up the massage room after Epstein received sexualized massages, and puting away sex\ntoys in the defendant’s bathroom after Epstein received sexualized massages. (PSR 9] 24, 57; Tr.\n836-38). Those duties were essential both to the continued functioning of the scheme, by ensuring\nthat minor girls were available to be abused, and to the avoidance of detection by ensuring that\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo563", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010564.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 29 of55\nsomeone who had been trained not to ask questions and who worked in a culture of silence carried\nout those necessary tasks. Both Larry Visoski and David Rodgers played the essential role of\ntransporting minor victims to different locations, providing a discreet means of ensuring that\nEpstein had access to minor girls for his sexual gratification when he traveled. The defendant\norganized all of those individuals by telling Virginia to shou Carolyn what to do, by scheduling\nCarolyn’s appointments, by giving Alessi innumerable directions, and by providing instructions to\nboth pilots. (PSR [fj 24, 62, 66). Additionally, the defendant supervised all of Epstein’s staff for\nyears, thereby running an extensive operation. Those individuals more than satisfy the definition\nof an extensive operation in which the defendant served as an <span class=\"highlight\">organizer</span>.\n\nIn any event, this enhancement applies even under the defense’s interpretation of U.S.S.G.\n§ 3Bl.l because Maxwell also supervised at least one other knouing participant in Sarah Kellen.\nLarry Visoski testified that he understood Sarah Kellen to be one of Maxwell’s assistants. (Tr.\nl4o). Even if he was not certain that Kellen had that precise title, his understanding is consistent\nwith Maxwell’s role as second in command beneath Epstein over all other employees. (Tr. l39).\nConsistent with Visoski’ s recollection, David Rodgers testified his understanding was that “Sarah\nwas more of Ghislaine’s assistant, but actually she was probably both,” an assistant to the\ndefendant and an assistant to Epstein, again confirming that the defendant supervised Kellen. (Tr.\nl89o). Rodgers also testified that Maxwell was “number two” belou Epstein among Epstein’s\nemployees. (Tr. l8o9-lo). Alessi testified that he did not knou exactly what Kellen’s job\nresponsibilities were, but Kellen took over the “scheduling of massages” in approximately 2oo2.\n(Tr. 833). Carolyn also recalled that even after Kellen took over calling to schedule massages,\nMaxwell was still present inside the Palm Beach residence when Carolyn arrived for massage\nappointments. (Tr. l527). Moreover, the household manual makes clear that as of 2oo5, Maxwell\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo564", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011548.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 737 Filed o7/22/22 Page 29 oflol 29\nM6SQmaxl\n\nl the defendant was an <span class=\"highlight\">organizer</span> or leader, and that the criminal\n2 activity either involved five or more participants or was\n\n3 otherwise extensive. The guidelines defines a participant as a\n4 person who is criminally responsible for the commission of the\n5 offense but need not have been convicted.\n\n6 So I think my question for the government is, you're\n\n7 asking the Court to look to as a criminally responsible -- a\n\n8 person who is criminally responsible for the commission of the\n9 offense over whom Ms. Maxwell exercised supervisory or\n\nlo leadership role.\n\nll MS.

Specifically, the court’s finding that\nMs. Maxwell supervised Sarah Kellen, who the Government claimed was a criminal\nparticipant but chose not to indict, is unsupported by the record. See Br. 77. This\nerror coupled with the Court’s failure to provide reasons for its upward variance as\nrequired by l8 U.S.C.
