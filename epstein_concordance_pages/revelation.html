The Court Should Grant a Bill of Particulars.\n\nA bill of particulars is appropriate if the indictment does not disclose to the defendant\nwith sufficient particularity “the nature of the charge pending against him, thereby enabling\ndefendant to prepare for trial, to prevent surprise, and to interpose a plea of double jeopardy\nshould he be prosecuted a second time for the same offense.” United States v. Bortnovsky, 82o\nF.2d 572, 574 (2d Cir. l987). Here, the <span class=\"highlight\">revelation</span> of new allegations from Accuser-3 disclosed\nfor the first time in the government’s opposition, as well as the government’s continuing refusal\nto identify the names of the three accusers, justify the need for a bill of particulars to prevent\nunfair surprise at trial and to allou Ms. Maxwell to adequately prepare her defense.\n\nFirst, as it has done since the beginning of this case, the government continues to deny\nMs. Maxwell the most basic piece of information she needs to investigate the allegations against\nher and prepare for trial — the names of the three individuals who have accused her of the crimes\ncharged in the Indictment. Rather than atempt to justify withholding this information out of\nconcer for the accusers’ safety or privacy—an untenable argument, given that two of the three\naccusers, if we are correct about their identities, have already publicly identified themselves—the\ngovernment instead argues that because it has provided enough information for Ms. Maxwell to\nguess who they are, there is no need to disclose their names at this point. (Opp. l8l-82). Ms.\nMaxwell should not have to rely on guesswork to prepare for trial, especially when the testimony\nof these three accusers will comprise the core of the government’s proof. With trial only four\nmonths away, Ms. Maxwell’s need to have sufficient time to investigate the allegations against\nher vastly outweighs any countervailing interest the accusers may have in remaining anonymous.\nIf the government is unwilling to provide the names of the accusers, the Court should order the\ngovernment to do so either as part of a bill of particulars or pursuant to its inherent authority to\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4233", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004235.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 287 Filed o5/2o/2l Page8ofl6\nThese new allegations—which expand the nature and scope of the charged\nconspiracies—are exactly the type of “surprise” revelations that a bill of particulars is designed\nto protect against. The Indictment makes no mention of these allegations, nor is there any\ninformation in the discovery indicating that they would be part of the government’s case. The\ngovernment therefore cannot argue, as it does in its opposition, that the information provided in\nthe Indictment and the discovery produced to date are sufficient for Ms. Maxwell to understand\nthe nature of the charges against her, especially when only a small fraction of the discovery\npertains to the time period charged in the Indictment. (Opp. l79-8l). “The Government [does]\nnot fulfill its obligation merely by providing mountains of documents to defense counsel” if the\ndiscovery does not identify the alleged criminal conduct.” Bortnovsky, 82o F.2d at 575; see also\nUnited States v.

Such experiences are of a highly\npersonal nature, the <span class=\"highlight\">revelation</span> of which in a public courtroom could lead to embarrassment and\nemotional distress. As a result, issues relevant to this case need to be addressed in a sensitive\nand private seting.\n\nThe jury selection procedures normally used by this Court — l.e., group voir dire with\nquestioning exclusively by the judge — pose heightened problems to an effective and informative\nvoir dire in a case involving topics that are difficult to discuss, let alone in a large public forum.\nIt is typically anxiety producing and discomforting for jurors to make public disclosures. This\ncase amplifies the likelihood that jurors will be more apprehensive and constrained to respond\nopenly and honestly in open court within earshot of other jurors, members of the public, and the\nmedia.\n\nIV. ATTORNEY-CONDUCTED VOIR DIRE PERMITS A MORE INFORMED\n\nEXERCISE OF FOR CAUSE AND PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES\n\nRule 24(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure grants the Court broad discretion in\nconducting the voir dire examination. The Court has the right to control who conducts the voir\ndire and has the discretion to allou atorneys to conduct some, or all, of the voir dire. Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 24(a)(l) and (2) (“The court may examine prospective jurors or may permit the atorneys\nfor the parties to do so.”).\n\nThe Court should grant a limited period of atorney-conducted voir dire after the Court's\ngeneral voir dire because it will yield more complete information about the potential jurors for\nthe proper exercise of peremptory challenges. For a peremptory challenge to serve its purposes, it\nmust be intelligently exercised. This requires that the parties obtain sufficient information from\nthe potential jurors upon which to base their challenges. United States v. Ledee, 549 F.2d 99o,\n993 (Sth Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 9o2 (l977) (“Peremptory challenges are worthless if trial\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52l6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005219.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Pagel4ofl7\nfor the court's evaluation, ‘merely going through the form of obtaining jurors’ assurances of\nimpartiality is insufficient [to test that impartiality]”) (citation omited).\n\nBecause it is extremely likely that prospective jurors have been exposed to potentially\nprejudicial pretrial publicity, specific, individual voir dire is required. Davis, 583 F.2d at l96-97.\nTo increase the likelihood that any hidden prejudices of the jurors will be uncovered, to\naccomplish the goal of exercising sensitive and intelligent peremptory challenges, and to ensure\nthat a fair and impartial jury is empaneled in this case, counsel should be given an opportunity to\nindividually examine prospective jurors.\n\nIndividual sequestered voir dire conducted jointly by counsel and the Court has a variety\nof benefits. It invites a conversation rather than posing an interrogation. It eliminates the pressure\non jurors to provide socially desirable or acceptable answers in a group seting, reduces\nconformity pressures that can diminish candor, and removes the risk of other jurors being\ninfluenced by statements made during group voir dire that enable them to either stay on the jury\nor be removed for cause. It increases juror comfort, minimizes the anxiety of public speaking,\nencourages candor, and promotes honesty.\n\nFurthermore, questioning conducted exclusively by the Court further hampers the ability\nto uncover important information about jurors because it places jurors in a subordinate position\nheightening their reluctance to be candid. Atorney-conducted questioning bridges the status gap\nbetween the humble layperson and the honorable judicial officer exalted high above the venire.\nResearch indicates that expansive voir dire yields greater revelations of juror bias;? and in-depth\natorney-conducted voir dire combined with individual sequestered voir dire elicits greater\n3 See, e.g., Moran, Cutler & Loftus.

We respectfully request leave from the Court\nto file a brief amicus curiae on the issue of the impact of the post-trial revelations and admissions from\nJuror # 5o on whether the Defendant in this case received the guaranteed right to a fair trial and what relief\nis required. Specifically, NACDL would address the increased importance of writen or oral voir dire in\nhigh-profile criminal cases and/or those with sensitive issues central to a case that could reflect a juror’s\nbias or potential for extraneous issues being brought into jury deliberations, the impact of inaccurate\nanswers to questions asked to expose potential bias for further questioning and the exercise of strikes,\nwhether and when a court should consider the deliberateness in a potential juror providing inaccurate\ninformation and the process by which such issues should be explored once they have been disclosed.\n\nIn support of this request to file a brief amicus curiae, proposed amici state the follouing:\n\nl. NACDL is a nonprofit voluntary professional bar association made up of and working on\nbehalf of criminal defense atorneys to ensure justice and due process for those accused of crime or\nmisconduct.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo89l8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009029.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 28 of 66\nC.

Ironically, her level of flight risk increases as the strength of government’s case\nagainst her diminishes. Ms. Maxwell has challenged the strength of the government’s case\nin pretrial motions pending before the Court. Among other things, Ms. Maxwell has\npersuasively argued that the Non-Prosecution Agreement entered into by Jeffrey Epstein in\n2oo7, which immunizes “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” bars Ms. Maxwell’s\nprosecution in this case, and that the counts charging her with alleged sexual abuse are\ntime-barred.\n\nThe government’s response to Ms. Maxwell’s pretrial motions shines further light\nof the weaknesses of its case. For example, the government concedes it cannot establish that\neither Ms. Maxwell or Epstein ever caused, or sought to cause, Accuser-3* to travel while she\nwas a minor or that she was underage when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein.\n(See Opp.l62-65 & fn. 57-58.)° Hence, her allegations cannot support the conspiracies charged\nin the Indictment, leaving the government with only two witnesses to prove the charges against\nMs. Maxwell. More importantly, in connection with the government’s response, it\nproduced documents indicating that government prosecutors misled a federal judge to\nobtain evidence against Ms. Maxwell (see, e.g.,.
