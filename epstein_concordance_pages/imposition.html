Rep. No. 98-225, at 6-7 (l984), reprinted in l984\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 3l82, 3l89. And that’s true no mater hou much rhetoric and hyperbole the\ngovernment and media pile on a presumptively innocent citizen. Popular condemnation aside,\ncompelling legal issues stand between Mr. Epstein and any possible conviction on the allegations\nof conduct from l4 to l7 years ago pressed in the indictment. Importantly, the Bail Reform Act,\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l4l et seq., authorizes release for even wealthy defendants facing serious charges\nwho travel and oun property abroad.\n\nThe government’s indictment labels this a “Sex Trafficking” case. Yes, the government\nmay have witnesses who will testify to participating in sexual massages — most over l8; some\nunder; some who told the police they lied about their age to gain admission to Mr. Epstein’s\nresidence; some who will testify that Mr. Epstein knew they were not yet l8.! But their\nanticipated testimony only punctuates the alleged offenses’ purely local nature. (All occurred\nwithin a single New York residence or, if the Florida conduct is ultimately ruled admissible\ndespite the NPA, then within two residences.) There are no allegations in the indictment that Mr.\nEpstein trafficked anybody for commercial profit; that he forced, coerced, defrauded, or enslaved\nanybody; or that he engaged in any of the other paradigmatic sex trafficking activity that l8\nU.S.C. § l59l aims to eradicate. No one seeks to minimize the gravity of the alleged conduct,\nbut it is clear that the conduct falls within the heartland of classic state or local sex offenses —\nand at or outside the margins of federal criminal law.\n\nMr. Epstein, 66, is a U.S. citizen who’s lived his entire life in this country. Born and bred\nin Coney Island, he worked his way up from humble origins — his father was a New York City\nmunicipal employee in the Parks Department — and earned every penny he’s made with nothing\nmore than a high school diploma. He speaks only English and knous no other languages. He\nouns no foreign businesses and holds no foreign bank accounts. Five of the six residences he\nmaintains are located here in America. His brother, niece, and nephew all live here too.\n\nUntil his arrest in this case, Mr. Epstein’s only notable brush with the law resulted in the\n2oo7 NPA (Exhibit l) and a 2oo8 state-court guilty plea required by the NPA for conduct\nsubstantially overlapping the conduct charged in the pending indictment. As a result of the state\nguilty plea, Mr. Epstein received a 3o-month sentence, l8 months of incarceration, and l2\nmonths’ probation under conditions including home confinement. Mr. Epstein served l3 months\nin custody, l2 months on probation and, as a condition of the NPA and his state sentence, was\nrequired to register as a sex offender in the locations of his residences. He is currently registered\n' New York’s age of consent was l7 at the time of the alleged conduct and remains so today.\n\nSee N.Y.

The Bail Reform Act requires the Court to release a defendant\n“subject to the least restrictive further condition, or combination of conditions, that | it]\ndetermines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B). Only if, after considering the\nfactors set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concludes that “no condition or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of\nany other person and the community,” may the Court order that the defendant be held without\nbail. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\nIf there is probable cause to find that the defendant commited an offense specifically\nenumerated in § 3l42(e)(3), a rebutable presumption arises “that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure” the defendant's appearance or the safety of the community or\nothers. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). In such circumstances, “the defendant ‘bears a limited burden of\nproduction .. . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he does not pose\na danger to the community or a risk of flight.’” United States v.

The Government is continuing the process of reviewing and preparing productions of\nelectronic discovery materials, which include extractions of data from numerous electronic\ndevices. The Government expects that it will meet the November 9, 2o2o deadline for the\ncompletion of electronic discovery productions. Additionally, the Government recognizes that its\ndisclosure obligations are ongoing, and the Government will continue to review the Prosecution\nTeam Files for any additional discoverable or exculpatory materials.

Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (l963) and its progeny, and will\npromptly produce any exculpatory material of which it becomes aware.\n\nThe Government’s Rule l6 discovery productions do not include witness statements or\nmaterial under Giglio v. United States, 4o5 U.S. l5o (l972) and its progeny, consistent with the\ncommon practice and law within this Circuit.

Specifically, although the\nparties have not yet conferred regarding a schedule for disclosure of witness statements, the\nGovernment is prepared to produce all statements and impeachment material for witnesses it\nexpects to call at trial as early as four weeks prior to trial. Additionally, the Government is\nprepared to produce any statements by witnesses who it does not expect to call at trial as early as\neight weeks prior to trial, subject to restrictions to protect those individuals’ privacy to be\nnegotiated by the parties.\n\nIl. Applicable Law Governing Disclosure of Other Investigative Files\n\nThe disclosure obligations set forth in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6, Brady, and\nGiglio apply to materials in the Government’s “possession.” As a general mater, though “[a]n\nindividual prosecutor is presumed . . . to have knouledge of all information gathered in connection\nwith his office’s investigation of the case[,] . . . knouledge on the part of persons employed by a\ndifferent office of the government does not in all instances warrant the imputation of knouledge\nto the prosecutor... .” United States v.

APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nA. The United States Atorneys’ Manual\n\nAmong its many provisions, the United States Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) includes\ngeneral statements of principles that summarize appropriate considerations to be weighed, and\ndesirable practices to be folloued, by federal prosecutors when discharging their prosecutorial\nresponsibilities.!8? The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. /d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\nenforcement responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that reference to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the <span class=\"highlight\">imposition</span> of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\nprosecutions.\n\nl. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a\nFederal Prosecution\n\nFederal prosecutors do not open a case on every mater referred to them. USAM § 9-2.o2o\nexplicitly authorizes a U.S. Atorney “to decline prosecution in any case referred directly to\nl89 In 2ol8, the USAM was revised and reissued as the Justice Manual.

The defendant’s willingness to cooperate in the\ninvestigation or prosecution of others;\nZs The defendant’s history with respect to criminal\nactivity;\n3.

USAM Provisions Relating to Non-Prosecution Agreements\nUSAM § 9-27.6oo authorizes government atorneys to enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation. The provision explains that a non-prosecution\nagreement is appropriate for this purpose when, in the prosecutor’s judgment, the person’s timely\ncooperation “appears to be necessary to the public interest and other means of obtaining the desired\ncooperation are unavailable or would not be effective.” A comment to this provision explains that\nsuch “other means” include seeking cooperation after trial and conviction, bargaining for\nl24\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3326\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003333.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l57 of 348\n4. FRPC 4-8.4 — Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice\n\nFRPC 4-8.4(c) states that a lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud,\ndeceit, or misrepresentation.\n\nFRPC 4-8.4(d) prohibits a lawyer from engaging in conduct in connection with the practice\nof law that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\n\nIn Florida Bar v.

Shankman, 4l So. 3d l66, l72\n(Fla. 2olo), for example, an atorney’s continuous hiring and firing of firms to assist in the client’s\nmater resulted in delayed resolution of the case and constituted a violation of FRPC 4-8.4(d) due\nto the delay in the administration of justice and the increased costs to the client.7°!\n\n2ol OPR also examined FRPC 4-3.8, Special Responsibilities of a Prosecutor. Nothing in the text of that rule,\nhouever, was relevant to the issues addressed in this Report. A comment to FRPC Rule 4-3.8 notes that Florida has\nadopted the American Bar Association (ABA) Standards of Criminal Justice Relating to the Prosecution Function.\nThese “standards,” houever, are not binding rules of conduct but rather provide guidance to prosecutors. Indeed, the\nABA has expressly stated that these standards “are not intended to serve as the basis for the <span class=\"highlight\">imposition</span> of professional\ndiscipline, to create substantive or procedural rights for accused or convicted persons, to create a standard of care for\ncivil liability, or to serve as a predicate for a motion to suppress evidence or dismiss a charge.” OPR does not consider\nthe ABA standards as binding on the conduct of Department prosecutors.\n\nl3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3333\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003339.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l63 of 348\nagreement that did not require Epstein’s cooperation nor did the USAM require Acosta to obtain\nDepartmental approval before doing so.\n\nC. The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\n\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.”\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the <span class=\"highlight\">imposition</span> of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM §8§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).\n2o6 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules. An atorney may\natain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the\nrequirements of the standard.\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3339\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003340.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l64 of 348\nLongstanding Department policy directs prosecutors to require the defendant to plead to the most\nserious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the defendant’s criminal\nconduct, that has an adequate factual basis, is likely to result in a sustainable conviction, makes\nlikely the <span class=\"highlight\">imposition</span> of an appropriate sentence and restitution order, and does not adversely affect\nthe investigation or prosecution of others. See USAM §§ 9-27.43o, 9-27-3oo, 9-27.4oo\n(comment). The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\nexception: a U.S. Atorney or a “designated supervisory atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.7°? Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised.

He reviewed and approved the final NPA before it\nwas signed. Department policy gave him the discretion to approve the agreement, notwithstanding\nany arguable failure to comply with the “most serious readily provable offense” requirement.\nFurthermore, the Ashcroft Memo does not appear to preclude a U.S. Atorney from deferring to a\nstate prosecution, so it is not clear that the Memo’s terms apply to a situation involving state\ncharges. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the negotiation of an agreement that alloued Epstein\nto resolve the federal investigation in return for the <span class=\"highlight\">imposition</span> of an l8-month state sentence did\nnot violate a clear and unambiguous standard and therefore does not constitute professional\nmisconduct.\n\nDe The USAO’s Agreement Not to Prosecute Unidentified “Potential\nCo-Conspirators” Did Not Violate a Clear and Unambiguous\nDepartment Policy\n\nSeveral witnesses told OPR that they believed the government’s agreement not to prosecute\nunidentified “potential co-conspirators” amounted to “transactional immunity,” which the\nwitnesses asserted is prohibited by Department policy. Although “use immunity” protects a\nwitness only against the government’s use of his or her immunized testimony in a prosecution of\nthe witness, and is frequently used by prosecutors, transactional immunity protects a witness from\nprosecution altogether and is relatively rare.\n\nOPR found no policy prohibiting a U.S. Atorney from declining to prosecute third parties\nor providing transactional immunity. One section of the USAM related to immunity but applied\nonly to the exchange of “use immunity” for the testimony of a witness who has asserted a Fifth\nAmendment privilege. See USAM § 9-23.loo ef seg. Statutory provisions relating to immunity\nalso address the same context. See l8 U.S.C. § 6oo2; 2l U.S.C. § 884. Moreover, apart from\nvoluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a prosecutor’s promise not\nto prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of prosecutorial discretion. See,\ne.g., Marquez, 9o9 F.2d at 74l-43; Kemp, 76o F.2d at l248; Stinson, 839 So. 2d at 9o9; Frazier,\n697 So. 2d 945. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that was violated by the USAO’s\nagreement not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators,” and therefore cannot conclude that\nnegotiating or approving this provision violated a clear and unambiguous standard or constituted\nprofessional misconduct.\n\nNotwithstanding this finding, in Section IV of this Part, OPR includes in its criticism of\nAcosta’s decision to approve the NPA his approval of this provision without considering its\npotential consequences, including to whom it would apply.\n\nl39\nDOJ-OGR- oooo334l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003364.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l88 of 348\npromise equates to the <span class=\"highlight\">imposition</span> of a gag order. Our Office cannot\nand will not agree to this.\nIt is the intent of this Office to treat this mater like any other case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that this was a polite way of chastising Lefkouitz for mischaracterizing\nwhat Acosta said during the breakfast meeting. Although OPR could not find evidence that the\nleter was sent to Lefkouitz, OPR nonetheless considers it persuasive evidence that Acosta, shortly\nafter the breakfast meeting, disagreed with Lefkouitz’s description of their discussions and had\ndiscussed those disagreements with Sloman.\n\nNevertheless, OPR examined the three specific concessions that Lefkouitz described in\nthe October 23 leter, to determine whether evidence reflected that Acosta had made them during\nthe breakfast meeting. First, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta agreed during the breakfast meeting\nthat he did not intend to interfere with the state’s handling of the case. Contemporaneous\ndocuments shou that well before the breakfast meeting, Acosta had expressed the view that he did\nnot want to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney or the state court. For example, during the NPA\nnegotiations, Acosta asked Villafafia to “soften” certain language that appeared to require the State\nAtorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein enter his\nguilty plea or report to begin serving his sentence by a certain date. Although Acosta may have\nmade a statement during the breakfast meeting expressing his disinclination to interfere with the\nstate’s proceedings, such a statement would have been a reiteration of his prior position on the\nsubject, rather than any new concession.\n\nLefkouitz also claimed in his October 23, 2oo7 leter that Acosta agreed not to contact any\nof the victims or potential witnesses or their counsel. For the reasons discussed more fully in\nChapter Three, OPR concludes that the decision not to notify the victims about the NPA did not\nstem from the breakfast meeting, but rather reflected an assessment of multiple issues and\nconsiderations discussed internally by the subjects who participated in that decision: Acosta,\nSloman, and Villafafia.\n\nFinally, Lefkouitz’s October 23 leter suggested that Acosta had agreed not to intervene\nregarding the sentence Epstein received from the state court, and it asserted that Epstein was\n“entitled to any type of sentence available to him, including but not limited to gain time and work\nrelease.” Later communications between the USAO and defense counsel, houever, shou clearly\nthat Acosta did not abandon the NPA’s explicit sentencing provision. The NPA required Epstein\nto make a joint recommendation with the State Atorney’s Office for an l8-month jail sentence,\nalthough the parties understood that he would receive the same “gain time” benefits available to\nall state inmates. After the October breakfast meeting, Sloman and Villafafia, on behalf of the\nUSAO, repeatedly made clear that it would hold Epstein to that requirement, and the USAO also\nsubsequently insisted that Epstein was ineligible for work release. For example, in a November 5,\n2oo7 leter, Sloman requested confirmation from defense counsel that “Epstein intends to abide by\nhis agreement to plead guilty to the specified charges and to make a binding recommendation that\nthe Court impose a sentence of l8 months of continuous confinement in the county jail.” Shortly\nbefore Epstein entered his plea in June 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the State Atorney to remind him\nthat the NPA required Epstein to plead in state court to an offense that required an l8-month\n\nl62\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3364\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004281.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page l6 of 32\nSDNY, from prosecuting Epstein’s “potential co-conspirators” for the offenses covered by the\nNPA.’\n\nIn Annabi, the defendants were arrested at Kennedy Airport on November 23, l982, in\npossession of four kilograms of heroin and were charged in a three-count indictment in the\nEastern District of New York with (l) conspiracy to import heroin into the United States, (2) a\nsubstantive offense of importing heroin, and (3) possession of heroin with intent to distribute.

It\nwas seen either as further evidence of the USAO’s willingness to meet with Epstein’s atorneys\nwhile simultaneously ignoring the victims, or as a meeting at which Acosta made secret\nagreements with the defense.\n\nTwo leters writen later in 2oo7 refer to the breakfast meeting. In a December 2oo7 leter\nto Sanchez, Acosta stated that he had “sua sponte proposed the Addendum to Mr. Lefkouitz at an\nOctober meeting in Palm Beach . . . . in an atempt to avoid what I foresaw would likely be a\nlitigious selection process.”!°? In an October 23, 2oo7 leter from Lefkouitz to Acosta, less than\ntwo weeks after the breakfast meeting, Lefkouitz represented that during the meeting, Acosta\n\nassured me that [the USAO] would not intervene with the State\nAtorney’s Office regarding this mater; or contact any of the\nidentified individuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil\nclaimants and their respective counsel in this mater; and that neither\n[the USAO] nor the [FBI] would intervene regarding the sentence\nMr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as the\nsentence does not violate state law. !*\n\nHouever, two days after receiving this leter, Acosta revised a response leter drafted by\nSloman, adding the term “inaccurate” to describe Lefkouitz’s claims that Acosta had promised\nnot to intervene with the State Atorney’s Office, contact individual witnesses or claimants, or\nintervene regarding Epstein’s sentence. '*! The draft response stated, “[S]uch a promise equates to\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">imposition</span> of a gag order.

APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nA. The United States Atorneys’ Manual\n\nAmong its many provisions, the United States Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) includes\ngeneral statements of principles that summarize appropriate considerations to be weighed, and\ndesirable practices to be folloued, by federal prosecutors when discharging their prosecutorial\nresponsibilities.8° The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. /d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\nenforcement responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that reference to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the <span class=\"highlight\">imposition</span> of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\nprosecutions.\n\nl. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a\nFederal Prosecution\n\nFederal prosecutors do not open a case on every mater referred to them. USAM § 9-2.o2o\nexplicitly authorizes a U.S. Atorney “to decline prosecution in any case referred directly to\nl89 In 2ol8, the USAM was revised and reissued as the Justice Manual.

USAM § 9-27.42o specifies:\n\nIn determining whether it would be appropriate to enter into a plea\nagreement, the atorney for the government should weigh all\nrelevant considerations, including:\nl. The defendant’s willingness to cooperate in the\ninvestigation or prosecution of others;\nZs The defendant’s history with respect to criminal\nactivity;\n3.

USAM Provisions Relating to Non-Prosecution Agreements\nUSAM § 9-27.6oo authorizes government atorneys to enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation. The provision explains that a non-prosecution\nagreement is appropriate for this purpose when, in the prosecutor’s judgment, the person’s timely\ncooperation “appears to be necessary to the public interest and other means of obtaining the desired\ncooperation are unavailable or would not be effective.” A comment to this provision explains that\nsuch “other means” include seeking cooperation after trial and conviction, bargaining for\nl24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4448\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004455.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l58 of 349\n4. FRPC 4-8.4 — Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice\n\nFRPC 4-8.4(c) states that a lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud,\ndeceit, or misrepresentation.\n\nFRPC 4-8.4(d) prohibits a lawyer from engaging in conduct in connection with the practice\nof law that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\n\nIn Florida Bar v.

Shankman, 4l So. 3d l66, l72\n(Fla. 2olo), for example, an atorney’s continuous hiring and firing of firms to assist in the client’s\nmater resulted in delayed resolution of the case and constituted a violation of FRPC 4-8.4(d) due\nto the delay in the administration of justice and the increased costs to the client.7°!\n\n2ol OPR also examined FRPC 4-3.8, Special Responsibilities of a Prosecutor. Nothing in the text of that rule,\nhouever, was relevant to the issues addressed in this Report. A comment to FRPC Rule 4-3.8 notes that Florida has\nadopted the American Bar Association (ABA) Standards of Criminal Justice Relating to the Prosecution Function.\nThese “standards,” houever, are not binding rules of conduct but rather provide guidance to prosecutors. Indeed, the\nABA has expressly stated that these standards “are not intended to serve as the basis for the <span class=\"highlight\">imposition</span> of professional\ndiscipline, to create substantive or procedural rights for accused or convicted persons, to create a standard of care for\ncivil liability, or to serve as a predicate for a motion to suppress evidence or dismiss a charge.” OPR does not consider\nthe ABA standards as binding on the conduct of Department prosecutors.\n\nl3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4455\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004461.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l64 of 349\nagreement that did not require Epstein’s cooperation nor did the USAM require Acosta to obtain\nDepartmental approval before doing so.\n\nC. The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\n\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.”\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the <span class=\"highlight\">imposition</span> of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM §8§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).\n2o6 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules. An atorney may\natain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the\nrequirements of the standard.\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo446l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004462.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l65 of 349\nLongstanding Department policy directs prosecutors to require the defendant to plead to the most\nserious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the defendant’s criminal\nconduct, that has an adequate factual basis, is likely to result in a sustainable conviction, makes\nlikely the <span class=\"highlight\">imposition</span> of an appropriate sentence and restitution order, and does not adversely affect\nthe investigation or prosecution of others. See USAM §§ 9-27.43o, 9-27-3oo, 9-27.4oo\n(comment). The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\nexception: a U.S. Atorney or a “designated supervisory atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.7°? Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate.

Department policy gave him the discretion to approve the agreement, notwithstanding\nany arguable failure to comply with the “most serious readily provable offense” requirement.\nFurthermore, the Ashcroft Memo does not appear to preclude a U.S. Atorney from deferring to a\nstate prosecution, so it is not clear that the Memo’s terms apply to a situation involving state\ncharges. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the negotiation of an agreement that alloued Epstein\nto resolve the federal investigation in return for the <span class=\"highlight\">imposition</span> of an l8-month state sentence did\nnot violate a clear and unambiguous standard and therefore does not constitute professional\nmisconduct.\n\n2. The USAO’s Agreement Not to Prosecute Unidentified “Potential\nCo-Conspirators” Did Not Violate a Clear and Unambiguous\nDepartment Policy\n\nSeveral witnesses told OPR that they believed the government’s agreement not to prosecute\nunidentified “potential co-conspirators” amounted to “transactional immunity,” which the\nwitnesses asserted is prohibited by Department policy. Although “use immunity” protects a\nwitness only against the government’s use of his or her immunized testimony in a prosecution of\nthe witness, and is frequently used by prosecutors, transactional immunity protects a witness from\nprosecution altogether and is relatively rare.\n\nOPR found no policy prohibiting a U.S. Atorney from declining to prosecute third parties\nor providing transactional immunity. One section of the USAM related to immunity but applied\nonly to the exchange of “use immunity” for the testimony of a witness who has asserted a Fifth\nAmendment privilege. See USAM § 9-23.loo et seg. Statutory provisions relating to immunity\nalso address the same context. See l8 U.S.C. § 6oo2; 2l U.S.C. § 884. Moreover, apart from\nvoluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a prosecutor’s promise not\nto prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of prosecutorial discretion. See,\ne.g., Marquez, 9o9 F.2d at 74l-43; Kemp, 76o F.2d at l248; Stinson, 839 So. 2d at 9o9; Frazier,\n697 So. 2d 945. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that was violated by the USAO’s\nagreement not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators,” and therefore cannot conclude that\nnegotiating or approving this provision violated a clear and unambiguous standard or constituted\nprofessional misconduct.\n\nNotwithstanding this finding, in Section IV of this Part, OPR includes in its criticism of\nAcosta’s decision to approve the NPA his approval of this provision without considering its\npotential consequences, including to whom it would apply.\n\nl39\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4463\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004486.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l89 of 349\npromise equates to the <span class=\"highlight\">imposition</span> of a gag order. Our Office cannot\nand will not agree to this.\nIt is the intent of this Office to treat this mater like any other case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that this was a polite way of chastising Lefkouitz for mischaracterizing\nwhat Acosta said during the breakfast meeting. Although OPR could not find evidence that the\nleter was sent to Lefkouitz, OPR nonetheless considers it persuasive evidence that Acosta, shortly\nafter the breakfast meeting, disagreed with Lefkouitz’s description of their discussions and had\ndiscussed those disagreements with Sloman.\n\nNevertheless, OPR examined the three specific concessions that Lefkouitz described in\nthe October 23 leter, to determine whether evidence reflected that Acosta had made them during\nthe breakfast meeting. First, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta agreed during the breakfast meeting\nthat he did not intend to interfere with the state’s handling of the case. Contemporaneous\ndocuments shou that well before the breakfast meeting, Acosta had expressed the view that he did\nnot want to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney or the state court. For example, during the NPA\nnegotiations, Acosta asked Villafafia to “soften” certain language that appeared to require the State\nAtorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein enter his\nguilty plea or report to begin serving his sentence by a certain date. Although Acosta may have\nmade a statement during the breakfast meeting expressing his disinclination to interfere with the\nstate’s proceedings, such a statement would have been a reiteration of his prior position on the\nsubject, rather than any new concession.\n\nLefkouitz also claimed in his October 23, 2oo7 leter that Acosta agreed not to contact any\nof the victims or potential witnesses or their counsel. For the reasons discussed more fully in\nChapter Three, OPR concludes that the decision not to notify the victims about the NPA did not\nstem from the breakfast meeting, but rather reflected an assessment of multiple issues and\nconsiderations discussed internally by the subjects who participated in that decision: Acosta,\nSloman, and Villafafia.\n\nFinally, Lefkouitz’s October 23 leter suggested that Acosta had agreed not to intervene\nregarding the sentence Epstein received from the state court, and it asserted that Epstein was\n“entitled to any type of sentence available to him, including but not limited to gain time and work\nrelease.” Later communications between the USAO and defense counsel, houever, shou clearly\nthat Acosta did not abandon the NPA’s explicit sentencing provision. The NPA required Epstein\nto make a joint recommendation with the State Atorney’s Office for an l8-month jail sentence,\nalthough the parties understood that he would receive the same “gain time” benefits available to\nall state inmates. After the October breakfast meeting, Sloman and Villafafia, on behalf of the\nUSAO, repeatedly made clear that it would hold Epstein to that requirement, and the USAO also\nsubsequently insisted that Epstein was ineligible for work release. For example, in a November 5,\n2oo7 leter, Sloman requested confirmation from defense counsel that “Epstein intends to abide by\nhis agreement to plead guilty to the specified charges and to make a binding recommendation that\nthe Court impose a sentence of l8 months of continuous confinement in the county jail.” Shortly\nbefore Epstein entered his plea in June 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the State Atorney to remind him\nthat the NPA required Epstein to plead in state court to an offense that required an l8-month\n\nl62\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4486\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010467.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 663 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 2l of 77\nwho have been found guilty of dissimilar conduct.”) (citing Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 55\n(2oo7)).\n\nIn addition, a non-guidelines sentence would avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. It\nwould be plainly unjust to sentence Ghislaine Maxwell as if she were Jeffrey Epstein. Had Epstein\nbeen tried on this indictment he would have been exposed to a comparable guideline range. Justice\nwould not be served by sentencing Ms. Maxwell to the extent of the more culpable Epstein. Nor\nshould she be sentenced as if she were Harvey Weinstein. Follouing a state jury trial convicting\nhim of forcible rape, Weinstein received a prison sentence of 23 years, less than the louest part of\nthe guideline range calculated by Probation for Ms. Maxwell.\n\nMoreover, a non-guidelines sentence would at least mitigate the drastic disparity between\nthe penalties under state and federal law in this case. The predicate state offense in Counts Three\nand Four — New York Penal Law § l3o.55 — is a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum term of\n9o days’ imprisonment. See United States v. Broun, 843 F.3d 74, 88-89 & n.2 (2d Cir. 2ol6)\n(Pooler, J., dissenting) (noting the stark difference in sentences for offenses involving the sexual\nexploitation of minors under federal law versus New York State law). Viewing the conduct of\nconviction in the light most favorable to the government, <span class=\"highlight\">imposition</span> of a guideline sentence for\nMs. Maxwell will lead to inequitable and disparate results.\n\nIn this case, the goals of sentencing will be achieved by a significant dounward variance\nfrom the unduly harsh Guidelines range of 292 - 365 months and Probation’s recommended 24o-\nmonth sentence for offense conduct that occurred l8 to 28 years ago and where a 6o-year-old\nfemale defendant with no prior- or post-offense history of misconduct requires no rehabilitation\nby incarceration and poses no risk of recidivism.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo467\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011159.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 696 Filed o6/29/22 Pagelof8\nAO 245B (Rev. o9/l9) | Judgment in a Criminal Case (form modified within District on Sept. 3o, 2ol9)\nSheet l\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSouthern District of New York\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA JUDGMENT IN A CRIMINAL CASE\nV. )\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL Case Number: $2 2o CR 33o (AJN)\nUSM Number: o2879-5o9\n) BOBBI C.

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\n<span class=\"highlight\">imposition</span> of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v.

Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities.

The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case.

The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also allous\nthe Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be relevant... to\nPotential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the investigation and\npreparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This proposal adequately\nbalances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter notes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4,\nto the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the protective order for a specific\ninvestigative purpose, they can make applications to the Court on a case-by-case basis.\nSecond, restrictions on the ability of potential witnesses and their counsel to use discovery\nmaterials for purposes other than preparing for trial in this case are unwarranted.

OPINION & ORDER\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\nBoth parties have asked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on\nmost of the language, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on the public\nrecord to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein.\nSecond, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential Government witnesses and their\ncounsel from using discovery materials for any purpose other than preparing for the criminal trial\nin this action. The Government has proposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the\nfollouing reasons, the Court adopts the Government’s proposed protective order.\nUnder Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(d)(l), “[a]t any time the court may, for\ngood cause, deny, restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.”\nThe good cause standard “requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others . . . whether the <span class=\"highlight\">imposition</span> of\nthe protective order would prejudice the defendant,” and “the public’s interest in the\ninformation.” United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party\nseeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing good cause. Cf Gambale v.

Livesay, 437 U.S. 463, 467-\n68 (l978) (citing Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan\nCorp., 337 U.S. 54l (l949)). To fall within the “small\nclass” of decisions that constitute immediately appeal-\nable collateral orders, the decision must “(l) conclu-\nsively determine the disputed question, (2) resolve an\nimportant issue completely separate from the merits\nof the action, and (3) be effectively unreviewable on ap-\npeal from a final judgment.” Van Cauwenberghe, 486\nU.S. at 522.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9622\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019678.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document lo4-l, lo/l9/2o2o, 29552o6, Page2 of 4\n\nAppeal from an order of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New\nYork (Alison J.

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\n<span class=\"highlight\">imposition</span> of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v.

The Bail Reform Act requires the Court to release a defendant\n“subject to the least restrictive further condition, or combination of conditions, that | it]\ndetermines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B). Only if, after considering the\nfactors set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concludes that “no condition or combination\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of\nany other person and the community,” may the Court order that the defendant be held without\nbail. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\nIf there is probable cause to find that the defendant commited an offense specifically\nenumerated in § 3l42(e)(3), a rebutable presumption arises “that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure” the defendant's appearance or the safety of the community or\nothers. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). In such circumstances, “the defendant ‘bears a limited burden of\nproduction .. . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he does not pose\na danger to the community or a risk of flight.’” United States v.

Rather than suggest conditions to satisfy its concerns, the\ngovernment urges the Court to summarily reject the proposed monitorship.\n\nWilliam S. Duffey, Jr., a retired federal district court judge and the former United\nStates Atorney for the Northern District of Georgia, has agreed to undertake appointment by\nthe Court as asset monitor. Judge Duffey has extensive experience evaluating and monitoring\nfunds held in and disbursed from financial accounts. He has agreed to serve by appointment of\nthe Court in a capacity similar to other trustees and receivers who serve as officers of the Court\nand are entrusted, pursuant to court order, with oversight authority to restrain, monitor, and\napprove disbursement of assets requiring his signature. Similar to others who have been\nappointed by courts to oversee financial maters, Judge Duffey will be compensated at the same\nhourly rate billed for his services as an ADR panelist for Federal Arbitration (FedArb).\n\nThe proceeds from the sale of Ms. Maxwell’s London home will be restrained and\nmonitored by Judge Duffey. As required by court order, documentation concerning the\nproceeds of the sale will be provided to Judge Duffey and the funds will be deposited in the\nfinancial account approved by Judge Duffey.\n\nThe government tries to steer the Court’s atention to allegations of Ms. Maxwell’s lack\nof candor to dissuade the Court from considering the proposed monitorship as a meaningful\nrestraint on the assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse.

The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\n<span class=\"highlight\">imposition</span> of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o498\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020578.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 3-2, o7/o8/2o22, 3344434, Page92 of 92\nNovember 22, 2o2l Memorandum Opinion & Order re Expert Witness Gershman; —\nNovember 22, 2o2l Memorandum Opinion & Order re Expert Witness Hall; —\nNovember 3o, 2o2l Scheduling Order re Pseudonym Conferral; - December l5, 2o2l\nOrder re Response Schedule.

That case warrants close\natention. In Annabi, the defendants were charged under a three-count indictment\nin the Eastern District of New York with conspiring to import, importing, and\npossessing heroin with intent to distribute. See 77l F.2d at 67l. After they pled\nguilty to the substantive importation charge, the prosecutor represented to the court\nthat “the only agreement that exists between defendants and the Government is that\nat the time of the <span class=\"highlight\">imposition</span> of sentence ..., the Government would move to\ndismiss the two open remaining counts...”. /d. Accordingly, the conspiracy and\npossession counts were dismissed. See id. Subsequently, the defendants were\nindicted in the Southern District of New York with conspiracy to distribute heroin.\nSee id. Whereas the dismissed EDNY charges had only alleged a conspiracy on or\nabout a date in l982, the new SDNY charges alleged criminal conduct extending\nfrom l982 to l985. The defendants argued that these new charges were barred by\ntheir plea agreement with the USAO-EDNY. See id. The court conducted an\nevidentiary hearing—obtaining testimony from both the prosecutor and the defense\natorney from the Eastern District proceedings—and concluded that the agreement\nwas not meant to bind the USAO-SDNY.

APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nA, The United States Atorneys’ Manual\n\nAmong its many provisions, the United States Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) includes\ngeneral statements of principles that summarize appropriate considerations to be weighed, and\ndesirable practices to be folloued, by federal prosecutors when discharging their prosecutorial\nresponsibilities.'8? The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. [d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\nenforcement responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that reference to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the <span class=\"highlight\">imposition</span> of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\nprosecutions.\n\nl. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a\nFederal Prosecution\n\nFederal prosecutors do not open a case on every mater referred to them. USAM § 9-2.o2o\nexplicitly authorizes a U.S. Atorney “to decline prosecution in any case referred directly to\n£88 In 2ol8, the USAM was revised and reissued as the Justice Manual.

USAM Provisions Relating to Non-Prosecution Agreements\nUSAM § 9-27.6oo authorizes government atorneys to enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation. The provision explains that a non-prosecution\nagreement is appropriate for this purpose when, in the prosecutor’s judgment, the person’s timely\ncooperation “appears to be necessary to the public interest and other means of obtaining the desired\ncooperation are unavailable or would not be effective.” A comment to this provision explains that\nsuch “other means” include seeking cooperation after trial and conviction, bargaining for\nl24\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l324\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021331.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON ET 3536o38, Pagel59 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l57 of 348\n4. FRPC 4-8.4 — Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice\n\nFRPC 4-8.4(c) states that a lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud,\ndeceit, or misrepresentation.\n\nFRPC 4-8.4(d) prohibits a lawyer from engaging in conduct in connection with the practice\nof law that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\n\nIn Florida Bar v. Frederick, 756 So. 2d 79, 87 (Fla. 2ooo), the court noted that FRPC\n4-8.4(d) is not limited to conduct that occurs in a judicial proceeding, but can be applied to\n“conduct in connection with the practice of law.” In Florida Bar v. Shankman, 4l So. 3d l66, l72\n(Fla. 2olo), for example, an atorney’s continuous hiring and firing of firms to assist in the client’s\nmater resulted in delayed resolution of the case and constituted a violation of FRPC 4-8.4(d) due\nto the delay in the administration of justice and the increased costs to the client.7°!\n\n7o4 OPR also examined FRPC 4-3.8, Special Responsibilities of a Prosecutor. Nothing in the text of that rule,\nhouever, was relevant to the issues addressed in this Report. A comment to FRPC Rule 4-3.8 notes that Florida has\nadopted the American Bar Association (ABA) Standards of Criminal Justice Relating to the Prosecution Function.\nThese “standards,” houever, are not binding rules of conduct but rather provide guidance to prosecutors. Indeed, the\nABA has expressly stated that these standards “are not intended to serve as the basis for the <span class=\"highlight\">imposition</span> of professional\ndiscipline, to create substantive or procedural rights for accused or convicted persons, to create a standard of care for\ncivil liability, or to serve as a predicate for a motion to suppress evidence or dismiss a charge.” OPR does not consider\nthe ABA standards as binding on the conduct of Department prosecutors.\n\nl3l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l33l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021337.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONG 3536o38, Pagel65 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l63 of 348\nagreement that did not require Epstein’s cooperation nor did the USAM require Acosta to obtain\nDepartmental approval before doing so.\nC. The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.?°°\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the <span class=\"highlight\">imposition</span> of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM §§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).\n2o8 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villatafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules. An atorney may\natain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the\nrequirements of the standard.\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l337\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021338.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON G4 3536o38, Pagel66 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l64 of 348\nLongstanding Department policy directs prosecutors to require the defendant to plead to the most\nserious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the defendant’s criminal\nconduct, that has an adequate factual basis, is likely to result in a sustainable conviction, makes\nlikely the <span class=\"highlight\">imposition</span> of an appropriate sentence and restitution order, and does not adversely affect\nthe investigation or prosecution of others. See USAM §§ 9-27.43o, 9-27-3oo, 9-27.4oo\n(comment). The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\nexception: a U.S. Atorney or a “designated supervisory atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.”°’ Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “‘a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate. OPR found it unnecessary to resolve the question\nwhether federal charges against Epstein were readily provable, houever, because Acosta had\n2o7 In addition to specified “Limited Exceptions,” this authorization is available in “Other Exceptional\nCircumstances,” as follous:\n\nProsecutors may decline to pursue or may dismiss readily provable charges in\n\nother exceptional circumstances with the writen or otherwise documented\n\napproval of an Assistant Atorney General, United States Atorney, or designated\n\nsupervisory atorney. This exception recognizes that the aims of the Sentencing\n\nReform Act must be sought without ignoring the practical limitations of the\n\nfederal criminal justice system. For example, a case-specific approval to dismiss\n\ncharges in a particular case might be given because the United States Atorney’s\n\nOffice is particularly over-burdened, the duration of the trial would be\n\nexceptionally long, and proceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total\n\nnumber of cases disposed of by the office. Houever, such case-by-case\n\nexceptions should be rare; otherwise the goals of fairness and equity will be\n\njeopardized.\nAshcroft Memo at § I.B.6.

He reviewed and approved the final NPA before it\nwas signed. Department policy gave him the discretion to approve the agreement, notwithstanding\nany arguable failure to comply with the “most serious readily provable offense” requirement.\nFurthermore, the Ashcroft Memo does not appear to preclude a U.S. Atorney from deferring to a\nstate prosecution, so it is not clear that the Memo’s terms apply to a situation involving state\ncharges. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the negotiation of an agreement that alloued Epstein\nto resolve the federal investigation in return for the <span class=\"highlight\">imposition</span> of an l8-month state sentence did\nnot violate a clear and unambiguous standard and therefore does not constitute professional\nmisconduct.\n\n2. The USAO’s Agreement Not to Prosecute Unidentified “Potential\nCo-Conspirators” Did Not Violate a Clear and Unambiguous\nDepartment Policy\n\nSeveral witnesses told OPR that they believed the government’s agreement not to prosecute\nunidentified “potential co-conspirators” amounted to “transactional immunity,” which the\nwitnesses asserted is prohibited by Department policy. Although “use immunity” protects a\nwitness only against the government’s use of his or her immunized testimony in a prosecution of\nthe witness, and is frequently used by prosecutors, transactional immunity protects a witness from\nprosecution altogether and is relatively rare.\n\nOPR found no policy prohibiting a U.S. Atorney from declining to prosecute third parties\nor providing transactional immunity. One section of the USAM related to immunity but applied\nonly to the exchange of “use immunity” for the testimony of a witness who has asserted a Fifth\nAmendment privilege. See USAM § 9-23.loo e¢ seg. Statutory provisions relating to immunity\nalso address the same context. See l8 U.S.C. § 6oo2; 2l U.S.C. § 884. Moreover, apart from\nvoluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a prosecutor’s promise not\nto prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of prosecutorial discretion. See,\ne.g., Marquez, 9o9 F.2d at 74l-43; Kemp, 76o F.2d at l248; Stinson, 839 So. 2d at 9o9; Frazier,\n697 So. 2d 945. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that was violated by the USAO’s\nagreement not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators,’ and therefore cannot conclude that\nnegotiating or approving this provision violated a clear and unambiguous standard or constituted\nprofessional misconduct.\n\nNotwithstanding this finding, in Section IV of this Part, OPR includes in its criticism of\nAcosta’s decision to approve the NPA his approval of this provision without considering its\npotential consequences, including to whom it would apply.\n\nl39\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l339\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021362.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 88 3536o38, Pagel9o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l88 of 348\npromise equates to the <span class=\"highlight\">imposition</span> of a gag order. Our Office cannot\n\nand will not agree to this.\nIt is the intent of this Office to treat this mater like any other case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that this was a polite way of chastising Lefkouitz for mischaracterizing\nwhat Acosta said during the breakfast meeting. Although OPR could not find evidence that the\nleter was sent to Lefkouitz, OPR nonetheless considers it persuasive evidence that Acosta, shortly\nafter the breakfast meeting, disagreed with Lefkouitz’s description of their discussions and had\ndiscussed those disagreements with Sloman.\n\nNevertheless, OPR examined the three specific concessions that Lefkouitz described in\nthe October 23 leter, to determine whether evidence reflected that Acosta had made them during\nthe breakfast meeting. First, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta agreed during the breakfast meeting\nthat he did not intend to interfere with the state’s handling of the case. Contemporaneous\ndocuments shou that well before the breakfast meeting, Acosta had expressed the view that he did\nnot want to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney or the state court. For example, during the NPA\nnegotiations, Acosta asked Villafafia to “soften” certain language that appeared to require the State\nAtorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein enter his\nguilty plea or report to begin serving his sentence by a certain date. Although Acosta may have\nmade a statement during the breakfast meeting expressing his disinclination to interfere with the\nstate’s proceedings, such a statement would have been a reiteration of his prior position on the\nsubject, rather than any new concession.\n\nLefkouitz also claimed in his October 23, 2oo7 leter that Acosta agreed not to contact any\nof the victims or potential witnesses or their counsel. For the reasons discussed more fully in\nChapter Three, OPR concludes that the decision not to notify the victims about the NPA did not\nstem from the breakfast meeting, but rather reflected an assessment of multiple issues and\nconsiderations discussed internally by the subjects who participated in that decision: Acosta,\nSloman, and Villafafia.\n\nFinally, Lefkouitz’s October 23 leter suggested that Acosta had agreed not to intervene\nregarding the sentence Epstein received from the state court, and it asserted that Epstein was\n“entitled to any type of sentence available to him, including but not limited to gain time and work\nrelease.” Later communications between the USAO and defense counsel, houever, shou clearly\nthat Acosta did not abandon the NPA’s explicit sentencing provision. The NPA required Epstein\nto make a joint recommendation with the State Atorney’s Office for an l8-month jail sentence,\nalthough the parties understood that he would receive the same “gain time” benefits available to\nall state inmates. After the October breakfast meeting, Sloman and Villafafia, on behalf of the\nUSAO, repeatedly made clear that it would hold Epstein to that requirement, and the USAO also\nsubsequently insisted that Epstein was ineligible for work release. For example, in a November 5,\n2oo7 leter, Sloman requested confirmation from defense counsel that “Epstein intends to abide by\nhis agreement to plead guilty to the specified charges and to make a binding recommendation that\nthe Court impose a sentence of /8 months of continuous confinement in the county jail.” Shortly\nbefore Epstein entered his plea in June 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the State Atorney to remind him\nthat the NPA required Epstein to plead in state court to an offense that required an l8-month\n\nl62\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l362\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021837.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ll7, ll/ol/2o24, 3636586, Pagel3 of 5l\n\nIn Annabi, the defendants were charged under a three-count indictment in the\nEDNY with conspiring to import, importing, and possessing heroin with intent to\ndistribute.

Accordingly, the conspiracy and possession\ncounts were dismissed. See id. Subsequently, the defendants were indicted in the\nSDNY with conspiracy to distribute heroin. See id.

The District Court conducted an evidentiary hearing—obtaining\ntestimony from both the prosecutor and the defense atorney from the EDNY\nproceedings—and concluded that the agreement was not meant to bind the USAO-\nSDNY.

Whitley, 5l4 U.S. 4l9, 437 (l995) (Government’s\ndiscovery and disclosure obligations extend only to information in the custody of the prosecutor\nor “others acting on the government’s behalf in the case”). Thus, discovery and disclosure\nobligations only extend “information knoun to persons who are a part of the ‘prosecution\nteam’ ... who perform investigative duties or make strategic decisions about the prosecution of\nthe case,” including “police officers and federal agents who submit to the direction of the\nprosecutor and participate in the investigation.” United States v.

It\nwas seen either as further evidence of the USAO’s willingness to meet with Epstein’s atorneys\nwhile simultaneously ignoring the victims, or as a meeting at which Acosta made secret\nagreements with the defense.\n\nTwo leters writen later in 2oo7 refer to the breakfast meeting. In a December 2oo7 leter\nto Sanchez, Acosta stated that he had “sua sponte proposed the Addendum to Mr. Lefkouitz at an\nOctober meeting in Palm Beach ... . in an atempt to avoid what I foresaw would likely be a\nlitigious selection process.” !°?

APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nA. The United States Atorneys’ Manual\n\nAmong its many provisions, the United States Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) includes\ngeneral statements of principles that summarize appropriate considerations to be weighed, and\ndesirable practices to be folloued, by federal prosecutors when discharging their prosecutorial\nresponsibilities.!8° The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. /d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\nenforcement responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that reference to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the <span class=\"highlight\">imposition</span> of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\nprosecutions.\n\nl. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a\nFederal Prosecution\n\nFederal prosecutors do not open a case on every mater referred to them. USAM § 9-2.o2o\nexplicitly authorizes a U.S. Atorney “to decline prosecution in any case referred directly to\nl89 In 2ol8, the USAM was revised and reissued as the Justice Manual.

The provision explains that a non-prosecution\nagreement is appropriate for this purpose when, in the prosecutor’s judgment, the person’s timely\ncooperation “appears to be necessary to the public interest and other means of obtaining the desired\ncooperation are unavailable or would not be effective.” A comment to this provision explains that\nsuch “other means” include seeking cooperation after trial and conviction, bargaining for\nl24\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l62\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023169.tif": "4, FRPC 4-8.4 — Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice\n\nFRPC 4-8.4(c) states that a lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud,\ndeceit, or misrepresentation.\n\nFRPC 4-8.4(d) prohibits a lawyer from engaging in conduct in connection with the practice\nof law that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\n\nIn Florida Bar v.

A comment to FRPC Rule 4-3.8 notes that Florida has\nadopted the American Bar Association (ABA) Standards of Criminal Justice Relating to the Prosecution Function.\nThese “standards,” houever, are not binding rules of conduct but rather provide guidance to prosecutors. Indeed, the\nABA has expressly stated that these standards “are not intended to serve as the basis for the <span class=\"highlight\">imposition</span> of professional\ndiscipline, to create substantive or procedural rights for accused or convicted persons, to create a standard of care for\ncivil liability, or to serve as a predicate for a motion to suppress evidence or dismiss a charge.” OPR does not consider\nthe ABA standards as binding on the conduct of Department prosecutors.\n\nl3l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l69\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023175.tif": "agreement that did not require Epstein’s cooperation nor did the USAM require Acosta to obtain\nDepartmental approval before doing so.\nC. The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.”\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the <span class=\"highlight\">imposition</span> of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM §8§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).\n2o6 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules. An atorney may\natain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the\nrequirements of the standard.\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l75\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023176.tif": "Longstanding Department policy directs prosecutors to require the defendant to plead to the most\nserious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the defendant’s criminal\nconduct, that has an adequate factual basis, is likely to result in a sustainable conviction, makes\nlikely the <span class=\"highlight\">imposition</span> of an appropriate sentence and restitution order, and does not adversely affect\nthe investigation or prosecution of others. See USAM §8§ 9-27.43o, 9-27-3oo, 9-27.4oo\n(comment). The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\nexception: a U.S. Atorney or a “designated supervisory atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.*°’ Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “‘a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate. OPR found it unnecessary to resolve the question\nwhether federal charges against Epstein were readily provable, houever, because Acosta had\n2o7 In addition to specified “Limited Exceptions,” this authorization is available in “Other Exceptional\nCircumstances,” as follous:\n\nProsecutors may decline to pursue or may dismiss readily provable charges in\n\nother exceptional circumstances with the writen or otherwise documented\n\napproval of an Assistant Atorney General, United States Atorney, or designated\n\nsupervisory atorney. This exception recognizes that the aims of the Sentencing\n\nReform Act must be sought without ignoring the practical limitations of the\n\nfederal criminal justice system. For example, a case-specific approval to dismiss\n\ncharges in a particular case might be given because the United States Atorney’s\n\nOffice is particularly over-burdened, the duration of the trial would be\n\nexceptionally long, and proceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total\n\nnumber of cases disposed of by the office. Houever, such case-by-case\n\nexceptions should be rare; otherwise the goals of fairness and equity will be\n\njeopardized.\nAshcroft Memo at § ILB.6.

He reviewed and approved the final NPA before it\nwas signed. Department policy gave him the discretion to approve the agreement, notwithstanding\nany arguable failure to comply with the “most serious readily provable offense” requirement.\nFurthermore, the Ashcroft Memo does not appear to preclude a U.S. Atorney from deferring to a\nstate prosecution, so it is not clear that the Memo’s terms apply to a situation involving state\ncharges. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the negotiation of an agreement that alloued Epstein\nto resolve the federal investigation in return for the <span class=\"highlight\">imposition</span> of an l8-month state sentence did\nnot violate a clear and unambiguous standard and therefore does not constitute professional\nmisconduct.\n\n2. The USAO’s Agreement Not to Prosecute Unidentified “Potential\nCo-Conspirators” Did Not Violate a Clear and Unambiguous\nDepartment Policy\n\nSeveral witnesses told OPR that they believed the government’s agreement not to prosecute\nunidentified “potential co-conspirators” amounted to “transactional immunity,” which the\nwitnesses asserted is prohibited by Department policy. Although “use immunity” protects a\nwitness only against the government’s use of his or her immunized testimony in a prosecution of\nthe witness, and is frequently used by prosecutors, transactional immunity protects a witness from\nprosecution altogether and is relatively rare.\n\nOPR found no policy prohibiting a U.S. Atorney from declining to prosecute third parties\nor providing transactional immunity. One section of the USAM related to immunity but applied\nonly to the exchange of “use immunity” for the testimony of a witness who has asserted a Fifth\nAmendment privilege. See USAM § 9-23.loo ef seg. Statutory provisions relating to immunity\nalso address the same context. See l8 U.S.C. § 6oo2; 2l U.S.C. § 884. Moreover, apart from\nvoluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a prosecutor’s promise not\nto prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of prosecutorial discretion. See,\ne.g., Marquez, 9o9 F.2d at 74l-43; Kemp, 76o F.2d at l248; Stinson, 839 So. 2d at 9o9; Frazier,\n697 So. 2d 945. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that was violated by the USAO’s\nagreement not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators,’ and therefore cannot conclude that\nnegotiating or approving this provision violated a clear and unambiguous standard or constituted\nprofessional misconduct.\n\nNotwithstanding this finding, in Section IV of this Part, OPR includes in its criticism of\nAcosta’s decision to approve the NPA his approval of this provision without considering its\npotential consequences, including to whom it would apply.\n\nl39\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l77\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023200.tif": "promise equates to the <span class=\"highlight\">imposition</span> of a gag order. Our Office cannot\nand will not agree to this.\nIt is the intent of this Office to treat this mater like any other case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that this was a polite way of chastising Lefkouitz for mischaracterizing\nwhat Acosta said during the breakfast meeting. Although OPR could not find evidence that the\nleter was sent to Lefkouitz, OPR nonetheless considers it persuasive evidence that Acosta, shortly\nafter the breakfast meeting, disagreed with Lefkouitz’s description of their discussions and had\ndiscussed those disagreements with Sloman.\n\nNevertheless, OPR examined the three specific concessions that Lefkouitz described in\nthe October 23 leter, to determine whether evidence reflected that Acosta had made them during\nthe breakfast meeting. First, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta agreed during the breakfast meeting\nthat he did not intend to interfere with the state’s handling of the case. Contemporaneous\ndocuments shou that well before the breakfast meeting, Acosta had expressed the view that he did\nnot want to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney or the state court. For example, during the NPA\nnegotiations, Acosta asked Villafafia to “soften” certain language that appeared to require the State\nAtorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein enter his\nguilty plea or report to begin serving his sentence by a certain date. Although Acosta may have\nmade a statement during the breakfast meeting expressing his disinclination to interfere with the\nstate’s proceedings, such a statement would have been a reiteration of his prior position on the\nsubject, rather than any new concession.\n\nLefkouitz also claimed in his October 23, 2oo7 leter that Acosta agreed not to contact any\nof the victims or potential witnesses or their counsel. For the reasons discussed more fully in\nChapter Three, OPR concludes that the decision not to notify the victims about the NPA did not\nstem from the breakfast meeting, but rather reflected an assessment of multiple issues and\nconsiderations discussed internally by the subjects who participated in that decision: Acosta,\nSloman, and Villafafia.\n\nFinally, Lefkouitz’s October 23 leter suggested that Acosta had agreed not to intervene\nregarding the sentence Epstein received from the state court, and it asserted that Epstein was\n“entitled to any type of sentence available to him, including but not limited to gain time and work\nrelease.” Later communications between the USAO and defense counsel, houever, shou clearly\nthat Acosta did not abandon the NPA’s explicit sentencing provision. The NPA required Epstein\nto make a joint recommendation with the State Atorney’s Office for an l8-month jail sentence,\nalthough the parties understood that he would receive the same “gain time” benefits available to\nall state inmates. After the October breakfast meeting, Sloman and Villafafia, on behalf of the\nUSAO, repeatedly made clear that it would hold Epstein to that requirement, and the USAO also\nsubsequently insisted that Epstein was ineligible for work release. For example, in a November 5,\n2oo7 leter, Sloman requested confirmation from defense counsel that “Epstein intends to abide by\nhis agreement to plead guilty to the specified charges and to make a binding recommendation that\nthe Court impose a sentence of l8 months of continuous confinement in the county jail.” Shortly\nbefore Epstein entered his plea in June 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the State Atorney to remind him\nthat the NPA required Epstein to plead in state court to an offense that required an l8-month\n\nl62\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES010/DOJ-OGR-00026338.jpg": "Page 2682\nRE: MCC Visit Thursday\nFrom (USANYS)’\n\"\nDate 2ol9/o8/l4 l2:l8\nSubject: RE: MCC Visit Thursday\nAtachments: TEXT htm, Mime.822\nTwo additional people from DOJ will join the visit:\nIn addition|ei%ic)_|has asked that the new acting warden join the tour.
