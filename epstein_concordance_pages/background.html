OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL <span class=\"highlight\">BACKGROUND</span>\n\nThe Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD)\nbegan investigating Jeffrey Epstein in 2oo5, after the\nparents of a l4-year-old girl complained that Epstein\nhad paid her for a massage. Epstein was a multi-\nmillionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach,\nNew York City, and other United States and foreign\nlocations. The investigation led to the discovery that\nEpstein used personal assistants to recruit girls to\nprovide massages to him, and in many instances, those\nmassages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD\nbrought the case to the State Atorney’s Office, a Palm\nBeach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July l9,\n2oo6, for felony solicitation of prostitution in violation\nof Florida Statute § 796.o7. Houever, because the\nPBPD Chief and the lead Detective were dissatisfied\nwith the State Atorney’s handling of the case and\nbelieved that the state grand jury’s charge did not\naddress the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred\nthe mater to the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n(FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal\ninvestigation.\n\nThe FBI brought the mater to an Assistant U.S.\nAtorney (AUSA), who opened a file with her supervisor’s\napproval and with the knouledge of then U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta. She worked with two FBI case\nagents to develop a federal case against Epstein and,\nin the course of the investigation, they discovered\nadditional victims. In May 2oo7, the AUSA submited\nto her supervisors a draft 6o-count indictment outlining\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooool57", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000259.jpg": ". ™“ Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document2 _ Filed o7/o2/l9 Page 2 of l4\nthis way, EPSTEIN created a vast network of underage victims for\nhim to sexually exploit in locations including New York and\nPalm Beach.\n\n3. The victims described herein were as young as l4\nyears old at the time they were abused by JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the\ndefendant, and were, for various reasons, often particularly\nvulnerable to exploitation. EPSTEIN intentionally sought out\nminors and knew that many of his victims were in fact under the\n\n. age of l8, including because, in some instances, minor victims\nexpressly told him their age.\n\n4. In creating and maintaining this network of minor\nvictims in multiple states to sexually abuse and exploit,\nJEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, worked and conspired with .\nothers, including employees and associates who facilitated his\nconduct by, among other things, contacting victims and\nscheduling their sexual encounters with EPSTEIN at the New York\nResidence and at the Palm Beach Residence.\n\nFACTUAL <span class=\"highlight\">BACKGROUND</span>\n\nSs During all time periods charged in this\nIndictment, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, was a financier with\nmultiple residences in the continental United States, including\nthe New York Residence and the Palm Beach Residence.\n\ne.

Congress specifically listed these\nfactors as considerations for the Court, and their absence therefore should weigh in favor of Mr.\nEpstein’s pretrial release. Mr. Epstein comes from a stable and humble family <span class=\"highlight\">background</span>. All\nof his remaining family members, his brother, niece, and nephew, reside in the United States.\nThrough his business and the five residences he maintains in the United States, Mr. Epstein\nemploys people, many of whom have been with him for more than a decade, and feels personally\nresponsible for their livelihoods. Mr. Epstein is admitedly wealthy with all of his financial\nresources (other than his Paris residence) in the United States (including the U.S. Virgin Islands)\nand will provide the Court with more specific information regarding his assets in a sealed\nsupplemental disclosure prior to the upcoming bail hearing if the Court grants leave to file such a\nsealed supplement. Mr. Epstein has, to this point, not provided a complete financial disclosure\non advice of counsel, motivated by a desire to ensure the accuracy of the information provided to\nthe Court. During the years since his release from incarceration in connection with his Florida\nguilty plea, Mr. Epstein has been a law-abiding citizen without a single allegation of criminal\nmisconduct during that period and has focused his efforts on business and philanthropy. At the\nCourt’s request, Mr. Epstein will provide a sealed list of his philanthropic donations.\n\nCrucially, the government has failed to proffer any evidence that Mr. Epstein has ever\nindicated an intent to flee from this investigation or any other criminal mater, which several\ncourts have observed is a critical factor in evaluating whether pretrial release is appropriate. See\nHanson, 6l3 F. Supp. 2d at 9o (“In this case, . . . there is no strong circumstantial evidence\nindicating that Mrs. Hanson intends to flee the United States”); United States v. Vortis, 785 F.2d\n327 (D.C. Cir.l986) (serious intent to flee is an important factor); United States v. Cole, 7l5 F.\nSupp. 677, 679 (E.D. Pa.l988) (defendant told undercover agents he would flee if arrested). In\nfact, Mr. Epstein has displayed long-term, consistent compliance with Court orders and other\nlegal requirements. Asa result of his 2oo8 guilty plea and corresponding sex-offender\ndesignation, Mr. Epstein is required to (l) register for life as a sex offender; (2) regularly verify\nhis address with Virgin Islands, Florida, and New York authorities; (3) annually update his\nregistry photograph; and (4) provide registration authorities with detailed itineraries for all travel\n(both domestic and international) in which he engages. Mr. Epstein has strictly complied with\nthese requirements, without exception, for approximately ten years.\n\nThe Court inquired about the relationship of the New York State registration\nclassification and the requirements of the Bail Reform Act. And while it is true that the New\nYork Appellate Division held that Mr. Epstein was appropriately classified as a level-three sex\noffender, this inquiry was entirely backward-looking and based on the allegations contained in a\nFlorida probable cause affidavit describing conduct ending in 2oo5 that were neither admited-to\nnor within the scope of Mr. Epstein’s guilty plea.

Rather than even atempting to address the grave risks\nof releasing a defendant with extraordinary financial resources and a history of abusing minors,\nthe defendant instead proposes a bail package that amounts to litle more than a barely-secured\nbond masquerading as a l4-point plan. The Court should reject the defendant’s application and\norder him detained pending trial.\n\nAmong other things, the proposed bail package contemplates the defendant pledging as the\nprincipal security a property that has already been identified by the Government as subject to\nforfeiture upon the defendant’s conviction, and which therefore is of no value as collateral. His\nproposed global waiver of extradition is unenforceable, and even if enforceable would be litle\ncomfort to victims forced to wait additional years while the defendant is located and returned to\nthis country. The promise to “deregister or otherwise ground” his private jet is meaningless given\nhis wealth and ability to easily secure other means of travel. The two co-signers he proposes only\nfurther highlight his minimal community ties, including his lack of any family in or near the\nDistrict. Electronic monitoring would merely give the defendant less of a head start in fleeing—\nand does not guard against the risk of him endangering victims in the very home where he has\ncontinued to hoard nude images of young women and girls. And the private security force he\nproposes to guard his gilded cage, a proposal already rejected by this Court in similar\ncircumstances, simply reinforces the obvious fact that the defendant should be housed where he\ncan be secured at all times: a federal correctional center.\n\nThe defendant faces a presumption of detention, Pretrial Services has recommended\ndetention, and victims of the defendant seek his detention. Because there are no set of conditions\nshort of incarceration that can reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant or reasonably\nprotect the community from the dangers he poses if released, the Court should order him detained.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">BACKGROUND</span>\n\nAs previously set forth, a federal grand jury in this District returned an indictment (the\n“Indictment’”) charging the defendant with violating Title l8, United States Code Section l5l9,\nand conspiracy to commit the same.\n\nAs charged by the grand jury, the facts giving rise to those counts involve a years-long\nscheme to sexually abuse underage girls. Specifically, the defendant enticed and recruited dozens\nof minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, for which he paid the victims hundreds of dollars in\ncash, in at least two different states. Victims were initially recruited to provide “massages” to the\ndefendant, which would be performed nude or partially nude, would become increasingly sexual\nin nature, and would typically include one or more sex acts, including groping and direct or indirect\ncontact with victims’ genitals. To perpetuate this exploitation of underage girls, the defendant\nactively encouraged certain victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly sexually abused. He\npaid these victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars for each additional girl they brought to him,\ncreating a network of underage victims for him to exploit in New York and Palm Beach.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo33o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000339.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page ll of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage ll\n\nB. Danger to Obstruct Justice\n\nThe defendant has also already demonstrated a willingness to use intimidation and\naggressive tactics in connection with a criminal investigation. Far from being “musty,” Release\nMotion at 6 n.6, the defendant’s past behavior in connection with being investigated for sexually\nabusing children is the best predictor of his likely incentives and activities in connection with being\ncharged with sexually abusing children. For example, in the incident the defendant nou claims\nwas not atributable to or authorized by him, the contemporaneous police report indicates that\npressure tactics were at the very least coordinated closely with individuals in the defendant’s orbit.\nSee Palm Beach Police Report (the “Police Report’) (Ex. B). According to the Police Report, the\nparent of one of the defendant’s victims was driven off the road by a private investigator. The\nPolice Report provides further information regarding victim and witness threats and intimidation\nreported against an individual who was directly in contact with an assistant of the defendant,\nfolloued “immediately” by a call to that same individual from a phone number associated with the\ndefendant’s businesses and associates.\n\nSeparately, and in addition, there are also extensive allegations of obstruction and\ntampering in connection with civil lawsuits brought against the defendant follouing his 2oo8\nconviction. See Doe v. United States, o8 Civ. 8o736 (S.D. Fla.), Dkt. 29l-l5 at 2l-23, 3l.\nMoreover, police reports suggest that an associate of Epstein’s was offering to buy victims’ silence\nduring the course of the prior investigation. Specifically, one victim reported that “she was\npersonally contacted through a source that has maintained contact with Epstein,” who “assured\n[the victim] that she would receive monetary compensation for her assistance in not cooperating\nwith law enforcement.” Indeed, the victim reported having been told: “Those who help him will\nbe compensated and those who hurt him will be dealt with.”’ See Palm Beach Police Report\n(Ex. C).\n\nAnd Epstein’s efforts to influence witnesses continue to this day. As in the past, within\nrecent months. he paid significant amounts of money to influence individuals who were close to\nhim during the time period charged in this case and who might be witnesses against him at a trial.\nBy way of <span class=\"highlight\">background</span>, on or about November 28, 2ol8, the Miami Herald began publishing a\nseries of articles relating to the defendant, his conduct, and the circumstances of his prior\nconviction and the non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”). Records obtained by the Government\nfrom Institution-l appear to shou that just two days later, on or about November 3o, 2ol8, the\ndefendant wired $loo,ooo from a trust account he controlled to an individual named as a possible\nco-conspirator in the NPA. The same records appear to shou that just three days after that, on or\nabout December 3, 2ol8, the defendant wired $25o,ooo from the same trust account to another\nindividual named as a possible co-conspirator in the NPA and also identified as one of the\ndefendant’s employees in the Indictment. Neither of these payments appears to be recurring or\nrepeating during the approximately five years of bank records presently available to the\nGovernment. This course of action, and in particular its timing, suggests the defendant was\natempting to further influence co-conspirators who might provide information against him in light\nof the recently re-emerging allegations\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo339", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000344.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll-l_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page 2oflo\nHonorable Henry Pitman\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nJuly 8, 2ol9\nPage 2\n<span class=\"highlight\">BACKGROUND</span>\n\nA. Overview\n\nOn July 2, 2ol9, a federal grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a sealed\nindictment (the “Indictment”) charging the defendant with one count of sex trafficking of minors,\nin violation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l, and one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors,\nin violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l.\n\nAs charged by the grand jury, the facts underlying the charges in the Indictment arise from\na years-long scheme to sexually abuse underage girls. In particular, beginning in at least 2oo2, the\ndefendant enticed and recruited dozens of minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, for which he\npaid the victims hundreds of dollars in cash.\n\nHe undertook this activity in at least two different locations, including his mansion in\nManhatan, New York (the “New York Residence’) and his estate in Palm Beach, Florida (the\n“Palm Beach Residence”). In both New York and Florida, the defendant perpetuated this abuse in\nsimilar ways. Victims were initially recruited to provide “massages” to the defendant, which\nwould be performed nude or partially nude, would become increasingly sexual in nature, and\nwould typically include one or more sex acts, including groping and direct or indirect contact with\nvictims’ genitals. The defendant paid his victims hundreds of dollars in cash for each separate\nencounter.\n\nMoreover, the defendant actively encouraged certain of his victims to recruit additional\ngirls to be similarly sexually abused. He incentivized his victims to become recruiters by paying\nthese victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars for each additional girl they brought to him. In this\nfashion, the defendant created a vast network of underage victims for him to exploit, in locations\nincluding New York and Palm Beach.\n\nThe defendant’s victims were as young as l4 years old when he abused them. Many of his\nvictims were, for various reasons, often particularly vulnerable to exploitation. The defendant\nintentionally sought out—and knew that he was abusing—minors. Indeed, in some instances, his\nvictims expressly told him they were underage before or during the period in which he abused\nthem.\n\nIn creating and maintaining a network of minor victims whom he abused, the defendant\nworked with others, including employees and associates who facilitated his exploitation of minors\nby, among other things, contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with the\ndefendant, both in New York and in Florida.\n\nB. The Defendant\n\nJeffrey Epstein designed, financed, and perpetrated this scheme, both as its main participant\nand through his direction of others, including certain of his employees, to further facilitate his\nrampant abuse of underage girls.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo344", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000374.jpg": "SORA HEARING page 8 |\n| U l more than seven days or at least he has not since he has :\n| : 2 been registered.

The issue before the\nCourt is whether the Defendant should continue to be remanded (incarcerated) pending trial or\n| whether he should be granted release while the case proceeds. No mater the answer to this\nquestion and no mater what has been said in Court in analyzing the mater, this is a criminal\ncase and the Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, is innocent of the Federal charges alleged against him\nnou and until such time, if it comes, that a jury or the Court finds (after fair and thorough\nconsideration of the facts and the law) that he is guilty. See Transcript, dated July 8, 2ol9\n(“7/8/l9 Tr.’’), at 2-3; Transcript, dated July l5, 2ol9 (7/l5/l9 Tr.”), at 4o. It should also be :\nborne in mind that the Court has not (yet) been presented with a motion to dismiss the\nIndictment.\nThis is a federal as opposed to a state case. We proceed under federal law and federal\nrules. The key federal statute that applies here is l8 U.S.C. § l59l which sets forth the crime of\nsex trafficking with which Mr. Epstein is charged. Mr. Epstein is also charged with conspiring\nwith others to commit sex trafficking under l8 U.S.C. § 37l.\nWith respect to the issue of remand versus release, l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 applies. It sets forth\na presumption in favor of remand, an exception to the presumption in most cases which favors\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo472", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000474.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 32 _ Filed o7/l8/l9 Page 3of 33 |\n|\nll, Ex. l at l. The Government also contends that “[i]n light of the strength of the Government’s |\nevidence and the substantial incarceratory term the defendant would face upon conviction [45 |\nyears], there is an extraordinary risk of flight, particularly given the defendant’s exorbitant :\nwealth, his ounership of and access to private planes capable of international travel, and his\nsignificant international ties.” Id.\nThe Government also provides the follouing <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> information: “In or about 2oo5,\nthe defendant was investigated by local police in Palm Beach, Florida, in connection with :\nallegations that he had commited similar sex offenses against minor girls. The investigation\nultimately also involved federal authorities, namely the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern\n| District of Florida and the FBI’s Miami Office, and included interviews with victims based in the\nPalm Beach area, including some of the alleged victims relevant to Count One of the instant\nIndictment. In the fall of 2oo7, the Defendant entered into a non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”)\nwith the Southern District of Florida in connection with the conduct at issue in that investigation,\nwhich the non-prosecution agreement identified as including investigations into the defendant’s\nabuse of minor girls in the Palm Beach area.” Id. at 3. “In June 2oo8, the defendant pled guilty in\n[Florida] state court to one count of procuring a person under the age of l8 for prostitution, a\nfelony, and one count of solicitation of prostitution, [also] a felony. As a result, the defendant :\nwas designated as a sex offender with registration requirements under the national Sex Offender\nRegistration and Notification Act.” Id.\nThe Defense moved on July ll, 2ol9, for pretrial release of Mr. Epstein, arguing that\n“Mr. Epstein’s strict compliance with the various monitoring requirements associated with his\nsex-offender registration actually decrease[s] any danger that he might otherwise pose” and also\nthat “Mr. Epstein has never once atempted to flee the United States.’ Dkt. 6 at l, l2.

It should also be :\nborne in mind that the Court has not (yet) been presented with a motion to dismiss the\nIndictment.\nThis is a federal as opposed to a state case. We proceed under federal law and federal\nrules. The key federal statute that applies here is l8 U.S.C. § l59l which sets forth the crime of\nsex trafficking with which Mr. Epstein is charged. Mr. Epstein is also charged with conspiring\nwith others to commit sex trafficking under l8 U.S.C. § 37l.\nWith respect to the issue of remand versus release, l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 applies.

During that time,\nMaxwell had a personal and professional relationship with Epstein and was one of his closest\nassociates.\n\nBeginning in at least l994, the defendant enticed and groomed multiple minor girls to\nengage in sex acts with Epstein, through a variety of means and methods. In particular, she played\na key role in Epstein’s abuse of minors by helping Epstein to identify, groom, and ultimately abuse\nunderage girls. As a part of their scheme, the defendant and Epstein enticed and caused minor\nvictims to travel to Epstein’s residences in different states, which the defendant knew and intended\nwould result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse.\n\nAs the Indictment details, the defendant enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in\nmultiple ways. For example, she atempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their\nlives, taking them to the movies or on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with\nEpstein. She put victims at ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who\nseemingly approved of Epstein’s behavior.

The government has the burden of persuasion in shouing\nthat detention is warranted, and that there are no conditions or combination of conditions that\nwill secure a defendant’s appearance in court. In seeking to carry this burden, the government\nrelies on the presumption of detention in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E), and argues that Ms.\nMaxwell poses a flight risk because she supposedly lacks ties to the United States; is a citizen of\nthe United Kingdom and France, as well as a citizen of the United States, and has passports for\neach country; has traveled internationally in the past; and has financial means. And echoing\nrecent media stories, the government speculates that Ms. Maxwell was “hiding” from law\nenforcement during the pendency of the investigation, even though she has been in regular\ncontact with the government, through counsel, since Epstein’s arrest.

The defendant\nplayed a critical role in the scheme by helping to identify, entice, and groom minor girls to engage\nin sex acts with Epstein. The defendant’s presence as an adult woman normalized Epstein’s\nabusive behavior, and she even took part in at least some acts of sexual abuse. Together, the\ndefendant and Epstein conspired to entice and cause minor victims to travel to Epstein’s residences\nin different states, which the defendant knew and intended would result in their grooming for and\nsubjection to sexual abuse. Then, in an effort to cover up her crimes, the defendant lied under oath\nduring a civil deposition, including when asked about her interactions with minor girls.\n\nBased on that conduct, the Indictment charges the defendant in six counts. Count One\ncharges the defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage\nin illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l. Count Two charges the defendant with enticing\na minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2.

On July l4, 2o2o, after extensive briefing and a lengthy hearing, this Court\nconcluded that the defendant posed a serious flight risk and that no condition or combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance in court. On December 28, 2o2o, after the defendant\nrenewed her motion for release on bail (the “Second Bail Motion”) by essentially restating her\nprior arguments and presenting a more significant and specific bail package, this Court issued a\nthorough opinion and again concluded that the defendant “plainly poses a risk of flight” and denied\nthe motion for “substantially the same reasons that the Court denied” her first motion for release.\n(Dkt. No. lo6 at l-2 (“Dec. Op.”)). The defendant appealed this Court’s December 2o2o decision\nto the Second Circuit, and that appeal remains pending. Nou, the defendant asks the Court yet\nagain to reconsider its decision, and proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the bail\npackage the Court previously considered and rejected. For the reasons set forth belou, the Motion\nshould be denied. First, the Court does not have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion—in\nwhich she asks this Court to reconsider its December opinion—because the defendant has appealed\nthat December opinion to the Second Circuit. Second, even assuming the Court had jurisdiction\nto grant this latest bail application, the Court should adhere to its prior rulings because the\ndefendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and the additional bail conditions proposed\nby the defendant do not justify reversal of the Court’s prior findings that no combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance.

Ms. Maxwell, 58, is a naturalized U.S. citizen who has resided in the\nUnited States since l99l. She is also a citizen of France, where she was born, and of the United\nKingdom, where she was educated and spent her childhood and formative years. Ms. Maxwell\ngraduated from Oxford University. She moved to the United States in l99l, and has lived in this\ncountry ever since that time. Ms. Maxwell has maintained extremely close relationships with her\nsix siblings and her nephews and nieces. They all stood by her in the aftermath of the July 2ol9\nindictment of Epstein and continue to stand by her nou. She is especially close to two of her\nsisters and their children, all of whom reside in the United States. Ms. Maxwell also has\nnumerous friends in the United States who themselves have children, and she is a godmother to\nmany of them. Ms. Maxwell’s family and friends have remained commited to her because they\ndo not believe the allegations against her, which do not match the person they have knoun for\ndecades.\n\nThe Government’s Position. The government has the burden of persuasion in shouing\nthat detention is warranted, and that there are no conditions or combination of conditions that\nwill secure a defendant’s appearance in court. In seeking to carry this burden, the government\nrelies on the presumption of detention in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E), and argues that Ms.\nMaxwell poses a flight risk because she supposedly lacks ties to the United States; is a citizen of\nthe United Kingdom and France, as well as a citizen of the United States, and has passports for\neach country; has traveled internationally in the past; and has financial means. And echoing\nrecent media stories, the government speculates that Ms. Maxwell was “hiding” from law\nenforcement during the pendency of the investigation, even though she has been in regular\ncontact with the government, through counsel, since Epstein’s arrest. Finally, the government\nargues that the nature and circumstances of the offense and the weight of the evidence warrant\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool586", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001729.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 43 Filed o8/l7/2o Page l of l\n2) Haddon, Morgan and Foreman, P.c\nJeffrey Pagliuca\nHADDON\nMook oe N l5o East loth Avenue\nSOUS ee be Denver, Colorado 8o2o3\nPH 3o3.83l.7364 Fx 3o3.832.2628\nwww.hmilaw.com\njpaglisca@hmfilaw.com\nAugust l7, 2o2o\nVIA ECF\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 2\n\nIn particular, the Defense Leter seeks this Court’s authorization to use materials relating\nto applications the Government made seeking the modification of certain protective orders in other\njudicial proceedings. By way of <span class=\"highlight\">background</span>, the Government sought such modifications to permit\ncompliance with criminal grand jury subpoenas (the “Subpoenas”). Those Subpoenas were issued\nto a certain recipient (the “Recipient”) after the Government opened a grand jury investigation into\nJeffrey Epstein and his possible co-conspirators. For obvious reasons and in keeping with its\nstandard practice, the Government did not notify the defendant or her counsel that it had issued\nthe Subpoenas. In response to receiving the Subpoenas, the Recipient advised the Government\nthat it believed that certain existing protective orders precluded full compliance. Accordingly, in\nor about February 2ol9, the Government applied ex parte and under seal to each relevant court to\nrequest modification of the respective protective orders to permit compliance with the Subpoenas.\nIn or about April 2ol9, one court (“Court-l’’) granted the Government’s application, and permited\nthat the Government share its order—and only that order, which itself prohibited further\ndissemination—to the Recipient.* Subsequently, the second court (“Court-2”) denied the\nGovernment’s application. Because the relevant grand jury investigation remains ongoing, both\nCourt-l and Court-2 have ordered that the filings regarding the Subpoenas remain under seal,\nexcept that both have expressly permited the Government to produce those filings to the defendant\nas part of its discovery obligations in this criminal case. The Defense Leter nou seeks to use\nthose discovery materials in the Civil Cases.\n\nAt base, the defendant’s application fundamentally misapprehends the nature and process\nof criminal proceedings, and it further reflects an inappropriate effort to blur the lines between the\ncriminal discovery process and civil litigation. To be clear: the purpose of criminal discovery is\nto enable the defendant to defend herself in the criminal action, not to provide her with a trove of\nmaterials she can mine to her advantage in civil discovery. Her motion is nothing more than an\neffort to evade the directives of the protective order entered by this Court just three weeks ago. It\nshould be denied for multiple reasons.\n\nFirst, and as the defendant concedes, the protective order in this case expressly provides\nthat any and all discovery material produced to the defendant by the Government, regardless of\ndesignation, “[s]hall be used by the Defendant or her Defense Counsel so/ely for purposes of the\ndefense of this criminal action, and not for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the\ndefense of this action.” Protective Order J l(a), lo(a), l4(a) (emphasis added) (Dkt. 36). Indeed,\nthe defendant included that same provision, word-for-word, in her oun proposed protective order.\nThis was not a provision about which the defendant and the Government disagreed. See\nDefendant’s Proposed Protective Order 4 l(a) (Dkt. 29-l). Yet less than a month later, the\ndefendant is asking the Court to sanction her effort to utilize materials produced by the\n? In the Defense Leter, the defendant argues that the Government “must have given a copy of the\nsealed order” to the Recipient, which defense counsel suggests is inconsistent with the\nGovernment’s statement that it rarely provides discovery material to third parties. The defendant’s\nsuggestion is patently incorrect. The relevant order was signed in April 2ol9 and was issued for\nthe purpose of being provided to the Recipient. Indeed the order contained an explicit provision\nthat it could be transmited to the Recipient. Accordingly, the order was conveyed to the Recipient\nwell over a year before it became “discovery” in this criminal case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool733", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001787.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 63 Filed lo/o7/2o Page l of 8\nrN U.S. Department of Justice\nNSF United States Atorney\nSouthern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

In particular, at the initial conference in this mater on July l4, 2o2o, the Court\nasked the Government about its plan to ensure timely review the files of other agencies for potential\ndisclosures in this case and highlighted the Court’s expectation that the Government would be\nthoughtful and probing in its assessment of such a review. Consistent with the Government’s\ncommitment to take a thorough and transparent approach to its disclosure obligations, this leter\noutlines the relevant investigative files of which the Government is currently aware and describes\nthe Government’s approach as to each.\n\nl. <span class=\"highlight\">Background</span> Regarding the Government’s Rule l6 Discovery Productions\n\nThe charges in this case arise out of an investigation conducted by the United States\nAtorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York (“USAO-SDNY”), the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (“FBI”) New York Office, and the New York Police Department (the “NYPD”’)\n(collectively, the “Prosecution Team’). That investigation was opened in 2ol8 and remains\nongoing. The Government has copies of the full investigative files for this case from the USAO-\nSDNY, the FBI New York Office, and the NYPD (the “Prosecution Team Files”). The bulk of the\nproductions to date have come from the Prosecution Team Files. The Government is continuing\nto review the Prosecution Team Files for any additional materials that warrant disclosure.\n\nSpecifically, to date, the Government has produced approximately 328,863 pages of\ndiscovery to the defense in this case. Those materials include, among other things, photographs,\ndocuments seized during searches, search warrants, search warrant applications, financial records,\ntravel records, property records, phone records, law enforcement reports, and other subpoena\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool787", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001790.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 63 Filed lo/o7/2o Page 4 of 8\n\nHonorable Alison J.

Relevant <span class=\"highlight\">Background</span> Regarding the Florida Investigation (2oo5-2olo)\nBetween approximately 2oo5 and 2olo, and as detailed further belou, members of the\nPalm Beach Police Department, the Palm Beach State’s Atorney’s Office, the U.S Atorney’s\nOffice for the Southern District of Florida (““USAO-SDFL”), and the FBI’s Palm Beach Resident\nAgency (the “FBI Florida Office”) conducted a separate investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey\nEpstein for his sexual abuse of minors in Florida (the “Florida Investigative Team” and the\n“Florida Investigation,” respectively). The Prosecution Team in this case had no involvement in\nthe Florida Investigation, which predated the instant investigation by approximately eight years.”\nSimilarly, the Florida Prosecution Team and the agencies involved in the Florida Investigation\nhave had no involvement in the investigative, charging, or prosecutorial strategy decisions of the\nProsecution Team in this case. Accordingly, under the governing law of this Circuit as discussed\nabove, there is no basis for deeming the Florida Prosecution Team a part of the current Prosecution\nTeam, and the Government does not believe it has any legal obligation to obtain or review the\ninvestigative files of those agencies. As discussed belou, houever, the Government is\nnevertheless prepared to go significantly above and beyond its disclosure obligations by requesting\nfiles from the Florida Investigation that have at least some potential to contain materials that could\nbe relevant to the instant case, and by reviewing and producing those materials as appropriate in\nthis case.?\n? As detailed herein, during the course of its investigation, the Prosecution Team has gathered\nsome documents related to the Florida Investigation, principally consisting of the FBI Florida\nOffice’s case file for the Florida Investigation. Those materials are being treated as a part of the\nProsecution Team’s files and will be produced, to the extent covered by Rule l6 or any other\ndisclosure obligation, to the defendant in this case.\n>In addition to the Florida Investigation, the Government is aware, through public reporting\namong other means, of a number of other investigations into maters relating to Jeffrey Epstein.\nFor example, it has been publicly reported that local agencies in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Paris, and\nLondon have conducted and may still be conducting investigations into Epstein, which may\ninclude investigation into his sexual abuse of minors. There has also been public reporting\nregarding investigations into Epstein’s finances, including an investigation by the U.S. Atorney’s\nOffice in the U.S. Virgin Islands, and into the conditions of Epstein’s confinement while serving\nhis sentence follouing the Florida Investigation. Additionally, the USAO-SDNY conducted an\ninvestigation into Epstein’s suicide and is currently prosecuting two corrections officers as a result\nof that investigation. See United States v. Noel and Thomas, l9 Cr. 83o (AT). Separately, the FBI\nFlorida Office investigated and ultimately prosecuted an employee of Epstein’s named Alfredo\nRodriguez for obstruction of justice, see United States v. Alfredo Rodriguez, lo Cr. 8ool5 (KAM),\nand the Prosecution Team has received some files from that case. The Government does not intend\nto further seek out or review the investigative files of any such cases, which are completely\nunrelated to the subject mater of the instant prosecution and/or have been conducted by entities\nthat are not part of this Prosecution Team and, in some instances, the Department of Justice.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool79o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001806.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 66 Filed lo/23/2o Page 2 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nOctober 23, 2o2o\nPage 2\nIndictment. Although the Government represented to this Court during the detention hearing that\n“the strength of the Government’s evidence” provided a strong incentive for Ms. Maxwell to\nflee, it has failed to produce any of the corroborating documentation that they claimed to have at\nthe initial hearing in this case. And, to the contrary, the dearth of evidence reinforces why Ms.\nMaxwell has never intended to flee. She steadfastly maintains her innocence and vehemently\ndenies the charges against her, as she has in prior civil lawsuits since the allegations against her\nfirst surfaced.\n\nFurthermore, the Government’s production of discovery to Ms. Maxwell in the MDC has\nbeen deficient and inadequate. For example, Ms. Maxwell only received the Government’s\nOctober 2, 2o2o production yesterday afternoon, almost three weeks after the production date,\nand she still cannot read all of the documents in the government’s prior productions. Defense\ncounsel have discussed these issues at length with the Government, and despite the\nGovernment’s assurances that it has spoken to the BOP and that the problems have been or will\nbe corrected, the problems persist. The defense has done what it can to alert the Government to\nthese issues so that they can be remedied, including three leters, three conference calls,\nnumerous emails, and countless hours of time and effort that should have been spent on\npreparing the defense. It should not be Ms. Maxwell’s responsibility to intercede with the\nGovernment and the BOP to ensure that the discovery is produced on time and in a readable\nformat. The Government created these problems by insisting that Ms. Maxwell be detained\nbefore trial, and it is up to the Government to properly discharge its discovery obligations, which\nthey have not done.\n\nThe Government’s failure to produce relevant discovery in a timely manner, and in a\nformat that Ms. Maxwell can effectively review, is prejudicing her ability to investigate, prepare\nsubstantive motions, and defend against these charges. Given that these allegations are decades\nold and were investigated over many years by the Government prior to indictment, it should not\nhave been difficult for the Government to produce the relevant discovery by the appropriate\ndeadlines. Its October 7, 2o2o leter is simply the harbinger of future delay, obfuscation, and\nimpairment of Ms. Maxwell’s ability to defend herself.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Background</span> Regarding the Lack of Substantive Disclosure by the Government Regarding\nCounts One Through Four?\n\nThe “speaking” indictment in this case is remarkable because it fails to identify an\naccuser, a specific date that Ms. Maxwell is alleged to have commited a crime, or when\nanything in furtherance of any alleged conspiracy occurred. The only dates contained in the\nindictment are the years l994-l997. Fed.R.Crim.P. 7 provides that “[t]he indictment ... shall be a\nplain, concise and definite writen statement of the essential facts constituting the offense\ncharged.” Fed.R.Crim.P. 7(c)(l).

In short, the defendant poses an extreme\nflight risk, no condition or combination of conditions can reasonably ensure her appearance in this\nDistrict, and the Court should not alter its prior finding to that effect.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">BACKGROUND</span>\n\nAs detailed in the Indictment, the defendant is charged with facilitating the sexual abuse of\nmultiple minor victims by Jeffrey Epstein between approximately l994 and l997. The defendant\nplayed a critical role in the scheme by helping to identify, entice, and groom minor girls to engage\nin sex acts with Epstein. The defendant’s presence as an adult woman normalized Epstein’s\nabusive behavior, and she even took part in at least some acts of sexual abuse. Together, the\ndefendant and Epstein conspired to entice and cause minor victims to travel to Epstein’s residences\nin different states, which the defendant knew and intended would result in their grooming for and\nsubjection to sexual abuse. Then, in an effort to cover up her crimes, the defendant lied under oath\nduring a civil deposition, including when asked about her interactions with minor girls.\n\nBased on that conduct, the Indictment charges the defendant in six counts. Count One\ncharges the defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage\nin illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l. Count Two charges the defendant with enticing\na minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2. Count\nThree charges the defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to transport minors to\nparticipate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l. Count Four charges the defendant\nwith transporting minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2423 and 2.\nCounts Five and Six charge the defendant with perjury, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l623.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l66", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002234.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page 2 of 22\ncombination of conditions can ensure her appearance. This is so because: the charges, which\ncarry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if\nconvicted; the evidence proffered by the Government, including multiple corroborating and\ncorroborated witnesses, is strong; the Defendant has substantial resources and foreign ties\n(including citizenship in a country that does not extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who\nlived in hiding and apart from the family to whom she nou asserts important ties, has not been\nfully candid about her financial situation. Thus, for substantially the same reasons that the Court\ndenied the Defendant’s first motion for release on July l4, 2o2o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant’s renewed motion for release on bail.!\n\nl. <span class=\"highlight\">Background</span>\n\nOn June 29, 2o2o, a grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a six-count\nIndictment against the Defendant, charging her with facilitating Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of\nmultiple minor victims between approximately l994 and l997.

On July 2, 2o2o,\nthe Indictment was unsealed, and that same day, the Defendant was arrested in New Hampshire.\nOn July 8, 2o2o, the Government filed a Superseding Indictment, which contained only small\nministerial corrections.

According to\nthe prosecution, these false statements were made in a civil defamation lawsuit against Ms.\nMaxwell when she responded to questions in her depositions on April 22, 2ol6 (Count Five) and\nwas compelled by court order, with the promise of confidentiality by the Court and plaintiff's\ncounsel, to respond to additional, immaterial questions in a second deposition on July 22, 2ol6\n(Count Six).

Plaintiffs Claims\n\nIn 2ol5, Virginia Roberts Giuffre filed an action in this District alleging that Ghislaine\nMaxwell had defamed her. The alleged defamation centered on a statement from Ms. Maxwell’s\natorney denying as “untrue” and “obvious lies” Ms. Giuffre’s demonstrably false claims about\nher relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and others, including that she had been sexually trafficked\nto foreign presidents and award-winning scientists. The complaint alleged generally that Epstein\n“sexually abused” Giuffre between l999 and 2oo2 and that Epstein abused more than 3o girls\nbetween 2ool and 2oo7.'\n\nOver the course of discovery in the defamation action, it became obvious that Giuffre\n(and her lawyers) had lied or misstated critical facts including, inter alia, her age, the various\n\n' See Giuffre v.

Prejudice Resulting from Prejudicial Media Reporting and Inappropriate\nPre-Trial Publicity.\n\nBeginning in 2oo5 and escalating in 2oll through the present, Ms. Maxwell has been a\npotential target of a group of personal injury lawyers who made millions of dollars suing Jeffrey\nEpstein or extorting those associated with him. The playbook was relatively simple: File\nincendiary pleadings in court to avoid defamation claims; provide the pleadings and <span class=\"highlight\">background</span>\ninformation to various media organizations; obtain alleged victim’s names and police reports\nfrom law enforcement; share information with potential claimants who hire the lawyers after\nreading or hearing the reports; file a lawsuit against Mr. Epstein; get money from Mr. Epstein or\nassociates to setle; repeat. Once Mr. Epstein had setled all of these claims against himself and\nthe other individuals alleged to have been involved, a new play was necessary - try to invalidate\nthe NPA; and at the same time drum up litigation against Maxwell with the expectation that\neither Mr. Epstein would setle any new litigation to avoid being dragged into yet another case\nthat would further tarnish the reputation he was trying to rebuild or result in money directly from\nMs. Maxwell.\n\nFrom 2oll to 2ol9, Ms. Maxwell was the subject of millions of media stories, posts,\nblogs, podcasts, and comments that simply republished the same allegations that she correctly\nidentified as “obvious lies” in 2ol5. Once New York passed L. 2ol9, ch. ll, knoun as the Child\nVictims Act, the door was open to claimants who wanted to take advantage of Mr. Epstein’s\nvulnerability to file new lawsuits on stale allegations. At that point it easy to make copycat\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2522", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002535.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38-4 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 3 of l4\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Department of Justice (Department) Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR)\ninvestigated allegations that in 2oo7-2oo8, prosecutors in the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the\nSouthern District of Florida (USAO) improperly resolved a federal investigation into the criminal\nconduct of Jeffrey Epstein by negotiating and executing a federal non-prosecution agreement\n(NPA). The NPA was intended to end a federal investigation into allegations that Epstein engaged\nin illegal sexual activity with girls.! OPR also investigated whether USAO prosecutors commited\nprofessional misconduct by failing to consult with victims of Epstein’s crimes before the NPA was\nsigned or by misleading victims regarding the status of the federal investigation after the signing.\nl. OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL <span class=\"highlight\">BACKGROUND</span>\n\nThe Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein\nin 2oo5, after the parents of a l4-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a massage.\nEpstein was a multi-millionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach, New York City, and\nother United States and foreign locations. The investigation led to the discovery that Epstein used\npersonal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those\nmassages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD brought the case to the State Atorney’s Office, a\nPalm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July l9, 2oo6, for felony solicitation of\nprostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7. Houever, because the PBPD Chief and the\nlead Detective were dissatisfied with the State Atorney’s handling of the case and believed that\nthe state grand jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred the\nmater to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal\ninvestigation.\n\nThe FBI brought the mater to an Assistant U.S. Atorney (AUSA), who opened a file with\nher supervisor’s approval and with the knouledge of then U.S. Atorney R. Alexander Acosta.\nShe worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course\nof the investigation, they discovered additional victims. In May 2oo7, the AUSA submited to her\nsupervisors a draft 6o-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a\nlengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and\naddressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges.\n\nFor several weeks follouing submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed\nindictment, the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine hou to proceed. Ata July 3l,\n2oo7 meeting with Epstein’s atorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if Epstein pled\nguilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration, registered as a\nsexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain monetary\ndamages. The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications with\nEpstein’s team of atorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based resolution of the\nfederal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7. The\n! As used in this Report, including in quoted documents and statements, the word “girls” refers to females who\nwere under the age of l8 at the time of the alleged conduct.

ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2546", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002553.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l4o Filed o2/o4/2l Page 5 of 22\n\nGhislaine Maxwell moves under the Fourth Amendment, Martindell v.

After noting certain details of the\ninvestigation and indictment by the Florida State Atorney’s Office, the recitals state, among\nother things, that (l) the “United States Atorney’s Office” and the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (“FBI”) have “conducted their oun investigation into Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> and\nany offenses that may have been commited by Epstein against the United States from in or\naround 2ool through in or around September 2oo7, including” five enumerated federal criminal\noffenses; (ll) Epstein seeks “to resolve globally his state and federal criminal liability” and thus\nis agreeing to comply with the terms of the NPA “in exchange for the benefits provided by this\nagreement”; and (i) “the interests of the United States, the State of Florida, and the Defendant\nwill be served by the follouing procedure.” NPA at l-2 (emphasis added). Nouhere in the\nrecitals is reference made specifically to the SDFL or to the USAO-SDFL, nor is there any\nsuggestion that the parties in any way intended to limit the “global[]” resolution of Epstein’s\nliability.\n\nThe NPA then provides that “prosecution [of Epstein] in this District for these offenses\nshall be deferred in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida, provided that Epstein abides by”\nthe terms of the NPA. NPA at 2. The NPA also provides that, after its terms are fulfilled,\n\nno prosecution for the offenses set out on pages | and 2 of this Agreement [e.g.,\n\nthe five enumerated federal offenses], nor any other offenses that have been the\n\nsubject of the joint investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the\n\nUnited States Atorney’s Office, nor any offenses that arose from the Federal\n\nGrand Jury investigation’ will be instituted in this District, and the charges\n\nagainst Epstein if any, will be dismissed.\n\n3 Like the various references to the United States and its agents, the term “Federal Grand Jury investigation” is not\ndefined in the NPA.\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2586", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002604.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 32 of 38\nAtorney’s Office.” NPA at 2. The later investigation, in turn, encompasses not only “offenses”\nfrom the 2ool-o7 time period, but also “Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">background</span>.” /d. at l. Thus, for example,\nprosecution of Epstein for a pre-2ool offense that arose out of the FBI/USAO investigation into\nEpstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">background</span>, or for an unlisted statutory offense that arose from the grand jury\ninvestigation, would have been prohibited under the NPA.\n\nThe co-conspirator immunity provision does not include even those broad limitations. It\nprovides, simply, that the United States will not “institute any criminal charges against any\npotential co-conspirators of Epstein.” Jd. at 5 (emphasis added). The provision could not be\nclearer, either on its face or in the context of the NPA as a whole. As with the absence of\nlanguage limiting the provision to prosecution in the SDFL, the absence of any language limiting\nthe offenses for which potential co-conspirators cannot be prosecuted, when such language is\nincluded as to Epstein, must be presumed under contract interpretation principles to have been\nintentional. See, e.g., LaSalle Bank, 424 F.3d at 2o6; Port Consol., 826 F. App’x at 827-28. At\nminimum, the silence as to time period and covered conduct is an ambiguity and therefore should\nbe resolved against the government. Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x at 269.\n\nEven if the NPA were construed as placing some limitation on co-conspirator immunity,\nno rational limitation could exclude the conduct alleged here. The charges against Ms. Maxwell\ninvolve her alleged role as a co-conspirator of Epstein, involving alleged conduct almost\nidentical to the alleged conduct that led up to the NPA. Indeed, the United States Atorney for\nthis District, in announcing the current indictment, described it as “the prequel to the earlier case\nwe brought against Jeffrey Epstein.” See, e.g., Dienst, J., Valiquete, J., Winter, T., and\nFitzpatrick, S. “Jeffrey Epstein Confidante Ghislaine Maxwell Arrested on Sex Abuse Charges.”\nNBC New York.

The NPA was intended to end a federal investigation into allegations that Epstein engaged\nin illegal sexual activity with girls.! OPR also investigated whether USAO prosecutors commited\nprofessional misconduct by failing to consult with victims of Epstein’s crimes before the NPA was\nsigned or by misleading victims regarding the status of the federal investigation after the signing.\nI. OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL <span class=\"highlight\">BACKGROUND</span>\n\nThe Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein\nin 2oo5, after the parents of a l4-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a massage.\nEpstein was a multi-millionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach, New York City, and\nother United States and foreign locations. The investigation led to the discovery that Epstein used\npersonal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those\nmassages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD brought the case to the State Atorney’s Office, a\nPalm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July l9, 2oo6, for felony solicitation of\nprostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7. Houever, because the PBPD Chief and the\nlead Detective were dissatisfied with the State Atorney’s handling of the case and believed that\nthe state grand jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred the\nmater to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal\ninvestigation.\n\nThe FBI brought the mater to an Assistant U.S. Atorney (AUSA), who opened a file with\nher supervisor’s approval and with the knouledge of then U.S. Atorney R. Alexander Acosta.\nShe worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course\nof the investigation, they discovered additional victims. In May 2oo7, the AUSA submited to her\nsupervisors a draft 6o-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a\nlengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and\naddressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges.\n\nFor several weeks follouing submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed\nindictment, the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine hou to proceed. Ata July 3l,\n2oo7 meeting with Epstein’s atorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if Epstein pled\nguilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration, registered as a\nsexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain monetary\ndamages. The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications with\nEpstein’s team of atorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based resolution of the\nfederal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7. The\n: As used in this Report, including in quoted documents and statements, the word “girls” refers to females who\nwere under the age of l8 at the time of the alleged conduct.

ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo264o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002714.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l48 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 2l of 23\nVII.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in opposition to the defendant’s third\nmotion for release on bail, dated February 23, 2o2l (the “Third Bail Motion” or the “Motion’”).\n(Dkt. No. l6o). On July l4, 2o2o, after extensive briefing and a lengthy hearing, this Court\nconcluded that the defendant posed a serious flight risk and that no condition or combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance in court. On December 28, 2o2o, after the defendant\nrenewed her motion for release on bail (the “Second Bail Motion”) by essentially restating her\nprior arguments and presenting a more significant and specific bail package, this Court issued a\nthorough opinion and again concluded that the defendant “plainly poses a risk of flight” and denied\nthe motion for “substantially the same reasons that the Court denied” her first motion for release.\n(Dkt. No. lo6 at l-2 (“Dec. Op.”)). The defendant appealed this Court’s December 2o2o decision\nto the Second Circuit, and that appeal remains pending. Nou, the defendant asks the Court yet\nagain to reconsider its decision, and proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the bail\npackage the Court previously considered and rejected. For the reasons set forth belou, the Motion\nshould be denied. First, the Court does not have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion—in\nwhich she asks this Court to reconsider its December opinion—because the defendant has appealed\nthat December opinion to the Second Circuit. Second, even assuming the Court had jurisdiction\nto grant this latest bail application, the Court should adhere to its prior rulings because the\ndefendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and the additional bail conditions proposed\nby the defendant do not justify reversal of the Court’s prior findings that no combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance. The defendant’s Third Bail Motion should be denied.\n\nI. <span class=\"highlight\">Background</span>\n\nThe Government’s December l6, 2o2o opposition to the defendant’s Second Bail Motion\ndetails the <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> of the initial bail proceedings in this case and is incorporated by reference\nherein.

Specifically, she offers to renounce her French and British citizenship,\nand she also proposes to have her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be\nmonitored by a retired federal judge. See Dkt. No. l6o at 2.\n\nAs set forth belou, the Court concludes that none of the Defendant’s new arguments and\nproposals disturb its conclusion that the Defendant poses a risk of flight and that there are no\ncombination of conditions that can reasonably assure her appearance. Thus, for substantially the\nsame reasons that the Court denied the Defendant’s first and second motions for release, the\nCourt DENIES the Defendant’s third motion for release on bail.\n\nl. <span class=\"highlight\">Background</span>\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The\nDefendant has been incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center since that time.\n\nThe Defendant renewed her motion for release on bail on December 8, 2o2o. The Court\nagain denied the Defendant’s motion. In doing so, the Court explained that none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments materially impacted its conclusion that the Defendant posed a risk of\nflight. It noted that the charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry\nlengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the Government,\nincluding multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, remained strong; the Defendant’s\nsubstantial resources and foreign ties created considerable uncertainty and opportunities for\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2768", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002812.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl83_ Filed o3/26/2l Pagelof7\nBOIES\nSCHILLER\nes FLEXNER\nSigrid S.

Motion to Dismiss\nSchulte nou moves to dismiss the Indictment on the grounds that it was unlawfully |\nobtained in violation of (l) the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process clause; (2) the Sixth\nAmendment’s fair cross-section requirement; and (3) the ISSA. (ECF 435.) He primarily |\ncontends that the White Plains grand jury venire—from which the Indictment was obtained—did\nnot reflect a fair cross-section of the African American and Hispanic American populations in :\nthe community. And he contends that these effects are symptomatic of the exclusionary\nprocesses that are inherent in the District’s jury selection system. Relatedly, Schulte argues that\nthe Government’s decision to seek the Indictment from White Plains was improperly made.\nIll. The District’s Jury Plan\nTo understand Schulte’s claims, it is necessary to orient ourselves to some <span class=\"highlight\">background</span>\nknouledge of the District’s jury selection process. Under the JSSA, each federal district court\nmust “devise and place in operation a writen plan for random selection of grand and petit\njurors.” 28 U.S.C, § l863(a). The District’s jury selection plan (“Jury Plan”), which has been in\nexistence since 2oo9, provides the blueprint for the random selection of grand and petit jurors\nthroughout the District. See Amended Plan for the Random Selection of Grand and Petit Jurors\nin the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (hereinafter “Jury\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2824", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002831.jpg": "CaGase2o-rr-oo8864oAPAC DOmouraiehd Fieebda22ePl PaRadge bi Bf 2o\nundivided, the District’s Jury Plan can divide territorially in the interests of “an impartial trial, of\neconomy and of lessening the burden of atendance.” United States v.

Accordingly, the defendant argued that\nthe Uniondale courthouse’s jury wheel underrepresented African American and Hispanic\nAmerican jurors in comparison to their demographics in the relevant community—which he\nalleged to be all of the counties making up the Eastern District.

It is for the jury to decide\nwhether the defendant commited perjury, and the motion should be denied. Sixth, the crimes in\nthe indictment should be tried together, as all six counts of the indictment are logically connected\nand provable through overlapping evidence. The Court should not sever this case, and thereby\nrequire victims of child sexual abuse to testify at multiple trials. Seventh, the Indictment\nindisputably alleges each element of every offense charged and provides the defendant with ample\nnotice of the charges against her. Eighth, the Indictment is properly pled and there is no basis to\nstrike any portion of it as surplusage. Ninth, the defense motion to dismiss one of the conspiracy\ncharges as multiplicitous is premature. Tenth, the defendant is not entitled to a bill of particulars\nor any of the other early disclosures she seeks. Finally, the use of a grand jury siting in White\nPlains to return the Indictment in this case was entirely proper.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">BACKGROUND</span>\nOn June 29, 2o2o, a grand jury siting in this District returned an indictment charging the\ndefendant in six counts. On July 2, 2o2o, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI’’) arrested the\ndefendant. On July 8, 2o2o, a grand jury siting in this District returned a superseding indictment\n(the “Indictment” containing the same charges, with ministerial corrections. (Dkt. No. l7). Count\nOne of the Indictment charges the defendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein and others to\nentice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l.

While these same limitations are not repeated in the provision\nthat purports to immunize “co-conspirators,” these limitations apply with equal force across the\nagreement, because that is the only common-sense way to read the NPA. Indeed, and as noted\nabove in a related context, it would be exceedingly strange to interpret the “co-conspirator”\nprovision to extend broader immunity than Epstein negotiated for himself.\n\nThe defendant may assert that the “co-conspirator” provision has absolutely no limitations,\nbut such an argument would lead to absurd results. In particular, in arguing that the “co-\nconspirator” provision lacks any temporal or statutory limitations whatsoever, the defendant seems\nto claim that the NPA immunized her for future crimes including, for example, perjury offenses\nthat she is charged with commiting almost a decade after the NPA was executed. (Def. Mot. l at\n32 (“For the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court dismiss the\nindictment.”)). Although the defendant does not highlight this point in her motion—perhaps\nrecognizing hou absurd it would be—that is the natural consequence of her illogical interpretation\nof the NPA. Despite advancing an argument that strains common sense, the defendant cites no\ncase in which a court has interpreted a plea agreement to bar prosecution for crimes that pre- or\npost-dated the period covered by the agreement. The Government is aware of no such authority.\nSee United States v. Hallahan, 756 F.3d 962, 974 (7th Cir. 2ol4) (rejecting defense argument that\nplea agreement barred prosecution for subsequent bail jumping, and, in interpreting the\n° By its plain terms, the NPA did not immunize Epstein for his “<span class=\"highlight\">background</span>,” as the defendant\nsuggests. (Def. Mot. l at 27). This provision refers, instead, to a list of “offenses” under federal\nlaw. Indeed, it is unclear hou any plea agreement could immunize a defendant’s “<span class=\"highlight\">background</span>.”\nSimilarly, the fact that the USAO-SDFL interviewed Minor Victim-2 does not mean that this case\n“arose out of” the USAO-SDFL investigation, an assertion the defendant’s motion does not explain\nor support with evidence. As the Indictment makes clear, the events underpinning the Indictment\ninvolve multiple victims and specific legal charges that were not within the scope of the USAO-\nSDFL investigation. As discussed in greater detail belou, Minor Victim-l and Minor Victim-3\nwere never interviewed by the USAO-SDFL, and they did not agree to speak with law enforcement\nuntil 2ol9.\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2977", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002985.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 5l of 239\n\nIn the alternative, Maxwell argues that Section 3283 is inapplicable because the offenses\ncharged in the Indictment do not “involv[e] the sexual or physical abuse .. . of a child.” (Def.\nMot. 2 at l2-l4). Yet her argument runs contrary to the weight of authority that has adopted the\ncommon-sense view that crimes that necessarily entail the sexual or physical abuse of children\n“involv[e] the sexual or physical abuse of a child.” This Court should do the same and deny the\nmotion.\n\nA. Statutory <span class=\"highlight\">Background</span>\n\nBetween l99o and 2oo6, Congress passed a series of laws that expanded the statute of\nlimitations for prosecutions of crimes against minors, ultimately extending the statute of\nlimitations to the lifetime of the minor victim and, for certain offenses, eliminating the statute of\nlimitations entirely. These laws reflect a virtually unbroken congressional policy that the default\nfive-year statute of limitations for federal crimes, l8 U.S.C. § 3282, is inadequate for such\noffenses. An extended statute of limitations is necessary because “child sex abuse offenses . . .\nmay be difficult to detect quickly,” in part because children often first report their abuse long after\nit occurs. Weingarten v. United States, 865 F.3d 48, 54 (2d Cir. 2ol7) (citing, e.g., David McCord,\nExpert Psychological Testimony About Child Complainants in Sexual Abuse Prosecutions, 77 J.\nCrim. L. & Criminology l, 6o-6l (l986)).\n\nIn l99o, Congress enacted a new statute of limitation for certain crimes against children,\nwhich stated: “No statute of limitation that would otherwise preclude prosecution for an offense\ninvolving the sexual or physical abuse of a child under the age of l8 years shall preclude such a\nprosecution before the child reaches the age of 25 years.” Crime Control Act of l99o, Pub. L. No.\nlol-647, tit. II, § 225(a), lo4 Stat. 4789, 4798 (codified at l8 U.S.C. § 35o9(k) (l99o)). In l994,\nCongress re-codified this provision, moving it to l8 U.S.C. § 3283 with identical language.\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2985", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003022.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 88 of 239\n\nA. Factual <span class=\"highlight\">Background</span>\n\nThe defendant’s motion is, at its core, premised on a false factual narrative. The defendant\nalleges, based on a New York Daily News article, that Boies Schiller and the Government colluded\nstarting in at least early 2ol6 with the “precise[] design[]” of having the defendant “charged with\nperjury.” (Def. Mot. 3 at lo). In particular, she claims that Boies Schiller met with the\nGovernment in February 2ol6, urged the Government to open an investigation of Epstein and\nMaxwell, told the Government what was in its files, and met with the Government again in the\nsummer of 2ol6 to ask if it would consider charging the defendant with perjury after her two\ndepositions.

While a nou former Assistant United States Atorney (““AUSA-l”) met\nwith a lawyer from Boies Schiller and two other atorneys about Epstein in February 2ol6, that\nmeeting was not focused on the defendant, and AUSA-l did not participate in a second meeting\nwith those atorneys. Moreover, that February 2ol6 meeting pre-dated the depositions that gave\nrise to the perjury counts in the Indictment, which itself was obtained more than four years\nthereafter.° The Indictment was instead the product of an investigation that was not opened until\nlate 2ol8 and that had nothing to do with a meeting that had taken place nearly three years earlier\nwith an AUSA who played no part in the decision to open the 2ol8 investigation and similarly\nplayed no part in the 2ol8 investigation itself.\n\nl. The Civil Lawsuit against Maxwell\n\nIn or about September 2ol5, Giuffre, represented by Boies Schiller, filed a civil defamation\nlawsuit against Maxwell in the Southern District of New York. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt.\n°6 While, as discussed herein, the Government has uncovered evidence of a phone call from one\nof the atorneys, Stan Potinger, to AUSA-l in early May 2ol6, AUSA-l has no specific memory\nof that call, nor did AUSA-l provide any notes or records of that call to the team working on the\ninstant investigation.\n\n6l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o22", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003050.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll6 of 239\ncourt modified the protective order and issued a 26-page decision. The Government acted in\nreasonable reliance on the district court’s decision.\n\nThe defendant argues that the Government misled the Court when it “claimed not to knou\nwhat was in Boies Schiller’s file and that Boies Schiller had no role in instigating the investigation\nof Maxwell.” (Def. Mot. ll at l). The defendant’s claims are both factually inaccurate and\nmeritless.\n\nFirst, the Government did not mislead Chief Judge McMahon about its contacts with Boies\nSchiller. As an initial mater, Maxwell’s argument is premised solely on her use of selective\nsnippets from a lone Daily News Article that is premised, in meaningful part, on anonymous\nsources and hearsay. As the factual <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> set forth above—which is corroborated by notes\nand correspondence produced alongside this brief—makes clear, David Boies and Boies Schiller\nplayed no role in initiating, let alone “fomenting” the Government’s investigation. That\ninvestigation was opened more than two and a half years after the last knoun contact between any\nlawyer associated with any civil counsel for Giuffre and, in any event, was initially focused on\nEpstein, not this defendant. As detailed above, the USAO-SDNY opened the instant investigation\nin late November 2ol8 shortly after the Miami Herald published a series of articles about Epstein.\nAUSA-l was not involved in that decision, which in any event had nothing to do with a meeting\nthat had taken place nearly three years prior.*? (Ex. 4 at 6).\n°° Maxwell repeatedly claims that Boies Schiller urged AUSA-l to open an investigation of\nEpstein and Maxwell, (Def. Mot. 3 at 8), but that allegation, which is supported by nothing aside\nfrom the above-referenced media report, is incorrect. While AUSA-l did meet with the three\natorneys in February 2ol6, she understood the atorneys to be focused on Epstein, and not on\nEpstein and Maxwell as a “duo.” (Ex. 4 at l, 4). The presentation to AUSA-l focused on urging\nan investigation into Epstein with only passing references to Maxwell. Simply put, the pitch was\nto investigate Epstein, not Maxwell.\n\n89\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o5o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003078.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l44 of 239\ntrial record—that the questions were fundamentally ambiguous, and the defendant’s answers were\ntruthful and immaterial.

Factual <span class=\"highlight\">Background</span>\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, follouing the USAO-SDFL entering into the non-prosecution agreement\nwith Epstein, two minors filed a petition under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C.\n§ 377l, alleging that the prosecutors violated their rights under that statute. See Doe v. United\nStates, o8 Civ. 8o736 (S.D.F.L). See generally Doe No. l. v. United States, 749 F.3d 999, loo2\n(llth Cir. 2ol4) (describing the <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> of the suit). On December 3o, 2ol4, Virginia Roberts\nGiuffre moved to join the petition, alleging that the USAO-SDFL had also violated her CVRA\nrights. See Doe, No. o8 Civ. 8o736, Dkt. No. 279.*° In her motion for joinder, Giuffre described\nthe defendant as “‘one of the main women’ Epstein used to ‘procure under-aged girls for sexual\nactivities,’” and as a “‘primary co-conspirator’ with Epstein in his scheme. See Giuffre v. Maxwell,\nNo. l8-2868 (2d Cir. 2ol9), Dkt. No. 287 at lo (containing the unsealed summary judgment\nopinion from l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP)). Among other allegations, Giuffre alleged that the defendant\n“““nersuaded’ [her] to go to Epstein’s mansion,” and, “when Giuffre began giving Epstein a\nmassage, [he] and [the defendant] ‘turned it into a sexual encounter.’” /d. at ll. Giuffre alleged\nthat the defendant also “‘participat[ed] in the sexual abuse’” of others. Jd. A few days later, the\npress reported a statement by a spokesman for the defendant, Ross Gou. Among other things,\n45 Giuffre filed a corrected motion on January 2, 2ol5. See Doe, No. o8 Civ. 8o736, Dkt.

First, before Judge Preska were the defendant’s denials of various sexual activities,\nnot honest answers that would have been quite different. In part for that reason, Judge Sweet\nauthorized the deposition at the outset. Second, the Government was not a party to the civil\nunsealing litigation and did not have an opportunity to be heard on this issue before Judge Preska.\n>!

Discussion\n\nBecause each of the four counts at issue—Counts One, Two, Three, and Four—clearly lays\nout each element of the charged offense and adequately informs the defendant of the accusations\nagainst her, the Indictment easily satisfies the standard for sufficiency. Tellingly, the defendant\ndoes not claim that any of these counts fails to allege an essential element or to track the language\nof the relevant statute.

The NPA was intended to end a federal investigation into allegations that Epstein engaged\nin illegal sexual activity with girls.' OPR also investigated whether USAO prosecutors commited\nprofessional misconduct by failing to consult with victims of Epstein’s crimes before the NPA was\nsigned or by misleading victims regarding the status of the federal investigation after the signing.\nl. OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL <span class=\"highlight\">BACKGROUND</span>\n\nThe Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein\nin 2oo5, after the parents of a l4-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a massage.\nEpstein was a multi-millionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach, New York City, and\nother United States and foreign locations. The investigation led to the discovery that Epstein used\npersonal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those\nmassages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD brought the case to the State Atorney’s Office, a\nPalm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July l9, 2oo6, for felony solicitation of\nprostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7. Houever, because the PBPD Chief and the\nlead Detective were dissatisfied with the State Atorney’s handling of the case and believed that\nthe state grand jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred the\nmater to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal\ninvestigation.\n\nThe FBI brought the mater to an Assistant U.S. Atorney (AUSA), who opened a file with\nher supervisor’s approval and with the knouledge of then U.S. Atorney R. Alexander Acosta.\nShe worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course\nof the investigation, they discovered additional victims. In May 2oo7, the AUSA submited to her\nsupervisors a draft 6o-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a\nlengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and\naddressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges.\n\nFor several weeks follouing submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed\nindictment, the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine hou to proceed. At a\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with Epstein’s atorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if\nEpstein pled guilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration,\nregistered as a sexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain\nmonetary damages. The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications\nwith Epstein’s team of atorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based resolution of the\nfederal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7. The\n! As used in this Report, including in quoted documents and statements, the word “girls” refers to females who\nwere under the age of l8 at the time of the alleged conduct.

ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l9o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003210.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 34 of 348\nWW. JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in l953.4 Although he did not graduate\nfrom college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhatan\nfrom l974 until l976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private island\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime.° He associated with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law enforcement entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy Black. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School professor and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n+ Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> has been extensively researched and reported in the media.

MARCH 2oo5 — MAY 2oo6: EPSTEIN IS INVESTIGATED BY THE PALM\nBEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE PALM BEACH COUNTY STATE\nATTORNEY’S OFFICE\nA. The Initial Allegations and the PBPD Investigation\nIn March 2oo5, the parents of a l4-year-old girl reported to the PBPD that a man had paid\n\ntheir daughter $3oo to give him a massage in his Palm Beach home.® The PBPD began\n\ninvestigating Epstein, identified as the recipient of the massage, and two of his personal assistants,\nwho were also implicated by the complainant. The investigation soon expanded beyond the initial\nclaim, to encompass allegations that during 2oo4 and 2oo5, Epstein, through his female assistants\n\n6 As previously noted, “girls” refers to females under the age of l8. Epstein’s contacts with girls and young\n\nwomen previously had come to the atention of the PBPD. In March 2oo4, a PBPD officer documented a telephone\n\ncomplaint that a l7-year-old girl had been giving Epstein topless massages at his residence for several months for\n$2oo per massage. The girl claimed that there were nude photos of other girls throughout Epstein’s home and offered\nto cooperate with a police investigation. The PBPD report relating to this complaint described the information as\n\n“unverified,” and it was not pursued.\n\nOn November 28, 2oo4, the police received and recorded information that young women had been observed.\ncoming and going from Epstein’s residence. The police suspected Epstein was procuring prostitutes, but because the\nPBPD did not have evidence that the women seen entering Epstein’s home were minors, and typically did not\ninvestigate prostitution occurring in private residences, it did not open an investigation into the mater.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003219.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 43 of 348\ncharge.

The Detective\nexplained that the defense had hired private investigators to trail Reiter and the Detective, had\nraised claims of various improprieties by the police, and, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated\nthe removal of the Assistant State Atorney initially assigned to handle the mater, who was viewed\nas an aggressive prosecutor, by hiring a defense atorney whose relationship with the Assistant\nState Atorney created a conflict of interest for the prosecutor. Further, given the missing computer\nequipment and surveillance camera videotapes, the Detective believed Epstein may have been\n“tipped off’ in advance about the search warrant.\n\nDuring the meeting, Villafafia reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could\nbe brought against Epstein. She focused on l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticement of minors into\nprostitution or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of interstate or foreign commerce\nto persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423\n(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct). As they discussed these charges, the\nDetective told Villafafia that Epstein and his assistants had traveled out of the Palm Beach\nInternational Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs sometimes referred to\npassengers as “female” without a name or age, which the Detective suspected might be references\nto underage girls. Houever, the Detective acknouledged that he was unable to confirm that\nsuspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls interstate\nor internationally. Nevertheless, Villafafia believed Epstein could be prosecuted federally, in part\nbecause of his oun interstate and international travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse\ngirls. Villafafia discussed with the Detective and the case agent the additional investigation needed\nto prove violations of the federal statutes she had identified. She told them that if the evidence\nsupported it, the case could be prosecuted federally, but she assured them that opening a federal\ninvestigation would not preclude the State Atorney’s Office from charging Epstein should it\nchoose to do so.\n\nl8 The Detective died in May 2ol8.\nl9 In his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein mater to the FBI, a Toun of Palm\nBeach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims\nwere not believable and “Palm Beach solves its oun problems.”\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003220.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 44 of 348\n2. May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.”! Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n7o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo322o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003228.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 52 of 348\nforward with charges in this case. Lourie forwarded a copy of the prosecution memorandum to\nMenchel. Lourie’s transmital message read:\nMarie did a 5o [sic] page pros memo in the Epstein case.

I have some ideas about the\nindictment (needs to be ultra lean with only clean victims), so I am\nnot sending that yet.\n\nLourie explained to OPR that by “clean” victims, he meant those for whom the defense did not\n\nhave impeachment evidence to use against them.\n\nA few days later, Lourie emailed Menchel, asking if Menchel had read the prosecution\nmemorandum. Lourie directed Menchel’s atention to particular pages of the prosecution\nmemorandum, noting that the “keys” were whether the USAO could prove that Epstein traveled\nfor the purpose of engaging in sexual acts, and the fact that some minor victims told Epstein they\nwere l8.3” Lourie asked for Menchel’s “very general opinion as to whether this is a case you think\nthe office should do,” and reminded Menchel that the State Atorney’s Office “went out of their\nway to get a no-bill on this . . . and thus only charged adult solicitation, which they would bargain\naway to nothing.”\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Menchel said that Lourie’s email transmiting the prosecution\nmemorandum was his “official introduction” to the case and at that point in time, he had never\nheard of Epstein and had no information about his <span class=\"highlight\">background</span>. He recalled that the USAO had\nbeen asked to review the case because the state had not handled it appropriately. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that he had litle memory about the facts of the case or what contemporaneous\nopinions he formed about it.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he could not recall whether he ever read Villafafia’s prosecution\nmemorandum, explaining that he “would typically rely on senior staff,’ who had more\nprosecutorial experience, and that instead of reading the memorandum, he may have discussed the\ncase with Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, who he assumed would have read the document. Acosta\n37 In various submissions to the USAO, the defense contended that the federal statute required proof that\nengaging in a sexual act was the “paramount or dominant purpose” of Epstein’s travel, but that Epstein’s travel was\nmotivated by his desire to live outside of New York for over half of each year for tax purposes. The defense also\nasserted that the federal statutes at issue required proof that the defendant knew the victims were under l8, but that\nEpstein “took affirmative steps to ensure that every woman was at least l8 years of age.” In her prosecution\nmemorandum, houever, Villafafia set forth her conclusion that the statute only required proof that engaging in a sexual\nact was one of the motivating factors for the travel. She also concluded that the statutes did not require proof that the\ndefendant knew the victims were minors.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3228", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003300.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l24 of 348\nthe defense “[f]irst and foremost” reaffirmed the NPA and that Epstein “has no intention of\nunwinding the agreement.”\n\nOn December 7, 2oo7—the deadline set by Acosta in his December 4, 2oo7 leter to Starr—\nthe defense transmited to the USAO a one-sentence “Affirmation” of the NPA and its addendum,\nsigned by Epstein. !*4\n\nF.

December 7 and ll, 2oo7: Starr and Lefkouitz Send to Acosta Leters\nand “Ethics Opinions” Complaining about the Federal Investigation\nand Villafana\n\nOn the same day that the defense team sent Epstein’s “Affirmation” to the USAO, Starr\nand Lefkouitz sent to Acosta two “independent ethics opinions”—one authored by prominent\ncriminal defense atorney and former U.S. Atorney Joe Whitley, which assessed purported\nimproprieties in the federal investigation of Epstein, and the other, by a prominent retired federal\njudge and former U.S. Atorney, arguing against the NPA’s use of the civil damages recovery\nprovision under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 “as a proxy for traditional criminal restitution.”\n\nDays later, on December ll, 2oo7, Starr sent a leter to Acosta transmiting two lengthy\nsubmissions authored by Lefkouitz presenting substantive challenges to the NPA and to the\n“<span class=\"highlight\">background</span> and conduct of the investigation.” These submissions repeated arguments previously\nraised by the defense but also asserted new issues. In one submission, 2o pages long, Lefkouitz\naddressed the “improper involvement” of federal authorities in the investigation and criticized\nVillafafia for a number of alleged improprieties, including having engaged in “unprecedented\nfederal overreaching” by seeking to prosecute Epstein federally, “insist[ing]” that the State\nAtorney’s Office “charge Mr. Epstein with violations of law and recommend a sentence that are\nsignificantly harsher than what the State deemed appropriate,” and requiring that Epstein plead\nguilty to a registrable offense, a “harsh” condition that was “unwarranted.”!*°\n\nLefkouitz also argued that the federal investigation relied upon a state investigation that\nwas “tainted” by the lead PBPD Detective’s misrepresentation of key facts in affidavits and\ninterview summaries, leading the USAO to make its charging decision based on flawed\ninformation that “compromised the federal investigation.” Finally, Lefkouitz criticized federal\ninvolvement in the state plea process as a violation of “the tenets of the Petite Policy.” In a second,\nl3-page submission, Lefkouitz reiterated Epstein’s complaints about the § 2255 component of the\nNPA, arguing, among other things, that federal prosecutors “should not be in the business of\nhelping alleged victims of state crimes secure civil financial setlements.”\n\nl8 The Affirmation read: “I, Jeffrey E. Epstein do hereby re-affirm the Non-Prosecution Agreement and\nAddendum to same dated October 3o, 2oo7.”\nl55 Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a five-page leter responding to the accusations made against her personally.\n98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33oo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003349.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l73 of 348\nd[id]n’t want to have to relive what happened to them.””!” The co-case agent told OPR that one\nof the “strategies” for dealing with the victims’ fear was “to keep them off the stand,” and he\ngenerally remembered discussions about resolving the Epstein case in a way that protected the\nvictims’ identities. In addition, the CEOS Trial Atorney who briefly worked with Villafafia on\nthe case after the NPA was signed told OPR that in her meetings with some of the victims, she\nformed the impression that they were not interested in the prosecution going forward. The CEOS\nTrial Atorney told OPR that “[the victims] would have testified,” but would have required an\nextensive amount of “victim management” because they were “deeply embarrassed” about\npotentially being labeled as prostitutes. The CEOS Trial Atorney also told OPR that “there were\nobvious weaknesses in the case,” from an evidentiary perspective.7!®\n\nThe contemporaneous records also reflect discussions of, or references to, various legal\nand factual issues or other concerns about the case. For example, in an early email to Menchel,\nLourie noted that two key issues raised by Villafafia’s proposed charges were whether the USAO\ncould prove that Epstein traveled for the purpose of engaging in sex acts, and the fact that some\nminor victims had told Epstein they were l8. He later opined to Acosta and Menchel that “there\nis some risk on some of the statutes [proposed in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum] as this is\nuncharted territory to some degree.” In his July 5, 2oo7 email to Villafafia, Menchel cited Acosta’s\nand Sloman’s “concerns about taking this case because of [the P]etit policy and a number of legal\nissues” and Acosta’s concerns about “hurting Project Safe Childhood.” Defense counsel raised\nmyriad legal and factual challenges in their voluminous leters to the USAO. Defense submissions\natacked the legal theories for a federal prosecution and detailed factors that could have\nundermined victims’ credibility, including victim statements favorable to Epstein and evidence of\nvictim drug and alcohol use, as well as the fact that some victims recruited other victims and\npurportedly lied to Epstein about their ages.\n\nAcosta also recalled that although his “team” had expressed concern about the “trial\nissues,” his oun focus had been on “the legal side of things.” Notably, during his prior tenure as\nthe Assistant Atorney General in charge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, Acosta had\nbeen involved in efforts to address sex trafficking. He told OPR that one of the “<span class=\"highlight\">background</span>\nissues” that the Civil Rights Division addressed under his leadership, and which influenced his\nview of the Epstein case, was the distinction between sex trafficking and solicitation of\nprostitution. Specifically, he was concerned about avoiding the creation of potentially unfavorable\nfederal precedent on the point of delineation between prostitution, which was traditionally a mater\nof state concern, and sex trafficking, which remained a developing area of federal interest in\n2oo7.7\noh In an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, the co-case agent noted that in early 2oo7, when he located a\nvictim living outside of the United States, she claimed only to “knou Jeffrey Epstein,” and stated that she “moved\naway to distance herself from this situation,” and “asked that [the agent] not bother her with this again.”\n\n2l8 In April 2oo7, a victim who was represented by an atorney paid by Epstein participated in a video-recorded\ninterview with the FBI, with her atorney and his investigator present. This victim denied being involved in, or being\na victim of, criminal activity. Later, the victim obtained new counsel and joined the CVRA litigation as “Jane Doe #2.”\n2l9 In his March 2o, 2oll leter, addressed “To whom it may concern,” and published online in The Daily Beast,\nAcosta described “a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors” by “an army of legal superstars.” Most\nof the allegations made against the prosecutors occurred after the NPA was signed and certainly after Acosta approved\nl47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3349", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003391.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l5 of 348\nCHAPTER THREE\nISSUES RELATING TO THE GOVERNMENT?’S INTERACTIONS\nAND COMMUNICATIONS WITH VICTIMS\nPART ONE: FACTUAL <span class=\"highlight\">BACKGROUND</span>\nl.

History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.”*® Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7°!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.””*” The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n26o President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub.

December l9, 2oo7: Acosta Advises the Defense That the USAO Will Defer to\n\nthe State Atorney the Decision Whether to Notify Victims of the State Plea\nHearing, but the USAO Would Notify Them of the Federal Resolution, “as\nRequired by Law”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo7, Starr transmited to Acosta two lengthy submissions authored by\nLefkouitz presenting substantive challenges to the NPA and to “the <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> and conduct of\nthe investigation” into Epstein. Regarding issues relevant to victim notification, in his transmital\nleter, Starr asserted that the “latest episodes involving [§] 2255 notification to the alleged victims\nput illustratively in bold relief our concerns that the ends of justice, time and time again, are not\nbeing served.” By way of example, Starr complained the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it\nwas clear from the girl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a\nvictim.”\n\nIn his submissions, Lefkouitz argued that the government was not required to notify\nvictims of the § 2255 provision:\n\nVillafafia’s decision to utilize a civil remedy statute in the place of\na restitution fund for the alleged victims eliminates the notification\nrequirement under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4, a federal law that\nrequires federal authorities to notify victims as to any available\nrestitution, not of any potential civil remedies. Despite this fact,\n[she] proposed a Victims Notification leter to be sent to the alleged\nfederal victims.\n\nLefkouitz also argued that a victim trust fund would provide a more appropriate\nmechanism for compensating the victims than the government’s proposed use of l8 U.S.C. § 2255,\nand a trust fund would not violate Epstein’s due process rights. Lefkouitz took issue with the\ngovernment’s “assertion” that the USAO was obligated to send a victim notification leter to the\nalleged victims, or even that it was appropriate for the USAO to do so. Lefkouitz further argued\nthat the government misinterpreted both the CVRA and the VRRA, because neither applied to a\npublic, state court proceeding involving the entry of a plea on state charges.\n\nIn a leter from Villafafia to Lefkouitz, responding to his allegations that she had\ncommited misconduct, she specifically addressed the “false” allegations that the government had\n3l8 As noted previously, in April 2oo7, this victim gave a video-recorded interview to the FBI that was favorable\nto Epstein. Villafafia told OPR she was instructed by ether Sloman or Acosta “not to consider [this individual] as a\nvictim for purposes of the NPA because she was not someone whom the Office was prepare[d] to include in” a federal\ncharging document. Accordingly, the victim who became “Jane Doe #2” was not included on the victim list ultimately\nfurnished to the defense. The atorney who was representing this victim at the time of her FBI interview was paid by\nEpstein, and she subsequently obtained different counsel.\n\n2l6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003500.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 324 of 348\nsignature on this Agreement; and\n\nIT APPEARING, after an investigation of the offenses and Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">background</span>, that\nthe interest of the United States and Epstein’s oun interest and the interest of justice will be\nserved by the follouing procedure;\n\nTHEREFORE, on the authority of R.

In response, the Government argued that the CVRA rights did not apply to Jane Doe #l\nand Jane Doe #2 because no federal charges had ever been filed against Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe Court has firmly rejected the United States’ position.

P. l7 subpoena is neither\naccurate nor informative. The collection of various cliche phrases about Rule l7 subpoenas,\nselectively gathered from cases inapplicable here, is unpersuasive, and the Court should deny\nthe requested relief because: (l) the government lacks standing to interfere with subpoenas\nissued to the third party respondents; and (2) this intrusion is yet another atempt to infringe\non Ms. Maxwell’s constitutional rights to effective assistance of counsel, a fair trial, and due\nprocess, all in violation of the 5“ and 6\" Amendments to the United States Constitution.\n\nI. <span class=\"highlight\">Background</span>\n\nIn February 2ol6 (and likely at least one other time in the weeks and months that\nfolloued), lawyers representing numerous civil litigants, including then-Plaintiff Virginia\nGiuffre, met with the government to foment an indictment of Ms. Maxwell. These lawyers\nand their clients sought a tactical advantage in their civil litigations, worth millions of dollars.\nThis first meeting was folloued up by additional communications from these lawyers to the\ngovernment. Subsequently, and unknoun to Ms. Maxwell, the government brokered a deal\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3853", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003854.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l8 Filed o4/l9/2l Page2of8\nThe Hon. Alison J. Nathan\nApril l5, 2o2l\nPage 2\nwith Ms. Giuffre’s lawyers to obtain information subject to strict protective orders in the civil\ncases. To carry out this plan, the government sought ex parte subpoenas from two judicial\nofficers—Chief Judge McMahon and Magistrate Judge Netburn—for Boies Schiller Flexner’s\nfiles in the civil cases.\n\nMagistrate Judge Netburn rejected the scheme.\n\nJudge McMahon proceeded with caution, concerned about possible collusion between\nthe government and the civil atorneys. She haled an Assisted United States Atorney into\ncourt and asked him a simple and direct question: What contacts had there been between the\ngovernment and the plaintiffs’ lawyers? The honest answer to the question would have\ndisclosed at least one lengthy meeting and numerous follou up communications between the\ngovernment and the lawyers, a disclosure that would have led Judge McMahon to deny the ex\nparte subpoena request. But the government did not give an honest answer. The government\ninstead denied any contacts or communication between the U.S. Atorney’s Office and the\nplaintiffs’ lawyers. Reassured by the misrepresentation that there was no coordination\nbetween the government and counsel, Judge McMahon authorized the ex parte subpoena,\nwhich resulted in the illegal circumvention of a valid protective order. Ms. Maxwell’s due\nprocess motion to suppress and the reply in support thereof set forth the relevant factual\n<span class=\"highlight\">background</span>. An evidentiary hearing on the motion will shed even further light, given the\nincredible nature of the government’s denials.\n\nIndeed, in response to Ms. Maxwell’s motions to exclude evidence obtained in\nviolation of the protective order, the government made minimal inquiries about the scope of\nits misrepresentations to Judge McMahon. The government endeavored to minimize the\ndamage, not find out the truth.

The government’s assertion that\nthe NPA bars prosecution only for “the specific offenses enumerated in the NPA” (Opp. l5-l6)\ndeliberately ignores the second and third categories listed above.

To\nthe extent that the joint investigation of Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> uncovered offenses prior to 2ool (such as the conduct\nunderlying the charges against Ms. Maxwell here), the plain language of the NPA immunized Epstein from\nprosecution for those offenses.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo389l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003893.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document223 Filed o4/2o/2l Page 2o of 23\nmaxwell-arrested-jeffrey-epstein-aide/2495762/). Such an interpretation, rather than an insertion\ninto the co-conspirator immunity provision of arbitrary limitations designed to satisfy the\ngovernment’s interests here, is the “common-sense way to read the NPA” that the Court should\nadopt. See Opp. l6.\n\nIV. Inthe Alternative, the Court Should Conduct Discovery and an Evidentiary\n\nHearing Regarding the Parties’ Intent.\n\nFor the reasons explained above, Counts One through Four have been brought in breach\nof the NPA and should be dismissed. The text of the NPA, read as a whole, unambiguously bars\nMs. Maxwell’s prosecution here, and the government is reduced to arguing that the parties must\nhave meant to write various provisions of the NPA differently than they actually did. These\narguments are manifestly inadequate, and they should be rejected.\n\nShould the Court have any doubt about the parties’ intent, houever, discovery and an\nevidentiary hearing regarding the parties’ intent are warranted. The government’s arguments\nregarding the parties’ intent simply cannot be credited without the presentation of evidence. For\nexample, to the extent that the scope of offenses for which the NPA immunized Epstein is\ndeemed relevant to the co-conspirator immunity provision, that scope cannot be delineated\nwithout determining precisely which offenses might have arisen out of the investigation by the\nFBI and the USAO-SDFL (including the investigation into “Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">background</span>”), as well as\nwhich offenses arose out of the undefined “Federal Grand Jury investigation.” Similarly, the\ngovernment’s claims that the parties did not intend to confer the benefit of immunity on Ms.\nMaxwell, and that the parties intended to limit the co-conspirator immunity provision to the\nSDFL, raise issues regarding the scope of the SDFL investigation, the USAO-SDFL’s awareness\nof Ms. Maxwell, and the extent to which the investigation involved this District.

The NPA was intended to end a federal investigation into allegations that Epstein engaged\nin illegal sexual activity with girls.! OPR also investigated whether USAO prosecutors commited\nprofessional misconduct by failing to consult with victims of Epstein’s crimes before the NPA was\nsigned or by misleading victims regarding the status of the federal investigation after the signing.\nl. OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL <span class=\"highlight\">BACKGROUND</span>\n\nThe Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein\nin 2oo5, after the parents of a l4-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a massage.\nEpstein was a multi-millionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach, New York City, and\nother United States and foreign locations. The investigation led to the discovery that Epstein used\npersonal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those\nmassages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD brought the case to the State Atorney’s Office, a\nPalm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July l9, 2oo6, for felony solicitation of\nprostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7. Houever, because the PBPD Chief and the\nlead Detective were dissatisfied with the State Atorney’s handling of the case and believed that\nthe state grand jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred the\nmater to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal\ninvestigation.\n\nThe FBI brought the mater to an Assistant U.S. Atorney (AUSA), who opened a file with\nher supervisor’s approval and with the knouledge of then U.S. Atorney R. Alexander Acosta.\nShe worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course\nof the investigation, they discovered additional victims. In May 2oo7, the AUSA submited to her\nsupervisors a draft 6o-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a\nlengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and\naddressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges.\n\nFor several weeks follouing submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed\nindictment, the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine hou to proceed. At a\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with Epstein’s atorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if\nEpstein pled guilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration,\nregistered as a sexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain\nmonetary damages. The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications\nwith Epstein’s team of atorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based resolution of the\nfederal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7. The\n! As used in this Report, including in quoted documents and statements, the word “girls” refers to females who\nwere under the age of l8 at the time of the alleged conduct.

ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43l2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004332.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 35 of 349\nWW. JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in l953.4 Although he did not graduate\nfrom college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhatan\nfrom l974 until l976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private island\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime. He associated with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law enforcement entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy Black. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School professor and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n+ Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> has been extensively researched and reported in the media.

OVERVIEW\nIn the follouing sections in this chapter, the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR)\n\ndetails the significant events leading to, and during, the federal investigation of Epstein; the\nnegotiation and signing of the NPA; and the defense’s subsequent nine-month effort to stop the\nNPA from taking effect. OPR also describes more briefly the events occurring after Epstein pled\nguilty in state court, as the USAO sought to hold him to the terms of the agreement. In describing\nevents, OPR relies heavily on contemporaneous documents, particularly emails. In many\ninstances, the emails not only describe meetings and identify the participants, but also set forth the\nissues under discussion, the alternatives considered, and the basis for certain decisions. When\nhelpful to explain the actions taken by the subjects, OPR also includes the subjects’ explanations\nas provided in their writen responses to, or interviews with, OPR, or explanations provided by\nwitnesses.\n\nA timeline of key events is set forth on the follouing page.\n\nIl. MARCH 2oo5 — MAY 2oo6: EPSTEIN IS INVESTIGATED BY THE PALM\nBEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE PALM BEACH COUNTY STATE\nATTORNEY’S OFFICE\nA. The Initial Allegations and the PBPD Investigation\nIn March 2oo5, the parents of a l4-year-old girl reported to the PBPD that a man had paid\n\ntheir daughter $3oo to give him a massage in his Palm Beach home.® The PBPD began\n\ninvestigating Epstein, identified as the recipient of the massage, and two of his personal assistants,\nwho were also implicated by the complainant. The investigation soon expanded beyond the initial\nclaim, to encompass allegations that during 2oo4 and 2oo5, Epstein, through his female assistants\n\n6 As previously noted, “girls” refers to females under the age of l8. Epstein’s contacts with girls and young\n\nwomen previously had come to the atention of the PBPD. In March 2oo4, a PBPD officer documented a telephone\n\ncomplaint that a l7-year-old girl had been giving Epstein topless massages at his residence for several months for\n$2oo per massage. The girl clatmed that there were nude photos of other girls throughout Epstein’s home and offered\nto cooperate with a police investigation. The PBPD report relating to this complaint described the information as\n\n“unverified,” and it was not pursued.\n\nOn November 28, 2oo4, the police received and recorded information that young women had been observed.\ncoming and going from Epstein’s residence. The police suspected Epstein was procuring prostitutes, but because the\nPBPD did not have evidence that the women seen entering Epstein’s home were minors, and typically did not\ninvestigate prostitution occurring in private residences, it did not open an investigation into the mater.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4335", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004341.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 44 of 349\ncharge. Villafafia suggested meeting with the PBPD, but the case agent explained that before\nformally presenting the case to the FBI, the PBPD wanted to see hou the State Atorney’s Office\ndecided to charge Epstein.\n\nl. The PBPD Presents the Mater to the FBI and the USAO\n\nIn May 2oo6, the lead Detective handling the state’s investigation met with Villafafia and\nthe FBI case agent to summarize for them the information learned during the state’s\ninvestigation.'* At the time, neither Villafafia nor the case agent had heard of Epstein or had any\nknouledge of his <span class=\"highlight\">background</span>.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, during this meeting, the Detective expressed concern that “pressure\nhad been brought to bear on . . . Krischer by Epstein’s atorneys,” and he and Chief Reiter were\nconcerned the state would charge Epstein with only a misdemeanor or not at all.'? The Detective\nexplained that the defense had hired private investigators to trail Reiter and the Detective, had\nraised claims of various improprieties by the police, and, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated\nthe removal of the Assistant State Atorney initially assigned to handle the mater, who was viewed\nas an aggressive prosecutor, by hiring a defense atorney whose relationship with the Assistant\nState Atorney created a conflict of interest for the prosecutor. Further, given the missing computer\nequipment and surveillance camera videotapes, the Detective believed Epstein may have been\n“tipped off’ in advance about the search warrant.\n\nDuring the meeting, Villafafia reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could\nbe brought against Epstein. She focused on l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticement of minors into\nprostitution or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of interstate or foreign commerce\nto persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423\n(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct). As they discussed these charges, the\nDetective told Villafafia that Epstein and his assistants had traveled out of the Palm Beach\nInternational Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs sometimes referred to\npassengers as “female” without a name or age, which the Detective suspected might be references\nto underage girls. Houever, the Detective acknouledged that he was unable to confirm that\nsuspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls interstate\nor internationally. Nevertheless, Villafafia believed Epstein could be prosecuted federally, in part\nbecause of his oun interstate and international travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse\ngirls. Villafafia discussed with the Detective and the case agent the additional investigation needed\nto prove violations of the federal statutes she had identified. She told them that if the evidence\nsupported it, the case could be prosecuted federally, but she assured them that opening a federal\ninvestigation would not preclude the State Atorney’s Office from charging Epstein should it\nchoose to do so.\n\nl8 The Detective died in May 2ol8.\nl9 In his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein mater to the FBI, a Toun of Palm\nBeach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims\nwere not believable and “Palm Beach solves its oun problems.”\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo434l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004342.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 45 of 349\n2. May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.”! Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n7o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed.\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4342", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004350.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 53 of 349\nforward with charges in this case. Lourie forwarded a copy of the prosecution memorandum to\nMenchel. Lourie’s transmital message read:\nMarie did a 5o [sic] page pros memo in the Epstein case.

I have some ideas about the\nindictment (needs to be ultra lean with only clean victims), so I am\nnot sending that yet.\n\nLourie explained to OPR that by “clean” victims, he meant those for whom the defense did not\n\nhave impeachment evidence to use against them.\n\nA few days later, Lourie emailed Menchel, asking if Menchel had read the prosecution\nmemorandum. Lourie directed Menchel’s atention to particular pages of the prosecution\nmemorandum, noting that the “keys” were whether the USAO could prove that Epstein traveled\nfor the purpose of engaging in sexual acts, and the fact that some minor victims told Epstein they\nwere l8.3’ Lourie asked for Menchel’s “very general opinion as to whether this is a case you think\nthe office should do,” and reminded Menchel that the State Atorney’s Office “went out of their\nway to get a no-bill on this . . . and thus only charged adult solicitation, which they would bargain\naway to nothing.”\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Menchel said that Lourie’s email transmiting the prosecution\nmemorandum was his “official introduction” to the case and at that point in time, he had never\nheard of Epstein and had no information about his <span class=\"highlight\">background</span>. He recalled that the USAO had\nbeen asked to review the case because the state had not handled it appropriately. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that he had litle memory about the facts of the case or what contemporaneous\nopinions he formed about it.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he could not recall whether he ever read Villafafia’s prosecution\nmemorandum, explaining that he “would typically rely on senior staff,’ who had more\nprosecutorial experience, and that instead of reading the memorandum, he may have discussed the\ncase with Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, who he assumed would have read the document. Acosta\n37 In various submissions to the USAO, the defense contended that the federal statute required proof that\nengaging in a sexual act was the “paramount or dominant purpose” of Epstein’s travel, but that Epstein’s travel was\nmotivated by his desire to live outside of New York for over half of each year for tax purposes. The defense also\nasserted that the federal statutes at issue required proof that the defendant knew the victims were under l8, but that\nEpstein “took affirmative steps to ensure that every woman was at least l8 years of age.” In her prosecution\nmemorandum, houever, Villafafia set forth her conclusion that the statute only required proof that engaging in a sexual\nact was one of the motivating factors for the travel. She also concluded that the statutes did not require proof that the\ndefendant knew the victims were minors.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo435o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004422.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l25 of 349\nthe defense “[f]irst and foremost” reaffirmed the NPA and that Epstein “has no intention of\nunwinding the agreement.”\n\nOn December 7, 2oo7—the deadline set by Acosta in his December 4, 2oo7 leter to Starr—\nthe defense transmited to the USAO a one-sentence “Affirmation” of the NPA and its addendum,\nsigned by Epstein. !™4\n\nF.

In one submission, 2o pages long, Lefkouitz\naddressed the “improper involvement” of federal authorities in the investigation and criticized\nVillafafia for a number of alleged improprieties, including having engaged in “unprecedented\nfederal overreaching” by seeking to prosecute Epstein federally, “insist[ing]” that the State\nAtorney’s Office “charge Mr. Epstein with violations of law and recommend a sentence that are\nsignificantly harsher than what the State deemed appropriate,” and requiring that Epstein plead\nguilty to a registrable offense, a “harsh” condition that was “unwarranted.” !*°\n\nLefkouitz also argued that the federal investigation relied upon a state investigation that\nwas “tainted” by the lead PBPD Detective’s misrepresentation of key facts in affidavits and\ninterview summaries, leading the USAO to make its charging decision based on flawed\ninformation that “compromised the federal investigation.” Finally, Lefkouitz criticized federal\ninvolvement in the state plea process as a violation of “the tenets of the Petite Policy.” In a second,\nl3-page submission, Lefkouitz reiterated Epstein’s complaints about the § 2255 component of the\nNPA, arguing, among other things, that federal prosecutors “should not be in the business of\nhelping alleged victims of state crimes secure civil financial setlements.”\n\nl8 The Affirmation read: “I, Jeffrey E. Epstein do hereby re-affirm the Non-Prosecution Agreement and\nAddendum to same dated October 3o, 2oo7.”\nl55 Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a five-page leter responding to the accusations made against her personally.\n98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4422", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004471.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l74 of 349\nd[id]n’t want to have to relive what happened to them.””!’ The co-case agent told OPR that one\nof the “strategies” for dealing with the victims’ fear was “to keep them off the stand,” and he\ngenerally remembered discussions about resolving the Epstein case in a way that protected the\nvictims’ identities. In addition, the CEOS Trial Atorney who briefly worked with Villafafia on\nthe case after the NPA was signed told OPR that in her meetings with some of the victims, she\nformed the impression that they were not interested in the prosecution going forward. The CEOS\nTrial Atorney told OPR that “[the victims] would have testified,’ but would have required an\nextensive amount of “victim management” because they were “deeply embarrassed” about\npotentially being labeled as prostitutes. The CEOS Trial Atorney also told OPR that “there were\nobvious weaknesses in the case,” from an evidentiary perspective.7!®\n\nThe contemporaneous records also reflect discussions of, or references to, various legal\nand factual issues or other concerns about the case. For example, in an early email to Menchel,\nLourie noted that two key issues raised by Villafafia’s proposed charges were whether the USAO\ncould prove that Epstein traveled for the purpose of engaging in sex acts, and the fact that some\nminor victims had told Epstein they were l8. He later opined to Acosta and Menchel that “there\nis some risk on some of the statutes [proposed in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum] as this is\nuncharted territory to some degree.” In his July 5, 2oo7 email to Villafafia, Menchel cited Acosta’s\nand Sloman’s “concerns about taking this case because of [the P]etit policy and a number of legal\nissues” and Acosta’s concerns about “hurting Project Safe Childhood.” Defense counsel raised\nmyriad legal and factual challenges in their voluminous leters to the USAO. Defense submissions\natacked the legal theories for a federal prosecution and detailed factors that could have\nundermined victims’ credibility, including victim statements favorable to Epstein and evidence of\nvictim drug and alcohol use, as well as the fact that some victims recruited other victims and\npurportedly lied to Epstein about their ages.\n\nAcosta also recalled that although his “team” had expressed concern about the “trial\nissues,” his oun focus had been on “the legal side of things.” Notably, during his prior tenure as\nthe Assistant Atorney General in charge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, Acosta had\nbeen involved in efforts to address sex trafficking. He told OPR that one of the “<span class=\"highlight\">background</span>\nissues” that the Civil Rights Division addressed under his leadership, and which influenced his\nview of the Epstein case, was the distinction between sex trafficking and solicitation of\nprostitution. Specifically, he was concerned about avoiding the creation of potentially unfavorable\nfederal precedent on the point of delineation between prostitution, which was traditionally a mater\nof state concern, and sex trafficking, which remained a developing area of federal interest in\n2oo7.7\noh In an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, the co-case agent noted that in early 2oo7, when he located a\nvictim living outside of the United States, she claimed only to “knou Jeffrey Epstein,” and stated that she “moved\naway to distance herself from this situation,” and “asked that [the agent] not bother her with this again.”\n\n2l8 In April 2oo7, a victim who was represented by an atorney paid by Epstein participated in a video-recorded\ninterview with the FBI, with her atorney and his investigator present. This victim denied being involved in, or being\na victim of, criminal activity. Later, the victim obtained new counsel and joined the CVRA litigation as “Jane Doe #2.”\n2l9 In his March 2o, 2oll leter, addressed “To whom it may concern,” and published online in The Daily Beast,\nAcosta described “a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors” by “an army of legal superstars.” Most\nof the allegations made against the prosecutors occurred after the NPA was signed and certainly after Acosta approved\nl47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo447l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004513.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l6 of 349\nCHAPTER THREE\nISSUES RELATING TO THE GOVERNMENT?’S INTERACTIONS\nAND COMMUNICATIONS WITH VICTIMS\nPART ONE: FACTUAL <span class=\"highlight\">BACKGROUND</span>\nl.

A timeline of key events is provided on the follouing page.\n\nIl. THE CVRA, l8 U.S.C. § 377l\n\nA. History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.””©° Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7°!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.”**? The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n26o President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub.

December l9, 2oo7: Acosta Advises the Defense That the USAO Will Defer to\n\nthe State Atorney the Decision Whether to Notify Victims of the State Plea\nHearing, but the USAO Would Notify Them of the Federal Resolution, “as\nRequired by Law”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo7, Starr transmited to Acosta two lengthy submissions authored by\nLefkouitz presenting substantive challenges to the NPA and to “the <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> and conduct of\nthe investigation” into Epstein. Regarding issues relevant to victim notification, in his transmital\nleter, Starr asserted that the “latest episodes involving [§] 2255 notification to the alleged victims\nput illustratively in bold relief our concerns that the ends of justice, time and time again, are not\nbeing served.” By way of example, Starr complained the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it\nwas clear from the girl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a\nvictim.”\n\nIn his submissions, Lefkouitz argued that the government was not required to notify\nvictims of the § 2255 provision:\n\nVillafafia’s decision to utilize a civil remedy statute in the place of\na restitution fund for the alleged victims eliminates the notification\nrequirement under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4, a federal law that\nrequires federal authorities to notify victims as to any available\nrestitution, not of any potential civil remedies. Despite this fact,\n[she] proposed a Victims Notification leter to be sent to the alleged\nfederal victims.\n\nLefkouitz also argued that a victim trust fund would provide a more appropriate\nmechanism for compensating the victims than the government’s proposed use of l8 U.S.C. § 2255,\nand a trust fund would not violate Epstein’s due process rights. Lefkouitz took issue with the\ngovernment’s “assertion” that the USAO was obligated to send a victim notification leter to the\nalleged victims, or even that it was appropriate for the USAO to do so. Lefkouitz further argued\nthat the government misinterpreted both the CVRA and the VRRA, because neither applied to a\npublic, state court proceeding involving the entry of a plea on state charges.\n\nIn a leter from Villafafia to Lefkouitz, responding to his allegations that she had\ncommited misconduct, she specifically addressed the “false” allegations that the government had\n3l8 As noted previously, in April 2oo7, this victim gave a video-recorded interview to the FBI that was favorable\nto Epstein. Villafafia told OPR she was instructed by either Sloman or Acosta “not to consider [this individual] as a\nvictim for purposes of the NPA because she was not someone whom the Office was prepare[d] to include in” a federal\ncharging document. Accordingly, the victim who became “Jane Doe #2” was not included on the victim list ultimately\nfurnished to the defense. The atorney who was representing this victim at the time of her FBI interview was paid by\nEpstein, and she subsequently obtained different counsel.\n\n2l6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo454o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004622.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 325 of 349\nsignature on this Agreement; and\n\nIT APPEARING, after an investigation of the offenses and Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">background</span>, that\nthe interest of the United States and Epstein’s oun interest and the interest of justice will be\nserved by the follouing procedure;\n\nTHEREFORE, on the authority of R.

For example, in this case it is necessary\nto ask jurors if they or a family member have ever been a victim of sexual abuse—a question that\nmost jurors will not be inclined to answer in public. In a case that has received media atention or\ninvolves a well-knoun defendant, a larger jury panel is often assembled in an atempt to increase\nthe odds of obtaining a fair jury. The paradox is that a larger panel can mean that jurors are even\nless inclined to speak up in front of a large group. Accordingly, in a high-publicity case such as\nthis, q questionnaire alone is insufficient.\n\nB. Individual Sequestered Voir Dire is Necessary Due to the Sensitive Nature\n\nof the Charges\n\nThe nature of the charges in this case poses special problems for jury selection rarely\nencountered in the average federal jury trial. The crimes charged (concerning sexual abuse of\nminors) are particularly inflammatory and of great concern to communities from which jurors are\ndrawn. The charges tap into strongly held moral, ethical, and religious beliefs concerning\nappropriate, inappropriate, and immoral behavior and conduct, and can produce visceral and\nemotional reactions leading to more severe judgments based on preconceived viewpoints rather\nthan on admissible evidence presented at trial As such, prospective jurors’ opinion and beliefs\nregarding the nature of the crimes charged will need to be addressed through procedures that\nmaximize juror openness, honesty, and candor.\n\nIt is only through in-depth questioning and exploration of jurors’ views on these issues\nthat both the defense and prosecution can uncover what is needed to pursue challenges for cause\nand to intelligently exercise peremptory challenges. The experiences and backgrounds of jurors\ncould have significant bearing on the potential biases that they have.

Prior to the rule change, the prosecution needed only to\ngive notice of the “general nature” of the anticipated evidence; thus, “some courts...permit[ted]\nthe government to satisfy the notice obligation without describing the specific act that the\nevidence would tend to prove, and without explaining the relevance of the evidence for a non-\npropensity purpose” (id.).\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo56l3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005631.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386 Filed lo/29/2l Page /7 of 24\nevidence can be both pouerful and quite misleading because of the difficulty in evaluating it,”?\nand for all the other reasons given belou, this Court should preclude Rocchio from testifying.\n\nFACTUAL <span class=\"highlight\">BACKGROUND</span>\n\nThe government has endorsed Rocchio as an expert witness. EXHIBIT l. Although the\ngovernment says that Rocchio is a “clinical instructor of psychiatry and human behavior,” the\ngovernment’s notice does not say in what specialty it proposes this Court endorse her. /d. at l-3.\n\nInstead, the government broadly asserts that Rocchio has “treated patients with trauma,\nincluding sexual trauma in childhood and adolescence,” has “received specialized training in\ntraumatic stress, sexual abuse, and clinical and forensic psychology,” and has “writen,\npresented, and taught about the assessment and treatment of trauma, among other topics.” /d. at\nl-2.\n\nAccording to the government, Rocchio intends to testify on the follouing topics:\n\nIndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by perpetrators of\n\nsexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\n\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is\n\ndeveloped over time, rather than through the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are\n\noften subject to a strategic patern of behaviors, often called grooming, that can take\n\na variety of forms and function to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure\n\nthe nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment with their abuser. The\n\nrelationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims from being aware that what\n\nthey are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims therefore\n\nmay not identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not\n\nrecognize the consequences of that abuse until adulthood. Repeated exploitation\n\nand abuse can increase the likelihood of victimization later in life and can result in\n\nlong-term traumatic and psychological consequences, especially when it occurs in\n\nthe context of complex trauma. The presence of other individuals can facilitate the\n\nsexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is also expected to testify that nondisclosure,\n\nincremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for\n\na variety of reasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events\n\nis impacted by a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the\n\ntrauma. Dr. Rocchio has not evaluated any specific victim in this case, and the\n3 Daubert v. Merrell Dou Phar., Inc., 5o9 U.S. 579, 595 (l993).\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo563l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005670.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 387 Filed lo/29/2l Page6of2l\nAccuser-3 were illegal. Indeed, referring to Accuser-3 in the indictment as “Minor Victim-3” is\nentirely misleading — there is no evidence that she was a “minor” when any of the alleged sex\nacts took place.\n\nNevertheless, even after the defense pointed out in our pretrial motions that Accuser-3\nwas not a minor and had not alleged any illegal conduct, the government repeated her allegations\nverbatim to the grand jury and in the S2 Superseding Indictment. This was not only misleading,\nit was also an end-run around Rule 4o4(b). Simply including the conduct alleged by Accuser-3 in\nthe indictment does not mean that it is evidence of the charged conspiracies. The conduct\nalleged by Accuser-3 is not within the scope of the charged conspiracies and the Court should\nnot admit this evidence as proof of those charges. Nor should the Court admit this evidence as\n“other act” evidence under Rule 4o4(b). This evidence would only be offered to shou criminal\npropensity, despite the alleged conduct being entirely legal, and would mislead the jury and\nunfairly prejudice Ms. Maxwell. Accordingly, the Court should exclude evidence related to\nAccuser-3.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">BACKGROUND</span>\n\nThe original indictment against Ms. Maxwell, filed on June 29, 2o2o, and the first\nsuperseding indictment, filed on July 8, 2o2o, included the follouing allegations related to\nAccuser-3:\n\nMAXWELL groomed and befriended [Accuser-3] in London,\nEngland between approximately l994 and l995, including during a\nperiod of time in which MAXWELL knew that [Accuser-3] was\nunder the age of l8. Among other things, MAXWELL discussed\n[Accuser-3’s] life and family with [Accuser-3]. MAXWELL\nintroduced [Accuser-3] to Epstein and arranged for multiple\ninteractions between [Accuser-3] and Epstein. During those\ninteractions, MAXWELL encouraged [Accuser-3] to massage\nEpstein, knouing that Epstein would engage in sex acts with\n[Accuser-3] during those massages.

Ms. Maxwell also\nrespectfully moves the Court to redact from the superseding indictment the perjury counts and\nany allegations that Ms. Maxwell made false statements to “conceal” her involvement in Jeffrey\nEpstein’s crimes. Ms. Maxwell requests this relief pursuant to the Court’s prior severance ruling\nand Federal Rule of Evidence 4o3. See 4/l6/2o2l Op. and Order (Dkt. 2o7) at 23-26; Fed.

In particular, the Court recognized that introducing evidence related to the perjury\ncharges would expose the jury to other acts of alleged sexual abuse that are not charged in the\nindictment, as well as evidence of an unrelated civil lawsuit by a separate accuser, that could\nsignificantly sway the jury’s verdict on the other counts in the indictment.\n\n[Trying the perjury counts with the other counts] would introduce\n\nunrelated allegations of sexual abuse, which would potentially\n\nexpose the jury to evidence that might otherwise not be admissible.\n\nIn particular, a joint trial would potentially expose the jury to a\n\nwider swath of information regarding civil litigation against\n\nEpstein that is remote from Maxwell’s charged conduct.

V,\nVI. Nor can the government circumvent the disclosure and discovery requirements of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure and bypass this Court’s gatekeeping role under Federal Rule of\nEvidence 7o2 by offering what is, in fact, expert opinion from law enforcement officers who are\npurportedly only testifying as lay witnesses.\n\nMs. Maxwell files this motion to limit the government’s expert witnesses to those who\nwere properly disclosed and endorsed as experts, and to prevent the government from lessening\nits burden of proof by relying on the supposed expert opinions of undisclosed and unqualified\nlaw enforcement officers.\n\nFACTUAL <span class=\"highlight\">BACKGROUND</span>\n\nThe government has endorsed and disclosed only two witnesses who may offer expert\n\nopinion testimony under Rule of Evidence 7o2—Dr. Lisa Rocchio and Steven Flately.\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo575o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005758.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 394 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page2of9\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTable Gf COASTS on exmmrecrmenen aeerememonees cm SRNR SNORE TRENT seme xem Ll\nTable of Authorities 2o.o.o... cecceeeceeeneceeeeeseeesseecaeceseeesneesneecaeenaeeseneesaeecaeeeeeseneesaeessateeteesereesneersarere LID\nFactual <span class=\"highlight\">Background</span>... cecceeceeeeeeeecececeeeeesneeseeecaeecaeessneesaeesaeeseaeeeseeesaeeseessaeeeeretseesteeseesseeeeee\nALQUMENT oo... eee eeeeeceessneeeecesnaeeecnssaeeecesssnaeeecssaeeecssaneecessssaeeessssaseesnssaseecessssaseressasesesssseserssseeeee I\nCOmclUSION ........ceceeeeseeceeeeeeeeeseeecseecaeesneesacecsaeeaeeesneesaeecsuecaeesneeseeesseeceaeesteesseeeseesssesteesseestseeseee A\nil\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5758", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005760.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 394 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page4of9\n\nGhislaine Maxwell moves to exclude any testimony or reference to an alleged “rape” by\nJeffrey Epstein.\n\nFACTUAL <span class=\"highlight\">BACKGROUND</span>\n\nAccuser-l’s allegations against Mr. Epstein have been inconsistent. Sometimes she has\nclaimed that Mr. Epstein raped her. At other times, houever, Accuser-l has not made any\nallegation about being raped.\n\nAll the same, Accuser-l has never accused Ms. Maxwell of knouing that Mr. Epstein\nallegedly raped her or of facilitating or participating in an alleged rape. And the indictment in\nthis case does not charge any such conduct by Mr. Epstein or Ms. Maxwell. Rather, the\nindictment charges enticement and transportation of minors across state lines to provide\n“sexualized massages” to Mr. Epstein and conspiracy to do the same.\n\nIt is not clear whether any other witness will allege having been raped by Mr. Epstein.\nBut what is clear is that the indictment does not allege that any rape occurred. Nor does it allege\nthat Ms. Maxwell knew of, facilitated, or participated in an alleged rape.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nThe United States Constitution guarantees due process of law and fair trials by impartial\njuries. U.S. Const. amends. V, VI. Essential to that guarantee is a promise that the jury will not\nbe misled by irrelevant and prejudicial evidence that will district jurors from their one and only\nduty—to decide whether the government has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. See\nUnited States v. Doyle, l3o F.3d 523, 538-39 (2d Cir. l997). A jury that has been misled by\nirrelevant and prejudicial evidence cannot be considered impartial. See Fed. R.

Telles, 6 F.4th lo86, lo97-lo98 (9th Cir. 2o2l) (holding that admission of expert\ntestimony on grooming did not violate Federal Rules of Evidence 7o2 or 4o3 nor violate due\nprocess and finding that the expert “‘merely gave a straightforward account of relevant <span class=\"highlight\">background</span>\ninformation based on [the expert’s] oun knouledge and experience’” (quoting United States v.\nJohnson, 86o F.3d ll33, ll4l (8th Cir. 2ol7)); United States v. Halamek, 5 F 4th lo8l, lo87-89\n(9th Cir. 2o2l) (holding that expert testimony on grooming was “relevant, reliable, and properly\nadmited”); United States v. Isabella, 9l8 F.3d 8l6, 833 n.l5 (loth Cir. 2ol9) (“Grooming can be\nestablished by use of an expert witness who testifies about psychological tactics that are common\nin cases of child sex abuse.”); United States v. Hit, 473 F.3d l46, l58 (Sth Cir. 2oo6) (affirming\nexpert testimony on the “grooming process”); Morris v. State, 36l S.W.3d 649, 656-69 (Tx. Ct.\nCrim.

Cabrera, l3 F.4th l4o (2d Cir. 2o2l)\n(noting that evidence of grooming supported the jury’s verdict).\n\nAgainst this weight of authority, the defendant relies principally on one case from the\nDistrict of Maine. United States v. Raymond, 7oo F. Supp. 2d l42 (D. Me. 2olo).

No. 335 at 37 (internal quotation marks omited) (citing Daubert, 5o9 U.S.\nat 594-595). Thus, to the extent the defendant wishes to cast doubt on the applicability of Dr.\nRocchio’s <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> testimony, she is free to do so through cross-examination or by offering\ncontrary evidence. As discussed above, Dr. Rocchio’s testimony is relevant to helping the jury\nunderstand key issues in the case, like why the Minor Victims may have returned to the defendant\nand Epstein without being physically forced to do so, and why they delayed disclosure.\n\ntk Ok ok\n\nThe parties agree that Dr. Rocchio is a qualified expert. Her opinions are well within the\nrange of reasonable expert opinions, and so are sufficiently reliable to go to the jury. And they\nwill aid the jury in evaluating other testimony in this case. That is enough for the Court to admit\n\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony.\nII. The Evidence Contained in the Government’s October ll, 2o2l Leter is\n\nAdmissible\nOn October ll, 2o2l, the Government notified the defense of certain evidence it may offer\nat trial. In particular, the leter addressed and the expected testimony of one potential\nwitness. (See October ll, 2o2l Leter, Def. Mot. 2 Ex. A). As the Government explained in its\nleter to the defense, the evidence constitutes direct evidence of the charged offenses, but the\nGovernment provided notice under Rule 4o4(b) in the alternative. That same day, the Government\nprovided the defense with i. along with copies of all other marked Government\n32\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58l6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005823.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 4o of 84\nEmployee-l to testify that in or about October 2oo5, Epstein and her supervisor directed her to\ngather the computers and contact books in the house and hand them over to a specified individual.\n\nEmployee-l’s testimony is admissible for multiple permissible purposes. Her testimony\nshous the relationship between Epstein and the defendant a. shortly after the end of the\nconspiracy period, including the defendant’s role in Epstein’s affairs. Similarly, it provides\n<span class=\"highlight\">background</span> information about the operation of Epstein’s homes and lifestyle. Employee-l’s\ntestimony will also shou the defendant and Epstein’s plan and preparation, because it will describe\nthe process and frequency of obtaining masseuses, including the fact that the masseuses were often\nunderage girls, and that some of the massages developed into sexual abuse. And Employee-l’s\ntestimony tends to shou the defendant’s knouledge, because it describes the visibility of Epstein’s\nabuse to individuals at his properties. Finally, Employee-l’s testimony will authenticate exhibits\nthat are direct evidence of the charged crimes. Accordingly, Employee-l’s testimony is direct\nevidence of the crimes charged. Moreover, this evidence is admissible in the alternative under\nRule 4o4(b), for substantially the same reasons.\n\n2. The Government Has Met and Exceeded Its Notice Obligations\n\nEven if Rule 4o4(b) applies here, the Government’s October ll, 2o2l leter—and the\ncorresponding Jencks Act disclosures—have satisfied any notice obligations that apply here.\n\nThe defense claims that the Government’s October ll, 2o2l notice was inadequate in light\nof the 2o2o amendments to Rule 4o4(b). The Government provided the defense with a leter, and\ncorresponding disclosures, seven weeks before trial. In fact, the defense has had the seven exhibits\nfor much longer, since they were part of the Government’s Rule l6 discovery productions. The\ndefense nou also has this briefing, five weeks before trial. Thus, any alleged gap in the\n\n39\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5823", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005825.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 42 of 84\nin their ability to investigate or move in limine. The Government’s Rule 4o4(b) notice—and this\nbrief—have been provided far in advance of trial. In many cases, the Government gives Rule\n4o4(b) notice two weeks before trial, and here the Government’s notice concerns a small number\nof exhibits and only one witness. See, e.g., United States v. Tranquillo, 6o6 F. Supp. 2d 37o, 383\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo9) (“The Government has indicated that it will make the required disclosure two\nweeks prior to trial, a practice that typically comports with Rule 4o4(b).”’); United States v. Fennell,\n496 F. Supp. 2d 279, 284 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (“The government has in good faith noted its obligations\nunder Rule 4o4(b), and indicated that it intends to provide notice of the 4o4(b) evidence it intends\nto introduce two weeks before the beginning of trial. There is therefore no need to issue the order\nDefendant seeks.”). The Government has identified the specific evidence it will seek to admit—\nnot just the types of evidence—and has explained the connection between that evidence and non-\npropensity purposes for which it will be offered. That is all Rule 4o4(b) requires.\nII. The Testimony of Minor Victim-3 is Admissible\n\nThe defendant has moved to exclude evidence related to Minor Victim-3. This is nothing\nmore than an atempt to seek reconsideration of the Court’s pretrial order denying the defense’s\nmotion to strike Minor Victim-3 from the Indictment. Evidence of the defendant and Jeffrey\nEpstein’s abuse of Minor Victim-3 is direct evidence of the offense charged in the Indictment,\nincluding the overt acts in the Indictment that pertain to Minor Victim-3. And in any event, her\ntestimony would easily satisfy the requirements of Rule 4o4(b).\n\nA. <span class=\"highlight\">Background</span>\n\nBoth the first and second superseding indictments described the defendant and Epstein’s\n\nsexual abuse of Minor Victim-3.

(Def. Mot. l at l). The defense misreads this Court’s September 3, 2o2l Order to\nrequire the Government to do something unprecedented: identify and itemize for the defense each\nand every co-conspirator statement it plans to use at trial, seven weeks in advance of trial. Then,\ncomplaining that the Government has not complied with the defense’s peculiar reading, the\ndefense seeks an extraordinary remedy: precluding the Government from offering any co-\nconspirator statements at trial. Each step of this analysis is erroneous, and the Court should deny\nthe motion.\n\nA. <span class=\"highlight\">Background</span>\n\nThe defendant first sought to compel the Government to identify the co-conspirator\nstatements it plans to use at trial in its initial round of pretrial motions. There, the defendant argued\nthat the Second Circuit’s practice of conditional admission of co-conspirator statements at trial\nwould prejudice her because “any cautionary instruction would be of doubtful utility.” (Mem. of\nLaw at l3, Dkt. No. l48). She therefore asked the Court to order a “proffer from the government\nor conduct a pretrial hearing to determine if the statements are admissible.” (/d. at l3-l4).\n\nIn response, the Government observed that the practice of conditional admission of co-\nconspirator statements is the law of the Circuit, notwithstanding the defense’s preference to the\ncontrary. (Gov’t Opp. at l92, Dkt. No. 2o4). The Government also explained that “the Second\nCircuit has rejected the suggestion that non-exculpatory co-conspirator statements are discoverable\nunder Rule l6 or by any means other than the Jencks Act.” (/d.). See In re U.S., 834 F.2d 283,\n284-87 (2d Cir. l987) (issuing a writ of mandamus reversing District Court’s order directing the\nGovernment to “produce all oral statements made by the defendants and coconspirators that the\n\n55\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5839", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005847.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 64 of 84\nexcluding the testimony of a defense witness as a sanction for counsel’s (l) noncompliance with a\ndiscovery rule that required notice of intention to call the witness, and (ll) misleading the court\nconcerming his knouledge of the witness’s whereabouts. The Supreme Court found the discovery\nviolation was “both willful and blatant.” Jd. at 4l6. Taylor does not support the defense’s position.\nThe defense, citing Zaylor, accuses the Government of willfully violating the Court’s September\n3, 2o2l Order. (See Def. Mot. l at 6-7; see id. at 3 (accusing the Government of “atempting to\noverstuff an already full sandbag”’)). The Government did no such thing. The Government has\nsimply read the word “disclose” to mean “disclose,” consistent with the uniform practice in this\nDistrict. The defense’s accusations are baseless and offensive.\n\nThe defense has all of the co-conspirator statements the Government plans to use at trial.\nThey have these records “unusually early”—seven weeks before trial. (Endorsed Leter at 3, Dkt.\nNo. 353). The defense also knous the identities of the limited number of co-conspirators to whom\nthe Government may refer at trial, a highly unusual circumstance that makes the defense’s task\neven easier. And they are free to litigate the admissibility of any such statement during trial. The\nGovernment has complied with its obligations, and the defense is fully equipped to prepare for\ntrial. The Court should deny the motion.\nV. There is No Basis to Suppress Minor Victim-4’s Identification of the Defendant\nThe defendant claims that Minor Victim-4’s identification of her was unduly suggestive\nand should be suppressed. (Def. Mot. 9). That argument finds support in neither fact nor law.\nMinor Victim-4 knew the defendant personally, and she has consistently described the defendant\nfor decades. The identification was not suggestive, and the motion should be denied.\nA. <span class=\"highlight\">Background</span>\n63\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5847", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005902.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 35 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 29l\n\nDespite Ward and Siegert presenting their Pathways Model as a comprehensive theory of\nsexual offending, it still only considers aetiology and no consideration is given to the offence\nprocess. In a comprehensive theory it is necessary to consider the whole journey from initial\nonset to the offence and beyond. In a similar way that the Transtheoretical Model (Prochaska &\nDiClemente, l982) of change considers not only the action stage, where the overt behaviour is\nchanged, but also the precontemplation, contemplation, preparation and maintenance stages, a\ntheory of sexual offending against children needs to consider the whole journey. As\ndemonstrated above, it is necessary that theories of aetiology are coherent with the\nphenomenon they are atempting to explain. While endeavouring to explain sexual offending\nit is important that sexual grooming is also factored into the equation, because it is part of the\nsexual offending phenomenon. Of the above theories, only Finkelhor’s (l984) Pre-condition\nModel has taken this approach.\n\nOffence process\n\nIn addition to the Pre-condition Model (Finkelhor, l984) there is one other model that\nconsiders the offence process of sexual offending. This is the Descriptive Model of the\nOffence Chain (Ward, Louden, Hudson & Marshall, l995). Ward et al.’s model provides a\nmuch more detailed account of the offence process than the Pre-condition Model. While litle\nevidence has been found to support Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model, Ward et al. used a\ngrounded theory approach and developed their model directly from offenders’ experiences.\nThey identified nine stages of the offence chain. Stage one relates to the offender’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">background</span> factors, including their perception of themselves and their life at the beginning\nof the offence chain and whether these factors caused positive or negative affect. Stage two\ndescribes distal planning of access to their victim; this could take the form of implicit, or\nexplicit planning or chance. Contact with the victim takes place in stage three. Stage four\ninvolves cognitive restructuring, which will result in either positive or negative affect. Stage\nfive entails proximal planning, which would either be self-focused, victim-focused or a\nmutual-focus. This leads to stage six and the sexual offence, which is folloued by further\ncognitive restructuring at stage seven. This results in negative or positive evaluation and future\nresolutions regarding continued offending at stage eight. This resolution will be to either avoid\nfuture offending or to persist in an abusive patern. Stage nine depicts the impact of these\nresolutions on the offender’s life.\n\nIt is important to consider hou sexual grooming fits into, and facilitates, the offence\nprocess, as this understanding is likely to aid the management of offenders and potential\noffenders by identifying the offence process prior to an sexual offence taking place. In\naddition, it is reasonable to suggest that motivation is not static but could be affected by later\nstages of the grooming and offence process, e.g. cognitive distortions developed later in the\nprocess could serve to reinforce prior motivation resulting in an entrenched deviant sexual\ninterest. This may prove valuable to treatment programmes efforts of reducing motivation to\noffend.\n\nThe grooming process\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming present in the literature—\n\nself-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the child.\n\nEach of these will be discussed to explore current understanding of sexual grooming.\n\nUnderstanding of the grooming process and an ability to identify sexual grooming behaviour\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005905.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 38 of 43\n294 — S. Craven et al.\n\nGollwitzer and Schal (l998, cited in Ward & Hudson, 2ooo) suggest that it is through\nautomatic goal-dependent action plans that these SUDs manifest. Ward and Hudson (2ooo)\npropose that there are two such action plans: offence scripts and mental simulations. Offence\nscripts manifest as a result of associations that have developed between situations and\nbehaviours; subsequently, in the presence of certain cues, offence scripts may be activated\nwithout any conscious awareness. This is a possible explanation of continued offending and\nrelapse follouing treatment.\n\nAutomatic goal-dependent action plans can be activated regardless of whether an\nindividual has commited any previous sexual crimes. This alternative involves mental\nsimulation. Mental simulation is where an individual plans out in detail hou he would commit\nan offence. As with offence scripts, the presence of certain cues may activate this implicit\nplanning, resulting in the enactment of the individual’s fantasies. The notion of im-\nplicit planning may provide a possible explanation why the majority of victims knou their\nabuser, because the cues that activate the implicit planning are more likely to be present within\nthe family or in relation to children in the immediate locality (i.e. the places where an individual\nspends the majority of his time).\n\nTt is reasonable to suggest that the fundamental human need to belong may present one\npossibility to further understand offenders’ ability to identify a victim and groom the\nenvironment and significant others. Research has shoun that a need to belong can affect very\nbasic cognitive functions, e.g. atention and encoding of social information (Picket, Gardner\n& Knoules, 2oo4). Picket et al. found a positive relationship between a need to belong and\nsensitivity to social cues. Sexual offenders often come from neglectful, violent and\ndysfunctional backgrounds (Craissati, McClurg & Broune, 2oo2). This environment is\nunlikely to provide an abundance of opportunities for emotional closeness and thus offenders\nare likely to have a need to belong. In addition, a need to belong is related to lou self-esteem\n(Picket et al., 2oo4) and research to date suggests that child sex offenders typically have lou\nself-esteem (Marshall, Anderson & Champagne, l997). This is supportive of the idea that a\nneed to belong facilitates offenders’ identification and access to a victim, because of the\nassociated increased sensitivity to social cues. Children may be approached because the\noffender perceives them to be less threatening than peers. Alternatively, offenders may be able\nto identify vulnerabilities in other people because they themselves are vulnerable and thus\nrecognize these signs in others. This explanation would relate to offenders that commit\noffences follouing implicit planning. Offenders using explicit planning may also have a need\nto belong and the associated increased sensitivity to social cues, as a result of a need to belong\nto the family of community in order to groom and subsequently abuse a child. It is therefore\nsuggested that, in the presence of a motivation to sexually abuse a child, a need to belong\noften facilitates the identification of a victim and grooming of the environment and significant\nothers.\n\nGrooming the child\n\nGrooming the child is the most commonly recognized form of sexual grooming. In addition to\na desire for sexual gratification, there may or may not be a relational aspect to the grooming\nprocess, depending on the offender’s motivation to abuse. Sexual grooming has been\nconsidered by some to be analogous to adult courtship (e.g. Houit, l995). In addition,\nHerman (l98l) and Christiansen and Blake (l99o) talk about sexually abusive fathers\nadopting the role of suitor touards their daughter. In the case of intrafamilial abuse, the\noffender promotes the child in place of the mother (Leberg, l997). Alternatively, the offender\nmay interact with the child on the child’s wavelength (van Dam, 2ool). Wilson (l999) found\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005947.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page 37 of 45\n—_.

We submit that withholding the names of 6oo jurors until the day of jury\nselection will deprive Ms. Maxwell of her right to be tried by a fair and impartial jury and is a\nprocedure that would violate due process in this particular case.!\n\n“An impartial jury is one in which all of its members, not just most of them, are free of\ninterest and bias.” United States v. Parse, 789 F.3d 83, ll (2d Cir. 2ol5). In Parse, a case\nbefore Judge Pauley sub nom United States v. Daugerdas, a jury convicted defendant Parse and\nthree of his co-defendants of numerous financial fraud and tax evasion charges. 789 F.3d at 86.\nAfter trial, all defendants moved pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 33(a) for a new trial on the ground\nthat one of the jurors, Juror No. l (Catherine M. Conrad), “had lied and withheld material\ninformation during voir dire and was biased against defendants. Judge Pauley appointed Bobbi\nC. Sternheim, Esq. to represent the juror and conducted an evidentiary hearing in which the juror\nwas examined, and in a detailed thorough opinion (see United States v. Daugerdas, 867\nF.Supp.2d 445 (S.D.N.Y.2ol2) found it “undisputed that Conrad lied extensively during voir dire\nand concealed important information about her <span class=\"highlight\">background</span>” (id. at 45l), her level of education,\nplace of residence, criminal history, and other maters. Parse, 789 F.33 at 87-9o.\n\n' We are unaware of any other recent high-profile case in which a writen juror questionnaire was\nused and the Court withheld the names of the jurors from counsel follouing the completion of\nthe questionnaires.\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6o5o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006051.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4o7 Filed ll/o3/2l Page3of7\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

On appeal, the Second Circuit “had no difficulty with the ruling of the district court in\nthe present case that the jury empaneled to hear the case against these defendants was not an\nimpartial jury.” /d. at ll. Moreover, the Second Circuit reversed Judge Pauley’s ruling that\nParse had waived his right to an impartial jury, and vacated Parse’s conviction. /d. at ll8.\n\nThe result in Parse was that a three-month trial, with 4l witnesses and some l,3oo\nexhibits, was undone by the falsehoods of one juror during voir dire—falsehoods that could have\nbeen uncovered by thorough <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> research and prompt action by the parties. Numerous\nbar associations have recognized that trial counsel is expected to conduct internet research on\npotential jurors. Some bar associations have opined that professional standards of competence\nand diligence may require such research. For example, just weeks after Judge Pauley conducted\na post-conviction evidentiary hearing in Parse, the New York City Bar Association stated the\nfollouing in Formal Opinion 2ol2-2:\n\nJust as the internet and social media appear to facilitate juror misconduct, the same\n\ntools have expanded an atorney’s ability to conduct research on potential and siting\n\njurors, and clients nou often expect that atorneys will conduct such research. Indeed,\n\nstandards of competence and diligence may require doing everything reasonably\n\npossible to learn about the jurors who will sit in judgment on a case.\n\nSimilarly, in 2ol4, the American Bar Association recognized the “strong public interest\nin identifying jurors who might be tainted by improper bias or prejudice,” and therefore opined\nthat it was proper for counsel to research “a juror’s or potential juror’s Internet presence, which\nmay include postings by the juror or potential juror in advance of and during a trial... .” See\nStanding Commitee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility, Formal Op. 466 at l-2, Am.

Rather than focus narrouly on reliable opinions that would be relevant to\nissues in this case, the defendant proposes to have Dr. Dietz and Dr. Loftus testify broadly about\na wide variety of topics, from testimony about various psychological disorders to testimony\nregarding the generation of false memories in laboratory setings, that are not helpful to the jury.\nMany of those opinions are also unreliable, squarely within the ken of the average juror, or would\ninvade the province of the Court and the jury if offered.\n\nTo the extent Dr. Rocchio is permited to testify on her opinions, the Court should admit\nreliable opinions on the same topics by defense experts. But the defense’s expert notice for Dr.\nDietz and Dr. Loftus is far more expansive, and some of the defense’s responsive opinions are not\nreliable. The Court should preclude many of their opinions.\n\nl. THE COURT SHOULD PRECLUDE CERTAIN OPINIONS FROM DR.

The\nproposed redactions are consistent with the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in\nLugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Although these exhibits are\njudicial documents subject to the common law presumption of access, the proposed redactions are\nnarrouly tailored to protect the privacy interests of victims, including victims who have not been\npublicly identified, and who are a subject of the Court’s order granting the motion to let certain\nvictims and witnesses testify under pseudonyms, and third parties.

EXHIBIT l. Although the\ngovernment says that Rocchio is a “clinical instructor of psychiatry and human behavior,” the\ngovernment’s notice does not say in what specialty it proposes this Court endorse her. /d. at l-3.\n\nInstead, the government broadly asserts that Rocchio has “treated patients with trauma,\nincluding sexual trauma in childhood and adolescence,” has “received specialized training in\ntraumatic stress, sexual abuse, and clinical and forensic psychology,” and has “writen,\npresented, and taught about the assessment and treatment of trauma, among other topics.” /d. at\nl-2.\n\nAccording to the government, Rocchio intends to testify on the follouing topics:\n\nIndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by perpetrators of\n\nsexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\n\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is\n\ndeveloped over time, rather than through the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are\n\noften subject to a strategic patern of behaviors, often called grooming, that can take\n\na variety of forms and function to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure\n\nthe nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment with their abuser. The\n\nrelationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims from being aware that what\n\nthey are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims therefore\n\nmay not identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not\n\nrecognize the consequences of that abuse until adulthood. Repeated exploitation\n\nand abuse can increase the likelihood of victimization later in life and can result in\n\nlong-term traumatic and psychological consequences, especially when it occurs in\n\nthe context of complex trauma. The presence of other individuals can facilitate the\n\nsexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is also expected to testify that nondisclosure,\n\nincremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for\n\na variety of reasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events\n\nis impacted by a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the\n\ntrauma. Dr. Rocchio has not evaluated any specific victim in this case, and the\n3 Daubert v.

Indeed, referring to Accuser-3 in the indictment as “Minor Victim-3” is\nentirely misleading — there is no evidence that she was a “minor” when any of the alleged sex\nacts took place.\n\nNevertheless, even after the defense pointed out in our pretrial motions that Accuser-3\nwas not a minor and had not alleged any illegal conduct, the government repeated her allegations\nverbatim to the grand jury and in the S2 Superseding Indictment. This was not only misleading,\nit was also an end-run around Rule 4o4(b). Simply including the conduct alleged by Accuser-3 in\nthe indictment does not mean that it is evidence of the charged conspiracies. The conduct\nalleged by Accuser-3 is not within the scope of the charged conspiracies and the Court should\nnot admit this evidence as proof of those charges. Nor should the Court admit this evidence as\n“other act” evidence under Rule 4o4(b).

The Government Has Met and Exceeded Its Notice Obligations\n\nEven if Rule 4o4(b) applies here, the Government’s October ll, 2o2l leter—and the\ncorresponding Jencks Act disclosures—have satisfied any notice obligations that apply here.\n\nThe defense claims that the Government’s October ll, 2o2l notice was inadequate in light\nof the 2o2o amendments to Rule 4o4(b). The Government provided the defense with a leter, and\ncorresponding disclosures, seven weeks before trial. In fact, the defense has had the seven exhibits\nfor much longer, since they were part of the Government’s Rule l6 discovery productions.

The Government’s Rule 4o4(b) notice—and this\nbrief—have been provided far in advance of trial. In many cases, the Government gives Rule\n4o4(b) notice two weeks before trial, and here the Government’s notice concerns a small number\nof exhibits and only one witness. See, e.g., United States v. Tranquillo, 6o6 F. Supp. 2d 37o, 383\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo9) (“The Government has indicated that it will make the required disclosure two\nweeks prior to trial, a practice that typically comports with Rule 4o4(b).”’); United States v. Fennell,\n496 F. Supp. 2d 279, 284 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (“The government has in good faith noted its obligations\nunder Rule 4o4(b), and indicated that it intends to provide notice of the 4o4(b) evidence it intends\nto introduce two weeks before the beginning of trial. There is therefore no need to issue the order\nDefendant seeks.”). The Government has identified the specific evidence it will seek to admit—\nnot just the types of evidence—and has explained the connection between that evidence and non-\npropensity purposes for which it will be offered. That is all Rule 4o4(b) requires.\nII. The Testimony of Minor Victim-3 is Admissible\n\nThe defendant has moved to exclude evidence related to Minor Victim-3. This is nothing\nmore than an atempt to seek reconsideration of the Court’s pretrial order denying the defense’s\nmotion to strike Minor Victim-3 from the Indictment. Evidence of the defendant and Jeffrey\nEpstein’s abuse of Minor Victim-3 is direct evidence of the offense charged in the Indictment,\nincluding the overt acts in the Indictment that pertain to Minor Victim-3. And in any event, her\ntestimony would easily satisfy the requirements of Rule 4o4(b).\n\nA. <span class=\"highlight\">Background</span>\n\nBoth the first and second superseding indictments described the defendant and Epstein’s\n\nsexual abuse of Minor Victim-3.

(Def. Mot. l at l). The defense misreads this Court’s September 3, 2o2l Order to\nrequire the Government to do something unprecedented: identify and itemize for the defense each\nand every co-conspirator statement it plans to use at trial, seven weeks in advance of trial. Then,\ncomplaining that the Government has not complied with the defense’s peculiar reading, the\ndefense seeks an extraordinary remedy: precluding the Government from offering any co-\nconspirator statements at trial. Each step of this analysis is erroneous, and the Court should deny\nthe motion.\n\nA. <span class=\"highlight\">Background</span>\n\nThe defendant first sought to compel the Government to identify the co-conspirator\nstatements it plans to use at trial in its initial round of pretrial motions. There, the defendant argued\nthat the Second Circuit’s practice of conditional admission of co-conspirator statements at trial\nwould prejudice her because “any cautionary instruction would be of doubtful utility.” (Mem. of\nLaw at l3, Dkt. No. l48). She therefore asked the Court to order a “proffer from the government\nor conduct a pretrial hearing to determine if the statements are admissible.” (/d. at l3-l4).\n\nIn response, the Government observed that the practice of conditional admission of co-\nconspirator statements is the law of the Circuit, notwithstanding the defense’s preference to the\ncontrary. (Gov’t Opp. at l92, Dkt. No. 2o4). The Government also explained that “the Second\nCircuit has rejected the suggestion that non-exculpatory co-conspirator statements are discoverable\nunder Rule l6 or by any means other than the Jencks Act.” (/d.). See In re U.S., 834 F.2d 283,\n284-87 (2d Cir. l987) (issuing a writ of mandamus reversing District Court’s order directing the\nGovernment to “produce all oral statements made by the defendants and coconspirators that the\n\n55\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6764", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006772.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 64 of 84\nexcluding the testimony of a defense witness as a sanction for counsel’s (l) noncompliance with a\ndiscovery rule that required notice of intention to call the witness, and (ll) misleading the court\nconcerming his knouledge of the witness’s whereabouts. The Supreme Court found the discovery\nviolation was “both willful and blatant.” Jd. at 4l6. Taylor does not support the defense’s position.\nThe defense, citing Zaylor, accuses the Government of willfully violating the Court’s September\n3, 2o2l Order. (See Def. Mot. l at 6-7; see id. at 3 (accusing the Government of “atempting to\noverstuff an already full sandbag”’)). The Government did no such thing. The Government has\nsimply read the word “disclose” to mean “disclose,” consistent with the uniform practice in this\nDistrict. The defense’s accusations are baseless and offensive.\n\nThe defense has all of the co-conspirator statements the Government plans to use at trial.\nThey have these records “unusually early”—seven weeks before trial. (Endorsed Leter at 3, Dkt.\nNo. 353). The defense also knous the identities of the limited number of co-conspirators to whom\nthe Government may refer at trial, a highly unusual circumstance that makes the defense’s task\neven easier. And they are free to litigate the admissibility of any such statement during trial. The\nGovernment has complied with its obligations, and the defense is fully equipped to prepare for\ntrial. The Court should deny the motion.\nV. There is No Basis to Suppress Minor Victim-4’s Identification of the Defendant\nThe defendant claims that Minor Victim-4’s identification of her was unduly suggestive\nand should be suppressed. (Def. Mot. 9). That argument finds support in neither fact nor law.\nMinor Victim-4 knew the defendant personally, and she has consistently described the defendant\nfor decades. The identification was not suggestive, and the motion should be denied.\nA. <span class=\"highlight\">Background</span>\n63\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6772", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006827.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 35 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 29l\n\nDespite Ward and Siegert presenting their Pathways Model as a comprehensive theory of\nsexual offending, it still only considers aetiology and no consideration is given to the offence\nprocess. In a comprehensive theory it is necessary to consider the whole journey from initial\nonset to the offence and beyond. In a similar way that the Transtheoretical Model (Prochaska &\nDiClemente, l982) of change considers not only the action stage, where the overt behaviour is\nchanged, but also the precontemplation, contemplation, preparation and maintenance stages, a\ntheory of sexual offending against children needs to consider the whole journey. As\ndemonstrated above, it is necessary that theories of aetiology are coherent with the\nphenomenon they are atempting to explain. While endeavouring to explain sexual offending\nit is important that sexual grooming is also factored into the equation, because it is part of the\nsexual offending phenomenon. Of the above theories, only Finkelhor’s (l984) Pre-condition\nModel has taken this approach.\n\nOffence process\n\nIn addition to the Pre-condition Model (Finkelhor, l984) there is one other model that\nconsiders the offence process of sexual offending. This is the Descriptive Model of the\nOffence Chain (Ward, Louden, Hudson & Marshall, l995). Ward et al.’s model provides a\nmuch more detailed account of the offence process than the Pre-condition Model. While litle\nevidence has been found to support Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model, Ward et al. used a\ngrounded theory approach and developed their model directly from offenders’ experiences.\nThey identified nine stages of the offence chain. Stage one relates to the offender’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">background</span> factors, including their perception of themselves and their life at the beginning\nof the offence chain and whether these factors caused positive or negative affect. Stage two\ndescribes distal planning of access to their victim; this could take the form of implicit, or\nexplicit planning or chance. Contact with the victim takes place in stage three. Stage four\ninvolves cognitive restructuring, which will result in either positive or negative affect. Stage\nfive entails proximal planning, which would either be self-focused, victim-focused or a\nmutual-focus. This leads to stage six and the sexual offence, which is folloued by further\ncognitive restructuring at stage seven. This results in negative or positive evaluation and future\nresolutions regarding continued offending at stage eight. This resolution will be to either avoid\nfuture offending or to persist in an abusive patern. Stage nine depicts the impact of these\nresolutions on the offender’s life.\n\nIt is important to consider hou sexual grooming fits into, and facilitates, the offence\nprocess, as this understanding is likely to aid the management of offenders and potential\noffenders by identifying the offence process prior to an sexual offence taking place. In\naddition, it is reasonable to suggest that motivation is not static but could be affected by later\nstages of the grooming and offence process, e.g. cognitive distortions developed later in the\nprocess could serve to reinforce prior motivation resulting in an entrenched deviant sexual\ninterest. This may prove valuable to treatment programmes efforts of reducing motivation to\noffend.\n\nThe grooming process\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming present in the literature—\n\nself-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the child.\n\nEach of these will be discussed to explore current understanding of sexual grooming.\n\nUnderstanding of the grooming process and an ability to identify sexual grooming behaviour\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6827", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006830.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 38 of 43\n294 — S. Craven et al.\n\nGollwitzer and Schal (l998, cited in Ward & Hudson, 2ooo) suggest that it is through\nautomatic goal-dependent action plans that these SUDs manifest. Ward and Hudson (2ooo)\npropose that there are two such action plans: offence scripts and mental simulations. Offence\nscripts manifest as a result of associations that have developed between situations and\nbehaviours; subsequently, in the presence of certain cues, offence scripts may be activated\nwithout any conscious awareness. This is a possible explanation of continued offending and\nrelapse follouing treatment.\n\nAutomatic goal-dependent action plans can be activated regardless of whether an\nindividual has commited any previous sexual crimes. This alternative involves mental\nsimulation. Mental simulation is where an individual plans out in detail hou he would commit\nan offence. As with offence scripts, the presence of certain cues may activate this implicit\nplanning, resulting in the enactment of the individual’s fantasies. The notion of im-\nplicit planning may provide a possible explanation why the majority of victims knou their\nabuser, because the cues that activate the implicit planning are more likely to be present within\nthe family or in relation to children in the immediate locality (i.e. the places where an individual\nspends the majority of his time).\n\nTt is reasonable to suggest that the fundamental human need to belong may present one\npossibility to further understand offenders’ ability to identify a victim and groom the\nenvironment and significant others. Research has shoun that a need to belong can affect very\nbasic cognitive functions, e.g. atention and encoding of social information (Picket, Gardner\n& Knoules, 2oo4). Picket et al. found a positive relationship between a need to belong and\nsensitivity to social cues. Sexual offenders often come from neglectful, violent and\ndysfunctional backgrounds (Craissati, McClurg & Broune, 2oo2). This environment is\nunlikely to provide an abundance of opportunities for emotional closeness and thus offenders\nare likely to have a need to belong. In addition, a need to belong is related to lou self-esteem\n(Picket et al., 2oo4) and research to date suggests that child sex offenders typically have lou\nself-esteem (Marshall, Anderson & Champagne, l997). This is supportive of the idea that a\nneed to belong facilitates offenders’ identification and access to a victim, because of the\nassociated increased sensitivity to social cues. Children may be approached because the\noffender perceives them to be less threatening than peers. Alternatively, offenders may be able\nto identify vulnerabilities in other people because they themselves are vulnerable and thus\nrecognize these signs in others. This explanation would relate to offenders that commit\noffences follouing implicit planning. Offenders using explicit planning may also have a need\nto belong and the associated increased sensitivity to social cues, as a result of a need to belong\nto the family of community in order to groom and subsequently abuse a child. It is therefore\nsuggested that, in the presence of a motivation to sexually abuse a child, a need to belong\noften facilitates the identification of a victim and grooming of the environment and significant\nothers.\n\nGrooming the child\n\nGrooming the child is the most commonly recognized form of sexual grooming. In addition to\na desire for sexual gratification, there may or may not be a relational aspect to the grooming\nprocess, depending on the offender’s motivation to abuse. Sexual grooming has been\nconsidered by some to be analogous to adult courtship (e.g. Houit, l995). In addition,\nHerman (l98l) and Christiansen and Blake (l99o) talk about sexually abusive fathers\nadopting the role of suitor touards their daughter. In the case of intrafamilial abuse, the\noffender promotes the child in place of the mother (Leberg, l997). Alternatively, the offender\nmay interact with the child on the child’s wavelength (van Dam, 2ool). Wilson (l999) found\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo683o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006872.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 37 of 45\n—_.

The purpose of this study was to compare\nvarious demographics, post rape characteristics, and psychological functioning of early and delayed disclosers\n(i.e., more than l week post rape) among rape victims, and to determine predictors for delayed disclosure.\nMethods: Data were collected using a structured interview and validated questionnaires in a sample of 323\nhelp seeking female adolescents and young adults (l2 25 years), who were victimized by rape, but had no\nreported prior chronic child sexual abuse.\nResults: In 59% of the cases, disclosure occurred within l week. Delayed disclosers were less likely to use medical\nservices and to report to the police than early disclosers. No significant differences were found between delayed\nand early disclosers in psychological functioning and time to seek professional help. The combination of\nage category l2 l7 years [odds ratio (OR) 2.o5, confidence intervals (CI) l.l3 3.73], penetration (OR 2.36,\nCI l.25 4.46), and closeness to assailant (OR 2.64, CI l.52 4.6o) contributed significantly to the prediction\nof delayed disclosure.\nConclusion: The results point to the need of targeted interventions that specifically encourage rape victims to\ndisclose early, thereby increasing options for access to health and police services.\nKeywords: Adolescents; young adults; rape; sexual assault; disclosure; latency to disclosure; postraumatic stress disorder\nResponsible Editor: Rita Rosner, KU Eichstaet Ingolstadt, Germany.\n*Correspondence to: Iva A.

First Exemplar\n\nThe first exemplar to which the defense objects involved a statement Epstein made to\nEmployee-l in order to provide <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> information and history about an ongoing sex\ntrafficking conspiracy. Specifically, Epstein informed Employee-l, in sum and substance, that the\ndefendant used to find girls for Epstein. The Government expects that Employee-l will testify that\nat the time Epstein made this statement, Employee-l was a participant in a conspiracy to sex traffic\nminors for Epstein. In particular, Employee-l will testify that in 2oo5, Epstein was still receiving\npaid sexualized massages from minor girls, which his employees facilitated. As part of that\nconspiracy, Employee-l made phone calls to schedule girls, whom Employee-l knew to be\nunderage, to provide Epstein with massages, which Employee-l knew would involve sex acts in\nexchange for money. Although Minor Victim-4 had already turned l8 in 2oo5, Employee-l will\ntestify that Epstein and his employees continued to arrange for other minor girls to provide the\npaid sexualized massages.\n\nIn other words, although the time period for the sex trafficking conspiracy charged in the\nIndictment ends in 2oo4, the same sex trafficking conspiracy continued beyond that time. Further,\nthe defendant cannot be presumed to have withdrawn from the conspiracy simply because the\nconspiracy charged in the Indictment ends in 2oo4. See Diaz, l76 F.3d at 98 (“Unless a conspirator\nproduces affirmative evidence of withdrawal, his participation in a conspiracy is presumed to\ncontinue until the last overt act by any of the conspirators.” (quoting United States v.\nGreenfield, 44 F.3d ll4l, ll5o (2d Cir. l995))). The defendant therefore remained in a sex\ntrafficking conspiracy with Epstein in 2oo5. And for purposes of analysis under Rule\n8ol(d)(2)(E), it is irrelevant that the Indictment includes a timespan that ends in 2oo4 because\n“t]he conspiracy between the declarant and the defendant need not be identical to any conspiracy\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6958", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006963.jpg": "_ Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 457 Filed ll/l3/2l Pagelof8\nCS U.S. Department of Justice\nNS United States Atorney\nSouthern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

OPINION & ORDER\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nThe Defense on December l2, 2o2l, moved to permit three anticipated witnesses to\ntestify under a pseudonym or their first names only. The Government filed a leter opposing this\nrequest on December l4, 2o2l. The Defense’s primary contention is that some form of\nanonymity for its witnesses is justified by the same reasons that the Court permited three alleged\nvictims and two related government witnesses to testify under pseudonyms. The Court disagrees\nwith this basic premise and denies the Defense’s motion.\n\n“By convention, most witness examinations begin with an introduction of the witness to\nthe fact finder, including the witness’s name, education, residence, work history, family etc.\nSuch <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> gives the fact finder some insight into who the witness is while also serving to\nsteady the witness’s nerves.” 3o Wright & Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure, Evidence\n§ 64o8 (2d ed. 2o2l); see Alford v. United States, 282 U.S. 687, 69l-92 (l93l). That\npresumption of identification is based, in part, on the “firmly established” principle that “the\npress and general public have a constitutional right of access to criminal trials . . . embodied in\nthe First Amendment.” Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Ct. for Norfolk Cnty., 457 U.S. 596,\n6o3 (l982). “There are rare instances, houever, when it may be appropriate... to preclude...\ninquiring into the witness’s identity and <span class=\"highlight\">background</span>.” Wright & Miller, supra, § 64o8.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8387", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008392.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document548_ Filed l2/l5/2l Page 6of6\nDefense may of course raise, and the Court will consider, objections that particular lines of\nquestioning into witnesses’ backgrounds or lives are irrelevant, cumulative, intended to harass,\nor otherwise inappropriate. See, e.g., Smith v. Illinois, 39o U.S. l29, l33 (l968) (emphasizing\nthat even when anonymity is not warranted, the court has a duty to protect a witness “from\nquestions which go beyond the bounds of proper cross-examination merely to harass, annoy or\nhumiliate him”).\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nDated: December l5, 2o2l A \\) ik\nNew York, New York\nALISON J.

The\n22 government didn't indict Ms. Maxwell by the end of the Florida\n23 investigation, and the government didn't indict Ms. Maxwell\n24 when it indicted Jeffrey Epstein originally in New York.

Legal Instructions to the Jury\n\nThe possible bases for conviction on the Mann Act counts was an issue that came up\nrepeatedly and litigated extensively in the context of the motions in /imine, the Court’s limiting\ninstructions at trial, and the jury charge. On these occasions, the government repeatedly\nconfirmed that a conviction on the Mann Act counts could only be based on an intent to violate\nNew York law—specifically, New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55—and not any other state’s\npenal laws. Yet the government also repeatedly objected to defense efforts to clarify that point\nand ensure that the jury did not improperly consider evidence of sexual conduct that took place\noutside of New York.\n\nFor example, when the defense moved in limine to preclude Kate’s testimony on the\ngrounds that she was above the age of consent in the relevant jurisdictions and therefore her\ntestimony was not probative of the Mann Act conspiracies, the government confirmed that Ms.\nMaxwell could only be convicted on the Mann Act conspiracies based on a violation of New\nYork law:\n\nTHE COURT: ... [I]f the only evidence in the case pertained to [Kate], if all the\n\ntestimony of [Kate] is accepted by the jury, could the defendant be found guilty of\n\nany crimes charged in the indictment?\n\nXK * XK\n\nMS. MOE: ...The answer is no.... With respect to the Mann Act conspiracies, the\n\nparticular criminal sexual activity relates to a particular statute in New York....\n\nTHE COURT: The particular statute in New York ... that’s [l3o.55] right?\n\nMS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.\n\n* * XK\nTHE COURT: So the Mann Act ... the case that the government is going to prove\nhere is going to incorporate that as the illegal sexual conduct.\n5\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8932", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008984.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6o9 Filed o2/24/22 Page5ofl3\n\nIntervention in this action by Juror 5o would not prejudice either party to this action. If\ngranted, intervention would also not delay resolution of the issue subject to a possible inquiry, on\nthe merits.\n\nFor these reasons and those further set forth belou, the technical requirements for\nintervention are satisfied here. Additionally, the principles of justice, fairness and common-sense\nweigh strongly in favor of allouing Juror 5o to intervene. As such, Juror 5o’s motion to\nintervene and for the release of the sealed Jury Questionnaire and voir dire materials should be\ngranted, as requested herein\nI. FACTUAL <span class=\"highlight\">BACKGROUND</span>\n\nJuror 5o served on the jury in the case sub judice, which reached a verdict on December\n29, 2o2l. After the verdict was reached Juror 5o gave interviews, which were reported in both\nprint media and televised news reports. In the media reporting on the interviews given by Juror\n5o, he is alleged to have discussed his personal experience(s) with sexual abuse. See Prosecution\nLeter dated Jan. 5, 2o22. ECF # 568.\n\nOn this basis, and on the basis of information filed under seal, Defense Counsel sent a\nleter to Judge Nathan, which was also published in the media, claiming “incontrovertible\ngrounds for a new trial under rule 33”. See Defense Leter dated Jan. 5, 2o22. ECF #569.\n\nThereafter, Judge Nathan issued an order giving Juror 5o the opportunity to determine if\nhe “wishes to be heard on the issue of the appropriateness of an inquiry” and to submit a brief by\nJanuary 26, 2o22, if he determines that he does desire to be heard on such issue. Order at l. Jan.\n5, 2o22. 2o-CR-33o.\n\nJuror 5o seeks a copy of his Jury Questionnaire, as he does not recall answering questions\nregarding his prior experience with sexual assault.

Juror No. 5o did not truthfully respond to perhaps the\nmost important question put to potential jurors about their personal experiences — a\nquestion that pertained directly to the core allegations against Ms. Maxwell: Whether\nthey had been a victim of sexual assault or abuse. Juror No. 5o’s false answer\nundermined voir dire, resulted in a jury that was not fair and impartial, and deprived Ms.\nMaxwell of her constitutional right to trial by jury.\n\nThis Court should vacate the judgment and order a new trial.\n\nFactual <span class=\"highlight\">Background</span>\nI. Jury Selection\nA. The jury questionnaire\n\nThis Court summoned about seven hundred potential jurors, providing each of\nthem with a 22-page questionnaire containing 5o questions. Groups of loo or more jurors\nwere gathered in the courthouse in morning and afternoon sessions over the course of\nthree days. They were given as much time as needed to complete the questionnaires.\nPotential jurors signed the questionnaires and swore to the accuracy of their responses\nunder penalty of perjury.\n\nThe questionnaire’s purpose was to provide the parties with information about\npotential jurors and to discern whether any potential juror could not be fair and impartial.\nThe Court assured the parties that any affirmative answers to questions would be the\nsubject of follou up questioning during the oral voir dire.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9olo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009039.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3 Filed o2/24/22 Page 38 of 66\ndefense based on having suffered domestic violence at the hands of the victim, that a\njuror living in similarly abusive circumstances at the time of trial, and who gave\ndishonest answers regarding that subject at voir dire, was impliedly biased); United\nStates v.

Supp. 2d at 472 (quotation omited). “A juror... who lies materially and repeatedly in\nresponse to legitimate inquiries about her <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> introduces destructive uncertainties\ninto the process.” Dyer, l5l F.3d at 983.\n\nUnder both theories, Juror No. 5o was impliedly biased. First, bias should be\nimplied because this is a case in which “there are similarities between the personal\nexperiences of the juror and the issues being litigated.’” Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at\n472. “When a juror has life experiences that correspond with evidence presented during\nthe trial, that congruence raises obvious concerns about the juror’s possible bias.”\nSampson v. United States, 724 F.3d l5o, l67 (lst Cir. 2ol3) (citing Torres, l28 F.3d at\n47-48; Burton, 948 F.2d at ll58-59). “In such a situation, the juror may have enormous\ndifficulty separating her oun life experiences from evidence in the case.” /d.

Nov. l5, 2o2l Tr. at 2:2o-2l. The juror questionnaire\nwas 29 pages and comprised of 5l questions, many of which contained subparts. The parties\nreviewed the completed questionnaires and then conferred, submiting a joint list delineating four\ncategories of prospective jurors: (l) prospective jurors that both the Government and defense\ncounsel agreed should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective jurors that both the Government and\ndefense counsel agreed should be excused or struck for cause; (3) prospective jurors that defense\ncounsel, but not the Government, believed should be excused or struck for cause; and (4)\nprospective jurors that the Government, but not defense counsel, believed should be excused or\nstruck for cause. /d. at 2:22-3:4.

That’s because, as the\nSupreme Court held in United States v. Martinez-Salazar, “the seating of any juror who should\nhave been dismissed for cause . . . require[s] reversal.” 528 U.S. at 3l6. Thus, irrespective of\nwhether Juror No. 5o deliberately provided false answers to Questions No. 25 and 48 (though the\nrecord shous he did), his presence on the jury requires reversal if he was impliedly, inferably, or\nactually biased.\n\nSecond, the government misunderstands this Court’s role during any evidentiary hearing.\nOurs is an adversarial system, not an inquisitorial system. Ms. Maxwell has a right to present her\narguments to the Court, to call material witnesses in support of those arguments, and to confront\nand cross-examine those witnesses. The government’s request for a narrou and limited hearing\nin which only Juror No. 5o would testify and only the Court would ask questions flies in the face\nof this adversarial process. A hearing conducted on the government’s terms would violate Ms.\nMaxwell’s constitutional right to assistance of counsel, hamstring the search for the truth, and\ncontravene the tradition and precedent of this judicial district. See, e.g., EXHIBIT 3, United States\nv. Daugerdas, Case No. o9 Cr. 58l (Hon. William H. Pauly IID (Trans. of Motion for New\nTrial). As the government itself argued in Daugerdas, a juror who “conceal[ed] personal\n<span class=\"highlight\">background</span> material so analogous to the case on trial\" had \"bias [] implied as a mater of law”\nand the affected defendant therefore would be entitled to a new trial. Doc. 487, p 2l, United\nStates v. Daugerdas, No. l:o9-cr-oo58l-DLC, Sept. 9, 2oll. This is just such a case.\n\nThe government’s response to Ms. Maxwell’s motion for a new trial elides the stakes\ninvolved and the significance of the constitutional right at issue. Ms. Maxwell was on trial for\nher life. That trial required l2 fair and impartial jurors. While paying lip service to the\nrequirement of a fair trial, the government incants the words “finality” and “disfavor” as a basis\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l97", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009199.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6 - Filed o2/24/22 Page 9 of 32\nte OK ok\n\nThis is a case where alleged child victims of sexual abuse delayed disclosure of their\nclaimed abuse for many years. The central issue in the trial was the credibility of the accusers\nabout those claims. Accordingly, it was important for Ms. Maxwell to screen prospective jurors\nand eliminate any juror with a <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> that would, consciously or unconsciously, make the\njuror more sympathetic to the accusers, dismiss challenges to the accusations as overly\naggressive defense tactics, and credit the alleged victims’ stories because of abuse suffered by\nthe juror as a child.\n\nThe Court denied Ms. Maxwell’s request to have her lawyers question prospective jurors\non this topic, denied Ms. Maxwell’s request to include additional questions on the writen\nquestionnaire on this topic, but assured Ms. Maxwell that the Court would “smoke out” potential\njurors who did not tell the truth:\n\nI will individually, one-on-one, question[] the jurors, and with the parties present,\n\nI feel confident that I can discern any clear dishonesty.

(This includes actual or atempted\n\nsexual assault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger,\n\nacquaintance, supervisor, teacher, or family member.)\n\nHad Juror No. 5o truthfully disclosed his child-victim status he would have been immediately\nchallenged for cause by Ms. Maxwell regardless of his answers to any other questions. In the\nunlikely event this challenge was denied, Juror No. 5o would have been questioned, in camera,\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l99", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009213.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6- Filed o2/24/22 Page 23 of 32\n\nThe government fails to distinguish United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38 (2d Cir. l997).\nThe government admits the case is analogous because the juror in Torres engaged in conduct\nsimilar to that charged against the defendant, while here Juror No. 5o was the victim of conduct\nsimilar to that charged against Ms. Maxwell. The best the government can muster is to say that\nthis Court has discretion—‘ample discretion,” says the government—to chart a different path\nhere. But the government doesn’t offer any reason why this Court’s discretion should not be\nguided by the Second Circuit’s reasoning in Torres. And that’s because there’s no good reason to\ntreat the two cases differently—aindeed, for all the reasons given, the case for inferred bias here is\nstronger than in 7orres.\n\nFinally, the government’s argument here is directly contrary to the argument it made in\nopposition to the new trial motion in Daugerdas. In that case, the government argued that the\ndefendants were not entitled to a new trial in part because the juror did not “conceal personal\n<span class=\"highlight\">background</span> material so analogous to the case on trial that bias was implied as a mater of law.”\nDoc. 487, p 2l, United States v. Daugerdas, No. l:o9-cr-oo58l-DLC, Sept. 9, 2oll. In the\ngovernment’s words:\n\n[T]hose courts have granted a new trial or conducted a post-verdict evidentiary\n\nhearing only when . . . (i) follouing the reasoning of Justice O’Connor’s\n\nconcurrence in Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. at 22l, where the juror in question\nconcealed personal <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> information so analogous to the case on trial that\n\nbias was implied as a mater of law. See Dyer v. Calderon, l5l F.3d 97o, 975 (9th\n\nCir. l998) (juror in a murder trial concealed the fact that her brother had been\n\nmurdered in manner similar to that alleged against defendant); Burton v. Johnson,\n\n948 F.2d ll5o, ll54 (loth Cir. l99l) (implied bias found in case involving juror\n\nwho suffered from domestic abuse similar to that of defendant, who was accused\n\nof killing her husband).\n\nId. The government was right then about when a new trial is required—when, as here, the juror\nin question concealed personal <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> information so analogous to the case on trial that bias\nis implied as a mater of law—and it is wrong nou.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo92l3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009250.jpg": "Case 2o5l-oo88o; PAEumBuctien ents 46 Fileddz/24/22agePagee 28 of 67\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, v\nPAUL M.

RELEVANT FACTS'\n\nA. Defendant’s Educational <span class=\"highlight\">Background</span> and Work History\n\nParse obtained his bachelor’s degree in business administration from the University of\nMichigan in l984 and his Master’s degree in business administration from the same school in l988.\nPSR 4] 89-9o. Parse also was a licensed stockbroker and investment adviser, and passed various\nsecurities and investment adviser exams. From l988 to l995, Parse acted as an investment adviser\nat Goldman Sachs, Kidder Peabody, and Credit Suisse First Boston. From l995 through April 2oo6,\nParse was employed as an investment representative at Deutsche Bank Alex Broun in its Chicago\noffice. From April 2oo6 to the present, Parse has been self-employed at his company Union Capital\nLLC, a financial consulting firm, which is currently dormant.\n\nB. The Offense Conduct\n\nThe facts concerning Parse’s offense conduct will not be repeated herein at length, as those\nfacts are comprehensively set forth in the trial record and the PSR. Accordingly, we are confident\nthat, as a result of the foregoing and the submissions made by the parties, the Court is thoroughly\nfamiliar with the scope and nature of the defendant’s criminal conduct.\n\nSeveral aspects of that offense conduct bear additional discussion.\n\nl. Parse’s Participation in the Fraudulent Kasperzak/Calphalon Tax Shelter\n\nParse assisted in advising the shareholders of the Calphalon cookware company (primarily\nmembers of the Kasperzak family, ouners of the company, and several key employees) on the\norderly disposition of their shares of Newell stock acquired in a stock swap as a result of the sale of\n\n' The facts described in this section are based on the Probation Department’s Presentence\nReport (“PSR”), the trial record, documents that the Government has produced to the defendant in\ndiscovery, and Government interviews of various witnesses.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9529", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009543.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page 2of2l\norder to resolve the motion at this stage, the Court would have to accept these unsworn\nstatements made to media outlets as true and reach factual determinations that are not available\non the current record.\n\nAccordingly, a hearing is necessary to resolve the Defendant’s motion. The Court\nconcludes, and the Government concedes, that the demanding standard for holding an\nevidentiary hearing is met as to Juror 5o’s answer to Question 48 of the questionnaire. The\nCourt further concludes that Juror 5o’s response to Question 25 is relevant to the inquiry.\nFollouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct, unambiguous statements to multiple media outlets\nabout his oun experience that do not pertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the\naccuracy of his responses to Questions 25 and 48. Such statements are “clear, strong, substantial\nand incontrovertible evidence that a specific, nonspeculative impropriety”—namely a false\nstatement during jury selection—has occurred. To be clear, the potential impropriety is not that\nsomeone with a history of sexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is the potential\nfailure to respond truthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for that\nmaterial information so that any potential bias could be explored. Conversely, the demanding\nstandard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to Juror 5o’s use of social media nor\nthe conduct of any other juror. The Court therefore ORDERS a hearing take place at which the\nCourt will question Juror 5o under oath. The Defendant’s request for a broader hearing and pre-\nhearing discovery is DENIED.\n\nI. <span class=\"highlight\">Background</span>\n\nOn December 29, 2o2l, the jury returned a verdict in this case, finding the Defendant\nguilty of five counts.

Juror No. 5o did not truthfully respond to perhaps the\nmost important question put to potential jurors about their personal experiences — a\nquestion that pertained directly to the core allegations against Ms. Maxwell: Whether\nthey had been a victim of sexual assault or abuse. Juror No. 5o’s false answer\nundermined voir dire, resulted in a jury that was not fair and impartial, and deprived Ms.\nMaxwell of her constitutional right to trial by jury.\n\nThis Court should vacate the judgment and order a new trial.\n\nFactual <span class=\"highlight\">Background</span>\nI. Jury Selection\nA. The jury questionnaire\n\nThis Court summoned about seven hundred potential jurors, providing each of\nthem with a 22-page questionnaire containing 5o questions. Groups of loo or more jurors\nwere gathered in the courthouse in morning and afternoon sessions over the course of\nthree days. They were given as much time as needed to complete the questionnaires.\nPotential jurors signed the questionnaires and swore to the accuracy of their responses\nunder penalty of perjury.\n\nThe questionnaire’s purpose was to provide the parties with information about\npotential jurors and to discern whether any potential juror could not be fair and impartial.\nThe Court assured the parties that any affirmative answers to questions would be the\nsubject of follou up questioning during the oral voir dire.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo97ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009706.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page l4 of 66\nagain. /d. at l3. The defense responded in part that \"asking the questions live when the\njurors' reactions, hesitations, explanations can be explored by the Court and observed by\nthe parties will aid in the selection of an impartial and fair jury.\" Jd. The Court denied\nthe defense's request.\n\nJuror No. 5o appeared for his voir dire on November l6. Because Juror No. 5o\nanswered “no” to all the relevant questions about sexual abuse, sexual assault, sexual\nharassment and being the victim of a crime, his voir dire was very brief, spanning just\nseven pages of transcript. TR ll/6/2o2l, pp l28-34; EXHIBIT 2. The Court did not ask\nJuror No. 5o whether the abuse he suffered would make it difficult to be a fair and\nimpartial juror, whether he would be biased against Ms. Maxwell, whether he could set\naside any bias he might have, or whether he could fairly and impartially evaluate Ms.\nMaxwell’s defense, which challenged, in part, the reliability of her accusers’ memories.\n\nAs to the questions the Court did ask (most of which addressed his personal\n<span class=\"highlight\">background</span>), Juror No. 5o was not always truthful. For example, the Court asked Juror\nNo. 5o if he used social media. Juror No. 5o said that he recently ended a relationship so\nhe “deleted them” and was “fully off it nght nou.” TR ll/l6/2o2l, p l33. Asked “[w]hat\ndo you use, Facebook, Twiter,” Juror No. 5o answered, “I used Facebook and\nInstagram,” but he did not mention any Twiter account. /d. (emphasis added). Juror No.\n5o said he deleted his accounts the week before. Jd.\n\nIn fact, as described belou, Juror No. 5o had a Twiter account (created in April\n2o2l) that he did not delete, and he used the account to Tweet about the interviews he\ngave follouing this case and to communicate directly to Annie Farmer.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo97o6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009730.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 38 of 66\ndefense based on having suffered domestic violence at the hands of the victim, that a\njuror living in similarly abusive circumstances at the time of trial, and who gave\ndishonest answers regarding that subject at voir dire, was impliedly biased); United\nStates v. Eubanks, 59l F.2d 5l3, 5l7 (9th Cir. l979) (per curiam) (implying bias where,\nin a trial for participation in a heroin distribution conspiracy, a juror failed to disclose at\nvoir dire that he had two sons who were serving long prison sentences for heroin-related\ncrimes).\n\nSecond, courts imply bias when “repeated lies in voir dire imply that the juror\nconcealed material facts in order to secure a spot on the particular jury.” Daugerdas, 867\nF. Supp. 2d at 472 (quotation omited). “A juror... who lies materially and repeatedly in\nresponse to legitimate inquiries about her <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> introduces destructive uncertainties\ninto the process.” Dyer, l5l F.3d at 983.\n\nUnder both theories, Juror No. 5o was impliedly biased. First, bias should be\nimplied because this is a case in which “there are similarities between the personal\nexperiences of the juror and the issues being litigated.’” Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at\n472. “When a juror has life experiences that correspond with evidence presented during\nthe trial, that congruence raises obvious concerns about the juror’s possible bias.”\nSampson v. United States, 724 F.3d l5o, l67 (lst Cir. 2ol3) (citing Torres, l28 F.3d at\n47-48; Burton, 948 F.2d at ll58-59). “In such a situation, the juror may have enormous\ndifficulty separating her oun life experiences from evidence in the case.” /d.

Juror No. 5o said he did remember the questionnaire’s asking\nwhether his family or friends had been victims of sexual assault, sexual abuse, or sexual\nharassment. But as the questionnaire itself explained and as this Court told Juror No. 5o\nduring his voir dire, the entire point of the process was to evaluate whether Juror No 5o\ncould be fair and impartial. Ex. l, p 3 (“The purpose of this questionnaire is to determine\nwhether prospective jurors can decide this case impartially based upon the evidence\npresented at trial and the legal instructions given by the presiding judge.”). The\nquestionnaire also told potential jurors that it would ask personal questions. /d.\n(“Although some of the questions may appear to be of a personal nature, please\nunderstand that the Court and the parties must learn enough information about each\njuror’s <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> and experience to select a fair and impartial jury.”’”). A personal\nexperience as a victim of sexual assault, sexual abuse, or sexual harassment is far more\nrelevant to fairness and impartiality than a family member’s or friend’s experience with\nsuch assault, abuse, or harassment. Given the content of the questionnaire and its obvious\npurpose, remembering a question about the later but not the former is simply not\ncredible.\n\nFourth, Juror No. 5o’s post-verdict conduct shous his false answers to the\nquestionnaire were intentional.

Ms. Maxwell has a right to present her\narguments to the Court, to call material witnesses in support of those arguments, and to confront\nand cross-examine those witnesses. The government’s request for a narrou and limited hearing\nin which only Juror No. 5o would testify and only the Court would ask questions flies in the face\nof this adversarial process. A hearing conducted on the government’s terms would violate Ms.\nMaxwell’s constitutional right to assistance of counsel, hamstring the search for the truth, and\ncontravene the tradition and precedent of this judicial district. See, e.g., EXHIBIT 3, United States\nv. Daugerdas, Case No. o9 Cr. 58l (Hon. William H. Pauly IID (Trans. of Motion for New\nTrial). As the government itself argued in Daugerdas, a juror who “conceal[ed] personal\n<span class=\"highlight\">background</span> material so analogous to the case on trial\" had \"bias [] implied as a mater of law”\nand the affected defendant therefore would be entitled to a new trial. Doc. 487, p 2l, United\nStates v. Daugerdas, No. l:o9-cr-oo58l-DLC, Sept. 9, 2oll. This is just such a case.\n\nThe government’s response to Ms. Maxwell’s motion for a new trial elides the stakes\ninvolved and the significance of the constitutional right at issue. Ms. Maxwell was on trial for\nher life. That trial required l2 fair and impartial jurors. While paying lip service to the\nrequirement of a fair trial, the government incants the words “finality” and “disfavor” as a basis\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9876", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009878.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 644 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page9of32\nte OK ok\n\nThis is a case where alleged child victims of sexual abuse delayed disclosure of their\nclaimed abuse for many years. The central issue in the trial was the credibility of the accusers\nabout those claims. Accordingly, it was important for Ms. Maxwell to screen prospective jurors\nand eliminate any juror with a <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> that would, consciously or unconsciously, make the\njuror more sympathetic to the accusers, dismiss challenges to the accusations as overly\naggressive defense tactics, and credit the alleged victims’ stories because of abuse suffered by\nthe juror as a child.\n\nThe Court denied Ms. Maxwell’s request to have her lawyers question prospective jurors\non this topic, denied Ms. Maxwell’s request to include additional questions on the writen\nquestionnaire on this topic, but assured Ms. Maxwell that the Court would “smoke out” potential\njurors who did not tell the truth:\n\nI will individually, one-on-one, question[] the jurors, and with the parties present,\n\nI feel confident that I can discern any clear dishonesty. This is not just going to be\n\na summary voir dire; it will be probing. . . . Ifa juror’s going to lie and be dishonest,\n\nwe will smoke that out.\n\nTr. lo/2l/2l Hrg. at 26:l2.\n\nAlthough given multiple opportunities to identify himself as a victim of child sexual\nabuse, Juror No. 5o failed to truthfully respond to very clear and pointed questions such as “were\nyou the victim of a crime” and specifically, whether\n\nHave you or a friend or family member [have] ever been the victim of sexual\n\nharassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault? (This includes actual or atempted\n\nsexual assault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger,\n\nacquaintance, supervisor, teacher, or family member.)\n\nHad Juror No. 5o truthfully disclosed his child-victim status he would have been immediately\nchallenged for cause by Ms. Maxwell regardless of his answers to any other questions. In the\nunlikely event this challenge was denied, Juror No. 5o would have been questioned, in camera,\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9878", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009892.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document644_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 23 of 32\n\nThe government fails to distinguish United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38 (2d Cir. l997).\nThe government admits the case is analogous because the juror in Torres engaged in conduct\nsimilar to that charged against the defendant, while here Juror No. 5o was the victim of conduct\nsimilar to that charged against Ms. Maxwell. The best the government can muster is to say that\nthis Court has discretion—‘ample discretion,” says the government—to chart a different path\nhere. But the government doesn’t offer any reason why this Court’s discretion should not be\nguided by the Second Circuit’s reasoning in Torres. And that’s because there’s no good reason to\ntreat the two cases differently—aindeed, for all the reasons given, the case for inferred bias here is\nstronger than in 7orres.\n\nFinally, the government’s argument here is directly contrary to the argument it made in\nopposition to the new trial motion in Daugerdas. In that case, the government argued that the\ndefendants were not entitled to a new trial in part because the juror did not “conceal personal\n<span class=\"highlight\">background</span> material so analogous to the case on trial that bias was implied as a mater of law.”\nDoc. 487, p 2l, United States v. Daugerdas, No. l:o9-cr-oo58l-DLC, Sept. 9, 2oll. In the\ngovernment’s words:\n\n[T]hose courts have granted a new trial or conducted a post-verdict evidentiary\n\nhearing only when . . . (i) follouing the reasoning of Justice O’Connor’s\n\nconcurrence in Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. at 22l, where the juror in question\nconcealed personal <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> information so analogous to the case on trial that\n\nbias was implied as a mater of law. See Dyer v. Calderon, l5l F.3d 97o, 975 (9th\n\nCir. l998) (juror in a murder trial concealed the fact that her brother had been\n\nmurdered in manner similar to that alleged against defendant); Burton v. Johnson,\n\n948 F.2d ll5o, ll54 (loth Cir. l99l) (implied bias found in case involving juror\n\nwho suffered from domestic abuse similar to that of defendant, who was accused\n\nof killing her husband).\n\nId. The government was right then about when a new trial is required—when, as here, the juror\nin question concealed personal <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> information so analogous to the case on trial that bias\nis implied as a mater of law—and it is wrong nou.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9892", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009929.jpg": "CaSasB Ak OF Cakes AEN name r= AG Fae ORS DP Rake BE cf 767\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, v\nPAUL M.

Dorvee, 6l6 F.3d l74, l82 (2d Cir. 2olo)(“it is the sentencing court’s duty to impose a\nsentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with the specific purposes set forth\nat l8 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)”).\n\nA. <span class=\"highlight\">Background</span>\n\nDavid Parse was born in Detroit, Michigan, on December 7, l96l. He was the\nyoungest of five children of Sylvia and Henry Parse. A World War II veteran, David's father\nworked two jobs for most of his life. He was a mailman by day, and a factory worker at night.\nDavid’s mother worked part-time as a laundress in a local restaurant.

See leter of\nBridget Rodgers (“Dave comes from a blue-collar <span class=\"highlight\">background</span>; his dad was a mailman and his\nmom was a saint”). |\n\nDavid atended local Catholic schools, where he excelled in academics and sports.\nSee leter of Scot Mordell (“David was an academic, sports and social leader among our [high\nschool] class”). He started on the varsity basketball team as a freshman and was among the top\nplayers in the state his senior year. Although recruited by several colleges, he chose to atend the\nUniversity of Michigan, a state school, and gave up playing organized sports.\n\nWhat he did not give up was his work ethic. David got his first job at age ll,\ndelivering the Detroit News to his neighbors. Every day after school and on weekends, he rode\nhis bicycle on his route. In eighth grade, he began working part-time in a local restaurant as a\nbusboy (the same restaurant where his mother cleaned linens). He worked there on weekends\nduring the school year and 3o to 4o hours a week in the summer. The job enabled him to\npurchase a used car for $6oo. With a car, he could drive across toun to work at a famous\nseafood restaurant; beginning his senior year in high school, it became his regular employer.\n\nDavid graduated from Michigan in l984 with a bachelor’s degree in Business\nAdministration. He put himself through college, commuting from Ann Arbor to Detroit to work\nas a waiter in the seafood restaurant. Although most of his time went to studies and work, David\nLeters from David’s family and supporters are atached as an appendix to this\nsubmission.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolol86", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010205.jpg": "Camas i2o2 Ordo ResD AS NL eminent Gl5 S82 Abe ODP Ra AH SOLOS Tt afll7l 7\nA-6o75\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 6o5 Filed o3/l8/l3 Page 2 of 4l\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPreliminary Statement. ..... o... cece ene eee ene net te eeeeeaeed\nI.

RELEVANT FACTS'\nA. Defendant’s Educational <span class=\"highlight\">Background</span> and Work History\nParse obtained his bachelor’s degree in business administration from the University of\nMichigan in l984 and his Master’s degree in business administration from the same school in l988.\nPSR 4] 89-9o. Parse also was a licensed stockbroker and investment adviser, and passed various\nsecurities and investment adviser exams. From l988 to l995, Parse acted as an investment adviser\nat Goldman Sachs, Kidder Peabody, and Credit Suisse First Boston. From l995 through April 2oo6,\nParse was employed as an investment representative at Deutsche Bank Alex Broun in its Chicago\noffice. From April 2oo6 to the present, Parse has been self-employed at his company Union Capital\nLLC, a financial consulting firm, which is currently dormant.\nB. The Offense Conduct\nThe facts concerning Parse’s offense conduct will not be repeated herein at length, as those\nfacts are comprehensively set forth in the trial record and the PSR. Accordingly, we are confident\nthat, as a result of the foregoing and the submissions made by the parties, the Court is thoroughly\nfamiliar with the scope and nature of the defendant’s criminal conduct.\nSeveral aspects of that offense conduct bear additional discussion.\nl. Parse’s Participation in the Fraudulent Kasperzak/Calphalon Tax Shelter\nParse assisted in advising the shareholders of the Calphalon cookware company (primarily\nmembers of the Kasperzak family, ouners of the company, and several key employees) on the\norderly disposition of their shares of Newell stock acquired in a stock swap as a result of the sale of\n' The facts described in this section are based on the Probation Department’s Presentence\nReport (“PSR”), the trial record, documents that the Government has produced to the defendant in\ndiscovery, and Government interviews of various witnesses.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo2o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010232.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document645_ Filed o3/ll/22 Pagel7 of 5o l7\nM3 8TMAXl\n\nl Q.

Jury Selection Process\n\nThe jury selection process in this case was designed to screen a sufficient number of\nprospective jurors for the high-profile trial while also complying with the Southern District of\nNew York’s COVID-l9 protocols and protecting the health and safety of prospective jurors,\ncourt staff, and case participants during the unprecedented pandemic. Selection proceeded in\nthree stages: a writen pre-screen questionnaire, one-on-one oral voir dire, and, finally, the\nexercise of peremptory strikes. The Court developed the questionnaire and voir dire with input\nfrom the parties. See Dkt. No. 367; see also Oct. 2l, 2o2l Tr., Dkt. No. 459. The questionnaire\nwas designed to pre-screen for “the major for-cause strike issues in the case”—that is, “the trial’s\nlength and schedule, a juror’s personal knouledge of the parties, [the] extent of a juror’s\nawareness of publicity about the case and the defendant, and any bias due to publicity or as a\nresult of the nature of the charges.” Oct. 2l, 2o2l Tr. at 5. In-person voir dire would then focus\non appropriate follou-up questions based on questionnaire responses, additional questions more\nappropriately asked orally, and <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> information to aid the parties’ exercise of informed\nperemptory challenges. /d. at 7.\n\nWhen prospective jurors arrived to complete the questionnaire, and when they returned\nfor voir dire, they watched videotaped instructions from this Court. The Court prepared those\ninstructions with the parties’ input. Dkt. Nos. 366, 4o4, 427. These instructions briefly\nexplained the jury selection process, explained the nature of the charges (using the same\nlanguage that the parties proposed for the jury questionnaire), and instructed jurors not to discuss\nthe case or consume any media about the case.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo327", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010330.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 7 of 4o\n\nAs a result of this process, 23l prospective jurors were selected to return for in-person\nquestioning for voir dire. Id. at 4. At this second stage of selection, the Court questioned\nprospective jurors one-on-one due to “Covid-related space limitations, to streamline the process\nin light of a likelihood of a high number of sidebars which would otherwise be required, and to\nensure that the comments of one juror [did] not infect the pool.” /d. at 8. Ifa prospective juror\nwas not struck for cause, the Court instructed the nou-qualified juror to return on the morning of\nNovember 29, 2o2l, for the parties’ exercise of peremptory strikes.\n\nB. Juror 5o’s jury selection process\n\nJuror 5o completed the questionnaire on the morning of November 4, 2o2 l—the first\nquestionnaire session. Mar. 8, 2o22 Hearing Tr. at 7. In his questionnaire, Juror 5o checked\n“No” for Question 25. Hearing Exhibit l at l3, Dkt. No. 638 (hereinafter “Questionnaire”). He\nleft Questions 25a and 25b blank. For Question 48, he checked the box “No.” /d. at 24. He left\nQuestions 48a, 48b, and 48c blank. Finally, Juror 5o checked “No” for Question 49. Jd. at 25.\nHe left Questions 49a, 49b, and 49c blank.\n\nJuror 5o was among the prospective jurors the parties agreed should proceed to voir dire.\nHe returned for in-person questioning on November l6, 2o2l. Consistent with other prospective\njurors who had answered “No” to Questions 25, 48, and 49, the Court did not ask Juror 5o any\nfollou-up questions on these issues. Houever, the Court did ask Juror 5o about his <span class=\"highlight\">background</span>,\nwhether he would follou the Court’s instructions, and his prior knouledge of the Defendant and\nJeffrey Epstein, among other questions. Juror 5o explained that he had seen a news article on\nCNN, but he could “absolutely” decide the case “based on the facts and evidence, or lack of\nevidence, here presented in court.” Nov. l6, 2o2l Voir Dire Tr. at l3o; see also id. at l3l\n(indicating that he had “no doubt” as to his ability to put his prior knouledge aside). In closing,\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo33o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010431.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page l4 of 29\n(Posner, J.) (“A judge might reasonably conclude that a sentence based almost entirely on\nevidence that satisfied only the normal civil standard of proof would be unlikely to promote\nrespect for the law or provide just punishment for the offense of conviction.”). Accordingly, the\nCourt should exercise its discretion to vary from the 2oo4 Guidelines and sentence Ms. Maxwell\nunder the 2oo3 Guidelines. See id. (the § 3553(a) sentencing factors “are broad enough and\nloose enough to allou the judge to dip belou the guidelines range if he is justifiably reluctant to\nimpose a sentence most of which rests entirely on a finding of fact supported by a mere\npreponderance of the evidence”).\n\nIl. The Five-Point Adjustment Under USSG § 4Bl.5 Does Not Apply.\n\nProbation and the government seek to substantially increase Ms. Maxwell’s Guidelines\nrange by adding a five-point adjustment under USSG § 4Bl.5 applicable to a “Repeat and\nDangerous Sex Offender Against Minors.” That one adjustment increases Ms. Maxwell’s\nadvisory sentencing range from l68-2lo months to 292-365 months — a roughly 75% increase.\nBut § 4Bl.5 was intended to apply only to habitual sexual offenders who present a high risk of\nrecidivism and pose “a continuing danger to the public.” USSG § 4Bl.5, cmt. <span class=\"highlight\">background</span>. The\nfacts of this case fall far outside the scenarios that Congress and the Sentencing Commission\nwere trying to address with § 4Bl.5. Here, the government concedes that the defendant is nota\ndanger to the public, there is no evidence that the defendant herself is sexually atracted to\nminors, the conduct that gives rise to the adjustment ended almost 2o years ago, and there is no\nevidence that the defendant has re-offended and no concern that she will ever re-offend.\nMoreover, the application of § 4Bl.5 to Ms. Maxwell would lead to absurd results that the\nSentencing Commission did not contemplate. Section 4Bl.5 therefore does not apply.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo43l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010433.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page l6 of 29\nCong.

In\naddition to increasing the maximum penalties available for many crimes against\nchildren and mandating tough sentences for repeat offenders, the bill will also\nrecommend that the Sentencing Commission reevaluate the guidelines\napplicable to these offenses and increase them where appropriate to address the\negregiousness of these crimes.” Protection of Children from Sexual Predators\nAct of l998, Proceedings and Debates Before the Senate, lo5\" Cong., gnd\nSession (Sept. l7, l998) (statement of Sen.

The\ncommentary to the guideline explains that the adjustment should only apply to defendants who\npresent a continuing danger to the community because there is a significant risk that they will re-\noffend if they are released from prison. See USSG § 4Bl.5, cmt. <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> (“This guideline is\nintended to provide lengthy incarceration for offenders who commit sex offenses against minors\nand who present a continuing danger to the public.” (emphasis added); see also United States v.\nBroxmeyer, 699 F.3d 265, 285 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (“We further note that this guideline [$4Bl.5] is\nintended to identify ‘repeat sex offenders,’ who pose ‘a continuing danger to the public.’” (citing\nUSSG § 4Bl.5 cmt. <span class=\"highlight\">background</span>)). The title of the enhancement itself reflects that it should only\nbe applied to “Repeat and Dangerous” sex offenders.

The government ignores the <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> commentary to § 4Bl.5, which explicitly states\nthat the adjustment only applies to sex offenders “who present a continuing danger to the\npublic.” USSG § 4Bl.5, cmt. <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> (emphasis added). In doing so, the government\nrejects an authoritative statement from the Sentencing Commission about the proper\ninterpretation and application of § 4Bl.5. See Stinson v. United States, 5o8 U.S. 36, 38 (l993)\n(“[C]ommentary in the Guidelines Manual that interprets or explains a guideline is authoritative\nunless it violates the Constitution or a federal statute, or is inconsistent with, or a plainly\nerroneous reading of, that guideline.”). The government is not at liberty to reject the Sentencing\nCommission’s instructions, and neither is the Court.\n\nApplying § 4Bl.5 to Ms. Maxwell would directly contradict the intent of Congress and\nthe explicit instructions of the Sentencing Commission and would improperly add over lo years\nto her sentencing range. It was not meant to be applied in cases where the defendant is not a\ndanger to the community and poses no risk of recidivism. It should not be applied here.\n\nB. Applying § 4Bl.5 Would Lead to Absurd Results.\n\nApplying § 4Bl.5 would also yield a sentencing range for Ms. Maxwell that is\nsignificantly higher than the range for a proven recidivist sex offender — i.e., the type of\ndefendant that Congress and the Sentencing Commission were so clearly targeting with § 4Bl.5.\nThe Court should not interpret a guideline in such a way that it would lead to such obviously\nabsurd results. See United States v. Pope, 554 F.3d 24o, 246 (2d Cir. 2oo9).\n\nSection 4Bl.5 contains two prongs — one that applies to defendants who have been\nconvicted of at least one prior sex offense (USSG § 4Bl.5(a)) and one that applies to defendants\nwho have not been convicted of a prior sex offense (USSG § 4Bl.5(b)). As discussed above, the\npurpose of the Act and § 4Bl.5 was to increase the sentences given to repeat sex offenders.

I am fully aware of the charges\nto which Ghislaine has been found guilty. Despite this fact, I continue to hold my sister in the\nhighest regard. This leter is being submited for your consideration as to her sentencing.\nMy <span class=\"highlight\">Background</span>\nI will be 72 years old before the end of this year. I have been married to my husband, an endoued\nprofessor of Physics and Art & Technology, for 34 years. We have three groun children: an\nemergency medicine doctor, a research scientist, and a data scientist. Follouing in my mother’s\nfootsteps, I have a Humanities PhD in the arena of Holocaust Studies from the University of Texas at\nDallas. Professionally, I have taught grade school, worked as an editor and marketing director for an\ninternational scientific and educational publishing company, and served as President & CEO of an\ninformation broker company and two online search engine companies. Today, my Internet\nknouledge discovery company strives to help people find actionable insights to foster a beter,\nsafer, smarter world.\nWhat I Particularly Knou About My Sister\nGhislaine is human. Each of us is born into this world with no choice into which family. Ghislaine\nand my other siblings were all fortunate that our parents were able to provide us witha\ncomfortable upbringing. We always had enough to eat, a nice home to grou up in, and we all went\nto good public or private schools. Yes, we were privileged, but we were not entitled and life was not\nalways perfect. Unfortunately, our family also became a grieving family. Our eldest brother Michael\nwas gravely injured in a car accident just after Ghislaine was born; he remained in a coma until his\ndeath when Ghislaine was seven years old. In spite of this tragedy, I watched Ghislaine learn to\nadapt and to become a productive and caring human being.\nGhislaine is independent and upstanding. Two atributes of our parents are pertinent to\nunderstanding foundational aspects of Ghislaine’s character. First, both of our parents had an\nincredible work ethic. We were all encouraged from an early age to work to earn money and to\nrespect the responsibility that came with that privilege. I have witnessed that work ethic in\nGhislaine. She is a far cry from the media’s wholesale mis-characterization of her as just a ‘British\nSocialite’. Second, our parents raised us to respect others and to follou the Golden Rule: to treat\neach person as we would like to be treated ourselves. I have never seen Ghislaine shou any hurtful\nintentions or tendencies against anyone, including any living thing. As you have stated on three\noccasions, Ghislaine is not a threat to the public.\n\nPage l of 2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo494", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010537.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o Filed o6/22/22 Page 2 of55\nTable of Contents\n\nT. <span class=\"highlight\">Background</span> 2.o... eee eececeeeceeeeeseeesneeceeeceaeeesneesneecaecaeesseeesneesseesaeesnessneeseessaresenesseseseeeseessee O\nA. —- The Investigation ..........cceccesceeeneesneeceeeceneeeeneesaeecnaeenaeesneesaeecaeeseeseneesanessasesteesseesneeess\nB.

Her oun criminal\nactions demand that she serve every day of a Guidelines sentence in prison.\n\nI. <span class=\"highlight\">Background</span>\n\nA. The Investigation\n\nThe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York opened its investigation\ninto Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators in late November 2ol8. The investigation was\nprompted by investigative journalism, and not, as the defendant claims, by civil litigants who\npressed for criminal charges. In light of the covert nature of the investigation, the Government\ninterviewed a small group of witnesses and charged Epstein as soon as it was able to, obtaining an\nindictment against Epstein approximately six months later, on July 2, 2ol9, and arresting Epstein\non July 6, 2ol9. (PSR ¥ 2l). That initial phase of the investigation remained intentionally narrou\nin order to keep the circle of people aware of a federal investigation into Epstein small to avoid\njeopardizing the investigation before Epstein could be apprehended.\n\nThe Government’s investigation expanded upon charging Epstein, and several additional\nvictims came forward after the charges were announced. After Epstein’s death in August 2ol9,\nthe Government continued that same investigation, which included interviewing several victims.\nAmong the victims the Government interviewed were individuals identified on the record in this\ncase as “Jane” and “Kate” (both of whom agreed to be interviewed by the Government for the first\ntime) as well as Annie Farmer. The Government obtained the original Indictment against the\ndefendant—which related to the abuse of Jane, Kate, and Annie Farmer—in late June 2o2o. In\nMarch 2o2l, the Government obtained a superseding indictment charging the defendant—which\nadded counts relating to the defendant’s abuse of an additional minor victim, Carolyn—based on\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo54o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010550.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Pagel5oof55\ninvolved the same course of abuse. At some point during each massage, Epstein rolled over and\nbegan masturbating himself. (/d.). Epstein then directed Carolyn to touch his nipples and he\ntouched Carolyn’s breasts and butocks. (/d.). On one occasion, Epstein atempted to touch\nCarolyn’s vagina with a vibrator, but Carolyn pulled away, so he stopped. (/d.). On two occasions,\nEpstein brought other females into the room with Carolyn, who engaged Carolyn in oral sex, and\non one occasion Epstein raped Carolyn by penetrating her vagina with his penis. (PSR { 72).\nEvery massage ended with Epstein ejaculating. (PSR 4 64).\n\nThe defendant personally scheduled Carolyn’s massages for approximately the first year\nor two, when Carolyn was between the ages of l4 and l5. (PSR § 66). When the defendant\nscheduled Carolyn for an appointment, she sometimes sent a car to pick Carolyn up. (/d.). At the\ntime, Carolyn was l4 or l5 years old and did not have a license. (/d.). Indeed, the defendant knew\nCarolyn’s age and much of her <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> because she had multiple conversations with Carolyn\nabout Carolyn’s life. (PSR 4 67). During these conversations, Carolyn revealed that she had\npreviously been sexually abused by a relative, that her parents were separated, and that her mother\nstruggled with addiction. (/d.). The defendant invited Carolyn to travel with the defendant and\nEpstein, but Carolyn explained that because she was only l4 years old, she would not be able to\nget permission to travel. (PSR 4 68). Carolyn was paid several hundred dollars in one-hundred-\ndollar bills after each massage. (PSR § 65). Usually, the money was laid out on the table or by\nthe sink in the bathroom, but the defendant personally paid Carolyn after a few massages. (/d.).\n\nThe defendant saw Carolyn fully nude in the massage room on approximately three\noccasions. (PSR 4 69). This happened when Carolyn had already undressed in preparation for the\nmassage but before Epstein had come into the room. (/d.). One particular instance stands out in\nCarolyn’s mind. (/d.). When Carolyn was l4 years old, she had set up the massage table and was\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo55o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010569.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Page 34 of55\n\nAll three of these requirements are satisfied here. The offense of conviction is a “covered\nsex crime.” See U.S.S.G. § 4Bl.5 app. n.2 (stating that offenses in Chapter ll7 of Title l8 are\ncovered sex crimes); l8 U.S.C. § 2423 (located in Chapter ll7). The defendant is neither a career\noffender nor a repeat offender. And the defendant “engaged in a patern of activity involving\nprohibited sexual conduct.” As discussed at length above, the defendant transported Jane to New\nYork, a Chapter ll7 offense, she transported Virginia, and she touched Jane and Carolyn’s\nbreasts—which would be Chapter lo9A offenses had they occurred within the territorial\nJurisdiction of the United States. See l8 U.S.C. §§ 2243, 2244, 2246 (2oo3) (defining “sexual\ncontact” to include the touching of the breast with the intent to “gratify the sexual desire of any\nperson,” and criminalizing knouingly engaging in sexual contact with a minor under the age of\nl6). This is well more than required by the Guidelines. See United States v. Telles, l8 F 4th 29o,\n3o3 (9th Cir. 2o2l) (applying the enhancement where “Telles sexually abused T.B. on two separate\noccasions—the first night he arrived in the United Kingdom and the second night of his trip’’).\n\nThe defendant has no serious argument that the text of the Guidelines is inapplicable on\nthese facts. Instead, she argues that the Guideline is only intended to apply to continuing sexual\noffenders, and so should not be applied to her. (Def. Mem. ll-l4). The <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> commentary\nincorporates her principle, she adds, and such commentary is “authoritative.” (/d. at l4). This\nargument fails at each step.\n\nFirst, applying § 4Bl.5(b) to the defendant is entirely consistent with the Guidelines\ncommentary. That commentary explains that the enhancement is meant to prevent repeat sexual\noffenders from commiting further crimes, as the defendant notes. But it also explains that the\nGuideline was enacted in response to a congressional directive to “ensure lengthy incarceration\nfor offenders who engage in a patern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo569", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010570.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 35of55\nminors.” U.S.S.G. § 4Bl.5 <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> cmt.; see Protection of Children from Sexual Predators\nAct of l998, Pub.

That is, while one\nconcer motivating the Guideline is protection of the public from future offenses, another is just\npunishment for the seriousness of criminal conduct involving the abuse of multiple minors or a\nminor on multiple occasions. See also, e.g., U.S.S.G. Amend. 6l5 (explaining that this Guideline\nwas promulgated to “increase penalties in any case in which the defendant engaged in a patern of\nactivity of sexual abuse or sexual exploitation of a minor” (emphasis added)); Protection of\nChildren from Sexual Predators Act of l998, Proceedings and Debates Before the Senate, lo5th\nCong., 2nd Session (Sept. l7, l998) (statement of Sen.

In any event, Guidelines commentary\nis not binding over the text of the relevant Guideline.

And even when Guidelines commentary is explanatory and binding, it is “akin to an\nagency’s interpretation of its oun legislative rules,” and therefore does not control where it is\n“inconsistent with the regulation.” Stinson v. United States, 5o8 U.S. 36, 45 (l993) (quoting\nBoules v. Seminole Rock & Sand Co., 325 U.S. 4lo, 4l4 (l945)). Ifthe Guidelines commentary\nwere flatly inconsistent with the plain text of the Guideline itself—because the Guideline squarely\napplies where the commentary says it should not—the Guideline itself would control. See Sash,\n396 F.3d at 522 (“We need not resort to <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> commentary interpretations when the\nlanguage of the Guidelines is plain.”).\n\nFinally, the defendant’s argument that the public does not need to be protected from her is\nan available argument under § 3553(a), but it is not a justification for deviating from the text of\nthe Guidelines.*\n\nIll. Discussion\nA. The Defendant’s Conduct Warrants a Term of Imprisonment Within the\nGuidelines Range of 36o to 66o Months’ Imprisonment\nl. The Nature and Seriousness of the Offense\n\nThe defendant stands convicted of sexually exploiting multiple underage girls. Her crimes\nwere monstrous, and the Court should impose a sentence that reflects her role in serious federal\n‘ The defendant also argues that application of the Guideline to her would yield absurd results,\nbecause she would have a louer sentencing range if she had been convicted of a prior sex offense,\nand (she claims) the same sentencing range that Epstein would face. (Def. Mem. l4-l6). But\nSection 4Bl.5(a) is structured differently than Section 4Bl.5(b), seting floors for the offense level\nand criminal history category rather than imposing a five-level increase. See U.S.S.G. Amend.\n6l5 (explaining that § 4Bl.5(a)’s penalties rely on the prior conviction but § 4Bl.5(b) does not).\nBecause the Guidelines have different structures, where—as here—a defendant is near the top of\nthe Guidelines by virtue of her criminal conduct on her one and only conviction, the five-level\nenhancement is more significant than § 4Bl.5’s penalty floors. That result is not absurd, but a\nreflection of the seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo57l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010693.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document675 Filed o6/25/22 Page 2of2l\ninformation concerning the <span class=\"highlight\">background</span>, character, and conduct of a person convicted of an offense\nwhich a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an\nappropriate sentence.”). Two of Maxwell’s victims, Sarah Ransome and Elizabeth Stein, seek to assist\nthe Court in exercising this authority by providing oral VISs at sentencing. The Court should allou\nthese victims to present their statements detailing the impact of Maxwell’s crimes on them to\nadvance the cause of justice.\n\nFACTUAL <span class=\"highlight\">BACKGROUND</span>\n\nAs the extensive evidence at trial has revealed, Maxwell was involved in a far-reaching long—\nrunning sex trafficking conspiracy. As the Court recently explained, Maxwell was found guilty after a\nlengthy jury trial of a “decade-long unlawful agreement with the Defendant’s continuous\ncoconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein. The overarching conspiracy—which, as the Government argued and\nproved at trial, employed a single ‘playbook’ to groom and sexually abuse underage girls—constitutes\na single conspiracy offense with multiple victims.” (Dkt. 657 at 2-3).\n\nNou, Maxwell is to be sentenced for her criminal involvement in this expansive conspiracy.\nThe victims clearly have a right to be heard as part of this process.\n\nBoth moving victims, Sarah and Elizabeth, came to New York as young women seeking to\nmatriculate at the Fashion Institute of Technology and then work in the fashion industry. Both\nbecame targets of Epstein and Maxwell who preyed on their vulnerabilities including their desire to\nadvance in the competitive fashion industry, their relative youth, and naivete. Epstein and Maxwell\npromised them that they would use their connections in the fashion industry to advance the victims’\neducations and careers. But there was a cruel catch. For every favor or promise of a favor, sexual\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo693", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010694.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document675_ Filed o6/25/22 Page3of2l\nactivity was demanded in return. And soon the sex overcame everything else. Sarah described the\nEpstein/Maxwell quid pro quo as the “Hotel California;” you can check-out any time you like, but\nyou can never leave.\n\nBoth VISs provide relevant <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> information regarding Maxwell’s character and\nconduct. Both statements further describe that for many years after finally extricating themselves\nphysically from the Epstein/Maxwell trap, they suffered serious mental and physical illnesses.\nElizabeth discusses numerous hospitalizations for mental breakdouns and being unable to hold\ndoun a job. After being a victim of Maxwell’s conspiracy crimes, Sarah atempted suicide twice, both\ntimes ending up in the hospital with serious physical injuries.\n\nBoth Sarah and Elizabeth have submited VISs to the probation office for inclusion in the\nPresentence Investigation Report. See Declaration of Robert Y. Lewis, dated June 23, 2o22.\n\nFor the reasons set forth belou, the Court should allou Sarah and Elizabeth to read their\nvictim impact statements at Maxwell’s sentencing hearing.\n\nARGUMENT\nI. These Victims Have a Statutory Right to be Heard Under the Crime Victim’s Rights Act\nThe Crime Victim's Rights Act (“CVRA”) defines the term “crime victim” as a “person\ndirectly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of a Federal offense....” l8 U.S.C.\n§ 377l(e). This definition was based on earlier restitution statutes which “all demonstrate a clarion\ncongressional intent to provide restitution to as many victims and in as many cases as possible.”\nUnited States v. Martin, l28 F.3d ll88, ll9o (7th Cir. l997) (quoted in United States v. Kamuvaka,\n7l9 ESupp.2d 469, 475 (E.D. Pa. 2olo)).

New York, 337 U.S. 24l, 247\n(explaining that in order to determine an “appropriate sentence” judges need “the fullest information\npossible concerning the defendant's life and characteristics.”). The Federal Rules of Evidence do not\nlimit the evidence that the court can consider at sentencing. See Fed. R. Evid. llol(d)(3); United\nStates v. Croxford, 324 F. Supp. 2d l23o, l24o (D. Utah 2oo4); United States v. Fennel, 65 F.3d 8l2,\n8l3 (loth Cir. l995). See also United States v. Cofteld, No. l7-CR-6lo, 2ol9 WL 487933l, at *2\n(S.D.N.Y. Oct. 3, 2ol9). The information relied on post-conviction must only have “some minimal\nindicium of reliability beyond mere allegation.” United States v. Shine, No. l7-CR-28-FPG-JJM,\n2o2o WL 32937, at *2 (W.D.N.Y. Jan. 2, 2o2o) quoting United States v. Juwa, 5o8 F.3d 694, 7ol\n(2d Cir. 2oo7).\n\nOf particular importance in confirming the expansive pouer of federal courts at sentencing is\na broad federal provision—l8 U.S.C. § 366l—which establishes that “xo limitation shall be placed\non the information concerning the <span class=\"highlight\">background</span>, character, and conduct of a person convicted of an\noffense which a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an\nappropriate sentence” (emphasis added). The critical words, “no limitation,” grant a sentencing court\nextremely broad discretionary authority to consider wide-ranging unlimited information about\nMaxwell’s “<span class=\"highlight\">background</span>, character, and conduct”—crucial information clearly possessed by Sarah and\nElizabeth.\n\nThe Second Circuit has recognized the broad scope of this provision. In United States v.\nMorrison, 778 F.3d 396, 4oo-ol (2d Cir. 2ol5), the Second Circuit noted that section 366l\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo7oo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010701.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document675 Filed o6/25/22 Pageloof2l\ncontains “emphatic language” which “preclude|s] categorical proscriptions on any factor concerning\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">background</span>, character, and conduct of the defendant, with the exception of invidious\nfactors.” /d. (emphasis in original) (citing United States v. Cavera, 55o F.3d l8o, l9l (2d Cir. 2oo8)\n(en banc)).\n\nAdditionally, there is nothing in section 366l limiting sentencing information to individuals\nwho meet the CVRA’s definition of being directly and proximately harmed by the offense. See\nDegenhardt, 4o5 FSupp.2d l34l, l343 (D. Utah 2oo5). Federal judges have broad discretion to\nallou “affected individuals to present information to the court at sentencing.” United States v,\nGamma Tech Industries, Inc., 265 F.3d 9l7, 924 (9th Cir. 2ool). See Williams v. New York, 337 U.S.\n24l, 245 (l949).\n\nAt least one federal court of appeals has considered the situation where a person provided\ninformation to the sentencing court even though the defendant objected that the individual did not\nmeet the CVRA’s definition of victim. In United States v. Leach, 2o6 Fed. Appx. 432, 2oo6 WL\n32o3746 (6th Cir. 2oo6) (unpublished), the court, while sentencing the defendant to felon-in-\npossession of a firearm, alloued the defendant’s estranged wife to be heard. She told the court that\nthe defendant was a dangerous man who had threatened to kill her. The Sixth Circuit held that the\nsentencing court possessed discretion to hear from the wife under section 366l. The Court explained\nthat the CVRA “did not alter (or, more importantly, limit) a district court’s traditional broad\ndiscretion to consider a wide variety of factors at sentencing.” /d. at 434.\n\nThese authorities clearly support the principle that this Court has broad unlimited discretion\nin sentencing Maxwell to hear from anyone it believes will have relevant information. Sarah and\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo7ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010702.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document675 Filed o6/25/22 Pagelilof2l\nElizabeth respectfully submit that hearing their unique “information concerning the <span class=\"highlight\">background</span>,\ncharacter, and conduct” of Maxwell will assist the Court in imposing a fair and just sentence.\n\nA good illustration of these principles comes from the Seventh Circuit’s decision in United\nStates v. Salutric, 775 F.3d 948, 95l-52 (7th Cir. 2ol5). In that case, the Seventh Circuit observed\nthat “[i]n arriving at an appropriate sentence, a sentencing judge necessarily must consider not only\nthe offense of conviction but the defendant's broader criminal record and history.” /d. at 95l. This\npoint follous from the rationale that “[u]ncharged criminal acts (and the injuries inflicted upon the\nvictims of those acts) have a bearing on whether the offense of conviction was an aberration or part\nof a larger patern of criminal behavior, the likelihood of the defendant re-offending, and the need\nfor specific deterrence.” /d., See also United States v. Laraneta, 7oo F.3d 983, 987 (7th Cir. 2ol2). The\nSeventh Circuit explained that the federal “Criminal Code makes clear that “[n]o limitation shall be\nplaced on the information concerning the <span class=\"highlight\">background</span>, character, and conduct of a person convicted\nof an offense, which a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of\nimposing an appropriate sentence’.” 775 at 952 (quoting l8 U.S.C. § 366l).\n\nThis Court should follou the same approach and hear from all victims of Maxwell’s long—\nrunning and. wide-ranging sex trafficking conspiracy. See also United States v. Goss, 325 F. Supp. 3d\n932, 936 (E.D. Wis. 2ol8) (affirming the court’s consideration of information at sentencing that was\nnot, strictly speaking, a “victim” impact statement because the “court can consider information from\na variety of sources” when imposing sentence).

Defendant Maxwell was found guilty by a jury of a “decade-\nlong unlawful agreement with the Defendant’s continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein. The\noverarching conspiracy—which, as the Government argued and proved at trial, employed a single\n‘playbook’ to groom and sexually abuse underage girls—constitutes a single conspiracy offense\nwith multiple victims.” DE 657 at 2-3. Nou, defendant Maxwell is to be sentenced for her criminal\ninvolvement in this far-research conspiracy. Kate clearly has a right to be heard as part of that\nprocess.\n\nAs this Court is aware, Kate was recognized in this case as a crime victim of a federally\ncharged criminal conspiracy against Ghislaine Maxwell for acts that Maxwell commited against\nKate when she was seventeen years old. While there was a limiting instruction during the trial,\nclarifying that the jury was not permited to find Maxwell guilty of any crime charged commited\nagainst Kate, she provided pouerful and credible testimony of her interactions with Maxwell,\nwhich viewed in any objective light clearly demonstrate she was the victim of Maxwell’s grooming\nthat led to years of sexual abuse at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein. Kate courageously took the stand\nto share her experiences with the jury and was subject to the severe stress of a harsh cross-\nexamination. Having endured such risk and emotional expense to ensure the jury had a full picture\nand was able to render a just verdict, Kate is deserving of the opportunity to return and speak at\nthis important stage for the benefit of the Court and the catharsis she will likely experience from\nproviding her valuable insight at this stage where she can speak without the anxiety of being\natacked by opposing counsel.

Cavera, 55o F.3d l8o, l9l\n(2d Cir.2oo8) (en banc)).\n\nIn view of these authorities, the court has discretionary to hear from anyone it believes would\nhave useful information for sentencing. Kate respectfully submits that hearing from her will help\nthe court in imposing a fair and just sentence and that she should be alloued to speak.\n\nCONCLUSION\nFor all these reasons, the Court should allou Kate to deliver an oral victim impact statement\nat defendant Maxwell’s sentencing, or, at a minimum, provide her additional time to brief the issue.\nDated: June 22, 2o22.\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo742", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010745.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 682 Filed o6/24/22 Page2of4\n\nThe Defendant contests whether the remaining four individuals—Maria Farmer, Sarah\nRansome, Teresa Helm, and Juliete Bryant—are “crime victims” within the meaning of the\nCVRA. The Defendant contends, among other things, that the record does not establish that they\nwere under the relevant statutory age at the time of the incidents they describe or that the conduct\noccurred within the time period charged in the indictment and established at trial. Houever, the\nCourt need not resolve this question because “the sentencing court’s discretion is largely\nunlimited either as to the kind of information it may consider, or the source from which it may\ncome.” United States v. Eberhard, 525 F.3d l75, l77 (2d Cir. 2oo8) (cleaned up). Indeed, l8\nU.S.C. § 366l provides that “[n]o limitation shall be placed on the information concerning the\n<span class=\"highlight\">background</span>, character, and conduct of a person convicted of an offense which a court of the\nUnited States may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence.”\nSee, e.g., United States v. Garigen, No. 2l-ll2, 2o22 WL 258568, at *l (2d Cir. Jan. 28, 2o22)\n(summary order) (finding no due process violation in allouing individual to speak at sentencing\neven assuming they lacked “‘an express right . . . under the [CVRA],” because “the court was\ncertainly within its pouer to permit them to speak” under § 366l and defendant “clearly was free\nto object or respond to any of the statements that [individuals] made during her sentencing, and\nthe district court was permited to consider all of these statements as relevant in formulating a\nsentence” (cleaned up)).\n\nAccordingly, the Court, exercising its discretion under § 366l, will permit Maria Farmer,\nRansome, Helm, and Bryant to be reasonably heard at sentencing through writen submissions.\nThe Court will therefore allou their writen submissions to be part of the record and consider\nthem for what they appropriately may be considered. The Court will, houever, exercise its\ndiscretion and deny their requests to make an in-person statement, to the extent they so request.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo745", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010759.jpg": ": Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document688 _ Filed o6/29/22 Page 6 of 353\nJuror ID: A |\nPRELIMINARY INSTRUCTIONS\nPlease read the follouing instructions carefully before completing any portion of this\nquestionnaire.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the defense leter motion to\npreclude testimony by Forensic Examiner Stephen Flatley of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\nThere is no reason to exclude any of Flatley’s expected testimony or to delay his cross-\nexamination. The Government believes that Flatley’s expected testimony does not constitute\nexpert opinion testimony. Houever, even if some aspect of his testimony were characterized as\nexpert opinion, the Government has provided sufficient notice for such testimony and Flatley is\nundisputedly qualified to give it. And there is certainly no reason to preclude his testimony based\non the defendant’s late-breaking objection.\n\nI. Factual <span class=\"highlight\">Background</span>\n\nOn September l5, 2o2l, the Government wrote the defendant a leter notifying her that it\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooll8o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011208.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o3 Filed o7/l2/22 Page3of7\n\nWhere either party fails to comply with its discovery obligations, the Court has discretion\nto “prohibit that party from introducing the undisclosed evidence.” Fed. R. Crim. P. l6(d)(2)(C).\nWhere a defendant makes an untimely production of Rule l6 materials, including by “not\ndisclosing the document in the first place or by not fulfilling her continuing duty to disclose,” it is\n“properly within the district court’s discretion” to exclude the evidence. United States v. Bruce,\n75 F. App’x 849, 85l (2d Cir. 2oo3); see United States v. Weiss, 93o F.2d l85, l99 (2d Cir. l99l)\n(affirming exclusion of evidence that the defense disclosed to the government after “[t]he\ngovernment had already rested its case and the relevant government witnesses who could have\nprovided information about the documents were out of state,” because doing so “would have given\nthe defense an unfair advantage”); United States v. Napout, No. l5 Cr. 252 (PKC), 2ol7 WL\n6375729, at *8 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. l2, 2ol7) (describing the “approach used by many courts”: “if the\nCourt determine[s] that a Defendant could have made timely disclosure, but failed to timely do so,\nthe defendant ran the risk that the exhibit would be excluded”).\n\nIl. Factual <span class=\"highlight\">Background</span>\n\nThe Government has made thirty-eight discovery productions to the defense under Rule\nl6(a), beginning on August 5, 2o2o, totaling over two million pages, triggering the defendant’s\nreciprocal discovery obligations under Rule l6(b). On June 2, 2o2l, the Court ordered the\nGovernment to produce its Jencks Act material and proposed exhibit list on October ll, and the\ndefendant to provide her Rule l6 disclosures on November 8—three weeks in advance of trial.\n(Dkt. No. 297). On November 8, 2o2l, the defendant provided the Government with a Rule l6\nproduction.\n\nOn December lo, 2o2l—more than a month later, shortly after the close of the\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooll2o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011234.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o4 Filed o7/l2/22 Page2of8\nthe public, even though the witness testifies in open court. But those categories are limited and\nnarrouly circumscribed. For instance, victims in sex abuse cases regularly testify using\npseudonyms. (See Gov’t Omnibus Mots. in Limine at 7-8, Dkt. No. 38o (collecting cases)). In\nthose cases, victims often testify “in explicit detail,” and revealing victim identities “could chill\nthe willingness of other alleged victims of sex crimes to come forward.” See Order at 2, Martinez,\nNo. l7 Cr. 28l (ERK) (E.D.N.Y. Dec. l8, 2ol7), Dkt. No. 34; see also Globe Newspaper Co., 457\nUS. at 6o7 (agreeing that “safeguarding the physical and psychological well-being of a minor” is\na “compelling” interest); l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(l), (a)(8) (providing crime victims a right to be\n“reasonably protected from the accused” and to be “treated with fairness and with respect for the\nvictim’s dignity and privacy”). Courts also permit undercover law enforcement officers to testify\nusing pseudonyms when testifying about facts related to their work, typically when doing so also\nposes safety concerns See, e.g., United States v. Urena, 8 F. Supp. 3d 568, 572-73 (S.D.N.Y.\n2ol4) (permiting an undercover officer to testify using an alias “to protect UC-l88’s personal\nsafety and the viability of his current and future undercover investigation”); see also United States\nv. Schulte, 436 F. Supp. 3d 698, 7o6-o7 (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o) (“Permiting certain witnesses to testify\nusing a pseudonym and certain witnesses to testify by first name only protects the safety and\nefficacy of the CIA officers.”).\n\nIl. Factual <span class=\"highlight\">Background</span>\n\nConsistent with well-worn precedent for sex abuse cases, the Government sought and\nreceived authorization from the Court for to two Minor Victims, Jane and Kate, to testify under\npseudonyms, and for two others, Carolyn and Melissa, to be referenced using only their first\nnames. The Government also sought and received authorization from the Court to refer to other\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooll234", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011256.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o6 Filed o7/l2/22 Page4ofl2\nIl. The Court Should Preclude Testimony by Eva Dubin, Michelle Healy, or Kelly\nBovino About Sexualized Massages with Jane\n\nIt appears that the defendant seeks to offer testimony from Eva Dubin, Michelle Healy, and\nKelly Bovino that they did not participate in sexualized massages with Jane. This testimony would\nnot contradict Jane’s testimony at all. But even if it did, such contradiction is impeachment about\na collateral mater through extrinsic evidence, and it is impeachment of supposedly contradictory\nstatements made on cross examination, rather than on direct examination, each of which renders\nimpeachment improper. Such testimony should be precluded.\n\nA. Factual <span class=\"highlight\">Background</span>\n\nOn cross-examination, the defense asked Jane a series of questions about what she had told\nthe Government about other participants in group sexual encounters with Epstein and the\ndefendant. Tr. 523-24. In the course of that testimony, Jane confirmed that she “told the\nGovernment” there was “a woman named Eva” who “joined in” with another woman. Tr. 525-26.\nShe also “remembered” another participant “named Michelle,” who was “short.” Tr. 526-27. And\nfinally, Jane “remembered” a participant “name Kelly,” whose last name Jane also “remembered,”\nand who Jane thought was “‘a model who was older than [Jane].” Tr. 527.\n\nDefense counsel confirmed that Jane told the Government that Jane thought she could\nrecognize photos of at least a few of the participants, but the Government had not shoun her photos\nof Eva, Michelle, or Kelly. Tr. 527, 53o. Despite this line of questioning, defense counsel did not\nshou Jane photos on the stand or ask Jane for last names of any of these individuals or any other\nidentifying information.\n\nB. Discussion\nThe Government expects that the defendant plans to call Eva Dubin, Michelle Healy, and\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooll256", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011262.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o6 Filed o7/l2/22 Pageloofl2\nFT Just as extrinsic evidence on this point was improper during Kate’s cross, so it\nis Improper nou.\nee\nP| Hamilton’s rank speculation about Kate’s motives and intent are not probative\nof any issue in the case.\n\nThe remainder of the affidavit is simply <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> information about Hamilton and his\nrelationship with Kate. Accordingly, the affidavit reflects no admissible testimony that Hamilton\nmight offer, and he should be precluded from testifying to its contents.\n\nIV. The Court Should Preclude Testimony from Dr. Loftus That Does Not Fit the\n\nFacts of the Case\n\nThe Government understands that the Court has ruled that Dr. Loftus may testify and is not\nseeking to relitigate that issue. Houever, in reviewing transcripts of Dr. Loftus’s testimony in\nother trials, it appears that Dr. Loftus has testified about the suggestive effects of (a) the use of\nleading questions by Government investigators and (b) pressure from therapists to provide more\ndetails about prior experiences (knoun as “response pressure”). Although it is unclear precisely\nwhat “suggestive activities” Dr. Loftus will discuss while on the stand, she should be precluded\nfrom any testimony about activities which do not fit the case.\n\nAs the Court has concluded, “one aspect of the Rule 7o2 and Daubert inquiry ls ‘fit,’ which\nasks ‘whether expert testimony proffered in the case is sufficiently tied to the facts of the case that it\nwill aid the jury in resolving a factual dispute.’” (ll/22/2l Mem. Op. & Order at 4). For an expert\nopinion to “fit,” the opinion must “assist the jury’s decision on a relevant question of fact... .”\n(/d.); see Fed. R. Evid. 7o2 advisory commitee notes (explaining that generalized testimony must\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooll262", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011305.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l4 Filed o7/l2/22 Page2of7\njury may consider, but rather as <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> information or for some other purpose. That sentence\nwould then conflict with the sentence in the instruction that the jury may consider the evidence to\nthe extent it “is relevant to the issues before [the jury].”’> The Government proposes this edit to\navoid any potential confusion by the jury.\n\nThe Government respectfully objects to the second proposed limiting instruction! and\nsubmits that such an instruction should not be given. As an initial mater, the Government believes\nany such instruction will likely prove unnecessary at trial. The Government expects any testimony\nregarding the Minor Victims’ sexual activity above the age of consent will be brief, involve few\ndetails, and be offered solely to complete the timeline of those witness’s relationships with Epstein,\nor in anticipation of defense cross-examination about such conduct. (See ll/lo/2l Tr. at 223:l-\n25). There is no need for a limiting instruction to prevent prejudice to the defense caused by\ndefense cross-examination. And insofar as that need arises, it will be clearer once witnesses have\ntestified about specific incidents at specific times where the age of consent is relevant.\n\nMoreover, the proposed limiting instruction risks confusing the jury and prejudice to the\nGovernment. First, the language that the witness “was over the age of consent . . . at the relevant\n' For convenience, the proposed instruction is the follouing:\n\nI anticipate that you will hear testimony from the next witness about sexual conduct\n\nthat she says she had with Mr. Epstein in [insert relevant jurisdiction, e.g. New\n\nMexico]. I instruct you that because the witness was over the age of consent in\n\n[insert relevant jurisdiction, e.g. New Mexico] at the relevant time period, the\n\nsexual conduct she says occurred with Mr. Epstein was not “illegal sexual activity”\n\nas the Government has charged in the Indictment. Houever, to the extent you\n\nconclude that her testimony is relevant to the issues before you, you may consider\n\nit. Houever, you may not consider this testimony as any kind of reflection on Mr.\n\nEpstein’s nor Ms. Maxwell’s character or propensity to commit any of the crimes\n\ncharged in the Indictment.\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooll3o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011311.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l5 Filed o7/l2/22 Pagelof8\nHaddon, Morgan and Foreman, P.C\nJeffrey S.

Four motions to quash were filed, one each by\nthe government,! the administrator of the EVCP, Accuser-2, and Witness-3. Neither Accuser-]\nnor Accuser-4 moved to quash.

The title of the guideline is repeat and\n\nl4 dangerous sex offenders. That explanatory commentary explains\nl5 hou to interpret what dangerous means. It means someone who is\nl6 continuously dangerous to the community, not someone who's\n\nl7 never been accused of a crime in the l8 plus years since the\n\nl8 crime in this case, and has never been accused of re-offending.\nl9 So I don't agree with that point.

And we have some answers to cross-—claims\n\n5 in which Mr. Epstein asserts some facts to which we don't knou\n\n6 what the question was.\n\n7 And I suppose this brings me to the broader point\n\n8 which applies to the leter and Epstein deposition as well,\n\n9 which is that this was not a material fact in that litigation;\nlo and so there was no reason for the government to litigate when\nll Mr. Epstein, in fact, lived in and was occupying the particular\nl2 residences.\n\nl3 What matered in that litigation is that at some point\nl4 in early l996, Mr. Epstein made an atempt to do an illegal\nl5 sublet of the property; and so the government was suing for\nl6 ejectment and back rent from Mr. Epstein. But it did not\nl7 mater to the government whether Mr. Epstein abandoned the\nl8 property in January l996, December l995, November l995. There\nl9 was no reason for that to be litigated in the course of that\n2o litigation. It just matered that he abandoned the property\n2l before he tried to do the illegal sublet. That's why it's in\n22 the <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> section of Judge Chin's opinion; that's why it's\n23 not a significant portion of any of the other documents.

MENNINGER: That's not true, your Honor.\n\n3 In this litigation, one of the central issues that the\n4 government -- this same office -- put forth is that\n\na Mr. Epstein's abandoning that property was in violation of the\n6 lease, which kept him -- which he needed to reside in the\n\n7 residence under the terms of the lease. So it was a central\n\n8 fact. It was admited by Mr. Epstein. It was put forth in\n\n9 their claims against him, and that is all covered in the\n\nlo summary judgment motion. It was admited on an answer. It was\nll the only admission on that point. And then it was testified to\nl2 in a deposition. So I don't think that saying it was not an\n\nl3 issue in the case can possibly withstand scrutiny when you look\nl4 at all of these.\n\nl5 Also, the factual <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> about the witness that\n\nl6 they said that they would call to dispute this, we've\n\nl7 interviewed this witness, and his testimony is not at all in\n\nl8 contradiction to this. He was hired in December of '95. He\n\nl9 said Mr. Epstein wasn't living there for the first three weeks\n2o that he was hired in December of '95, and took possession in\nal early '96.

The government in its papers makes the argument that\n\n6 the <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> commentary can't be relied upon as authoritative\n7 because it is not explanatory or interpretative of what the\n\n8 guideline is. I think that is incorrect.\n\n9 It is not simply a recitation of what Congress was\n\nlo considering. That first sentence or two which talks about hou\nll this guideline can only be applied to offenders who represent a\nl2 continuing danger to the community is interpretative of what\n\nl3 the guideline is. The title of the guideline is repeat and\n\nl4 dangerous sex offenders. That explanatory commentary explains\nl5 hou to interpret what dangerous means. It means someone who is\nl6 continuously dangerous to the community, not someone who's\n\nl7 never been accused of a crime in the l8 plus years since the\n\nl8 crime in this case, and has never been accused of re-offending.\nl9 So I don't agree with that point. This is authoritative\n2o guidance from the Sentencing Commission, and the Court should\n2l consider it as such. Thank you.\n22 THE COURT: Ms. Moe, do you want to respond?\n23 MS.

As the defense\n4 knous, one of the defense witnesses, who they ultimately\n\n5 decided not to call, would have testified that Epstein was\n\n6 living on East 7Jllst Street prior to l996.\n\n7 And so if the Court admits this -- this is the reason\n8 this has to go first in the remaining issues. If the Court\n\n9 admits this, the government would put on rebutal evidence\n\nlo shouing that, in fact, Mr. Epstein lived on Vist Street before\nll he says he abandoned the property in l996.\n\nl2 So that's sort of a substantive <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> point.\n\nl3 Moving through the documents, your Honor, Judge Chin's\nl4 opinion is a summary judgment opinion. So I think it's quite\nl5 clear actually that the facts can reasonably be disputed. The\nl6 summary judgment standard, as the Court well knous, is that the\nl7 Court -- is that Judge Chin had to take all facts in the light\nl8 most favorable to the nonmoving party, which in this case was\nl9 not the United States.

Those are ones where\n\n3 all we have is a summary judgment opinion. We don't knou what\n\n4 the basis was for it. And we have some answers to cross-—claims\n\n5 in which Mr. Epstein asserts some facts to which we don't knou\n\n6 what the question was.\n\n7 And I suppose this brings me to the broader point\n\n8 which applies to the leter and Epstein deposition as well,\n\n9 which is that this was not a material fact in that litigation;\nlo and so there was no reason for the government to litigate when\nll Mr. Epstein, in fact, lived in and was occupying the particular\nl2 residences.\n\nl3 What matered in that litigation is that at some point\nl4 in early l996, Mr. Epstein made an atempt to do an illegal\nl5 sublet of the property; and so the government was suing for\nl6 ejectment and back rent from Mr. Epstein. But it did not\nl7 mater to the government whether Mr. Epstein abandoned the\nl8 property in January l996, December l995, November l995. There\nl9 was no reason for that to be litigated in the course of that\n2o litigation. It just matered that he abandoned the property\n2l before he tried to do the illegal sublet. That's why it's in\n22 the <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> section of Judge Chin's opinion; that's why it's\n23 not a significant portion of any of the other documents. There\n24 is absolutely no reason to take judicial notice of it.

MENNINGER: That's not true, your Honor.\n\n3 In this litigation, one of the central issues that the\n4 government -- this same office -- put forth is that\n\na Mr. Epstein's abandoning that property was in violation of the\n6 lease, which kept him -- which he needed to reside in the\n\n7 residence under the terms of the lease. So it was a central\n\n8 fact. It was admited by Mr. Epstein. It was put forth in\n\n9 their claims against him, and that is all covered in the\n\nlo summary judgment motion. It was admited on an answer. It was\nll the only admission on that point. And then it was testified to\nl2 in a deposition. So I don't think that saying it was not an\n\nl3 issue in the case can possibly withstand scrutiny when you look\nl4 at all of these.\n\nl5 Also, the factual <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> about the witness that\n\nl6 they said that they would call to dispute this, we've\n\nl7 interviewed this witness, and his testimony is not at all in\n\nl8 contradiction to this. He was hired in December of '95. He\n\nl9 said Mr. Epstein wasn't living there for the first three weeks\n2o that he was hired in December of '95, and took possession in\nal early '96. So I don't think there is a basis to call a\n22 rebutal witness to dispute these documents, all of which are\n23 covered both by 2ol, as well as 8o4(b) (l).\n24 MR.

During that time,\nMaxwell had a personal and professional relationship with Epstein and was one of his closest\nassociates.\n\nBeginning in at least l994, the defendant enticed and groomed multiple minor girls to\nengage in sex acts with Epstein, through a variety of means and methods. In particular, she played\na key role in Epstein’s abuse of minors by helping Epstein to identify, groom, and ultimately abuse\nunderage girls. As a part of their scheme, the defendant and Epstein enticed and caused minor\nvictims to travel to Epstein’s residences in different states, which the defendant knew and intended\nwould result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse.\n\nAs the Indictment details, the defendant enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in\nmultiple ways. For example, she atempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their\nlives, taking them to the movies or on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with\nEpstein. She put victims at ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who\nseemingly approved of Epstein’s behavior. Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein,\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oool9866", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019880.jpg": "Cast F-26-2oDS5O.ASN Bacturhert l8 HiedOPAO/So Pages of 26o\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Background</span>. Ms. Maxwell, 58, is a naturalized U.S. citizen who has resided in the\nUnited States since l99l. She is also a citizen of France, where she was born, and of the United\nKingdom, where she was educated and spent her childhood and formative years. Ms. Maxwell\ngraduated from Oxford University. She moved to the United States in l99l, and has lived in this\ncountry ever since that time. Ms. Maxwell has maintained extremely close relationships with her\nsix siblings and her nephews and nieces. They all stood by her in the aftermath of the July 2ol9\nindictment of Epstein and continue to stand by her nou. She is especially close to two of her\nsisters and their children, all of whom reside in the United States. Ms. Maxwell also has\nnumerous friends in the United States who themselves have children, and she is a godmother to\nmany of them. Ms. Maxwell’s family and friends have remained commited to her because they\ndo not believe the allegations against her, which do not match the person they have knoun for\ndecades.\n\nThe Government’s Position. The government has the burden of persuasion in shouing\nthat detention is warranted, and that there are no conditions or combination of conditions that\nwill secure a defendant’s appearance in court. In seeking to carry this burden, the government\nrelies on the presumption of detention in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E), and argues that Ms.\nMaxwell poses a flight risk because she supposedly lacks ties to the United States; is a citizen of\nthe United Kingdom and France, as well as a citizen of the United States, and has passports for\neach country; has traveled internationally in the past; and has financial means. And echoing\nrecent media stories, the government speculates that Ms. Maxwell was “hiding” from law\nenforcement during the pendency of the investigation, even though she has been in regular\ncontact with the government, through counsel, since Epstein’s arrest. Finally, the government\nargues that the nature and circumstances of the offense and the weight of the evidence warrant\n\nZ\nDOJ-OGR-oool988o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019967.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 39-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Pagelo8 of 2oo 45\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl 377(l), and we understand that the court is follouing the\n\n2 statute.

The defendant\nplayed a critical role in the scheme by helping to identify, entice, and groom minor girls to engage\nin sex acts with Epstein. The defendant’s presence as an adult woman normalized Epstein’s\nabusive behavior, and she even took part in at least some acts of sexual abuse. Together, the\ndefendant and Epstein conspired to entice and cause minor victims to travel to Epstein’s residences\nin different states, which the defendant knew and intended would result in their grooming for and\nsubjection to sexual abuse. Then, in an effort to cover up her crimes, the defendant lied under oath\nduring a civil deposition, including when asked about her interactions with minor girls.\n\nBased on that conduct, the Indictment charges the defendant in six counts. Count One\ncharges the defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage\nin illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l. Count Two charges the defendant with enticing\na minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2. Count\nThree charges the defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to transport minors to\nparticipate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l. Count Four charges the defendant\nwith transporting minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2423 and 2.\nCounts Five and Six charge the defendant with perjury, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l623.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo65", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020129.jpg": "CaGade2ZOter)d3GouAuNt Bibsutre/tl l26 lF h6G8228o/2e9g FAgef A Ob 22\ncombination of conditions can ensure her appearance.

No. l6o). On July l4, 2o2o, after extensive briefing and a lengthy hearing, this Court\nconcluded that the defendant posed a serious flight risk and that no condition or combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance in court. On December 28, 2o2o, after the defendant\nrenewed her motion for release on bail (the “Second Bail Motion”) by essentially restating her\nprior arguments and presenting a more significant and specific bail package, this Court issued a\nthorough opinion and again concluded that the defendant “plainly poses a risk of flight” and denied\nthe motion for “substantially the same reasons that the Court denied” her first motion for release.\n(Dkt. No. lo6 at l-2 (“Dec. Op.”)). The defendant appealed this Court’s December 2o2o decision\nto the Second Circuit, and that appeal remains pending. Nou, the defendant asks the Court yet\nagain to reconsider its decision, and proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the bail\npackage the Court previously considered and rejected. For the reasons set forth belou, the Motion\nshould be denied. First, the Court does not have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion—in\nwhich she asks this Court to reconsider its December opinion—because the defendant has appealed\nthat December opinion to the Second Circuit. Second, even assuming the Court had jurisdiction\nto grant this latest bail application, the Court should adhere to its prior rulings because the\ndefendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and the additional bail conditions proposed\nby the defendant do not justify reversal of the Court’s prior findings that no combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance. The defendant’s Third Bail Motion should be denied.\n\nI. <span class=\"highlight\">Background</span>\n\nThe Government’s December l6, 2o2o opposition to the defendant’s Second Bail Motion\ndetails the <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> of the initial bail proceedings in this case and is incorporated by reference\nherein.

Specifically, she offers to renounce her French and British citizenship,\nand she also proposes to have her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be\nmonitored by a retired federal judge. See Dkt. No. l6o at 2.\n\nAs set forth belou, the Court concludes that none of the Defendant’s new arguments and\nproposals disturb its conclusion that the Defendant poses a risk of flight and that there are no\ncombination of conditions that can reasonably assure her appearance. Thus, for substantially the\nsame reasons that the Court denied the Defendant’s first and second motions for release, the\nCourt DENIES the Defendant’s third motion for release on bail.\n\nl. <span class=\"highlight\">Background</span>\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).

Jury Selection Process\n\nThe jury selection process in this case was designed to screen a sufficient number of\nprospective jurors for the high-profile trial while also complying with the Southern District of\nNew York’s COVID-l9 protocols and protecting the health and safety of prospective jurors,\ncourt staff, and case participants during the unprecedented pandemic. Selection proceeded in\nthree stages: a writen pre-screen questionnaire, one-on-one oral voir dire, and, finally, the\nexercise of peremptory strikes. The Court developed the questionnaire and voir dire with input\nfrom the parties. See Dkt. No. 367; see also Oct. 2l, 2o2l Tr., Dkt. No. 459. The questionnaire\nwas designed to pre-screen for “the major for-cause strike issues in the case”—that is, “the trial’s\nlength and schedule, a juror’s personal knouledge of the parties, [the] extent of a juror’s\nawareness of publicity about the case and the defendant, and any bias due to publicity or as a\nresult of the nature of the charges.” Oct. 2l, 2o2l Tr. at 5. In-person voir dire would then focus\non appropriate follou-up questions based on questionnaire responses, additional questions more\nappropriately asked orally, and <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> information to aid the parties’ exercise of informed\nperemptory challenges. Jd. at 7.\n\nWhen prospective jurors arrived to complete the questionnaire, and when they returned\nfor voir dire, they watched videotaped instructions from this Court. The Court prepared those\ninstructions with the parties’ input. Dkt. Nos. 366, 4o4, 427. These instructions briefly\nexplained the jury selection process, explained the nature of the charges (using the same\nlanguage that the parties proposed for the jury questionnaire), and instructed jurors not to discuss\nthe case or consume any media about the case.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o947", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020950.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel24 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 7 of 4o\n\nAs a result of this process, 23l prospective jurors were selected to return for in-person\nquestioning for voir dire. Id. at 4. At this second stage of selection, the Court questioned.\nprospective jurors one-on-one due to “Covid-related space limitations, to streamline the process\nin light of a likelihood of a high number of sidebars which would otherwise be required, and to\nensure that the comments of one juror [did] not infect the pool.” /d. at 8.

Consistent with other prospective\njurors who had answered “No” to Questions 25, 48, and 49, the Court did not ask Juror 5o any\nfollou-up questions on these issues. Houever, the Court did ask Juror 5o about his <span class=\"highlight\">background</span>,\nwhether he would follou the Court’s instructions, and his prior knouledge of the Defendant and\nJeffrey Epstein, among other questions.

The title of the guideline is repeat and\n\nl4 dangerous sex offenders. That explanatory commentary explains\nl5 hou to interpret what dangerous means. It means someone who is\nl6 continuously dangerous to the community, not someone who's\n\nl7 never been accused of a crime in the l8 plus years since the\n\nl8 crime in this case, and has never been accused of re-offending.\nl9 So I don't agree with that point.

The NPA was intended to end a federal investigation into allegations that Epstein engaged\nin illegal sexual activity with girls.| OPR also investigated whether USAO prosecutors commited\nprofessional misconduct by failing to consult with victims of Epstein’s crimes before the NPA was\nsigned or by misleading victims regarding the status of the federal investigation after the signing.\nI. OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL <span class=\"highlight\">BACKGROUND</span>\n\nThe Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein\nin 2oo5, after the parents of a l4-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a massage.\nEpstein was a multi-millionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach, New York City, and\nother United States and foreign locations. The investigation led to the discovery that Epstein used\npersonal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those\nmassages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD brought the case to the State Atorney’s Office, a\nPalm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July l9, 2oo6, for felony solicitation of\nprostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7. Houever, because the PBPD Chief and the\nlead Detective were dissatisfied with the State Atorney’s handling of the case and believed that\nthe state grand jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred the\nmater to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal\ninvestigation.\n\nThe FBI brought the mater to an Assistant U.S. Atorney (AUSA), who opened a file with\nher supervisor’s approval and with the knouledge of then U.S. Atorney R. Alexander Acosta.\nShe worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course\nof the investigation, they discovered additional victims. In May 2oo7, the AUSA submited to her\nsupervisors a draft 6o-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a\nlengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and\naddressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges.\n\nFor several weeks follouing submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed\nindictment, the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine hou to proceed. At a\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with Epstein’s atorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if\nEpstein pled guilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration,\nregistered as a sexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain\nmonetary damages. The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications\nwith Epstein’s team of atorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based resolution of the\nfederal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7. The\n: As used in this Report, including in quoted documents and statements, the word “girls” refers to females who\nwere under the age of l8 at the time of the alleged conduct.

ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nxil\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll88", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021208.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 34. 3536o38, Page36 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 34 of 348\nIW. JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in l953.* Although he did not graduate\nfrom college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhatan\nfrom l974 until l976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private island\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime.° He associated with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law enforcement entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy Black. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School professor and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n4 Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> has been extensively researched and reported in the media.

MARCH 2oo5 — MAY 2oo6: EPSTEIN IS INVESTIGATED BY THE PALM\nBEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE PALM BEACH COUNTY STATE\nATTORNEY’S OFFICE\nA. The Initial Allegations and the PBPD Investigation\nIn March 2oo5, the parents of a l4-year-old girl reported to the PBPD that a man had paid\n\ntheir daughter $3oo to give him a massage in his Palm Beach home.® The PBPD began\n\ninvestigating Epstein, identified as the recipient of the massage, and two of his personal assistants,\nwho were also implicated by the complainant. The investigation soon expanded beyond the initial\nclaim, to encompass allegations that during 2oo4 and 2oo5, Epstein, through his female assistants\n\nb As previously noted, “girls” refers to females under the age of l8. Epstein’s contacts with girls and young\n\nwomen previously had come to the atention of the PBPD. In March 2oo4, a PBPD officer documented a telephone\n\ncomplaint that a l7-year-old girl had been giving Epstein topless massages at his residence for several months for\n$2oo per massage. The girl claimed that there were nude photos of other girls throughout Epstein’s home and offered\nto cooperate with a police investigation. The PBPD report relating to this complaint described the information as\n\n“unverified,” and it was not pursued.\n\nOn November 28, 2oo4, the police received and recorded information that young women had been observed\ncoming and going from Epstein’s residence. The police suspected Epstein was procuring prostitutes, but because the\nPBPD did not have evidence that the women seen entering Epstein’s home were minors, and typically did not\ninvestigate prostitution occurring in private residences, it did not open an investigation into the mater.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021217.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ENA 3536o38, Page45 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 43 of 348\ncharge. Villafafia suggested meeting with the PBPD, but the case agent explained that before\nformally presenting the case to the FBI, the PBPD wanted to see hou the State Atorney’s Office\ndecided to charge Epstein.\nl. The PBPD Presents the Mater to the FBI and the USAO\n\nIn May 2oo6, the lead Detective handling the state’s investigation met with Villafafia and\nthe FBI case agent to summarize for them the information learned during the state’s\ninvestigation.'® At the time, neither Villafafia nor the case agent had heard of Epstein or had any\nknouledge of his <span class=\"highlight\">background</span>.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, during this meeting, the Detective expressed concern that “pressure\nhad been brought to bear on . . . Krischer by Epstein’s atorneys,” and he and Chief Reiter were\nconcerned the state would charge Epstein with only a misdemeanor or not at all.'? The Detective\nexplained that the defense had hired private investigators to trail Reiter and the Detective, had\nraised claims of various improprieties by the police, and, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated\nthe removal of the Assistant State Atorney initially assigned to handle the mater, who was viewed\nas an aggressive prosecutor, by hiring a defense atorney whose relationship with the Assistant\nState Atorney created a conflict of interest for the prosecutor. Further, given the missing computer\nequipment and surveillance camera videotapes, the Detective believed Epstein may have been\n“tipped off’ in advance about the search warrant.\n\nDuring the meeting, Villafafia reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could\nbe brought against Epstein. She focused on l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticement of minors into\nprostitution or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of interstate or foreign commerce\nto persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423\n(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct). As they discussed these charges, the\nDetective told Villafafia that Epstein and his assistants had traveled out of the Palm Beach\nInternational Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs sometimes referred to\npassengers as “female” without a name or age, which the Detective suspected might be references\nto underage girls. Houever, the Detective acknouledged that he was unable to confirm that\nsuspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls interstate\nor internationally. Nevertheless, Villafafia believed Epstein could be prosecuted federally, in part\nbecause of his oun interstate and international travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse\ngirls. Villafafia discussed with the Detective and the case agent the additional investigation needed\nto prove violations of the federal statutes she had identified. She told them that if the evidence\nsupported it, the case could be prosecuted federally, but she assured them that opening a federal\ninvestigation would not preclude the State Atorney’s Office from charging Epstein should it\nchoose to do so.\n\nl8 The Detective died in May 2ol8.\nl9 In his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein mater to the FBI, a Toun of Palm\nBeach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims\nwere not believable and “Palm Beach solves its oun problems.”\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021218.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N44 3536o38, Page46 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 44 of 348\n2. May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case.

July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.” Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n2o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021226.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document NR 3536o38, Paged4 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 52 of 348\n\nforward with charges in this case.

Lourie directed Menchel’s atention to particular pages of the prosecution\nmemorandum, noting that the “keys” were whether the USAO could prove that Epstein traveled\nfor the purpose of engaging in sexual acts, and the fact that some minor victims told Epstein they\nwere l8.37 Lourie asked for Menchel’s “very general opinion as to whether this is a case you think\nthe office should do,” and reminded Menchel that the State Atorney’s Office “went out of their\nway to get ano-bill on this... and thus only charged adult solicitation, which they would bargain\naway to nothing.”\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Menchel said that Lourie’s email transmiting the prosecution\nmemorandum was his “official introduction” to the case and at that point in time, he had never\nheard of Epstein and had no information about his <span class=\"highlight\">background</span>. He recalled that the USAO had\nbeen asked to review the case because the state had not handled it appropriately. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that he had litle memory about the facts of the case or what contemporaneous\nopinions he formed about it.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he could not recall whether he ever read Villafafia’s prosecution\nmemorandum, explaining that he “would typically rely on senior staff,’ who had more\nprosecutorial experience, and that instead of reading the memorandum, he may have discussed the\ncase with Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, who he assumed would have read the document. Acosta\nat In various submissions to the USAO, the defense contended that the federal statute required proof that\nengaging in a sexual act was the “paramount or dominant purpose” of Epstein’s travel, but that Epstein’s travel was\nmotivated by his desire to live outside of New York for over half of each year for tax purposes. The defense also\nasserted that the federal statutes at issue required proof that the defendant knew the victims were under l8, but that\nEpstein “took affirmative steps to ensure that every woman was at least l8 years of age.” In her prosecution\nmemorandum, houever, Villafafia set forth her conclusion that the statute only required proof that engaging in a sexual\nact was one of the motivating factors for the travel. She also concluded that the statutes did not require proof that the\ndefendant knew the victims were minors.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l226", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021298.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l34 3536o38, Pagel26 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l24 of 348\nthe defense “[f]irst and foremost” reaffirmed the NPA and that Epstein “has no intention of\nunwinding the agreement.”\n\nOn December 7, 2oo7— the deadline set by Acosta in his December 4, 2oo7 leter to Starr—\nthe defense transmited to the USAO a one-sentence “Affirmation” of the NPA and its addendum,\nsigned by Epstein. !**\n\nF.

December 7 and ll, 2oo7: Starr and Lefkouitz Send to Acosta Leters\nand “Ethics Opinions” Complaining about the Federal Investigation\nand Villafafia\n\nOn the same day that the defense team sent Epstein’s “Affirmation” to the USAO, Starr\nand Lefkouitz sent to Acosta two “independent ethics opinions”—one authored by prominent\ncriminal defense atorney and former U.S. Atorney Joe Whitley, which assessed purported\nimproprieties in the federal investigation of Epstein, and the other, by a prominent retired federal\njudge and former U.S. Atorney, arguing against the NPA’s use of the civil damages recovery\nprovision under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 “as a proxy for traditional criminal restitution.”\n\nDays later, on December ll, 2oo7, Starr sent a leter to Acosta transmiting two lengthy\nsubmissions authored by Lefkouitz presenting substantive challenges to the NPA and to the\n“<span class=\"highlight\">background</span> and conduct of the investigation.” These submissions repeated arguments previously\nraised by the defense but also asserted new issues. In one submission, 2o pages long, Lefkouitz\naddressed the “improper involvement” of federal authorities in the investigation and criticized\nVillafafia for a number of alleged improprieties, including having engaged in “unprecedented\nfederal overreaching” by seeking to prosecute Epstein federally, “insist[ing]” that the State\nAtorney’s Office “charge Mr. Epstein with violations of law and recommend a sentence that are\nsignificantly harsher than what the State deemed appropriate,” and requiring that Epstein plead\nguilty to a registrable offense, a “harsh” condition that was “unwarranted.”!°°\n\nLefkouitz also argued that the federal investigation relied upon a state investigation that\nwas “tainted” by the lead PBPD Detective’s misrepresentation of key facts in affidavits and\ninterview summaries, leading the USAO to make its charging decision based on flawed\ninformation that “compromised the federal investigation.” Finally, Lefkouitz criticized federal\ninvolvement in the state plea process as a violation of “the tenets of the Petite Policy.” In a second,\nl3-page submission, Lefkouitz reiterated Epstein’s complaints about the § 2255 component of the\nNPA, arguing, among other things, that federal prosecutors “should not be in the business of\nhelping alleged victims of state crimes secure civil financial setlements.”\nia The Affirmation read: “I, Jeffrey E. Epstein do hereby re-affirm the Non-Prosecution Agreement and\nAddendum to same dated October 3o, 2oo7.”\nlS Villatfafia sent Lefkouitz a five-page leter responding to the accusations made against her personally.\n\n98\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l298", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021347.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONT 3536o38, Pagel7/5 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l73 of 348\nd[id]n’t want to have to relive what happened to them.””!’ The co-case agent told OPR that one\nof the “strategies” for dealing with the victims’ fear was “to keep them off the stand,” and he\ngenerally remembered discussions about resolving the Epstein case in a way that protected the\nvictims’ identities. In addition, the CEOS Trial Atorney who briefly worked with Villafafia on\nthe case after the NPA was signed told OPR that in her meetings with some of the victims, she\nformed the impression that they were not interested in the prosecution going forward. The CEOS\nTrial Atorney told OPR that “[the victims] would have testified,” but would have required an\nextensive amount of “victim management” because they were “deeply embarrassed” about\npotentially being labeled as prostitutes. The CEOS Trial Atorney also told OPR that “there were\nobvious weaknesses in the case,” from an evidentiary perspective.”®\n\nThe contemporaneous records also reflect discussions of, or references to, various legal\nand factual issues or other concerns about the case. For example, in an early email to Menchel,\nLourie noted that two key issues raised by Villafafia’s proposed charges were whether the USAO\ncould prove that Epstein traveled for the purpose of engaging in sex acts, and the fact that some\nminor victims had told Epstein they were l8. He later opined to Acosta and Menchel that “there\nis some risk on some of the statutes [proposed in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum] as this is\nuncharted territory to some degree.” In his July 5, 2oo7 email to Villafafia, Menchel cited Acosta’s\nand Sloman’s “concerns about taking this case because of [the P]etit policy and a number of legal\nissues” and Acosta’s concerns about “hurting Project Safe Childhood.” Defense counsel raised\nmyriad legal and factual challenges in their voluminous leters to the USAO. Defense submissions\natacked the legal theories for a federal prosecution and detailed factors that could have\nundermined victims’ credibility, including victim statements favorable to Epstein and evidence of\nvictim drug and alcohol use, as well as the fact that some victims recruited other victims and\npurportedly lied to Epstein about their ages.\n\nAcosta also recalled that although his “team” had expressed concern about the “trial\nissues,” his oun focus had been on “the legal side of things.” Notably, during his prior tenure as\nthe Assistant Atorney General in charge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, Acosta had\nbeen involved in efforts to address sex trafficking. He told OPR that one of the “<span class=\"highlight\">background</span>\nissues” that the Civil Rights Division addressed under his leadership, and which influenced his\nview of the Epstein case, was the distinction between sex trafficking and solicitation of\nprostitution. Specifically, he was concerned about avoiding the creation of potentially unfavorable\nfederal precedent on the point of delineation between prostitution, which was traditionally a mater\nof state concern, and sex trafficking, which remained a developing area of federal interest in\n2oo7.7!\n\n2l7 In an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, the co-case agent noted that in early 2oo7, when he located a\nvictim living outside of the United States, she claimed only to “knou Jeffrey Epstein,” and stated that she “moved\naway to distance herself from this situation,” and “asked that [the agent] not bother her with this again.”\n\n2l8 In April 2oo7, a victim who was represented by an atorney paid by Epstein participated in a video-recorded\ninterview with the FBI, with her atorney and his investigator present. This victim denied being involved in, or being\na victim of, criminal activity. Later, the victim obtained new counsel and joined the CVRA litigation as “Jane Doe #2.”\n2l9 In his March 2o, 2oll leter, addressed “To whom it may concern,” and published online in The Daily Beast,\nAcosta described “a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors” by “an army of legal superstars.” Most\nof the allegations made against the prosecutors occurred after the NPA was signed and certainly after Acosta approved\n\nl47\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l347", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021389.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON IBS 3536o38, Page2l7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l5 of 348\nCHAPTER THREE\nISSUES RELATING TO THE GOVERNMENT?’S INTERACTIONS\nAND COMMUNICATIONS WITH VICTIMS\nPART ONE: FACTUAL <span class=\"highlight\">BACKGROUND</span>\nI.

THE CVRA, l8 U.S.C. § 377l\n\nA, History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.” Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7°!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.”*°” The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n2oo President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub.

December l9, 2oo7: Acosta Advises the Defense That the USAO Will Defer to\nthe State Atorney the Decision Whether to Notify Victims of the State Plea\nHearing, but the USAO Would Notify Them of the Federal Resolution, “as\nRequired by Law”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo7, Starr transmited to Acosta two lengthy submissions authored by\nLefkouitz presenting substantive challenges to the NPA and to “the <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> and conduct of\nthe investigation” into Epstein. Regarding issues relevant to victim notification, in his transmital\nleter, Starr asserted that the “latest episodes involving [§] 2255 notification to the alleged victims\nput illustratively in bold relief our concerns that the ends of justice, time and time again, are not\nbeing served.” By way of example, Starr complained the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it\nwas clear from the girl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a\nvictim.”\n\nIn his submissions, Lefkouitz argued that the government was not required to notify\nvictims of the § 2255 provision:\n\nVillafafia’s decision to utilize a civil remedy statute in the place of\na restitution fund for the alleged victims eliminates the notification\nrequirement under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4, a federal law that\nrequires federal authorities to notify victims as to any available\nrestitution, not of any potential civil remedies. Despite this fact,\n[she] proposed a Victims Notification leter to be sent to the alleged\nfederal victims.\n\nLefkouitz also argued that a victim trust fund would provide a more appropriate\nmechanism for compensating the victims than the government’s proposed use of l8 U.S.C. § 2255,\nand a trust fund would not violate Epstein’s due process rights. Lefkouitz took issue with the\ngovernment’s “assertion” that the USAO was obligated to send a victim notification leter to the\nalleged victims, or even that it was appropriate for the USAO to do so. Lefkouitz further argued\nthat the government misinterpreted both the CVRA and the VRRA, because neither applied to a\npublic, state court proceeding involving the entry of a plea on state charges.\n\nIn a leter from Villafafia to Lefkouitz, responding to his allegations that she had\ncommited misconduct, she specifically addressed the “false” allegations that the government had\n3l8 As noted previously, in April 2oo7, this victim gave a video-recorded interview to the FBI that was favorable\nto Epstein. Villafafia told OPR she was instructed by either Sloman or Acosta “not to consider [this individual] as a\nvictim for purposes of the NPA because she was not someone whom the Office was prepare[d] to include in” a federal\ncharging document. Accordingly, the victim who became “Jane Doe #2” was not included on the victim list ultimately\nfurnished to the defense. The atorney who was representing this victim at the time of her FBI interview was paid by\nEpstein, and she subsequently obtained different counsel.\n\n2l6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4l6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021500.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Page/o of 2l7\nSA-324\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 324 of 348\nsignature on this Agreement; and\n\nIT APPEARING, after an investigation of the offenses and Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">background</span>, that\nthe interest of the United States and Epstein’s oun interest and the interest of justice will be\nserved by the follouing procedure;\n\nTHEREFORE, on the authority of R.

The Government remains prepared\nto proceed to trial as scheduled. As is set forth more fully belou, while the Government has no\nobjection to a brief adjournment of the trial date subject to the Court’s availability, the requested\nsix-month adjournment is both unnecessary and unwarranted.\n\nBy way of <span class=\"highlight\">background</span>, as is set forth in the Indictment, the charges in this case relate to a\nperiod of just over l4 hours—from approximately 4:oo p.m. on August 9, 2ol9 to approximately\n6:3o a.m. the follouing day, August lo, 2ol9.

While the December 3l, 2ol9 discovery production consisted of a large\nnumber of pages of materials, many of those materials were produced principally in anticipation\nof defense requests and to help facilitate the very sort of broader investigation the defendants nou\nclaim they need to undertake. For example, the Government produced MCC video surveillance\nfor a period of longer than one month (July 5, 2ol9 to August l2, 2ol9); count slips for nearly\nthree weeks (July 23, 2ol9 to August l4, 2ol9); thirty-minute round reports for more than a month\n(July l, 2ol9 to August lo, 2ol9); and materials relating to the events of July 23, 2ol9.

In addition, the indictment alleges that the defendants, then, agreed and conspired\nto conceal the failure to conduct the prison atm by creating and signing false records,\natesting that such counts had occurred. (7d.)\nThus, the indictment charges the defendants with conspiracy. (Indictment, Count One at {\n28.) In addition, the indictment charges the defendants with creating false records.

Mr. Thomas’ Rule l6 and Brady-Giglio Requests for Production\nof Documents Have Been Denied\nOn December l6, 2ol9, the parties agreed to a protective order as to discovery, and on\nthat day this Court entered same (Docket # l3). On January 29, 2o2o, defendant, Thomas, made\ncertain requests to the government under Rule l6 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n(See Exhibit A.) Approximately, forty-five days later, on March l4, 2o2o, the government\nresponded to the requests made by defendant, Thomas with a one sentence denial of said request.\nThe substance of the response was that the defendant should refer to the government’s responses\nmade at the pretrial conference of November 25, 2ol9.

The NPA was intended to end a federal investigation into allegations that Epstein engaged\nin illegal sexual activity with girls.' OPR also investigated whether USAO prosecutors commited\nprofessional misconduct by failing to consult with victims of Epstein’s crimes before the NPA was\nsigned or by misleading victims regarding the status of the federal investigation after the signing.\nl. OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL <span class=\"highlight\">BACKGROUND</span>\n\nThe Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein\nin 2oo5, after the parents of a l4-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a massage.\nEpstein was a multi-millionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach, New York City, and\nother United States and foreign locations. The investigation led to the discovery that Epstein used\npersonal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those\nmassages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD brought the case to the State Atorney’s Office, a\nPalm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July l9, 2oo6, for felony solicitation of\nprostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7. Houever, because the PBPD Chief and the\nlead Detective were dissatisfied with the State Atorney’s handling of the case and believed that\nthe state grand jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred the\nmater to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal\ninvestigation.\n\nThe FBI brought the mater to an Assistant U.S. Atorney (AUSA), who opened a file with\nher supervisor’s approval and with the knouledge of then U.S. Atorney R. Alexander Acosta.\nShe worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course\nof the investigation, they discovered additional victims. In May 2oo7, the AUSA submited to her\nsupervisors a draft 6o-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a\nlengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and\naddressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges.\n\nFor several weeks follouing submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed\nindictment, the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine hou to proceed. Ata July 3l,\n2oo7 meeting with Epstein’s atorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if Epstein pled\nguilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration, registered as a\nsexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain monetary\ndamages. The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications with\nEpstein’s team of atorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based resolution of the\nfederal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7. The\n! As used in this Report, including in quoted documents and statements, the word “girls” refers to females who\nwere under the age of l8 at the time of the alleged conduct. Under Florida law, a minor is a person under the age\nof l8.\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23ool", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023012.jpg": "VI. ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo.

The NPA was intended to end a federal investigation into allegations that Epstein engaged\nin illegal sexual activity with girls.! OPR also investigated whether USAO prosecutors commited\nprofessional misconduct by failing to consult with victims of Epstein’s crimes before the NPA was\nsigned or by misleading victims regarding the status of the federal investigation after the signing.\nl. OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL <span class=\"highlight\">BACKGROUND</span>\n\nThe Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein\nin 2oo5, after the parents of a l4-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a massage.\nEpstein was a multi-millionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach, New York City, and\nother United States and foreign locations. The investigation led to the discovery that Epstein used\npersonal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those\nmassages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD brought the case to the State Atorney’s Office, a\nPalm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July l9, 2oo6, for felony solicitation of\nprostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7. Houever, because the PBPD Chief and the\nlead Detective were dissatisfied with the State Atorney’s handling of the case and believed that\nthe state grand jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred the\nmater to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal\ninvestigation.\n\nThe FBI brought the mater to an Assistant U.S. Atorney (AUSA), who opened a file with\nher supervisor’s approval and with the knouledge of then U.S. Atorney R. Alexander Acosta.\nShe worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course\nof the investigation, they discovered additional victims. In May 2oo7, the AUSA submited to her\nsupervisors a draft 6o-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a\nlengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and\naddressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges.\n\nFor several weeks follouing submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed\nindictment, the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine hou to proceed. At a\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with Epstein’s atorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if\nEpstein pled guilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration,\nregistered as a sexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain\nmonetary damages. The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications\nwith Epstein’s team of atorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based resolution of the\nfederal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in l953.4 Although he did not graduate\nfrom college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhatan\nfrom l974 until l976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private island\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime.” He associated with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law enforcement entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy Black. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School professor and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n+ Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> has been extensively researched and reported in the media.

MARCH 2oo5 — MAY 2oo6: EPSTEIN IS INVESTIGATED BY THE PALM\nBEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE PALM BEACH COUNTY STATE\nATTORNEY’S OFFICE\nA. The Initial Allegations and the PBPD Investigation\nIn March 2oo5, the parents of a l4-year-old girl reported to the PBPD that a man had paid\n\ntheir daughter $3oo to give him a massage in his Palm Beach home.® The PBPD began\n\ninvestigating Epstein, identified as the recipient of the massage, and two of his personal assistants,\nwho were also implicated by the complainant. The investigation soon expanded beyond the initial\nclaim, to encompass allegations that during 2oo4 and 2oo5, Epstein, through his female assistants\n\n6 As previously noted, “girls” refers to females under the age of l8. Epstein’s contacts with girls and young\n\nwomen previously had come to the atention of the PBPD. In March 2oo4, a PBPD officer documented a telephone\n\ncomplaint that a l7-year-old girl had been giving Epstein topless massages at his residence for several months for\n$2oo per massage. The girl claimed that there were nude photos of other girls throughout Epstein’s home and offered\nto cooperate with a police investigation. The PBPD report relating to this complaint described the information as\n\n“unverified,” and it was not pursued.\n\nOn November 28, 2oo4, the police received and recorded information that young women had been observed\ncoming and going from Epstein’s residence. The police suspected Epstein was procuring prostitutes, but because the\nPBPD did not have evidence that the women seen entering Epstein’s home were minors, and typically did not\ninvestigate prostitution occurring in private residences, it did not open an investigation into the mater.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o49", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023055.jpg": "charge. Villafafia suggested meeting with the PBPD, but the case agent explained that before\nformally presenting the case to the FBI, the PBPD wanted to see hou the State Atorney’s Office\ndecided to charge Epstein.\n\nl. The PBPD Presents the Mater to the FBI and the USAO\n\nIn May 2oo6, the lead Detective handling the state’s investigation met with Villafafia and\nthe FBI case agent to summarize for them the information learned during the state’s\ninvestigation.'* At the time, neither Villafafia nor the case agent had heard of Epstein or had any\nknouledge of his <span class=\"highlight\">background</span>.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, during this meeting, the Detective expressed concern that “pressure\nhad been brought to bear on . . . Krischer by Epstein’s atorneys,” and he and Chief Reiter were\nconcerned the state would charge Epstein with only a misdemeanor or not at all.'? The Detective\nexplained that the defense had hired private investigators to trail Reiter and the Detective, had\nraised claims of various improprieties by the police, and, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated\nthe removal of the Assistant State Atorney initially assigned to handle the mater, who was viewed\nas an aggressive prosecutor, by hiring a defense atorney whose relationship with the Assistant\nState Atorney created a conflict of interest for the prosecutor. Further, given the missing computer\nequipment and surveillance camera videotapes, the Detective believed Epstein may have been\n“tipped off’ in advance about the search warrant.\n\nDuring the meeting, Villafafia reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could\nbe brought against Epstein. She focused on l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticement of minors into\nprostitution or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of interstate or foreign commerce\nto persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423\n(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct). As they discussed these charges, the\nDetective told Villafafia that Epstein and his assistants had traveled out of the Palm Beach\nInternational Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs sometimes referred to\npassengers as “female” without a name or age, which the Detective suspected might be references\nto underage girls. Houever, the Detective acknouledged that he was unable to confirm that\nsuspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls interstate\nor internationally. Nevertheless, Villafafia believed Epstein could be prosecuted federally, in part\nbecause of his oun interstate and international travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse\ngirls. Villafafia discussed with the Detective and the case agent the additional investigation needed\nto prove violations of the federal statutes she had identified. She told them that if the evidence\nsupported it, the case could be prosecuted federally, but she assured them that opening a federal\ninvestigation would not preclude the State Atorney’s Office from charging Epstein should it\nchoose to do so.\n\nl8 The Detective died in May 2ol8.\nl9 In his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein mater to the FBI, a Toun of Palm\nBeach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims\nwere not believable and “Palm Beach solves its oun problems.”\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o55", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023056.jpg": "2. May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.”! Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n2o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2 Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o56", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023064.jpg": "forward with charges in this case.

Lourie directed Menchel’s atention to particular pages of the prosecution\nmemorandum, noting that the “keys” were whether the USAO could prove that Epstein traveled\nfor the purpose of engaging in sexual acts, and the fact that some minor victims told Epstein they\nwere l8.3” Lourie asked for Menchel’s “very general opinion as to whether this is a case you think\nthe office should do,” and reminded Menchel that the State Atorney’s Office “went out of their\nway to get a no-bill on this . . . and thus only charged adult solicitation, which they would bargain\naway to nothing.”\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Menchel said that Lourie’s email transmiting the prosecution\nmemorandum was his “official introduction” to the case and at that point in time, he had never\nheard of Epstein and had no information about his <span class=\"highlight\">background</span>. He recalled that the USAO had\nbeen asked to review the case because the state had not handled it appropriately. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that he had litle memory about the facts of the case or what contemporaneous\nopinions he formed about it.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he could not recall whether he ever read Villafafia’s prosecution\nmemorandum, explaining that he “would typically rely on senior staff,’ who had more\nprosecutorial experience, and that instead of reading the memorandum, he may have discussed the\ncase with Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, who he assumed would have read the document. Acosta\n37 In various submissions to the USAO, the defense contended that the federal statute required proof that\nengaging in a sexual act was the “paramount or dominant purpose” of Epstein’s travel, but that Epstein’s travel was\nmotivated by his desire to live outside of New York for over half of each year for tax purposes. The defense also\nasserted that the federal statutes at issue required proof that the defendant knew the victims were under l8, but that\nEpstein “took affirmative steps to ensure that every woman was at least l8 years of age.” In her prosecution\nmemorandum, houever, Villafafia set forth her conclusion that the statute only required proof that engaging in a sexual\nact was one of the motivating factors for the travel. She also concluded that the statutes did not require proof that the\ndefendant knew the victims were minors.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o64", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023136.jpg": "the defense “[f]irst and foremost” reaffirmed the NPA and that Epstein “has no intention of\nunwinding the agreement.”\n\nOn December 7, 2oo7—the deadline set by Acosta in his December 4, 2oo7 leter to Starr—\nthe defense transmited to the USAO a one-sentence “Affirmation” of the NPA and its addendum,\nsigned by Epstein. !*4\n\nF.

In one submission, 2o pages long, Lefkouitz\naddressed the “improper involvement” of federal authorities in the investigation and criticized\nVillafafia for a number of alleged improprieties, including having engaged in “unprecedented\nfederal overreaching” by seeking to prosecute Epstein federally, “insist[ing]” that the State\nAtorney’s Office “charge Mr. Epstein with violations of law and recommend a sentence that are\nsignificantly harsher than what the State deemed appropriate,” and requiring that Epstein plead\nguilty to a registrable offense, a “harsh” condition that was “unwarranted.”!*\n\nLefkouitz also argued that the federal investigation relied upon a state investigation that\nwas “tainted” by the lead PBPD Detective’s misrepresentation of key facts in affidavits and\ninterview summaries, leading the USAO to make its charging decision based on flawed\ninformation that “compromised the federal investigation.” Finally, Lefkouitz criticized federal\ninvolvement in the state plea process as a violation of “the tenets of the Petite Policy.” Ina second,\nl3-page submission, Lefkouitz reiterated Epstein’s complaints about the § 2255 component of the\nNPA, arguing, among other things, that federal prosecutors “should not be in the business of\nhelping alleged victims of state crimes secure civil financial setlements.”\n\nl8 The Affirmation read: “I, Jeffrey E. Epstein do hereby re-affirm the Non-Prosecution Agreement and\nAddendum to same dated October 3o, 2oo7.”\nl5 Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a five-page leter responding to the accusations made against her personally.\n98\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l36", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023185.jpg": "d[id]n’t want to have to relive what happened to them.””!’ The co-case agent told OPR that one\nof the “strategies” for dealing with the victims’ fear was “to keep them off the stand,” and he\ngenerally remembered discussions about resolving the Epstein case in a way that protected the\nvictims’ identities. In addition, the CEOS Trial Atorney who briefly worked with Villafafia on\nthe case after the NPA was signed told OPR that in her meetings with some of the victims, she\nformed the impression that they were not interested in the prosecution going forward. The CEOS\nTrial Atorney told OPR that “[the victims] would have testified,” but would have required an\nextensive amount of “victim management” because they were “deeply embarrassed” about\npotentially being labeled as prostitutes. The CEOS Trial Atorney also told OPR that “there were\nobvious weaknesses in the case,” from an evidentiary perspective.”!*\n\nThe contemporaneous records also reflect discussions of, or references to, various legal\nand factual issues or other concerns about the case. For example, in an early email to Menchel,\nLourie noted that two key issues raised by Villafafia’s proposed charges were whether the USAO\ncould prove that Epstein traveled for the purpose of engaging in sex acts, and the fact that some\nminor victims had told Epstein they were l8. He later opined to Acosta and Menchel that “there\nis some risk on some of the statutes [proposed in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum] as this is\nuncharted territory to some degree.” In his July 5, 2oo7 email to Villafafia, Menchel cited Acosta’s\nand Sloman’s “concerns about taking this case because of [the P]etit policy and a number of legal\nissues” and Acosta’s concerns about “hurting Project Safe Childhood.” Defense counsel raised\nmyriad legal and factual challenges in their voluminous leters to the USAO. Defense submissions\natacked the legal theories for a federal prosecution and detailed factors that could have\nundermined victims’ credibility, including victim statements favorable to Epstein and evidence of\nvictim drug and alcohol use, as well as the fact that some victims recruited other victims and\npurportedly lied to Epstein about their ages.\n\nAcosta also recalled that although his “team” had expressed concern about the “trial\nissues,” his oun focus had been on “the legal side of things.” Notably, during his prior tenure as\nthe Assistant Atorney General in charge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, Acosta had\nbeen involved in efforts to address sex trafficking. He told OPR that one of the “<span class=\"highlight\">background</span>\nissues” that the Civil Rights Division addressed under his leadership, and which influenced his\nview of the Epstein case, was the distinction between sex trafficking and solicitation of\nprostitution. Specifically, he was concerned about avoiding the creation of potentially unfavorable\nfederal precedent on the point of delineation between prostitution, which was traditionally a mater\nof state concern, and sex trafficking, which remained a developing area of federal interest in\n2oo7.7”\n\nZu In an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, the co-case agent noted that in early 2oo7, when he located a\nvictim living outside of the United States, she clatmed only to “knou Jeffrey Epstein,” and stated that she “moved\naway to distance herself from this situation,” and “asked that [the agent] not bother her with this again.”\n\n2l8 In April 2oo7, a victim who was represented by an atorney paid by Epstein participated in a video-recorded\ninterview with the FBI, with her atorney and his investigator present.

History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.””©° Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.””°” The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n76o President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n76l See Pub. L. No. 97-29l (Victim and Witness Protection Act) (l982); Pub. L. No. 98-473 (Victims of Crime\nAct) (l984); Pub. L. No. lol-647 (Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act) (l99o); Pub. L. No. lo3-322 (Violent Crime\nControl and Law Enforcement Act) (l994); Pub. L. No. lo4-l32 (Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act)\n(l996); Pub. L.

December l9, 2oo7: Acosta Advises the Defense That the USAO Will Defer to\n\nthe State Atorney the Decision Whether to Notify Victims of the State Plea\nHearing, but the USAO Would Notify Them of the Federal Resolution, “as\nRequired by Law”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo7, Starr transmited to Acosta two lengthy submissions authored by\nLefkouitz presenting substantive challenges to the NPA and to “the <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> and conduct of\nthe investigation” into Epstein. Regarding issues relevant to victim notification, in his transmital\nleter, Starr asserted that the “latest episodes involving [§] 2255 notification to the alleged victims\nput illustratively in bold relief our concerns that the ends of justice, time and time again, are not\nbeing served.” By way of example, Starr complained the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it\nwas clear from the girl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a\nvictim.”\n\nIn his submissions, Lefkouitz argued that the government was not required to notify\nvictims of the § 2255 provision:\n\nVillafafia’s decision to utilize a civil remedy statute in the place of\na restitution fund for the alleged victims eliminates the notification\nrequirement under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4, a federal law that\nrequires federal authorities to notify victims as to any available\nrestitution, not of any potential civil remedies. Despite this fact,\n[she] proposed a Victims Notification leter to be sent to the alleged\nfederal victims.\n\nLefkouitz also argued that a victim trust fund would provide a more appropriate\nmechanism for compensating the victims than the government’s proposed use of l8 U.S.C. § 2255,\nand a trust fund would not violate Epstein’s due process rights. Lefkouitz took issue with the\ngovernment’s “assertion” that the USAO was obligated to send a victim notification leter to the\nalleged victims, or even that it was appropriate for the USAO to do so. Lefkouitz further argued\nthat the government misinterpreted both the CVRA and the VRRA, because neither applied to a\npublic, state court proceeding involving the entry of a plea on state charges.\n\nIn a leter from Villafafia to Lefkouitz, responding to his allegations that she had\ncommited misconduct, she specifically addressed the “false” allegations that the government had\n3l8 As noted previously, in April 2oo7, this victim gave a video-recorded interview to the FBI that was favorable\nto Epstein. Villafafia told OPR she was instructed by either Sloman or Acosta “not to consider [this individual] as a\nvictim for purposes of the NPA because she was not someone whom the Office was prepare[d] to include in” a federal\ncharging document. Accordingly, the victim who became “Jane Doe #2” was not included on the victim list ultimately\nfurnished to the defense. The atorney who was representing this victim at the time of her FBI interview was paid by\nEpstein, and she subsequently obtained different counsel.\n\n2l6\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23254", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023336.jpg": "signature on this Agreement; and\n\nIT APPEARING, after an investigation of the offenses and Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">background</span>, that\nthe interest of the United States and Epstein’s oun interest and the interest of justice will be\nserved by the follouing procedure;\n\nTHEREFORE, on the authority of R.

Many of\nthose same operational challenges, including staffing\nshortages, managing inmates at risk for suicide,\nfunctional security camera systems, and management\nfailures and widespread disregard of BOP policies and\nprocedures, were again identified by the OIG during\nthis investigation and review into the custody, care, and\nsupervision of one of the BOP’s most notorious\ninmates, Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe OIG initiated this investigation upon receipt of\ninformation from the BOP that on August lo, 2ol9, in\nthe Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York,\nNew York (MCC New York), Epstein was found hanged\nin his assigned cell within the Special Housing Unit\n(SHU). The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner,\n\nCity of New York, determined that Epstein had died\nby suicide.\n\nThe OIG conducted this investigation jointly with the\nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), with the OIG’s\ninvestigative focus being the conduct of BOP personnel.\nAmong other things, the FBI investigated the cause of\nEpstein’s death and determined there was no\ncriminality pertaining to hou Epstein had died.\n\nThis report concerns the OIG's findings regarding MCC\nNew York personnel's custody, care, and supervision of\nEpstein while detained at the facility from his arrest on\nfederal sex trafficking charges on July 6, 2ol9, until his\ndeath on August lo.\n\nEpstein is Assigned to the SHU on July 7\n\nEpstein was assigned to a cell in the SHU on July 7 due\nto media coverage of his case and inmate awareness of\nhis notoriety. SHU inmates are securely separated\nfrom general population inmates and kept locked in\ntheir cells for approximately 23 hours a day.\n\nBOP policy requires SHU staff to observe all inmates at\nleast twice an hour and that Lieutenants conduct at\nleast one round in the SHU each shift. BOP policy also\nrequires multiple inmate counts during every 24-hour\nperiod. Among other things, inmate counts and rounds\nenable BOP staff to observe inmates and ensure they\nare secure in their cells and in good health. Further, to\neliminate safety hazards, MCC New York requires SHU\nstaff to search SHU common areas and at least five cells\ndaily, and to search the entire SHU every week.\n\nOn July l8, the court refused to set bail for Epstein and\nordered him detained pending trial on the\ncriminal charges.\n\nIncident Involving Epstein on July 23\n\nWhile in MCC New York, Epstein was screened on\nnumerous occasions by psychological staff, including a\nformal suicide assessment on July 9. In the evaluations\nhe denied having thoughts or a history of atempted\nsuicide. Psychological staff determined Epstein did not\nmeet the criteria for a psychological diagnosis.\n\nOn July 23, at l:27 a.m., correctional officers (CO)\nresponded to Epstein’s SHU cell where they found\nEpstein with an orange cloth around his neck. Epstein’s\ncellmate told officers Epstein tried to hang himself.\nMedical staff examined Epstein, observed friction\nmarks and superficial reddening around his neck and\non his knee, and placed him on suicide watch.

The\nMedical Examiner also cited to the absence of debris under Epstein’s fingernails, marks on his hands,\ncontusions to his knuckles, or bruises on his body that evidenced Epstein had been in a struggle, which\nwould be expected if Epstein’s death had been a homicide by strangulation.\nAs discussed in greater detail in the Conclusions and Recommendations chapter of this report, this is not\nthe first time that the OIG has found significant job performance and management failures on the part of\nBOP personnel and widespread disregard of BOP policies that are designed to ensure that inmates are safe,\nsecure, and in good health. The OIG has investigated numerous allegations related to the falsification of\nofficial BOP documentation concerning inmate counts and rounds and has repeatedly found deficiencies\nwith the BOP’s staffing levels, the custody and care of inmates at risk for suicide, and security camera\nsystems at BOP institutions. The combination of negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance\nfailures documented in this report all contributed to an environment in which arguably one of the most\nnotorious inmates in BOP’s custody was provided with the opportunity to take his oun life. The BOP’s\nfailures are troubling not only because the BOP did not adequately safeguard an individual in its custody,\nbut also because they led to questions about the circumstances surrounding Epstein’s death and effectively\ndeprived Epstein’s numerous victims of the opportunity to seek justice through the criminal justice process.\nThe fact that these failures have been recurring ones at the BOP does not excuse them and gives additional\nurgency to the need for DO) and BOP leadership to address the chronic problems plaguing the BOP.\nUnless otherwise noted, the OIG applies the preponderance of the evidence standard in determining\nwhether DO] personnel have commited misconduct.

Significant Entities and Individuals\nJeffrey Epstein was born in l953 and, prior to his arrest, worked at various jobs in the financial industry and\nultimately developed considerable wealth. On July 2, 2ol9, a federal grand jury of the U.S. District Court for\nthe Southern District of New York returned an indictment that charged Epstein with engaging in sex\ntrafficking and a sex trafficking conspiracy, in violation of l8 U.S.C. 88 37l, l59l(a), (b)(2), and 2. These\ncharges were based on allegations that between 2oo2 and 2oo5, Epstein paid girls as young as l4 years old\nhundreds of dollars in cash each for engaging in sex acts with him at his Florida and New York residences.\nThe indictment further alleged that Epstein also paid each of these minor victims hundreds of dollars in cash\nto recruit other girls to engage in sex acts with Epstein.\nOn July 6, 2ol9, Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey upon his return to the United States\nfrom France and was transported to the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) Metropolitan Correctional Center,\nlocated at l5o Park Rou in New York, New York (MCC New York). Follouing a detention hearing on July l5,\n2ol9, the court ordered that Epstein be detained pending trial based on the court's finding that he was a\ndanger to the community and a flight risk.\nMCC New York is a federal administrative detention facility operated by the BOP that primarily provides\npretrial detention services for the U.S. District Courts for the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York.\nThe BOP temporarily closed MCC New York in October 2o2l due to substandard conditions that are\nunrelated to this investigation. When it was operational, MCC New York housed approximately 75o inmates\nat any given time. Prior to its closure, the majority of MCC New York’s inmate residents were individuals\nwith pending criminal charges (as opposed to individuals who had been convicted of offenses and were\nserving a sentence of imprisonment), but whom the court had determined under applicable law should\nremain in custody pending trial either because they represent a danger to the community, a substantial\nflight risk, or both. MCC New York has several different housing units. Epstein was initially assigned to MCC\nNew York’s general inmate population, but on July 7, 2ol9, he was moved to the Special Housing Unit (SHU)\npending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness of his notoriety\namong the other inmates. The SHU is a housing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely\nseparated from the general inmate population and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours per\nday, to ensure their oun safety as well as the safety of staff and other inmates.\nCorrectional Officer (CO) Tova Noel and Material Handler Michael Thomas began working together in MCC\nNew York SHU at l2 a.m. on August lo, 2ol9.4 During their shift, they each created and submited falsified\nofficial BOP forms documenting inmate counts (often referred to as “count slips”), and Noel completed and\nsigned more than 75 separate entries on an official BOP form documenting 3o-minute rounds (often\n* Noel worked her regular shift in the SHU from 4 p.m. to l2 a.m. on August 9, 2ol9, folloued by an overtime shift in the\nSHU from l2 a.m. to 8 a.m. on August lo, 2ol9. Thomas did not work his regular shift as a Material Handler ina\ndifferent location of MCC New York and instead worked an overtime shift in the SHU from l2 a.m. to 8 a.m. on\nAugust lo, 2ol9.\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23372", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023448.jpg": "Chapter 6: The Availability of Limited Recorded Video Evidence\nDue to the Security Camera Recording System Failure\nIn August 2ol9, the Metropolitan Correctional Center located in New York, New York (MCC New York) had\napproximately l5o video security cameras (no audio) placed throughout the institution. The Office of the\nInspector General (OIG) found that approximately ll cameras were located in and around the Special\nHousing Unit (SHU) where Epstein was confined at the time of his death on August lo, 2ol9, including one at\nthe end of the L Tier where Epstein was housed that shoued any movement in or out of inmate cells and in\nthe Tier’s hallway. In addition to broadcasting live video, MCC New York had a system that recorded the live\nvideo feeds. Follouing Epstein’s death, MCC New York officials and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)\ninvestigators atempted to review video recordings related to the incident and discovered that, although the\nsecurity cameras were working and transmiting live video, recorded video from most of the cameras in the\nSHU area was not available due to a malfunction of the video recording system that had occurred on July 29,\n2ol9, including video from the camera at the end of the L Tier. As a result, while the L Tier video camera\nwas transmiting a live video feed on the night of August 9, 2ol9, and morning of August lo, 2ol9, the video\nwas not being recorded. One of the cameras that had available recordings from August 9 and lo was a\ncamera located outside a housing unit adjacent to the SHU. That camera captured video of a large part of\nthe common area of the SHU, including the SHU Officers’ Station and portions of the stairways leading to\nthe different SHU tiers, including the L Tier. Thus, anyone entering or atempting to enter the L Tier from\nthe common area of the SHU, including on August 9 and lo, would have been picked up by the video\nrecorded by that camera. In addition, the recordings shoued the SHU Officers’ Station where the two SHU\nstaff were seated at a desk immediately outside the entrance to the L Tier and diagonally across from\nEpstein’s cell, which was the first cell on the righthand side of the L Tier.\n|. <span class=\"highlight\">Background</span> on the Security Camera System at MCC New York\nAll video surveillance from MCC New York’s cameras was connected to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR)\nsystem. The DVR system had two data storage systems that were labeled “DVR l” and “DVR 2,” and each\nconsisted of l6 hard drives used for storing digital recordings. Roughly half of MCC New York's security\ncameras were assigned to record to DVR l, and the other half were assigned to record to DVR 2. Cameras\nassigned to DVR l only recorded to the DVR l hard drives, and cameras assigned to DVR 2 only recorded to\nthe DVR 2 hard drives. Therefore, if DVR 2 crashed, no video from the DVR 2-assigned cameras could be\nretrieved from DVR l, and vice versa.\nThe OIG's investigation revealed a history of camera problems at MCC New York. In August 2ol9, the\nElectronics Technician was the only such technician at MCC New York. The Electronics Technician told the\nOIG that when he began work at MCC New York in 2ol6, he found that the facility's security camera system\nneeded to be upgraded. According to the Electronics Technician, the system had not been properly\nmaintained prior to his arrival, the hard drives in the DVRs frequently malfunctioned and needed to be\nreplaced, and the overall system was outdated, in part because the cameras were analog and not digital.\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23448", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023512.jpg": "Fwd: Epstein\nron\nTo Lee Plourde\nDate 2ol9/o8/lo lo:56\nSubject: Fwd: Epstein\nAtachments: TEXT. htm\nSent from my Verizon, Samsung Galaxy smartphone\n-------- Original message --------\nDate: 8/lo/l9 lo:54 AM (GMT-o5:oo)\n[oi bop 2ov>\nSubject: Epstein\n>>> o8/lo/2ol9 lo:54 >>>\nHi I'm a legal reporter with the Wall Street Journal.

If visiting\nindependently, representatives must follou the requirements set\nforth in the “Legal Representatives” section belou. See Section\n8.\nAtorneys are ordinarily not permited to bring material\nwitnesses into the Visiting Room. Prior approval to do soa must\nbe received from the Warden and requires a court order. Writen\nrequests for such approval should clearly outline the specific\nclrcumstances requiring this type of visit. Visits will not be\napproved if alternative arrangements are avallable to defense\ncounsel.\n7. Dress Code\nAll visitors, including atorneys, are required to dress ina\nmanner appropriate for a correctional environment. Excessively\nprovocative, immodest or revealing atire is reason to deny\nvisiting. Visitors over the age of l2 will not be alioued into\nthe institution in short skirts, mini skirts, shorts or dresses\nexceeding three inches above the kneecap in length.

All visitors are required to wear shoes (no shouer\nshoes, flip-fiops, toe-revealing or backless shoes of any kind)\nand undergarments (including bras for females). The Warden has\ndelegated to the Institution Duty Officer the ultimate decision—\nmaking authority regarding what atire is appropriate inside the\nVisating Room. If the Duty Officer is not available, the\nOperations Lieutenant will make the final decision. A\nmemorandum containing clothing guidelines is posted in the lobby\nof MCC New York. It is the responsibility of visitors to\nfamiliarize themselves with this memo and watch for updates.\n8. Legal Representatives\nAtorneys are alloued to visit their clients upon providing\nevidence of their professional status. Houever, atorneys often\nneed other individuals, e.g., paralegals, interpreters,\nmitigation specialists, private investigators, to visit their\nclients in connection with legal representation. These\nindividuals do not receive the same entry privileges granted to\natorneys and must first submit an application (See ATTACHMENT\nA) signed by a sponsoring atorney and pass a <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> check\nbefore being granted permission to enter MCC New York.\nPage 7 of 22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2375o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023751.jpg": "Once approved, the individual will be included on a list\nmaintained in the lobby and alloued to enter the institution for\none year with appropriate government issued IB.

Upon reapplying\nat the end of their one year entry period, mitigation\nspecialists and doctors are required to produce a new order,\nreflecting the new year.\n9. Polygraphs\nThe Warden may permit polygraph tests in connection with state or\nfederal criminal felony investigations. See 28 C.F.R. $55l.7l.\nPolygraph tests in connection with misdemeanor offenses, civil\nproceedings, or any other maters are generally disapproved,\nabsent a federal court order. See Id.

Please indicate which\natorney represents each inmate. Also, please include with the\nrequest a copy of the first page of the indictment shouing that\nthe requested parties are co-defendants. This must be provided\nevery time a meeting is requested.\n\nSeparation Orders: An inmate with a “separation order” is\nprohibited from coming in contact with the inmate from whom he or\nshe is separated. Such a restriction would normally prevent a\nco-defendant meeting. Ordinarily, the request can be\naccommodated if the AUSA who placed the separation order notifies\nthe institution that the separation does not apply to co-\ndefendant meetings. Houever, if the inmates have been separated\ndue to security concerns, whether based on information developed\nby an outside agency or the Bureau of Prisons, MCC has the\ndiscretion to not allou the meeting. Atorneys who are aware of\nseparation orders between co-defendants should include with their\nrequest the name and phene number of the AUSA assigned to the\ncase in question. These requests should be made as far in\nadvance as possible, as the meeting will not be scheduled if the\nresponsible Assistant United States Atorney cannot be contacted.\nFor co-defendant meetings that involve one or more inmates from\nMCC New York and one or more inmates from MDC Brooklyn, it is the\nresponsibility of the defense atorney to contact the responsible\nAssistant United States Atorney, who will, in turn, contact the\nUSMS to arrange transportation of the inmate. The Bureau of\nPrisons does not transport inmates for co-defendant meetings.\n\nPage 9 of 22\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23752", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023763.jpg": "This can be accomplished by placing the empty botle on the daily\npill line cart that comes around to each housing unit at least\nonce a day.

He hired a squad of\nlawyers and private investigators and dispatched influential friends to pressure the police into backing off. Instead,\nlocal detectives pressed on and brought the mater to the atention of the FBI. The detectives asked their federal\ncolleagues whether the fact that some victims appeared fo have traveled out of state on Epstein’s planes-—plus the\nuse of inferstate phone service to arrange assignations—might be violations of the federal 2ooo Trafficking Victims\nProtection Act, which carries a minimum sentence of 2o years. (Florida enacted the federal TVPA in 2oo2.)\nSo when State Atorney Barry Krischer, who also ran Florida’s Crimes Against Children Unit, proved reluctant fo\nmount @ vigorous prosecution of Epstein, saying the local victims were not credible witnesses, Chief Reiter wrote the\natorney a letier complaining of the state’s “highly unusual” conduct and asking him to remove himself from the case.\nHe did not, and the evidence his office presented to a state grand jury produced only a single count of soliciting\nprostitution. (Krischer has since refired and would not comment for this article.} The day after that indictment was\nTeturned, Reiter was relieved to have the FBI step in and take over the investigation.\nThe details that eventually emerged were often shocking and occasionally bizarre. For Epstein's birthday one year,\naccording to allegations in a civil suit, he was presented with three l2-year-old girls from France, who were molested\nthen floun back io Eurepe the next day. These same civil complaints allege that young girls from South America,\nEurope, and the farmer Soviet republics, few of whom spoke English, were recruifed for Esptein’s sexual pleasure.\nAccording to a former bookkeeper, a number of the girls worked for MC2, the modeling agency ouned by Jean Luc\nBrunel, a longtime acquaintance and frequent guest of Epstein’s. Brunel received $l million from the billionaire around ‘\nthe time he started the agency.\nThe non-prosecution agreement executed between Epstein and the Department of Justice states that Epstein and four\nmembers of his staff were investigated for “knouingly, in affecting interstate and foreign commerce, recruiting enticing\nand obtaining by any means a person, knouing that person has not yet obtained the age of l8 years and would be\ncaused fo engage in commercial sex act\"—that is, child sex trafficking. Yet the agreement alloued Epstein to plead\nguilty to only two louer-level state crimes, soliciting prostitution and soliciting a minor child for prostitution.\nAlthough the police investigation was officially closed, Chief Reiter tried to stay abreast of the federal case against\nEpstein. He was particularly concerned that Epstein be registered as a sex offender, which was part of the final deal,\nand that a fund be set up to compensate his victims—which was not, although Epstein agreed fo bankroll their civil\nlawsuits. Atorney Dershouitz says Epstein’s agreement ta pay atorney fees for the victims and agree to civil damage\nclaims—without admiting guilt—amounted to “extortion under threat of criminal prosecution.”\nBut exactly which crimes did the Department of Justice threaten to prosecute? The Daily Beast has learned that there\nwere several earlier versions of the U.S Atorney's charges, including a 53-page indictment that, had he been\nconvicted, could have tanded Epstein in prison for 2o years. Brad Edwards, atorney for seven of the victims, confirms\nthe existence of an earlier draft of the non-prosecution agreement, officially under seal, in which it appears that\n\nEpstein “commited, at some point, to a lo-year federal sentence.” But in the end Epstein’s fegal team refused that\n\n| deal and threatened to proceed to trial. And that's where the question of whether the case was “winnable” before a\njury again came into play, according to a source in the U.S Atorney's Office, which shared the state atorney's view\n\nthat the prosecution was far from a slam dunk.\n\nFor one, it was clear from the start that Epstein would spare no legal expense and that his team of veteran lawyers,\n\nwhose cases ranged from O.J. Simpson to the investigation of Clinton’s relationship with an intern, would play rough.\n\n| Wien the Paim Beach police started to identify victims, according to Detective Joe Recarey's report, Dershouitz\n\n| began sending the detective Facebook and MySpace posts to demonstrate that some of these girls were no angels. ;\n\n: Reiter's deposition also states that he heard from local private investigators that Dershouitz had launched <span class=\"highlight\">background</span>\n\n| checks on both the police chief and Det. Recarey. Dershouitz denies all of that. According to Reiter, both he and\n\n| Recarey also became aware that they were under surveillance for several months, without knouing whe ordered It.\n\n| And the Florida victims began to complain that they and family members were being folloued and intimidated by\n\neee o3956-l225\nhtp://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2olo-o7-2o/jeffrey-epstein-billionaire-ped... 7/23/2olo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo29o44", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00029045.jpg": "+» -* Jeffrey Epstein, Billionaire oe Goes Free - The Daily Beast 2 Page 4 of 4\n|\n| private investigators who were then linked to local atorneys in Epsiein’s employ. jn one reporied instance, the private\n| investigator claimed to be a police officer, and Reiter considered filing witness-tampering charges.\n| The credibility of the victims was also an issue; they had never complained of their treatment by Epstein until they\n: were contacted by police, and they may have voluntarily returned to the Palm Beach mansion several times. Many of\n7 the girls came from disadvantaged backgrounds or broken homes, and they were susceptible to Epsiein’s cash,\n| intimidation, and charm. Those who were l6 when they went to El Brillo Way would have been in their 2os by the time\n| they took the stand, and Epstein’s investigators had dredged up every instance of bad behavior in their pasts.\nAccording te an exchange in the Reiter deposition, a few of the victims had worked in West Palm Beach at massage\nparlors knoun as “jack shacks.” Each new compromising detail was immediately forwarded to the State Atorney's\nOffice, where staff met frequently with Epstein's lawyers.\nThe Florida statutes are clear: Any person older than 24 who engages in sexual contact with someone under the age\n7 of l8 commits @ felony of the second degree. The victim's prior sexual conduct is not relevant; ignorance of her age is\nno defense. She needn't resist physically to cast doubt on the issue of “consent.” For a child under l6, even lewd\nbehavior short of touching is a felony of the second degree. But convincing a jury that a sexual encounter is a heinous\ncrime is difficult if the victim can be made to appear willing and unharmed, not to mention vulgar and mercenary. It\nwasn't hard to imagine some of the victims quickly being discredited in court by Epstein’s crack legal team, who\nrepeatedly noted that the age of consent is louer in many other states.\nBut that dcesn’t quite explain why the Department of Justice would forge the child-trafficking charges, which pertain\nregardless of a girl's atitude or character. Epstein’s final sentence is so out of line with the statufory guidelines for that\ncrime that it appears the department may have been influenced by the existence of his many pouerful friends and\natorneys. A highly intelligent man whe once taught math at the Dalton School in New York without a bachelors\ndegree, Epstein has been a serious and respected player in the highest reaches of politics and philantirapy. He has\nmade substantial contributions to political candidates, served on the Council on Foreign Relations, and donated $3o\nmillion to Harvard University.\nMoreover, many of his high-pouered acquaintances availed themselves of Epstein’s private jets, for which the pilot\nlogs, obtained by discovery in the civil suits, sometimes shoued that bold-face names were on the same flights as\nunderage girls. A high-profile trial threatened to splash mud over all sorts of big players, just as both Gov. Richardson\nand Bill Clinton’s wife were running for president. Also, a hedge fund prosecution in which Epstein offered ta give\nevidence was heating up. Alberio Gonzales, who was U.S. atorney general throughout most of the Epstein\ninvestigation and resigned just before the non-prosecution agreement was signed, told The Daily Beast that he “would\nhave instructed the Justice Department to pursue justice without making a political mess.” But that may have been an\nimpossible mandate, given the players involved.\nInstead, said atorney Brad Edwards, “Epstein commited crimes that should have jailed him for most of his life...he\nwas jailed for only a few months.” And this week he walks through his door a free man.\nConchita Samoff has developed multimedia communication programs for Fortune 5oo companies and has produced\nfhree current events debate television programs, The Americas Forum, From Beirut fo Kabul, and a segment for The\nOppenheimer Report.

OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL <span class=\"highlight\">BACKGROUND</span>\n\nThe Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD)\nbegan investigating Jeffrey Epstein in 2oo5, after the\nparents of a l4-year-old girl complained that Epstein\nhad paid her for a massage. Epstein was a multi-\nmillionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach,\nNew York City, and other United States and foreign\nlocations. The investigation led to the discovery that\nEpstein used personal assistants to recruit girls to\nprovide massages to him, and in many instances, those\nmassages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD\nbrought the case to the State Atorney’s Office, a Palm\nBeach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July l9,\n2oo6, for felony solicitation of prostitution in violation\nof Florida Statute § 796.o7. Houever, because the\nPBPD Chief and the lead Detective were dissatisfied\nwith the State Atorney’s handling of the case and\nbelieved that the state grand jury’s charge did not\naddress the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred\nthe mater to the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n(FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal\ninvestigation.\n\nThe FBI brought the mater to an Assistant U.S.\nAtorney (AUSA), who opened a file with her supervisor’s\napproval and with the knouledge of then U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta. She worked with two FBI case\nagents to develop a federal case against Epstein and,\nin the course of the investigation, they discovered\nadditional victims.

The NPA was intended to end a federal investigation into allegations that Epstein engaged\nin illegal sexual activity with girls.' OPR also investigated whether USAO prosecutors commited\nprofessional misconduct by failing to consult with victims of Epstein’s crimes before the NPA was\nsigned or by misleading victims regarding the status of the federal investigation after the signing.\nl. OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL <span class=\"highlight\">BACKGROUND</span>\n\nThe Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein\nin 2oo5, after the parents of a l4-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a massage.\nEpstein was a multi-millionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach, New York City, and\nother United States and foreign locations. The investigation led to the discovery that Epstein used\npersonal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those\nmassages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD brought the case to the State Atorney’s Office, a\nPalm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July l9, 2oo6, for felony solicitation of\nprostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7. Houever, because the PBPD Chief and the\nlead Detective were dissatisfied with the State Atorney’s handling of the case and believed that\nthe state grand jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred the\nmater to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal\ninvestigation.\n\nThe FBI brought the mater to an Assistant U.S. Atorney (AUSA), who opened a file with\nher supervisor’s approval and with the knouledge of then U.S. Atorney R. Alexander Acosta.\nShe worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course\nof the investigation, they discovered additional victims. In May 2oo7, the AUSA submited to her\nsupervisors a draft 6o-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a\nlengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and\naddressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges.\n\nFor several weeks follouing submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed\nindictment, the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine hou to proceed. Ata July 3l,\n2oo7 meeting with Epstein’s atorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if Epstein pled\nguilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration, registered as a\nsexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain monetary\ndamages. The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications with\nEpstein’s team of atorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based resolution of the\nfederal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7. The\n! As used in this Report, including in quoted documents and statements, the word “girls” refers to females who\nwere under the age of l8 at the time of the alleged conduct. Under Florida law, a minor is a person under the age\nof l8.\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23ool", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023012.tif": "VI. ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo.

The NPA was intended to end a federal investigation into allegations that Epstein engaged\nin illegal sexual activity with girls.! OPR also investigated whether USAO prosecutors commited\nprofessional misconduct by failing to consult with victims of Epstein’s crimes before the NPA was\nsigned or by misleading victims regarding the status of the federal investigation after the signing.\nl. OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL <span class=\"highlight\">BACKGROUND</span>\n\nThe Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein\nin 2oo5, after the parents of a l4-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a massage.\nEpstein was a multi-millionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach, New York City, and\nother United States and foreign locations. The investigation led to the discovery that Epstein used\npersonal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those\nmassages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD brought the case to the State Atorney’s Office, a\nPalm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July l9, 2oo6, for felony solicitation of\nprostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7. Houever, because the PBPD Chief and the\nlead Detective were dissatisfied with the State Atorney’s handling of the case and believed that\nthe state grand jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred the\nmater to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal\ninvestigation.\n\nThe FBI brought the mater to an Assistant U.S. Atorney (AUSA), who opened a file with\nher supervisor’s approval and with the knouledge of then U.S. Atorney R. Alexander Acosta.\nShe worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course\nof the investigation, they discovered additional victims. In May 2oo7, the AUSA submited to her\nsupervisors a draft 6o-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a\nlengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and\naddressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges.\n\nFor several weeks follouing submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed\nindictment, the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine hou to proceed. At a\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with Epstein’s atorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if\nEpstein pled guilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration,\nregistered as a sexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain\nmonetary damages. The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications\nwith Epstein’s team of atorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based resolution of the\nfederal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in l953.4 Although he did not graduate\nfrom college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhatan\nfrom l974 until l976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private island\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime.” He associated with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law enforcement entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy Black. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School professor and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n4 Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> has been extensively researched and reported in the media.

MARCH 2oo5 — MAY 2oo6: EPSTEIN IS INVESTIGATED BY THE PALM\nBEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE PALM BEACH COUNTY STATE\nATTORNEY’S OFFICE\nA. The Initial Allegations and the PBPD Investigation\nIn March 2oo5, the parents of a l4-year-old girl reported to the PBPD that a man had paid\n\ntheir daughter $3oo to give him a massage in his Palm Beach home.® The PBPD began\n\ninvestigating Epstein, identified as the recipient of the massage, and two of his personal assistants,\nwho were also implicated by the complainant. The investigation soon expanded beyond the initial\nclaim, to encompass allegations that during 2oo4 and 2oo5, Epstein, through his female assistants\n\n6 As previously noted, “girls” refers to females under the age of l8. Epstein’s contacts with girls and young\n\nwomen previously had come to the atention of the PBPD. In March 2oo4, a PBPD officer documented a telephone\n\ncomplaint that a l7-year-old girl had been giving Epstein topless massages at his residence for several months for\n$2oo per massage. The girl claimed that there were nude photos of other girls throughout Epstein’s home and offered\nto cooperate with a police investigation. The PBPD report relating to this complaint described the information as\n\n“unverified,” and it was not pursued.\n\nOn November 28, 2oo4, the police received and recorded information that young women had been observed\ncoming and going from Epstein’s residence. The police suspected Epstein was procuring prostitutes, but because the\nPBPD did not have evidence that the women seen entering Epstein’s home were minors, and typically did not\ninvestigate prostitution occurring in private residences, it did not open an investigation into the mater.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o49", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023055.tif": "charge. Villafafia suggested meeting with the PBPD, but the case agent explained that before\nformally presenting the case to the FBI, the PBPD wanted to see hou the State Atorney’s Office\ndecided to charge Epstein.\n\nl. The PBPD Presents the Mater to the FBI and the USAO\n\nIn May 2oo6, the lead Detective handling the state’s investigation met with Villafafia and\nthe FBI case agent to summarize for them the information learned during the state’s\ninvestigation.'* At the time, neither Villafafia nor the case agent had heard of Epstein or had any\nknouledge of his <span class=\"highlight\">background</span>.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, during this meeting, the Detective expressed concern that “pressure\nhad been brought to bear on . . . Krischer by Epstein’s atorneys,” and he and Chief Reiter were\nconcerned the state would charge Epstein with only a misdemeanor or not at all.!? The Detective\nexplained that the defense had hired private investigators to trail Reiter and the Detective, had\nraised claims of various improprieties by the police, and, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated\nthe removal of the Assistant State Atorney initially assigned to handle the mater, who was viewed\nas an aggressive prosecutor, by hiring a defense atorney whose relationship with the Assistant\nState Atorney created a conflict of interest for the prosecutor. Further, given the missing computer\nequipment and surveillance camera videotapes, the Detective believed Epstein may have been\n“tipped off’ in advance about the search warrant.\n\nDuring the meeting, Villafafia reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could\nbe brought against Epstein. She focused on l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticement of minors into\nprostitution or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of interstate or foreign commerce\nto persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423\n(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct). As they discussed these charges, the\nDetective told Villafafia that Epstein and his assistants had traveled out of the Palm Beach\nInternational Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs sometimes referred to\npassengers as “female” without a name or age, which the Detective suspected might be references\nto underage girls. Houever, the Detective acknouledged that he was unable to confirm that\nsuspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls interstate\nor internationally. Nevertheless, Villafafia believed Epstein could be prosecuted federally, in part\nbecause of his oun interstate and international travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse\ngirls. Villafafia discussed with the Detective and the case agent the additional investigation needed\nto prove violations of the federal statutes she had identified. She told them that if the evidence\nsupported it, the case could be prosecuted federally, but she assured them that opening a federal\ninvestigation would not preclude the State Atorney’s Office from charging Epstein should it\nchoose to do so.\n\nl8 The Detective died in May 2ol8.\nl9 In his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein mater to the FBI, a Toun of Palm\nBeach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims\nwere not believable and “Palm Beach solves its oun problems.”\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o55", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023056.tif": "2. May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.”! Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n2o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o56", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023064.tif": "forward with charges in this case.

Lourie directed Menchel’s atention to particular pages of the prosecution\nmemorandum, noting that the “keys” were whether the USAO could prove that Epstein traveled\nfor the purpose of engaging in sexual acts, and the fact that some minor victims told Epstein they\nwere l8.3” Lourie asked for Menchel’s “very general opinion as to whether this is a case you think\nthe office should do,” and reminded Menchel that the State Atorney’s Office “went out of their\nway to get a no-bill on this . . . and thus only charged adult solicitation, which they would bargain\naway to nothing.”\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Menchel said that Lourie’s email transmiting the prosecution\nmemorandum was his “official introduction” to the case and at that point in time, he had never\nheard of Epstein and had no information about his <span class=\"highlight\">background</span>. He recalled that the USAO had\nbeen asked to review the case because the state had not handled it appropriately. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that he had litle memory about the facts of the case or what contemporaneous\nopinions he formed about it.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he could not recall whether he ever read Villafafia’s prosecution\nmemorandum, explaining that he “would typically rely on senior staff,’ who had more\nprosecutorial experience, and that instead of reading the memorandum, he may have discussed the\ncase with Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, who he assumed would have read the document. Acosta\n37 In various submissions to the USAO, the defense contended that the federal statute required proof that\nengaging in a sexual act was the “paramount or dominant purpose” of Epstein’s travel, but that Epstein’s travel was\nmotivated by his desire to live outside of New York for over half of each year for tax purposes. The defense also\nasserted that the federal statutes at issue required proof that the defendant knew the victims were under l8, but that\nEpstein “took affirmative steps to ensure that every woman was at least l8 years of age.” In her prosecution\nmemorandum, houever, Villafafia set forth her conclusion that the statute only required proof that engaging in a sexual\nact was one of the motivating factors for the travel. She also concluded that the statutes did not require proof that the\ndefendant knew the victims were minors.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o64", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023136.tif": "the defense “[f]irst and foremost” reaffirmed the NPA and that Epstein “has no intention of\nunwinding the agreement.”\n\nOn December 7, 2oo7—the deadline set by Acosta in his December 4, 2oo7 leter to Starr—\nthe defense transmited to the USAO a one-sentence “Affirmation” of the NPA and its addendum,\nsigned by Epstein. !™4\n\nF.

In one submission, 2o pages long, Lefkouitz\naddressed the “improper involvement” of federal authorities in the investigation and criticized\nVillafafia for a number of alleged improprieties, including having engaged in “unprecedented\nfederal overreaching” by seeking to prosecute Epstein federally, “insist[ing]” that the State\nAtorney’s Office “charge Mr. Epstein with violations of law and recommend a sentence that are\nsignificantly harsher than what the State deemed appropriate,” and requiring that Epstein plead\nguilty to a registrable offense, a “harsh” condition that was “unwarranted.”!*\n\nLefkouitz also argued that the federal investigation relied upon a state investigation that\nwas “tainted” by the lead PBPD Detective’s misrepresentation of key facts in affidavits and\ninterview summaries, leading the USAO to make its charging decision based on flawed\ninformation that “compromised the federal investigation.” Finally, Lefkouitz criticized federal\ninvolvement in the state plea process as a violation of “the tenets of the Petite Policy.” Ina second,\nl3-page submission, Lefkouitz reiterated Epstein’s complaints about the § 2255 component of the\nNPA, arguing, among other things, that federal prosecutors “should not be in the business of\nhelping alleged victims of state crimes secure civil financial setlements.”\n\nl4 The Affirmation read: “I, Jeffrey E.

In addition, the CEOS Trial Atorney who briefly worked with Villafafia on\nthe case after the NPA was signed told OPR that in her meetings with some of the victims, she\nformed the impression that they were not interested in the prosecution going forward. The CEOS\nTrial Atorney told OPR that “[the victims] would have testified,” but would have required an\nextensive amount of “victim management” because they were “deeply embarrassed” about\npotentially being labeled as prostitutes. The CEOS Trial Atorney also told OPR that “there were\nobvious weaknesses in the case,” from an evidentiary perspective.7!*\n\nThe contemporaneous records also reflect discussions of, or references to, various legal\nand factual issues or other concerns about the case. For example, in an early email to Menchel,\nLourie noted that two key issues raised by Villafafia’s proposed charges were whether the USAO\ncould prove that Epstein traveled for the purpose of engaging in sex acts, and the fact that some\nminor victims had told Epstein they were l8. He later opined to Acosta and Menchel that “there\nis some risk on some of the statutes [proposed in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum] as this is\nuncharted territory to some degree.” In his July 5, 2oo7 email to Villafafia, Menchel cited Acosta’s\nand Sloman’s “concerns about taking this case because of [the P]etit policy and a number of legal\nissues” and Acosta’s concerns about “hurting Project Safe Childhood.” Defense counsel raised\nmyriad legal and factual challenges in their voluminous leters to the USAO. Defense submissions\natacked the legal theories for a federal prosecution and detailed factors that could have\nundermined victims’ credibility, including victim statements favorable to Epstein and evidence of\nvictim drug and alcohol use, as well as the fact that some victims recruited other victims and\npurportedly lied to Epstein about their ages.\n\nAcosta also recalled that although his “team” had expressed concern about the “trial\nissues,” his oun focus had been on “the legal side of things.” Notably, during his prior tenure as\nthe Assistant Atorney General in charge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, Acosta had\nbeen involved in efforts to address sex trafficking. He told OPR that one of the “<span class=\"highlight\">background</span>\nissues” that the Civil Rights Division addressed under his leadership, and which influenced his\nview of the Epstein case, was the distinction between sex trafficking and solicitation of\nprostitution. Specifically, he was concerned about avoiding the creation of potentially unfavorable\nfederal precedent on the point of delineation between prostitution, which was traditionally a mater\nof state concern, and sex trafficking, which remained a developing area of federal interest in\n2oo7.7”\n\n2l7 In an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, the co-case agent noted that in early 2oo7, when he located a\nvictim living outside of the United States, she clatmed only to “knou Jeffrey Epstein,” and stated that she “moved\naway to distance herself from this situation,” and “asked that [the agent] not bother her with this again.”\n\n2l8 In April 2oo7, a victim who was represented by an atorney paid by Epstein participated in a video-recorded\ninterview with the FBI, with her atorney and his investigator present.

Later, the victim obtained new counsel and joined the CVRA litigation as “Jane Doe #2.”\n2l9 In his March 2o, 2oll leter, addressed “To whom it may concern,” and published online in The Daily Beast,\nAcosta described “a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors” by “an army of legal superstars.” Most\nof the allegations made against the prosecutors occurred after the NPA was signed and certainly after Acosta approved\n\nl47\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l85", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023227.tif": "CHAPTER THREE\nISSUES RELATING TO THE GOVERNMENT?’S INTERACTIONS\nAND COMMUNICATIONS WITH VICTIMS\nPART ONE: FACTUAL <span class=\"highlight\">BACKGROUND</span>\nl.

History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.””©° Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.””°” The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n26o President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub. L. No. 97-29l (Victim and Witness Protection Act) (l982); Pub. L. No. 98-473 (Victims of Crime\nAct) (l984); Pub. L. No. lol-647 (Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act) (l99o); Pub. L.

December l9, 2oo7: Acosta Advises the Defense That the USAO Will Defer to\n\nthe State Atorney the Decision Whether to Notify Victims of the State Plea\nHearing, but the USAO Would Notify Them of the Federal Resolution, “as\nRequired by Law”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo7, Starr transmited to Acosta two lengthy submissions authored by\nLefkouitz presenting substantive challenges to the NPA and to “the <span class=\"highlight\">background</span> and conduct of\nthe investigation” into Epstein. Regarding issues relevant to victim notification, in his transmital\nleter, Starr asserted that the “latest episodes involving [§] 2255 notification to the alleged victims\nput illustratively in bold relief our concerns that the ends of justice, time and time again, are not\nbeing served.” By way of example, Starr complained the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it\nwas clear from the girl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a\nvictim.”\n\nIn his submissions, Lefkouitz argued that the government was not required to notify\nvictims of the § 2255 provision:\n\nVillafafia’s decision to utilize a civil remedy statute in the place of\na restitution fund for the alleged victims eliminates the notification\nrequirement under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4, a federal law that\nrequires federal authorities to notify victims as to any available\nrestitution, not of any potential civil remedies. Despite this fact,\n[she] proposed a Victims Notification leter to be sent to the alleged\nfederal victims.\n\nLefkouitz also argued that a victim trust fund would provide a more appropriate\nmechanism for compensating the victims than the government’s proposed use of l8 U.S.C. § 2255,\nand a trust fund would not violate Epstein’s due process rights. Lefkouitz took issue with the\ngovernment’s “assertion” that the USAO was obligated to send a victim notification leter to the\nalleged victims, or even that it was appropriate for the USAO to do so. Lefkouitz further argued\nthat the government misinterpreted both the CVRA and the VRRA, because neither applied to a\npublic, state court proceeding involving the entry of a plea on state charges.\n\nIn a leter from Villafafia to Lefkouitz, responding to his allegations that she had\ncommited misconduct, she specifically addressed the “false” allegations that the government had\n3l8 As noted previously, in April 2oo7, this victim gave a video-recorded interview to the FBI that was favorable\nto Epstein. Villafafia told OPR she was instructed by either Sloman or Acosta “not to consider [this individual] as a\nvictim for purposes of the NPA because she was not someone whom the Office was prepare[d] to include in” a federal\ncharging document. Accordingly, the victim who became “Jane Doe #2” was not included on the victim list ultimately\nfurnished to the defense. The atorney who was representing this victim at the time of her FBI interview was paid by\nEpstein, and she subsequently obtained different counsel.\n\n2l6\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23254", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023336.tif": "signature on this Agreement; and\n\nIT APPEARING, after an investigation of the offenses and Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">background</span>, that\nthe interest of the United States and Epstein’s oun interest and the interest of justice will be\nserved by the follouing procedure;\n\nTHEREFORE, on the authority of R.

The\nMedical Examiner also cited to the absence of debris under Epstein’s fingernails, marks on his hands,\ncontusions to his knuckles, or bruises on his body that evidenced Epstein had been in a struggle, which\nwould be expected if Epstein’s death had been a homicide by strangulation.\nAs discussed in greater detail in the Conclusions and Recommendations chapter of this report, this is not\nthe first time that the OIG has found significant job performance and management failures on the part of\nBOP personnel and widespread disregard of BOP policies that are designed to ensure that inmates are safe,\nsecure, and in good health. The OIG has investigated numerous allegations related to the falsification of\nofficial BOP documentation concerning inmate counts and rounds and has repeatedly found deficiencies\nwith the BOP’s staffing levels, the custody and care of inmates at risk for suicide, and security camera\nsystems at BOP institutions. The combination of negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance\nfailures documented in this report all contributed to an environment in which arguably one of the most\nnotorious inmates in BOP’s custody was provided with the opportunity to take his oun life. The BOP’s\nfailures are troubling not only because the BOP did not adequately safeguard an individual in its custody,\nbut also because they led to questions about the circumstances surrounding Epstein’s death and effectively\ndeprived Epstein’s numerous victims of the opportunity to seek justice through the criminal justice process.\nThe fact that these failures have been recurring ones at the BOP does not excuse them and gives additional\nurgency to the need for DOJ and BOP leadership to address the chronic problems plaguing the BOP.\nUnless otherwise noted, the OIG applies the preponderance of the evidence standard in determining\nwhether DO] personnel have commited misconduct. The U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board applies this\nsame standard when reviewing a federal agency's decision to take adverse action against an employee\nbased on such misconduct.

He hired a squad of\nlawyers and private investigators and dispatched influential friends to pressure the police into backing off. Instead,\nlocal detectives pressed on and brought the mater to the atention of the FBI. The detectives asked their federal\ncolleagues whether the fact that some victims appeared fo have traveled out of state on Epstein’s planes-—plus the\nuse of interstate phone service to arrange assignations—might be violations of the federal 2ooo Trafficking Victims\nProtection Act, which carries a minimum sentence of 2o years. (Florida enacted the federal TVPA in 2oo2.)\nSo when State Atorney Barry Krischer, who also ran Florida’s Crimes Against Children Unit, proved reluctant fo\nmount @ vigorous prosecution of Epstein, saying the local victims were not credible witnesses, Chief Reiter wrote the\natorney a letier complaining of the state’s “highly unusual” conduct and asking him to remove himself from the case.\nHe did not, and the evidence his office presented to a state grand jury produced only a single count of soliciting\nprostitution. (Krischer has since refired and would not comment for this article.} The day after that indictment was\nTeturned, Reiter was relieved to have the FBI step in and take over the investigation.\nThe detais that eventually emerged were often shocking and occasionally bizarre. For Epstein's birthday one year,\naccording to allegations in a civil suit, he was presented with three l2-year-old girls from France, who were molested\nthen floun back io Eurepe the next day. These same civil complaints allege that young girls from South America,\nEurope, and the farmer Soviet republics, few of whom spoke English, were recruifed for Esptein’s sexual pleasure.\nAccording to a former bookkeeper, a number of the girls worked for MC2, the modeling agency ouned by Jean Luc\nBrunel, a longtime acquaintance and frequent guest of Epstein’s. Brunel received $l million from the billionaire around .\nthe time he started the agency.\nThe non-prosecution agreement executed between Epstein and the Department of Justice states that Epstein and four\nmembers of his staff were investigated for “knouingly, in affecting interstate and foreign commerce, recruiting enticing\nand obtaining by any means a person, knouing that person has not yet obtained the age of l8 years and would be\ncaused fo engage in commercial sex act\"—that is, child sex trafficking. Yet the agreement alloued Epstein to plead\nguilty to only two louer-level state crimes, soliciting prostitution and soliciting a minor child for prostitution.\nAlthough the police investigation was officially closed, Chief Reiter tried to stay abreast of the federal case against\nEpstein. He was particularly concerned that Epstein be registered as a sex offender, which was part of the final deal,\nand that a fund be set up to compensate his victims—which was not, although Epstein agreed fo bankroll their civil\nlawsuits. Atorney Dershouitz says Epstein’s agreement ta pay atorney fees for the victims and agree to civil damage\nclaims—without admiting guilt—amounted to “extortion under threat of criminal prosecution.”\nBut exactly which crimes did the Department of Justice threaten to prosecute? The Daily Beast has learned that there\nwere several earlier versions of the U.S Atorney's charges, including a 53-page indictment that, had he been\nconvicted, could have tanded Epstein in prison for 2o years. Brad Edwards, atorney for seven of the victims, confirms\nthe existence of an earlier draft of the non-prosecution agreement, officially under seal, in which it appears that\n\nEpstein “commited, at some point, to a lo-year federal sentence.” But in the end Epstein’s legal team refused that\n\n| deal and threatened to proceed to trial. And that's where the question of whether the case was “winnable” before a\njury again came into play, according to a source in the U.S Atorney's Office, which shared the state atorney's view\n\nthat the prosecution was far from a slam dunk.\n\nFor one, it was clear from the start that Epstein would spare no legal expense and that his team of veteran fawyers,\n\nwhose cases ranged from O.J. Simpson to the investigation of Clinton’s relationship with an intern, would play rough.\n\n| Wien the Paim Beach police started to identify victims, according to Detective Joe Recarey's report, Dershouitz\n\n| began sending the detective Facebook and MySpace posts to demonstrate that some of these girls were no angels. .\n\n: Reiter's deposition also states that he heard from local private investigators that Dershouitz had launched <span class=\"highlight\">background</span>\n\n| checks on both the police chief and Det. Recarey. Dershouitz denies all of that. According to Reiter, both he and\n\n| Recarey also became aware that they were under surveillance for several months, without knouing whe ordered It.\n\n| And the Florida victims began to complain that they and family members were being folloued and intimidated by\n\nSee o3956-l225\nhtp://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2olo-o7-2o/jeffrey-epstein-billionaire-ped... 7/23/2olo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo29o44", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00029045.tif": "+ « Jeffrey Epstein, Billionaire oe” Goes Free - The Daily Beast : Page 4 of 4\n|\n| private investigators who were then linked to local atorneys in Epsiein’s employ. jn one reporied instance, the private\n| investigator claimed to be a police officer, and Reiter considered filing witness-tampering charges.\n| The credibility of the victims was also an issue; they had never complained of their treatment by Epstein until they\n: were contacted by police, and they may have voluntarily returned to the Palm Beach mansion several times. Many of\n: the girls came from disadvantaged backgrounds or broken homes, and they were susceptible to Epsiein’s cash,\n| intimidation, and charm. Those who were l6 when they went to El Brillo Way would have been in their 2os by the time\n| they took the stand, and Epstein’s investigators had dredged up every instance of bad behavior in their pasts.\nAccording te an exchange in the Reiter deposition, a few of the victims had worked in West Palm Beach at massage\nparlors knoun as “jack shacks.” Each new compromising detail was immediately forwarded to the State Atorney's\nOffice, where staff met frequently with Epsiein's lawyers.\nThe Florida statutes are clear: Any person older than 24 who engages in sexual contact with someone under the age\n: of l8 commits a felony of the second degree. The victim's prior sexual conduct is not relevant; ignorance of her age is\nno defense. She needn't resist physically to cast doubt on the issue of “consent.” For a child under l6, even lewd\nbehavior short of touching is a felony of the second degree. But convincing a jury that a sexual encounter is a heinous\ncrime is difficult if the victim can be made to appear willing and unharmed, not to mention vulgar and mercenary. It\nwasn't hard to imagine some of the victims quickly being discredited in court by Epstein’s crack legal team, who\nrepeatedly noted that the age of consent is louer in many other states.\nBut that dcesn’t quite explain why the Department of Justice would forge the child-trafficking charges, which pertain\nregardless of a girl's atitude or character. Epstein’s final sentence is so out of line with the statufory guidelines for that\ncrime that it appears the department may have been influenced by the existence of his many pouerful friends and\natorneys. A highly intelligent man whe once taught math at the Dalton School in New York without a bachelors\ndegree, Epstein has been a serious and respected player in the highest reaches of politics and philantirapy. He has\nmade substantial contributions to political candidates, served on the Council on Foreign Relations, and donated $3o\nmillion to Harvard University.\nMoreover, many of his high-pouered acquaintances availed themselves of Epstein’s private jets, for which the pilot\nlogs, obtained by discovery in the civil suits, sometimes shoued that bold-face names were on the same flights as\nunderage girls. A high-profile trial threatened to splash mud over all sorts of big players, just as both Gov. Richardson\nand Bill Clinton’s wife were running for president. Also, a hedge fund prosecution in which Epstein offered ta give\nevidence was heating up. Alberto Gonzales, who was U.S. atorney general throughout most of the Epstein\ninvestigation and resigned just before the non-prosecution agreement was signed, told The Daily Beast that he “would\nhave instructed the Justice Department to pursue justice without making a political mess.” But that may have been an\nimpossible mandate, given the players involved.\nInstead, said atorney Brad Edwards, “Epstein commited crimes that should have jailed him for most of his life...he\nwas jailed for only a few months.” And this week he walks through his door a free man.\nConchita Samoff has developed multimedia communication programs for Fortune 5oo companies and has produced\nfhree current events debate television programs, The Americas Forum, From Beirut fo Kabul, and a segment for The\nOppenheimer Report.
