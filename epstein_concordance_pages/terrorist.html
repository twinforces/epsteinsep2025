By\nthis Court’s order she is permited out of her approximately 9-by-7-foot isolation cell from 7:oo\nam to 8:oo pm, houever, she is frequently picked up late and returned to her cell promptly.\nWhen out of her cell, she is the sole inmate in a fenced off area of an unoccupied dormitory unit,\nwhere she eats, shouers, and reviews legal work while continually guarded by three officers.\n\nDespite being housed on an entire floor by herself, Ms. Maxwell is forced back into a tiny\ncorner of the floor. She is needlessly kept in a 63-square-foot space. She gets very litle sleep,\nas she is frequently woken up by flashlights every l5 minutes, loud discussions among the\nguards, and adjustments of the supplemental camera. Ms. Maxwell is effectively being kept in\nsolitary confinement (she has nou been housed alone for well over loo days) and treated as if\nshe were on suicide watch even though she is not and has never been suicidal.\n\nThe psychological and physiological impact of solitary confinement is well documented.\nMs. Maxwell has not, by her conduct or by virtue of the charges, brought this type of\nconfinement upon herself. This must be considered punishment.\n\nFurther, she has been required to stand for an hour waiting for the lieutenant to move her\nand during “the count” of inmates she is restricted to her bunk despite being housed in a one-\ninmate unit. She has at times been forced to do a standup count after midnight. Nou she is\nrequired to remain on a bed for the duration of the count.\n\nExcessive Scanning and Strip Searching: Ms. Maxwell is searched more frequently and\nextensively than any other pretrial detainee of which we are aware. All security scans to which\nMs. Maxwell have been subjected have returned negative results. Each time Ms. Maxwell is\nmoved from the isolation cell, she is searched and her cell is searched, and the dormitory is\nsearched prior to when she arrives at the dormitory area. Her cell and possessions including her\nlegal papers are searched after she has been moved to the dormitory. The process is repeated\nwhen Ms. Maxwell is brought back to the isolation cell. Recently, Ms. Maxwell was searched at\nleast five separate times and strip-searched twice during one day.\n\nMs. Maxwell is subjected to a body scans each week, and until recently, she received\napproximately three per week. We assume these are to see if Ms. Maxwell has secreted anything\ninside her body. We do not understand why it is necessary for the BOP to administer body scans\non such a regular and frequent basis — and thereby repeatedly expose Ms. Maxwell to radiation —\n* Undersigned counsel has represented clients charged with terrorism-related offenses confined to the\nmost restrictive unit in the Metropolitan Correctional Center, Unit lo South, aka “the <span class=\"highlight\">terrorist</span> SHU”.

Tarantino, 846 F.2d\nl384, l4l2 (D.C. Cir. l988). Thus, statements are in furtherance of the conspiracy if they:\n(l) inform or provide an update as to the status or progress of the conspiracy, see United States v.\nDesena, 26o F.3d l5o, l58 (2d Cir. 2ool); (2) “prompt the listener . . . to respond in a way that\npromotes or facilitates the carrying out of a criminal activity,” Maldonado-Rivera, 922 F.2d at\n958; (3) “seek to induce a co-conspirator’s assistance,” Desena, 26o F.3d at l58; (4) “provide\nreassurance,” id.; (5) “serve to foster trust and cohesiveness,” id.; United States v. Simmons, 923\nF.2d 934, 945 (2d Cir. l99l); (6) “facilitate and protect” the conspiratorial activities, United States\nv. Diaz, l76 F.3d 52, 87 (2d Cir. l999); or (7) inform a co-conspirator of “the identity and activities\nof his coconspirators,” United States v. Rastelli, 87o F.2d 822, 837 (2d Cir. l989); United States\nv. Rahme, 8l3 F.2d 3l, 36 (2d Cir. l987).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nBoth proffered statements are admissible as non-hearsay under the Federal Rules of\nEvidence. The first exemplar qualifies as a co-conspirator statement under Rule 8ol(d)(2)(E), and\nthe second exemplar is not offered for the truth of the mater asserted.

United States, 576 F.2d 432, 438 (2d Cir. l978) (affirming the denial of a\nhearing where the defendant presented “weakly authenticated, vague, and speculative material as\nto one juror,” even where that juror was not anonymous); United States v.

France has no difficulty with deporting individuals who have lost French nationality by\napplication of Article 25 of the Civil Code, which enumerates the list of crimes that may\ngive rise to a deprivation of citizenship. For example, a dual French-Algerian citizen\nnamed Djamel Beghal was recently deported to Algeria after he was convicted of\n<span class=\"highlight\">terrorist</span> offences and subsequently deprived of his French nationality’.\n\n24. While in custody in France, Djamel Beghal was also convicted in absentia to a term of\nprison in Algeria, but his extradition initially seemed impossible, not because he used\nto be a French citizen, but because the case law of the ECtHR specifically prohibits\nState parties from deporting persons deprived of their nationality to the State of which\nthey remain a national, when there is a risk of torture or degrading treatment?. Beghal\nwas eventually deported to Algeria where he was arrested upon landing for the purpose\nof standing trial. In this case, the French government’s decision to deprive Djamel\nBeghal of his French nationality was clearly intended to allou for his removal from\nFrance, whether through extradition or deportation, as both means of removal were\nconceivable at the time. Had there not been a risk of violation of the ECHR at the time\nof the Algerian extradition request, he may well have been extradited as opposed to\ndeported a few years later, when that risk was eliminated.\n\n25. In any case, the deportation of formerly French citizens shous that the loss of French\nnationality prevents any retroactive application of domestic provisions which are\nintended to protect French nationals, be it from deportation or extradition.\n\n? htps://www.lemonde. fr/societe/article/2ol8/o7/l 6/incertitude-sur-le-sort-de-l-islamiste-djamel-beghal-qui-sort-\nde-prison-lundi_5332o53_ 3224. html\n> ECtHR 3 December 2oo9, Daoudi v.

The article includes a short, non-detailed mention of an anonymous\njuror. As the Second Circuit recently held in affirming the denial of a hearing after a high-profile\ntrial, “the unsworn, uncorroborated statements that one unidentified juror made to a magazine\nreporter do not constitute the ‘clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence’” of\nmisconduct that requires a hearing. United States v. Guzman Loera, 24 F 4th l44, l6l (2d Cir.\n2o22) (quoting Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234). Another court in this circuit held that a New York\nTimes article that, in a single sentence, alleged misconduct by an unidentified juror was\ninsufficient to justify a hearing. United States v.

United States, 576 F.2d 432, 438 (2d Cir. l978) (affirming the denial of a\nhearing where the defendant presented “weakly authenticated, vague, and speculative material as\nto one juror,” even where that juror was not anonymous); United States v.

Supp. 2d at 438 (denying the defendant’s request for an\nevidentiary hearing where the defendant’s support, including post-trial media interviews,\n“amount[s] to litle more than hearsay, speculation, and in one instance, vague allegations made\nby a person who refused to identify himself”).

Nor are those excuses relevant to whether Thomas had a\ncriminal agreement with his co-defendant. Indeed, evidence as to a defendant’s purportedly\ninnocent motive in a false statement case is irrelevant to the question of intent. See United States\nv. Washington, 7o5 F.2d 489, 493-94 (D.C. Cir. l983) (holding that proof of a good or innocent\nmotive is not probative of intent where the mens rea is “knouingly and willfully”); Jn re <span class=\"highlight\">Terrorist</span>\nBombings of U.S. Embassies in E.

George, 786 F. Supp. 56, 64 (D.D.C. l992) (rejecting the defendant’s “context\nargument” for why materials could be relevant to the crime charged).\n\nFor the same reasons, “other people were doing it” is not a defense to a false statements or\nconspiracy charge because the conduct of other BOP employees is irrelevant to each of the\nforegoing elements. Thomas argues that because he was aware of incidents where BOP employees\nfalsified records and “their conduct did not lead to their indictment or incarceration,” evidence of\nwhat other BOP employees have done is relevant to his intent. (Mot. 6.) Not so. Whether Thomas\nbelieved falsifying records was illegal or was subject to criminal penalties is not relevant to the\ncharges against him. See United States v. Southland Corp., 76o F.2d l366, l372 (2d Cir. l985)\n(“Ignorance of the law is no defense to a charge of purposeful and intentional action.”); United\nStates v. Rosenfield, 469 F.2d 598, 6ol n.2 (3d Cir. l972) (“As long as the inexcusable intent is\npresent, it is not necessary that the defendant knou that his conduct is subject to criminal\npenalties.”). And in any event, it would be fundamentally inappropriate, and extremely prejudicial,\nfor the jury to consider other individuals not on trial or otherwise relevant to the conduct charged\nhere, in evaluating the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
