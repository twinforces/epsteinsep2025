Nathan\n\nOctober 7, 2o2o\n\nPage 2\nreturns. The Government is continuing the process of reviewing and preparing productions of\nelectronic discovery materials, which include extractions of data from numerous electronic\ndevices. The Government expects that it will meet the November 9, 2o2o deadline for the\ncompletion of electronic discovery productions. Additionally, the Government recognizes that its\ndisclosure obligations are ongoing, and the Government will continue to review the Prosecution\nTeam Files for any additional discoverable or exculpatory materials. In particular, the Government\nis aware of its obligations under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (l963) and its progeny, and will\npromptly produce any exculpatory material of which it becomes aware.\n\nThe Government’s Rule l6 discovery productions do not include witness statements or\nmaterial under Giglio v. United States, 4o5 U.S. l5o (l972) and its progeny, consistent with the\ncommon practice and law within this Circuit. As indicated in a prior leter, the Government intends\nto produce all such materials to the defense well in advance of trial.' Specifically, although the\nparties have not yet conferred regarding a schedule for disclosure of witness statements, the\nGovernment is prepared to produce all statements and impeachment material for witnesses it\nexpects to call at trial as early as four weeks prior to trial. Additionally, the Government is\nprepared to produce any statements by witnesses who it does not expect to call at trial as early as\neight weeks prior to trial, subject to restrictions to protect those individuals’ privacy to be\nnegotiated by the parties.\n\nIl. Applicable Law Governing Disclosure of Other Investigative Files\n\nThe disclosure obligations set forth in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6, Brady, and\nGiglio apply to materials in the Government’s “possession.” As a general mater, though “[a]n\nindividual prosecutor is presumed . . . to have knouledge of all information gathered in connection\nwith his office’s investigation of the case[,] . . . knouledge on the part of persons employed by a\ndifferent office of the government does not in all instances warrant the imputation of knouledge\nto the prosecutor... .” United States v. Avellino, l36 F.3d 249, 255 (2d Cir. l998) (citations\nomited); see also United States v. Locascio, 6 F.3d 924, 948-49 (2d Cir. l993) (declining to “infer\nthe prosecutors’ knouledge simply because some other government agents knew about” additional\nevidence where federal prosecutors were unaware of documents in possession of FBI agents who\nwere “uninvolved in the investigation or trial of the defendants”); United States v. Quinn, 445 F.2d\n94o, 944 (2d Cir. l97l) (declining to impute knouledge of prosecutor in Florida to prosecutor in\nNew York and noting that the “Department of Justice alone has thousands of employees”). The\nimposition of such “an unlimited duty on a prosecutor to inquire of other offices not working with\nthe prosecutor’s office on the case in question would inappropriately require [courts] to adopt ‘a\nmonolithic view of government’ that would ‘condemn the prosecution of criminal cases to a state\nof paralysis.” Avellino, l36 F.3d at 255 (quoting United States v. Gambino, 835 F. Supp. 74, 95\n(E.D.N.Y. l993)). Thus, discovery and disclosure obligations only extend to “information knoun\n' The Government recognizes that its Brady obligations include the disclosure of witness\nstatements containing exculpatory information. To date, the Government is not aware of any\nexculpatory material contained in any witness statements, but it will continued to review its files,\nincluding witness statements, for such material. If the Government becomes aware of any Brady\nmaterial from any source, it will promptly disclose such material to the defense.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool788", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008066.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o7 Filed ll/24/2l Page 25 of 28\nSee United States v. Lebedev, 932 F.3d 4o, 5o (2d Cir. 2ol9) (concluding that “an account and\nlitigation consultant” who “summar[ized] . . . the relevant financial records” was not an expert\nwitness). The Government has similarly provided expert notice in an abundance of caution for\nStephen Flatley, an FBI computer forensic examiner who will testify as a fact witness about his\n<span class=\"highlight\">extraction</span> of devices seized pursuant to court authorized search warrants and evidence recovered\nfrom those devices. !!\n\nTo the extent Kelso and Lopez would testify based on their “scientific, technical, or other\nspecialized knouledge,” houever, that testimony is expert testimony. /d. (quoting Fed. R. Evid.\n7o2(a)). And any such testimony is not reflected in the expert notice. These expert notices provide\nlists of “general and in some cases extremely broad topics,” which is “plainly inadequate” under\nRule l6. Ulbricht, 858 F.3d at ll5. For instance, the notice for Kelso states that he will testify\n“generally about computer forensic principles associated with the creation of documents,” and\ntestify “about user data associated with certain devices seized and searched by the government’s\nteam in this case.” (Ex. A at l2). It also states that the defense may “update the topics for Mr.\nKelso” before trial. (/d. at l3 (emphasis added)). Similarly, Lopez will “discuss various transfers\nof funds that are reflected in the financial records and explain the information contained in the\nfinancial records.” (/d.). These lists of topics do not permit the Government to identify Kelso and\nLopez’s opinions, determine whether the proffered experts are in fact expert on those subjects, and\nlitigate the reliability and relevance of those opinions.\n\n'! The Government also pointed to four other cases in this District and the Eastern District in which\nFlatley testified, including United States v.

United States, l38 S. Ct. 22o6 (2ol8). Exclusion is “a harsh sanction not to be\nimposed lightly.” /d. at ll7; see United States v. Canada, 858 F. App’x 436, 439 (2d Cir. 2o2l)\n(Mem.) (affirming a decision to permit an expert to testify who was noticed “the night before the\nlast day of trial” because the defendant “would have ample opportunity for cross-examination”).\n\nIl. Discussion\n\nThe Government will offer testimony tomorrou for which the defense has received ample\nnotice, and there is no reason to preclude any testimony or permit any delayed cross-examination.\n\nFirst, the primary issue concerns Flatley’s discussion of metadata. The Government\nbelieves that Flatley’s anticipated testimony on this subject is properly considered fact testimony.\nFor instance, Flatley is expected to read an exhibit reflecting that the author of a document is\n“emax.” That is pure fact testimony. See, e.g., GX 4l8-B. He is also expected to testify that he\nused a program to confirm, for example, that the metadata reflected in GX 4l8-B is the metadata\nfor GX 4l8. That does not constitute expert opinion, either, because it is based on his investigatory\nfindings, not rooted exclusively in his expertise. See, e.g., United States v. Rigas, 49o F.3d 2o8,\n224 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (“A witness’s specialized knouledge, or the fact that he was chosen to carry\nout an investigation because of this knouledge, does not render his testimony expert as long as it\nwas based on his investigation and reflected his investigatory findings and conclusions, and was\nnot rooted exclusively in his expertise.” (internal quotation marks and alteration omited)). This\nexpected testimony is thus quite unlike the case cited by the defendant, Jn re Digital Music\nAntitrust Litigation, 32l F.R.D. 64 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol7). There, the witness testimony included claims\nlike the fact that “he chose to use a program named ‘ExifTool,’ which is a commonly accepted\ntool used for forensic data <span class=\"highlight\">extraction</span>,” based on “his experience with it and because it would allou\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooll83", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011311.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l5 Filed o7/l2/22 Pagelof8\nHaddon, Morgan and Foreman, P.C\nJeffrey S.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan,\n\nI write in response to the government’s untimely disclosure of expert opinion testimony\nto be offered by Computer Forensic Examiner Stephen Flatley of the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation’s Computer Analysis Response Team. As explained belou, this Court should\npreclude Examiner Flatley from offering the newly-disclosed expert opinion testimony—\neverything newly disclosed in the November 26 disclosure, the December 3 email, or the\nDecember 5 email.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nOn September l5, the government wrote to Ms. Maxwell’s counsel to describe the\ntestimony it expected to elicit from Examiner Flatley. The government insisted Examiner Flatley\nwould not offer expert opinions. Instead, the government claimed Examiner Flatley would offer\nfact testimony about the steps he took to extract and clone certain devices seized under a search\nwarrant. This was the full description of the expected testimony:\n\nThe Government anticipates that, if called as a witness, Examiner Flatley will\n\ntestify about his <span class=\"highlight\">extraction</span> of devices seized pursuant to court-authorized search\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll3ll", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011312.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l5 Filed o7/l2/22 Page2of8\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nDecember 6, 2o2l\nPage 2\n\nwarrants; user information associated with certain of those devices; and documents\n\nand photographs extracted from certain of those devices. The Government further\n\nanticipates that Examiner Flatley will also testify that some of the devices on which\nhe performed extractions were clones of device extractions that had previously been\nperformed by someone else.\n\nGov. Sept. l5, 2o2l Leter.\n\nOn November 26, after the pretrial conference, the government sent a new leter to\ndefense counsel. Despite the substance Examiner Flatley’s expected testimony, the November 26\nleter continued the refrain that Examiner Flatley was not going to offer expert opinions. Said the\ngovernment:\n\nThe Government anticipates that Examiner Flatley will testify regarding the\nforensic examination of the devices marked for identification as Government\nExhibits 54 and 55, and his determination that those exhibits are clones. He is\nexpected to testify that a clone is an exact copy of one piece of media to another.\nExaminer Flatley is expected to explain that he connected Government Exhibits 54\nand 55 to a write blocker and subsequently imaged, or made an exact copy, of the\nexhibits. The Government anticipates that Examiner Flatley will explain that the\nimages of Government Exhibits 54 and 55 are exact copies of the original devices\nbecause he ran a hash, or mathematical algorithm that uniquely identifies data, on\nthe original devices and the images, which are identical.\n\nThe Government further anticipates that Examiner Flatley will testify that\nGovernment Exhibits 4o5 and 4l9 reflect registry software information for\nGovernment Exhibits 55 and 54, respectively. Examiner Flatley will explain that\nsuch registry software information includes several fields, including registered\norganization and registered ouner, which are user input data. He is expected to\nexplain that Government Exhibits 4o5 and 4l9 were generated by Access Data AD\nLab.\n\nThe Government further anticipates that Examiner Flatley will testify that\nhe examined certain exhibits contained on the devices marked for identification as\nGovernment Exhibits 54 and 55. In particular, he is expected to testify that\nGovernment Exhibits 4l2, 4l5, and 424 are emails on Government Exhibit 54;\nGovernment Exhibits 4l8, 42o, 42l, and 422 are Word documents on Government\nExhibit 54; and Government Exhibits 4l8B, 42oB, 42lB, and 422B contain the\nproperties, or metadata, for the corresponding exhibits. Examiner Flatley is\nexpected to testify that Government Exhibits 4l8, 42o, 42l, and 422 were created\nunder a user profile named “gmax.” He is also expected to testify that Government\nExhibit 4l7 is a Word document stored on Government Exhibit 55.
