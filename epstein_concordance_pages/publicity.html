See generally United States v. Marion, 4o4 U.S. 3o7 (l97l).\nHere, the delays of l4 years from the last alleged act and l2 years since Mr. Epstein signed the\nNPA are extraordinary. If the government is correct that the NPA does not, and never did,\npreclude a prosecution in this district, then the government will have to explain why it\npurposefully delayed a prosecution of someone like Mr. Epstein, who registered as a sex\noffender lo years ago and was certainly no stranger to law enforcement. There is no legitimate\nexplanation for the delay.\nIl. The government fails to meet its burden of proving that no combination of\n\nconditions will assure Mr. Epstein’s appearance and public safety\n\nAn analysis of the relevant statutory factors and case law supports pretrial release. Even\nshould the Court conclude, despite substantial evidence to the contrary, that the defendant\npresents a risk of flight, the foregoing combination of conditions virtually guarantees his\nappearance as required. Crucially, while it is always possible to hypothesize risks, the statutory\nstandard requires only a reasonable assurance that the defendant, if released, will appear. The\nconditions proposed above, including electronic GPS monitoring, surrender of Mr. Epstein’s\npassport, deregistration and/or grounding of Mr. Epstein’s private plane, and a substantial\npersonal bond (including posting of personal residence(s) and/or private jet as security to\nguarantee appearance) would extinguish any plausible risks. Mr. Epstein’s current notoriety\nminimizes any conceivable risk of flight even further. The location where he could be detained —\nhis residence on East 7l‘ Street in New York has entrances (one on the street, one in the back)\nthat can be easily monitored by video. With all of his financial resources in the United States\n(other than his Paris residence) and with his New York residence at risk due to the government’s\nforfeiture allegation, Mr. Epstein would be sacrificing virtually everything he has worked for —\nincluding any collateral the Court requires he post to secure his appearance — if he were to flee\nand to disentitle himself to the defense of his property whether it would be at risk to forfeiture or\nfor a bail violation.\n\nTo the extent there is any doubt regarding the proposed conditions, there is tremendous\nmoral suasion provided by the posting of real and personal property of Mr. Epstein’s brother, and\nhis close personal friend of decades, who have offered to co-sign a surety bond to ensure Mr.\nEpstein’s appearance in Court as required. Indeed, Mr. Epstein’s brother has agreed to pledge\nhis family home, that he shares half the year with his l4-year-old daughter and l7-year-old son,\nin order to secure the bond. It is particularly telling that Mr. Epstein’s brother, his only living\nimmediate family member, as well as his close personal friend, are both willing to guarantee his\nappearance, notwithstanding the widespread negative <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span> of Mr. Epstein that has\ndominated the news cycle since his arrest.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo282\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000320.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document7 Filed o7/ll/l9 Pagelof3\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\n)\n)\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA )\n)\nVv. )\n) CRIMINAL NO. l9-CR-49o\nJEFFREY EPSTEIN, )\nDefendant )\n)\noo)\nDEFENDANT JEFFREY EPSTEIN’S MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE\nSUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE UNDER SEAL\nDefendant Jeffrey Epstein, by and through undersigned counsel, hereby respectfully moves\nthis Honorable Court for leave to file under seal his supplemental financial disclosure.

Ironically, it is the MDC staff who leaked to the press that Ms. Maxwell had\nbeen vaccinated.\n\nFurther, in her desire to interact and be helpful with other inmates, Ms. Maxwell\ncompleted two programs to assist other inmates- (l) to qualify as a teacher aide and offered to\nhelp update MDC learning curriculum and (2) to qualify as companion for suicide watch.

Ghislaine Maxwell, Case No. 2o Cr. 33o (AJN), Local Criminal Rule 23.l\nDear Judge Nathan,\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we write to request that the Court enter an\norder prohibiting the Government, its agents and counsel for witnesses from making extrajudicial\nstatements concerning this case. Although Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent, the Government,\nits agents, witnesses and their lawyers have made, and continue to make, statements prejudicial\nto a fair trial. The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees an accused the\nright to an impartial jury. This fundamental guarantee is part of a criminal defendant’s basic right\nto a fair trial, which requires that a defendant must be judged by a jury of her peers based on\nevidence presented at trial, not in the media. The Court, to safeguard the due process rights of the\naccused, has “an affirmative constitutional duty to minimize the effects of prejudicial pretrial\n<span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span>.” Gannet Co. v. DePasquale, 443 U.S. 368, 378 (l979). This District has given effect\nto this Sixth Amendment right through Local Criminal Rule 23.l. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell\nrequests that the Court exercise its express pouer under Local Criminal Rule 23.l(h) and enter\nan Order requiring compliance with that rule to prevent further unwarranted and prejudicial\npretrial <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span> by the Government, its agents, and lawyers for alleged witnesses.\nLegal Standard\nMore than fifty years ago, warning of the danger of pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span> to fair trials, the\nSupreme Court directed trial judges to take “such steps by rule and regulation that will protect\ntheir processes from prejudicial outside interferences. Neither prosecutors, counsel for defense,\nthe accused, witnesses, court staff nor enforcement officers coming under the jurisdiction of the\ncourt should be permited to frustrate its function.” Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U.S. 333, 363\n(l966) (emphasis added).\nDOJ-OGR-ooool635\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001644.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 29 Filed o7/27/2o Page 2 of 4\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 27, 2o2o\nPage 2\nreferenced in the discovery and guard against prejudicial pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span>, while still ensuring\nthat Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel may adequately prepare and present a full defense at trial.\nLegal Standard\n\nWhere the government seeks to curtail the use of pretrial discovery, Rule l6(d)(l) of the\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires that it “shou good cause for the issuance of a\nprotective order.” United States v. Annabi, No. lo Cr. 7 (CM), 2olo WL l25322l, at *l\n(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2olo). To establish that good cause exists for proposed restrictions in a\nprotective order, the government must shou that disclosure will cause “a clearly defined and\nserious injury.” United States v. Wecht, 484 F.3d l94, 2ll (3d Cir. 2oo7). A finding of harm\n“must be based on a particular factual demonstration of potential harm, not on conclusory\nstatements.” United States v. Gangi, l998 WL 226l96, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 4, l998) (citations\nand internal quotations omited). “Broad allegations of harm, unsubstantiated by specific\nexamples or articulated reasoning, do not support a good cause shouing.” Wecht, 484 F.3d at\n2ll.\n\nCourts must be careful not to impose a protective order that is “broader than is necessary”\nto accomplish its goals. United States v. Lindh, l98 F. Supp. 2d 739, 742 (E.D. Va. 2oo2)\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited). Thus, courts are instructed to “weigh the\nimpact” of requested protections and their extent against a defendant’s “due process right to\nprepare and present a full defense at trial.” Jd.\n\nDiscussion\n\nl. Restrictions on Use of Discovery Materials\n\nThe government and the defense agree that the protective order should include a\nrestriction prohibiting Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel from (i) using discovery materials “for\nany civil proceeding or any purpose” other than defending or preparing for this criminal action;\nor (i) posting discovery materials on the Internet. See Ex. A ff l(a), 5. The defense’s proposed\nprotective order would make those same restrictions applicable to potential government\nwitnesses and their counsel so that they are on equal footing with the defense. See Ex. A {¥ 3, 5.\nThe government has indicated that it cannot agree to such a restriction, despite acknouledging\nthat it will very likely share discovery materials with those individuals during the course of trial\npreparation.\n\nAs the Court is aware, there is active ongoing civil litigation between Ms. Maxwell and\nmany of the government’s potential witnesses. Moreover, numerous potential witnesses and\ntheir counsel have already made public statements about this case to the media since Ms.\nMaxwell’s arrest. There is a substantial concern that these individuals will seek to use discovery\nmaterials to support their civil cases and future public statements.

More to the point, it does not meet the government’s\nburden under the law. As this Court recently recognized in Hernandez v. Kirby Forensic\nPsychiatric Hosp., No. l4-CV-59lo (AJN), 2ol9 WL 464oo54 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 24, 2ol9), an\nindividual’s privacy interest in sensitive information is relinquished by knouing and intentional\npublic disclosure. In that case, the plaintiff alleged that hospital staff violated his privacy rights\nby disclosing his HIV status to patients and other staff. Nevertheless, because the plaintiff had,\nhimself, disclosed his HIV status to the entire hospital ward, he “forfeited any reasonable\nexpectation that this information would remain confidential[.]” /d. at *5; see also In re Avaya,\nInc., No. l7-loo89 (SMB), 2ol9 WL l75o9o8, at *7 (Bankr.

The cases that the government cites in its leter are\ninapposite, as none addressed the privacy rights of victims and witnesses who had voluntarily\ndisclosed their identities to the public. (Gov. Resp. at 2.).”\n\nMoreover, the language proposed by the defense will permit it to conduct a full and\nmeaningful investigation, upon receiving the discovery, which is required for the effective\nassistance of counsel. Our client, of course, is presumed innocent, and intends to fight the\ncharges against her. The defense believes that there are individuals who have exculpatory\nevidence concerning Ms. Maxwell, and information bearing on the credibility of the alleged\nvictims and witnesses.

As reflected in our proposed order, the defense has agreed not to mention publicly the identities\nof any such individuals. Instead, to satisfy its burden, the government posits a series of “hypothetical examples”\nrelating to individuals and the type of interactions they may have had with various public fora. (d.). Hypothetical\nexamples are not a shouing of “good cause.” Moreover, the defense cannot address these scenarios without\nknouing if they relate to actual persons, and if so, the nature of such interactions.\n\n° See United States v.

Prejudice Resulting from Prejudicial Media Reporting and Inappropriate\nPre-Trial <span class=\"highlight\">Publicity</span>.\n\nBeginning in 2oo5 and escalating in 2oll through the present, Ms. Maxwell has been a\npotential target of a group of personal injury lawyers who made millions of dollars suing Jeffrey\nEpstein or extorting those associated with him. The playbook was relatively simple: File\nincendiary pleadings in court to avoid defamation claims; provide the pleadings and background\ninformation to various media organizations; obtain alleged victim’s names and police reports\nfrom law enforcement; share information with potential claimants who hire the lawyers after\nreading or hearing the reports; file a lawsuit against Mr. Epstein; get money from Mr. Epstein or\nassociates to setle; repeat. Once Mr. Epstein had setled all of these claims against himself and\nthe other individuals alleged to have been involved, a new play was necessary - try to invalidate\nthe NPA; and at the same time drum up litigation against Maxwell with the expectation that\neither Mr. Epstein would setle any new litigation to avoid being dragged into yet another case\nthat would further tarnish the reputation he was trying to rebuild or result in money directly from\nMs. Maxwell.\n\nFrom 2oll to 2ol9, Ms. Maxwell was the subject of millions of media stories, posts,\nblogs, podcasts, and comments that simply republished the same allegations that she correctly\nidentified as “obvious lies” in 2ol5. Once New York passed L. 2ol9, ch. ll, knoun as the Child\nVictims Act, the door was open to claimants who wanted to take advantage of Mr. Epstein’s\nvulnerability to file new lawsuits on stale allegations. At that point it easy to make copycat\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2522\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003012.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 78 of 239\nto the instant prosecution, is insufficient to shou actual prejudice. .. .

Furthermore, there has been no allegation in this case that the destruction of the records\nwas deliberate on the part of either the government or trustee.” (internal citations omited)).\n\nLastly, the defendant contends that prejudicial media reporting and inappropriate pre-trial\n<span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span> from at least 2oll through the present has resulted in prejudice to the defendant. (Def.\nMot. at l4). She claims that had the Government brought charges against her between l996 and\n2oll, the Government “would have not prevailed,” noting that the defendant’s accusers would not\nhave been “able to conform their ‘memories’ to the often republished ‘obvious lies.’” (/d. at l5).\nThis argument, like the others contained in this motion, is steeped in speculation.

The motion should\ntherefore be denied.\n\n'° The defendant also complains about the Government’s failure to “provide discovery adequate\nto fully investigate the extent of the prejudice to Ms. Maxwell.” (Def. Mot. 7 at 7). Among the\nitems the defense complains about not receiving in discovery are the names and dates of birth of\nthe Minor Victims, the specific location of any overt act, the date of any overt act, any witness\nstatements, or any corroboration of any allegation in the Indictment.

At\nthis point, Sloman left on vacation, and he informed Acosta and Villafafia that in his absence\nLourie had agreed “to help finalize this.” Lourie spent the follouing work week at his new post\nat the Department in Washington, D.C., but communicated with his USAO colleagues by phone\nand email.\n\nIn a Sunday, September l6, 2oo7 email, Villafafia informed Lefkouitz that she had drafted\na factual proffer to accompany a revised “hybrid” federal plea proposal. In that email, Villafafia\nalso noted that she was considering filing charges in the federal district court in Miami, “which\nwill hopefully cut the press coverage significantly.” This email received considerable atention l2\nyears later when it was made public during the CVRA litigation and was viewed as evidence of\nthe USAO’s efforts to conceal the NPA from the victims. Villafafia, houever, explained to OPR\nthat she was concerned that news media coverage would violate the victims’ privacy. She told\nOPR, “[I]f [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into\nthe courthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper,” and that such <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span>\nwas less likely to happen in Miami, where the press “in general does not care about what happens\nin Palm Beach.”\n\nLefkouitz responded to Villafafia with a revised version of her latest proposed “hybrid”\nplea agreement, in a document entitled “Agreement.” Significantly, this defense proposal\nintroduced two new provisions. The first related to four female assistants who had allegedly\nfacilitated Epstein in his criminal scheme. The defense sought a government promise not to\nprosecute them, as well as certain other unnamed Epstein employees, and a promise to forego\nimmigration proceedings against two of the female assistants:\n\nEpstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also\n\nprecludes the initiation of any and all criminal charges which might\n\notherwise in the future be brought against [four named female\n\nassistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate\n\nentity] for any criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal\n\ninvestigation . . . . Further, no immigration proceeding will be\n\ninstituted against [two named female assistants] as a result of the\n\nongoing investigation.\n\nThe second new provision related to the USAO’s efforts to obtain Epstein’s computers:\n\nEpstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement\n\nresolves any and all outstanding [legal process] that have requested\n\nwitness testimony and/or the production of documents and/or\n\ncomputers in relation to the investigation that is the subject of the\n\nAgreement.

Maxwell contends that lengthy public interest in this case has transformed her\nreputation from that of Epstein’s friend to a co-conspirator. And she also alleges—without\nevidence—that her accusers fabricated their stories based on media allegations. The Court will\nnot dismiss the indictment on Maxwell’s bare assertion that numerous witnesses are engaged in a\nperjurious conspiracy against her. And the Court will take all appropriate steps to ensure that the\npretrial <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span> in this case does not compromise Maxwell’s right to a fair and impartial jury.\n\nThe Court thus concludes that Maxwell has failed to establish actual prejudice from the\nGovernment’s delay in bringing charges. She may renew her motion if the factual record at trial\nshous otherwise. On the present record, neither the applicable statute of limitations nor due\nprocess bars the charges here.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3692\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003849.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l7 Filed o4/l9/2l Page3of6\nThe Hon.

Connecticut, 38l U.S. 479, 485-86 (U.S. l965). And\nMs. Maxwell proposes only those redactions “narrouly tailored” to preserve her privacy\ninterest in her intimate, consensual adult sexual activities. Press-Enterprise IT, lo6 S.Ct. at\n2743. Rather than seek to redact either the argument or the surrounding testimony, Ms.\nMaxwell marked for redaction those limited portions of the deposition transcript that Judge\nPreska ordered sealed. The remaining unredacted portions generally describe the redacted\ntestimony such that the public and media will have no issue ascertaining the nature of the\nlegal issues nor fulfill their role in monitoring the Courts. Inclusion of the exact lines\nreferencing “three-way sexual activity” or “sex toys” does not add to the argument but\nredacting those lines does preserve Ms. Maxwell’s privacy in testimony that was both\ncompelled and obtained under highly improper methods.\n\nIn addition to her privacy interests, Ms. Maxwell seeks to preserve her right to a fair\ntrial free from unfair pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span> concerning what may ultimately be deemed\n“inadmissible” evidence at the criminal trial.

Ironically, it is the MDC staff who leaked to the press that Ms. Maxwell had\nbeen vaccinated.\n\nFurther, in her desire to interact and be helpful with other inmates, Ms. Maxwell\ncompleted two programs to assist other inmates- (l) to qualify as a teacher aide and offered to\nhelp update MDC learning curriculum and (2) to qualify as companion for suicide watch. Her\nde facto solitary confinement prevents her from utilizing that training to assist others.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s segregation and surveillance go way beyond the concerns posited by the\nMDC. It is not only other inmates who may harm Ms. Maxwell, but also the very guards tasked\nto her security detail who have already done harm to her: failing to provide adequate food or feed\nher at all in a 2o-hour period, damaging her discovery hard drive, seizing her confidential legal\ndocuments, erasing her CorrLinks emails, physically abusing her. The list goes on and on.

It was the staff who\nconfronted Ms. Maxwell about the death of someone whom she was close to within hours on her\nlearning about it, information derived from her phone calls.

In that email, Villafafia\nalso noted that she was considering filing charges in the federal district court in Miami, “which\nwill hopefully cut the press coverage significantly.” This email received considerable atention l2\nyears later when it was made public during the CVRA litigation and was viewed as evidence of\nthe USAO’s efforts to conceal the NPA from the victims.

The first related to four female assistants who had allegedly\nfacilitated Epstein in his criminal scheme. The defense sought a government promise not to\nprosecute them, as well as certain other unnamed Epstein employees, and a promise to forego\nimmigration proceedings against two of the female assistants:\n\nEpstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also\n\nprecludes the initiation of any and all criminal charges which might\n\notherwise in the future be brought against [four named female\n\nassistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate\n\nentity] for any criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal\n\ninvestigation . . . .

The District\nAtorney’s Office became involved at the request of the Cheltenham Chief\nof Police John Norris.\n\nEveryone involved in this mater cooperated with investigators including the\ncomplainant and Mr. Cosby. The level of cooperation has helped the\ninvestigation proceed smoothly and efficiently.

In making this finding, the District\nAtorney has analyzed the facts in relation to the elements of any applicable\noffenses, including whether Mr. Cosby possessed the requisite criminal\nintent.

The District Atorney encourages the parties to resolve their dispute\n\nfrom this point forward with a minimum of rhetoric.\nId. (emphasis added).\nzs There is no doubt that there are two decisions at issue: the decision not to\nprosecute and the decision not to discuss that choice in public. The dissent would\nendorse the trial court’s selective interpretation of D.A. Castor’s language in the press\nrelease, finding at a minimum that D.A. Castor’s assertion that he would reconsider the\n“decision” is ambiguous. But a plain reading of the release belies such a construction.\nLike the trial court’s interpretation of the relevant paragraph of the press release, the\ndissent’s finding of ambiguity can result only when one overlooks the context and\nsurrounding statements quite entirely. D.A. Castor stated that he did not intend to discuss\nthe details of his decision not to prosecute. In the very next sentence, D.A. Castor stated\nthat he would reconsider “this decision” if the need arose. In context, “this decision” must\nnaturally refer to the decision not to discuss the mater with the public. This is so because\nannouncing that particular decision was the very purpose of the immediately preceding\nstatement, and the subject sentence naturally modifies that prior statement. D.A. Castor\nalready had stated earlier in the press release that he had decided not to prosecute\nCosby. Thus, when D.A. Castor referred to “this decision” in the particular paragraph\nunder examination, he was referring not to a decision addressed much earlier in the press\nrelease but rather to the decision that he had stated for the first time in the immediately\npreceding sentence. Even more compelling is the fact that the entirety of the paragraph\nrelates to D.A. Castor’s concern about the potential effect that any public statements that\nhe would make might have on jurors empaneled in a civil case. Nothing at all in that\nparagraph pertains to the decision not to prosecute Cosby. As noted, D.A. Castor already\nhad addressed the non-prosecution decision. There is no support for the notion that D.A.\nCastor was referring to his decision not to prosecute Cosby in the middle of a paragraph\ndirected exclusively to: (l) the potential impact that any public explication by D.A. Castor\nmight have upon the fairness of a civil case; and (2) D.A. Castor’s derivative decision not\nto discuss the mater publicly in order to avoid that potential impact.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 63\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4876\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004947.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page 24 of 27 |\nTo Be Filed Under Seal |\nThe term “extraordinary circumstances” is not well defined.

Similarly, in Nosik v.

Supplementing a\nrobust questionnaire with individual sequestered voir dire and limited examination of jurors by\ncounsel is necessary in this case because of the sensitive subject mater of the charges and two\ntypes of unfairly prejudicial media atention: (i) the pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span> that this case has received\nand will continue to receive throughout the duration of the trial and (ll) the extensive prior\nnegative <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span> concerning Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe intense negative media coverage of Ms. Maxwell and Epstein, most profoundly in\nthe aftermath of his death in August 2ol9 and the arrest of Ms. Maxwell in July 2o2o, has\nsignificantly increased the likelihood that prospective jurors will report to jury selection with\npreconceptions, impressions, and opinions about the conduct at issue in the trial and those\naccused of the charges in the indictment: Ms. Maxwell and Epstein An unprecedented amount of\nmedia coverage has focused on this case, Ms. Maxwell and Epstein. The <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span> includes\nextensive coverage in the press, including newspapers, magazines, and on-line sites; in broadcast\nmedia, including regular and cable television stations, radio, and streaming platforms, such as\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005208.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Page3ofl7\nNetflix, Peacock, and Amazon; in podcasts and YouTube recordings; in social media sites, such\nas Facebook, Instagram, Twiter; in online sites, chat rooms and blogs. The <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span> has\ncovered a wide range of topics including and beyond those that will be presented at trial.\n\nProspective jurors may also have a strong reaction to the sensitive nature of the charges\nand some of the evidence that to be adduced at trial. Epstein’s arrests and prior conviction for\nsexual misconduct, allegations of his sexual misconduct of minors over the course of two\ndecades, and his untimely death awaiting his federal trial will be front and center during Ms.\nMaxwell’s upcoming trial.\n\nThe standard voir dire typically conducted by the Court is insufficient for this case and\nwill be redundant to questions posed in the proposed jury questionnaire. A writen questionnaire\ncoupled with sequestered voir dire of individual prospective jurors and limited open-ended\nquestioning by counsel will assist the Court and parties in determining whether prospective\njurors have developed prejudicial preconceptions regarding this case, Ms. Maxwell, and Epstein\ndue to this intense media coverage and pretrial publications and broadcasts.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005209.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Page4ofl7\nARGUMENT\nI. THE APPLICABLE LAW\n\nA prospective juror may be excused for cause based on many forms of bias or partiality.\n\nAs the Second Circuit has explained, juror partiality can be actual, implied, or inferred:\n\nActual bias is “bias in fact,” generally evidenced by “express proof,”\n\nsuch as a juror’s admission to “a state of mind prejudicial to a party’s\n\ninterest.” Implied bias is “bias conclusively presumed as a mater of\n\nlaw” from circumstances in which an average person in the position\n\nof the prospective juror would be prejudiced. Inferred bias exists\n\n“when a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk of partiality\n\nsufficiently significant to warrant granting the trial judge discretion\n\nto excuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make mandatory\n\na presumption of bias.”\nUnited States v. Quinones, 5ll F.3d 289, 3ol (2d Cir. 2oo7) (quoting United States v. Haynes,\n398 F.2d 98o, 984 (2d Cir. l968) and United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 45 (2d Cir. l997)).\nAll types of bias can properly form the basis to excuse a juror for cause. See id. Thus, the jury\nselection process should screen for each type. See id.\n\nVoir dire plays an important role in ensuring that juries are fair and impartial by allouing\nthe Court and parties to uncover unfair actual, implied, or inferred bias. It serves to protect the\nConstitutional right of a fair trial “by exposing possible biases, both knoun and unknoun, on the\npart of potential jurors.” United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6). For these\nreasons, district courts routinely use their broad discretion to issue writen jury questionnaires in\nconducting voir dire, particularly in cases involving extensive pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span> or hot-buton\nissues. See, e.g., Skilling v. United States, l3o S. Ct. 2896, 29l9 (2olo) (approving district\ncourt’s use of questionnaire in trial of former Enron executive, Jeffrey Skilling); United States v.\nRobert Sylvester Kelly, l9 Cr. 286 (AMD) (EDNY) (“R.

There are literally hundreds if not thousands\nof negative articles about Ms. Maxwell and Epstein in the very newspapers, television stations,\nand streaming platforms to which the jury pool in this case are regularly exposed (New York\nDaily News, New York Post, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, NY l, ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox,\nNetflix, Peacock).\n\nThe jury pool from which the jury in this case will be selected has been exposed to more\nthan its fair share of media coverage fomenting public outrage at individuals accused of sex\ncrimes, like Ms. Maxwell. The negative <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span> has been so pervasive, vitriolic, and extreme\nthat Ms. Maxwell has been demonized in the press.

A ROBUST JURY QUESTIONNAIRE AND INDIVIDUAL VOIR DIRE ARE\n\nNECESSARY FOR THIS CASE\n\nA. A Questionnaire Alone Is Insufficient to Uncover Potential Juror Bias\n\nIn cases like this—where there has been pervasive media exposure that inflames passions\nabout the underlying events and demonizes a party—prospective jurors can form biases long\nbefore they appear for jury service. Once a pretrial judgment is made, the concepts of “belief\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005214.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Page9ofl7\npersistence” and “confirmation bias” are at work. Belief persistence occurs when an opinion\nformed is resistant to change even when proven wrong. Confirmation bias occurs when an\nindividual forms an opinion early in the decision-making process and then evaluates new\ninformation in a way that supports the earlier decision.' The jury questionnaire is the first\nopportunity jurors have to tell the lawyers and the Court what they are thinking and, more\nimportantly, what influenced them to think that way.\n\nGiven the likelihood intense media scrutiny of this trial, it is critical to use both a robust\nwriten jury questionnaire and individual sequestered voir dire to inquire about the extent to\nwhich each potential juror has been exposed to pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span> and to what extent each juror\nhas formed an opinion of Ms. Maxwell and Epstein\n\nBecause there is always the fear that a discussion of pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span> in front of the entire\njury pool will contaminate those few jurors who have not been subjected to the <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span>, a jury\nquestionnaire and individual voir dire in a case such as this is particularly warranted. If the Court\nwere to engage in public questioning of the venire panel en masse, answers could infect the\nentire panel. Alternatively, concerns about a panel member’s unanticipated answer may render\nthe questions too carefully worded to uncover the problem. Further, questions asked pose privacy\nconcerns that would require constant side bars. A questionnaire can solve some, but not all, of\nthese issues.\n\nIndividual sequestered voir dire would encourage jurors to answer questions more\ncompletely and more honestly because the jurors would not be influenced by (or influence) the\nanswers given by fellou jurors or fear embarrassment in giving an honest response.

Experience indicates that in the majority of situations\nquestioning by counsel would be more likely to fulfill this need [for\ninformation upon which to base the intelligent exercise of\nperemptory challenges] than an exclusive examination in general\nterms by the trial Court.\nUnited States v. Ible, 63o F.2d 389, 395 (Sth Cir. l98o).\n\nIn this case, voir dire conducted solely by the Court will interfere with the intelligent\nexercise of peremptory challenges. Atorneys have been working on this case well over a year.\nThey are most likely to knou the areas of questioning that must be explored to further uncover\nthe prejudices that are most pertinent to the evidence that will be presented at trial. They also act\nwith an awareness that they will have to base peremptory challenges on the juror's answers.\nPermiting atorney-conducted voir dire in addition to Court voir dire will therefore maximize the\ninformation obtained in voir dire.\n\nB. The Extensive Pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">Publicity</span> Related to This Case Necessitates Atorney-\n\nConducted Voir Dire\n\nThe possibility of prejudice in this case due to the extensive pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span> is so great\nthat specific voir dire questions by counsel are necessary. In United States v. Davis, the Fifth\nCircuit held that the district court erred in not undertaking a more thorough examination of panel\nmembers exposed to <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span> (“[W]here the nature of the <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span> as a whole raised a\nsignificant possibility of prejudice, the cursory questioning by the court was not enough.”). A\ndistrict court is required, under Davis, to determine what each juror may have heard or read and\nhou it may have affected his atitude touard the trial, and whether any juror’s impartiality had\nbeen destroyed. /d; see also Silverthorne v. United States, 4oo F.2d 627, 638 (9th Cir. l968)\n(“[I]n the absence of an examination designed to elicit answers which provide an objective basis\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005219.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Pagel4ofl7\nfor the court's evaluation, ‘merely going through the form of obtaining jurors’ assurances of\nimpartiality is insufficient [to test that impartiality]”) (citation omited).\n\nBecause it is extremely likely that prospective jurors have been exposed to potentially\nprejudicial pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span>, specific, individual voir dire is required. Davis, 583 F.2d at l96-97.\nTo increase the likelihood that any hidden prejudices of the jurors will be uncovered, to\naccomplish the goal of exercising sensitive and intelligent peremptory challenges, and to ensure\nthat a fair and impartial jury is empaneled in this case, counsel should be given an opportunity to\nindividually examine prospective jurors.\n\nIndividual sequestered voir dire conducted jointly by counsel and the Court has a variety\nof benefits. It invites a conversation rather than posing an interrogation. It eliminates the pressure\non jurors to provide socially desirable or acceptable answers in a group seting, reduces\nconformity pressures that can diminish candor, and removes the risk of other jurors being\ninfluenced by statements made during group voir dire that enable them to either stay on the jury\nor be removed for cause. It increases juror comfort, minimizes the anxiety of public speaking,\nencourages candor, and promotes honesty.\n\nFurthermore, questioning conducted exclusively by the Court further hampers the ability\nto uncover important information about jurors because it places jurors in a subordinate position\nheightening their reluctance to be candid. Atorney-conducted questioning bridges the status gap\nbetween the humble layperson and the honorable judicial officer exalted high above the venire.\nResearch indicates that expansive voir dire yields greater revelations of juror bias;? and in-depth\natorney-conducted voir dire combined with individual sequestered voir dire elicits greater\n3 See, e.g., Moran, Cutler & Loftus.

The Court Can Reasonably Limit the Scope of Atorney-Conducted Voir Dire\n\nThe Court can also fairly and reasonably limit the time and scope of the atorney-\nconducted voir dire and prevent any abuse of the process. For example, the Court can direct\ndemand that the atorneys restrict themselves to new or proscribed areas of examination or\nrelevant follou-up examination to ferret out bias and prejudice. In addition, the Court can\nlegitimately place a specific time limit on atorney-conducted voir dire. Permiting each party\none minute per juror (expanded to three minutes if there is basis to pursue a cause challenge) is\neminently justifiable after basic voir dire has been conducted by the Court. An atorney who is\ngiven mere minutes for additional voir dire examination is unlikely to waste that precious time.\nPermiting each party a mere minute of atorney-conducted voir dire will increase the possibility\nof rooting out prejudice and bias in this unique case.\n\nD. The Uniqueness of This Case Warrants Limited Atorney-Conducted Voir Dire\n\nThe conventional voir dire procedures utilized in this district are inadequate to screen\nvenire members for bias and prejudice due to the nature of the charges and the extensive pretrial\n<span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span> and exposure.

Even if counsel identify specific or additional issues the defendant believes her atorneys\nshould be able to explore in light of, as the defendant claims, the atorneys’ “more in-depth\nknouledge of the case” (id. at ll), counsel are free to propose additional questions that the Court\nmay ask, and the Court is in the best position to consider whether such inquiry is appropriate and,\nif so, hou to pose such questions in a way that is fair to the interests of all parties and the potential\njurors. Even if counsel atempt to ask their additional questions in an even-handed way, counsel\nmay easily and inadvertently step over the line and significantly prejudice the other side.

(/d. at\nl4). Given that prospective jurors are likely to “respond honestly to questions directed to them by\na federal judge,” Saipov, 2o2o WL 958527, at *l, Court-led voir dire remains appropriate in this\ncase.\n\nAccordingly, the Government respectfully submits that the well-established practice in this\nDistrict of Court-led voir dire should be folloued.

The defendant\nargues that individual sequestered voir dire is necessary in light of the nature of the charges in this\ncase, which she claims are “particularly inflammatory and of great concern to communities from\nwhich jurors are drawn,” and her concern that “a discussion of pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span> in front of the\nentire jury pool will contaminate those few jurors who have not been subjected to the <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span>.”\n(Dkt. No. 342 at 8-9). Of course, under the typical practice in the District, prospective jurors would\nnot be asked to describe their experiences with sexual assault or the details of pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span> in\nfront of the rest of the venire. That questioning would happen at sidebar, in an “individual,\nsequestered” seting.

Lo\n\nThis proposal would successfully protect the victim privacy interests identified above. The\nquestion is not whether the victims’ testimony—that is, the intimate details of their childhood\nsexual abuse at the hands of the defendant and Jeffrey Epstein—will become public.

First, the defense notes that Ms. Maxwell does\nl7 not pose a threat to any of the witnesses. That is plainly\nl8 true, and the government does not argue or suggest or allege\nl9 otherwise, but just because that reason for limiting\n2o disclosures is absent in this case does not eliminate the\n2l possibility of other justifications. And again, there is a\n22 need here to prevent undue embarrassment, harassment from the\n23 press and third parties, and any resistance of others to come\n24 forward and report alleged abuse.

Nov. l Tr. at 6. That motion was granted for two primary\nreasons. First, the Court has a statutory duty to protect an alleged crime victim’s “right to be\ntreated with fairness and with respect for the victim’s dignity and privacy.” l8 U.S.C. §\n377l(a)(8). Nov. l Tr. at 6-7. Because of the “sensitive and inflammatory nature of the conduct\nalleged” the Court found that pseudonyms were necessary to protect that right. /d. at 8. Second,\nif alleged victims of abuse were subject to <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span>, harassment, and embarrassment, “other\nalleged victims of sex crimes may be deterred from coming forward” to report abuse. Jd. The\nCourt emphasized that the Government’s proposal is “quite common” among courts in this\ncircuit, citing six such cases. /d. at 7-8. As a consequence of protecting alleged victims, the\nCourt further permited pseudonyms for several witnesses that were not alleged victims\nthemselves “because the disclosure of their identities would necessarily reveal the identities of\nthe alleged victims.” /d. at 8.\n\nThese reasons for granting the Government’s prior motion do not apply to the Defense’s\npresent request. Based on the current proffer, none of the Defense’s witnesses intend to testify to\nsensitive personal topics or sexual conduct. Rather, they all are anticipated to deny misconduct\nby Epstein and Ms. Maxwell, and therefore do not qualify as victims under § 377l. Further,\nthere is no similar concern, as there are for alleged victims of sexual abuse, that denying the use\nof pseudonyms will deter reports of misconduct.\n\nIt is notable that the Defense does not cite in support of its motion a single case in which\na court granted the use of pseudonyms to defense witnesses. Neither does the Government. And\nnor could the Court after significant independent research. It appears, then, that the Defense’s\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8388\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008389.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document548 _ Filed l2/l5/2l Page3of6\nrequested relief is unprecedented.\n\nThe Defense raises several specific arguments in favor of its unprecedented request.\nFirst, the Defense argues that anonymity is necessary to protect its witnesses from scrutiny and\nharassment because of the significant <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span> this case has garnered. But these generalized\nconcerns are present in every high-profile criminal case. They do not present the rare\ncircumstances that prior courts have found justify the use of pseudonyms. Further, the alleged\nvictims that received pseudonyms during the Government’s case have a statutory right to have\ntheir “dignity and privacy” protected. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(8). The Defense’s witnesses have no\nsimilar right.\n\nPerhaps most analogous to Defendant’s request is United States v. Rainiere, United States\nv. Rainiere, No. l8-CR-2o4Sl (NGG), 2o2l WL 4522298 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 4, 2o2l), another\nhigh-profile case involving alleged sexual misconduct. There, after a defendant pled guilty, the\ndefense sought to keep leters submited in support of the defendant at sentencing anonymous,\narguing that anonymity was necessary because “the authors of supportive leters may face\nretribution if their identities are publicly knoun, given the public atention that has been paid to\nthis case” and that failure to do so “will have a chilling effect on individuals who wish to speak\nin support of defendants in other high-profile prosecutions.” /d. at *3-4. The court\nacknouledged the individuals’ “genuine interest in assisting sentencing while remaining out of\nthe public eye themselves,” but concluded that their leters about the defendant did “not involve\ntraditionally private maters” and that the public’s interest in access prevailed. /d. at *4. The\nCourt concludes that the same analysis applies here.\n\nSecond, and relatedly, the Defense argues that without pseudonyms, its witnesses may\nrefuse to testify, implicating Ms. Maxwell’s right to present a defense. The Court notes the late-\n3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8389\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008854.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document59o _ Filed o2/ol/22 Page3of9\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Sealing is warranted to protect a\ndefendant's fair trial rights if the Court makes specific findings that “first, there is a substantial\nprobability that the defendant’s right to a fair trial will be prejudiced by <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span> that [sealing]\nwould prevent, and, second, reasonable alternatives to [sealing] cannot adequately protect the\ndefendant’s fair trial rights. /d. at *8 (quoting Press-Enter.

Ms. Maxwell’s fair trial rights must be\nprotected post-trial just as vigorously as they are pre-trial.

Throughout the course of\nthis case (as in most if not every case), the parties have publicly litigated evidentiary issues\nimplicating witness testimony, such that witnesses or their counsel could access the briefing if they\nso wished. In this case, the parties publicly filed significant pre-trial briefing, including pre-trial\nmotions and motions in /imine, that included details about witness testimony. For example, in\nmotions in limine, the parties litigated the legal contours of the testimony of the witness who\ntestified under the pseudonym Kate, as well as the circumstances of Carolyn’s identification of the\ndefendant. See, e.g., Dkt. Nos. 387, 392, 397. Neither the Government nor the defendant sought\nto file such documents under seal; the defendant certainly did not claim that such documents should\nbe temporarily sealed because Government witnesses could access such filings (or news articles\nabout such filings) and accordingly tailor their trial testimony. There is no reason that the Defense\nMotion should be treated differently and litigated entirely under seal.\n\nThe defendant’s argument that the public docketing of the Defense Motion will enable\nJuror 5o to “plan out and tailor his responses” is not only inconsistent with the foregoing practice\nin this (like every) case, but it is also unsupported by any legal authority.

Ms. Maxwell’s fair trial rights must be\nprotected post-trial just as vigorously as they are pre-trial. To do that, it is necessary to keep the\nMotion temporarily sealed.\n\n2o873o6.l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo89o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008911.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document596 Filed o2/ll/22 Page3of7\nplace” and, more specifically, to “ensure that the most critical evidence to be elicited at the\nhearing—namely, the testimony of Juror 5o—is not tainted by outside information and\ninfluence.” Dkt. No. 59o at 2. The Court agrees that the integrity of any inquiry is a “higher\nvalue” that must be weighed in determining public access to the documents.

No. 585.\n\nBut restricting public access to judicial documents, whether through sealing or redaction,\nmust be “narrouly tailored to serve that interest.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l2o. Wholesale sealing\nof the motion papers, even on a temporary basis, is not narrouly tailored to serve the interest in\nensuring the integrity of any potential inquiry. The Court is unpersuaded by the Defendant’s\nconcern that media interest in the motion warrants temporary sealing of the documents in their\nentirety. Defendant argues that “there is a substantial probability that the defendant’s right to a\nfair trial will be prejudiced by <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span>” because coverage “will influence the memories of other\npotential witnesses,” as well as Juror 5o.

As the Government\nproperly notes, houever, the concern in the pretrial posture, as in Si/ver, is that potential jurors\nmay learn prejudicial information they would otherwise not. Here, houever, the concern is\nentirely absent for at least two reasons. First, much of the information relied upon in the\nDefendant’s motion and the Government’s response is publicly available. And second, the Court\nis the relevant fact-finder with respect to any potential hearing and it is obviously privy to the\ninformation whether filed under seal or filed publicly.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo89ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008968.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6o4 _ Filed o2/l7/22 Page3of6\nhere, the misstatement concerned an issue so central that it is likely the juror, had he answered\naccurately, would have been disqualified for cause or disqualified through a peremptory\nchallenge. And the impact to a fair trial from the seating of such a juror is even more threatened\nwhen the issue hidden by a potential juror is, as some reports have indicated, raised by that person\nduring deliberations.

Calderon, l5l F.3d 97o,\n973 (9th Cir. l998) (“[W]e must be tolerant, as jurors may forget incidents long buried in their\nminds, misunderstand a question or bend the truth a bit to avoid embarrassment.”); United States\nv. Fell, No. ol Cr. l2, 2ol4 WL 36978lo, at *l3 (D. Vt. July 24, 2ol4) (“[T]he writen juror\nquestionnaires must be viewed in context. The long questionnaire in particular consisted of 75\nquestions not including sub-parts.””).!! And, in any event, the credibility of Juror 5o’s explanation\nas to why, if he was indeed a victim of sexual abuse, he answered this question in the negative is\nproperly resolved not based on a review of unsworn public statements, but at a hearing at which\nthe Court can question him on this subject and assess his credibility.\n\nFurthermore, the defendant’s suggestion Sn\na is undermined by several aspects of Juror 5o’s conduct. For example, when answering\nthe questions about exposure to pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span>, Juror 5o disclosed that he had read about the\ndefendant and her connection to Epstein. LF\nPO he would, presumably, have lied about other potentially\ndisqualifying facts, too. Similarly, if Juror 5o deliberately lied under penalty of perjury in order\nto serve on the jury, it would make litle sense for him to immediately publicize that fact, thus\nexposing himself to criminal liability. See Perez, l997 WL 4o3458, at *6 (“I find it improbable\nthat a juror who lied on voir dire in order to be empaneled on a jury in an age discrimination case\nto avenge himself against a discriminatory employer who was not a party to the lawsuit would\nreveal this motivation after rendering a verdict. If this had been the juror’s intent, there was no\nreason why he would expose himself to defense counsel immediately follouing the verdict.”).\n\n'! Indeed, Juror 5o’s counsel, in his motion to intervene, discussed infra at Part III, wrote that Juror\n5o “does not recall answering questions [in the questionnaire] regarding his prior experience with\nsexual assault.” (Juror 5o Mem. at 5).\nl7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9l38\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009161.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 42 of 49\nfirst instance, it held that the district court’s decision not to do so was within its broad discretion.\nId. at 3o6.\n\nAs the foregoing cases reflect, given the dangers of post-verdict hearings into jurors’\nconduct, to warrant a hearing, allegations of impropriety must be “concrete allegations of\ninappropriate conduct that constitute competent and relevant evidence.” Baker, 899 F.3d at l3o\n(quotation omited). A single, anonymous sentence found in a newspaper article does not meet\nthat standard. Such a report is classic hearsay and suffers from the risks inherent on relying on\nsuch information. See Schering Corp. v. Pfizer Inc., l89 F.3d 2l8, 232 (2d Cir. l999) (describing\nthe “four classes of risk peculiar to this kind of evidence: those of (l) insincerity, (2) faulty\nperception, (3) faulty memory and (4) faulty narration”). As such, in the foregoing cases and\nnumerous others, courts have routinely declined to grant evidentiary hearings based solely on\nhearsay statements. See also, e.g., United States v. Satar, 395 F. Supp. 2d 66, 77 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo5),\naff'd sub nom. United States v. Stewart, 59o F.3d 93 (2d Cir. 2oo9); Daniels v. Hollins, No. CV-\no2-4495FBLB, 2oo6 WL 474l2, at *8 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 9, 2oo6); United States v. Menendez, 44o F.\nApp’x 9o6, 9ll-l2 (llth Cir. 2oll). As one court observed, “to permit an inquiry based on such\nscant evidence in a case that continues to receive an unprecedented level of <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span> would do\nserious damage to the policies that justify limitations on postverdict juror scrutiny.” Stewart, 3l7\nF. Supp. 2d at 443. So too here.\n\nThe Court should deny the defendant’s request to expand the hearing to call every juror\nmerely to inquire into a single anonymous statement in a newspaper article.\n\n4.

The defendant’s leter previews her argument on the merits of Juror 5o’s motion to\nintervene, which the parties have not yet briefed, yet ignores that the motion is a judicial document\nwhether or not the Court ultimately grants the motion. See Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l2l (rejecting the\nargument that “until a district court knous the disposition of the underlying motion, any atempt\nat calling something a judicial document is premature”).\n\nThe defendant also argues that Juror 5o’s motion is not a judicial document because it is a\n“discovery request.” First, Juror 5o is not asking for discovery. He is asking for access to his\nquestionnaire: a document that he himself prepared and swore under penalty of perjury, and which,\nnou that trial is complete, is maintained under seal principally if not entirely to protect his oun\nprivacy interests. See, e.g., Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Ct. of California, Riverside Cty., 464 U.S.\n5ol, 5ll-l2 (l984). Second, the cases the defendant cites address whether discovery materials\nthemselves should be docketed, not whether a motion for discovery should be. The issue here is\nnot whether the questionnaire should be docketed, but whether the motion should be.\n\nTurning to the balancing factors set forth in Lugosch, the defendant has identified no\nprivacy interest implicated by public filing of the motion, nor could she. Instead, the defendant\ncites the vague concern that potential witnesses at a hearing may learn Juror 5o’s views if the\nmotion is unsealed, or that <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span> regarding the filing will prejudice her. This argument has no\nmerit. The only substantive factual assertion in the motion is a brief statement that Juror 5o “does\nnot recall answering questions regarding his prior experience with sexual assault,” which, as the\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9538\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009554.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62o_ Filed o2/25/22 Pagel3 of 2l\ncontent of deliberations” but instead to demonstrate that the second juror made a false statement\nduring voir dire, like Juror 5o allegedly did. Maxwell Br. at 5o. But this reading of Rule 6o6\nhas been squarely rejected by the Supreme Court, which held that the “plain meaning” of this\nlanguage is that “Rule 6o6(b) applies to juror testimony during a proceeding in which a party\nseeks to secure a new trial on the ground that a juror lied during voir dire.” Warger v. Shauers,\n574 U.S. 4o, 44 (2ol4). The Defendant’s one-sentence atempt to dismiss Warger because it\ninvolved a civil rather than a criminal case is unavailing. Maxwell Reply at 23 n.ll. It is the\nsame rule of evidence in issue, and the principles enunciated by the Supreme Court apply here\nwith equal force.\n\nThe Defendant may also be suggesting in this argument that Rule 6o6 does not bar Juror\n5o’s statements because they concern “extraneous prejudicial information,” which is an\nenumerated exception to the rule. See Fed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(2)(A). To the extent that argument is\nraised, it is meritless. Information is “extraneous” when it is “external to the jury”—that is,\n“<span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span> and information related specifically to the case the jurors are meant to decide,” rather\nthan “the general body of experiences that jurors are understood to bring with them to the jury\nroom.” Warger, 574 U.S. at 5l (cleaned up). So, for example, the Supreme Court has held that a\nforeperson’s undisclosed experience with a car accident is not extraneous information, even in a\nmotor-vehicle lawsuit where that failure to disclose could have supported a for-cause strike. /d.\nat 42-43. The same is true here, as the second juror’s alleged undisclosed experience “did not\nprovide either [the juror] or the rest of the jury with any specific knouledge regarding” this\nparticular case. /d. at 5l-52.

Without conferring as to either the submission of the\nleter or any redactions, the government publicly filed Docket No. 568. This leter\ncommunicated to Juror No. 5o, and the media, that Juror No. 5o had done something\nwrong, that his conduct would be subject to scrutiny, and that the conduct was serious\nenough to warrant appointment of a lawyer, free of charge if necessary.\n\nHad Ms. Maxwell been asked, she would have objected to the public filing of this\nleter, which caused Juror No. 5o to delete his social media accounts and alerted Juror\nNo. 5o that he needed to stop giving media presentations and to work on his story.\n\nThe government knous hou to file a leter under seal, and this Court’s protocol\nthroughout this case has been for the parties to file leters or pleadings under restriction\nwith a conferral and briefing as to what portion of the document should be redacted.

Calderon, l5l F.3d 97o,\n973 (9th Cir. l998) (“[W]e must be tolerant, as jurors may forget incidents long buried in their\nminds, misunderstand a question or bend the truth a bit to avoid embarrassment.”); United States\nv. Fell, No. ol Cr. l2, 2ol4 WL 36978lo, at *l3 (D. Vt. July 24, 2ol4) (“[T]he writen juror\nquestionnaires must be viewed in context. The long questionnaire in particular consisted of 75\nquestions not including sub-parts.””).!! And, in any event, the credibility of Juror 5o’s explanation\nas to why, if he was indeed a victim of sexual abuse, he answered this question in the negative is\nproperly resolved not based on a review of unsworn public statements, but at a hearing at which\nthe Court can question him on this subject and assess his credibility.\n\nFurthermore, the defendant’s suggestion that Juror 5o deliberately lied in order to serve on\nthe jury is undermined by several aspects of Juror 5o’s conduct. For example, when answering\nthe questions about exposure to pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span>, Juror 5o disclosed that he had read about the\ndefendant and her connection to Epstein. If a juror was willing to lie about sexual abuse to ensure\nthat he was seated on the jury, he would, presumably, have lied about other potentially\ndisqualifying facts, too. Similarly, if Juror 5o deliberately lied under penalty of perjury in order\nto serve on the jury, it would make litle sense for him to immediately publicize that fact, thus\nexposing himself to criminal liability. See Perez, l997 WL 4o3458, at *6 (“I find it improbable\nthat a juror who lied on voir dire in order to be empaneled on a jury in an age discrimination case\nto avenge himself against a discriminatory employer who was not a party to the lawsuit would\nreveal this motivation after rendering a verdict. If this had been the juror’s intent, there was no\nreason why he would expose himself to defense counsel immediately follouing the verdict.”).\n\n'! Indeed, Juror 5o’s counsel, in his motion to intervene, discussed infra at Part III, wrote that Juror\n5o “does not recall answering questions [in the questionnaire] regarding his prior experience with\nsexual assault.” (Juror 5o Mem. at 5).\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009840.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 42 of 49\nfirst instance, it held that the district court’s decision not to do so was within its broad discretion.\nId. at 3o6.\n\nAs the foregoing cases reflect, given the dangers of post-verdict hearings into jurors’\nconduct, to warrant a hearing, allegations of impropriety must be “concrete allegations of\ninappropriate conduct that constitute competent and relevant evidence.” Baker, 899 F.3d at l3o\n(quotation omited). A single, anonymous sentence found in a newspaper article does not meet\nthat standard. Such a report is classic hearsay and suffers from the risks inherent on relying on\nsuch information. See Schering Corp. v. Pfizer Inc., l89 F.3d 2l8, 232 (2d Cir. l999) (describing\nthe “four classes of risk peculiar to this kind of evidence: those of (l) insincerity, (2) faulty\nperception, (3) faulty memory and (4) faulty narration”). As such, in the foregoing cases and\nnumerous others, courts have routinely declined to grant evidentiary hearings based solely on\nhearsay statements. See also, e.g., United States v. Satar, 395 F. Supp. 2d 66, 77 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo5),\naff'd sub nom. United States v. Stewart, 59o F.3d 93 (2d Cir. 2oo9); Daniels v. Hollins, No. CV-\no2-4495FBLB, 2oo6 WL 474l2, at *8 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 9, 2oo6); United States v. Menendez, 44o F.\nApp’x 9o6, 9ll-l2 (llth Cir. 2oll). As one court observed, “to permit an inquiry based on such\nscant evidence in a case that continues to receive an unprecedented level of <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span> would do\nserious damage to the policies that justify limitations on postverdict juror scrutiny.” Stewart, 3l7\nF. Supp. 2d at 443. So too here.\n\nThe Court should deny the defendant’s request to expand the hearing to call every juror\nmerely to inquire into a single anonymous statement in a newspaper article.\n\n4. The Defendant’s “Discovery” Request Should Be Denied\n\nThe Court should deny the defendant’s motion for “pre-hearing discovery” in its entirety.\n\nGiven the “evil consequences” of post-verdict juror inquiries, courts may not permit such inquiries\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo984o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010152.jpg": "Cas PACOAB OES DARN l Demo rreaniGiaee® o Fibs DAP ab ates Se df 7\nA-5869\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 522 Filed o4/o6/l2 Page 27 of 29\n- Stephen Gillers\n\nlo5. “Some Misrepresentations Among Corporate Lawyers,” New York Professional\nResponsibility Report, June 2ooo at l.\n\nlo6. “Was Hubbell Case About Geting Justice or Geting Even?” Los Angeles Times, June l8,\n2ooo at M2 (comment on the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in United States v.

Jury Selection Process\n\nThe jury selection process in this case was designed to screen a sufficient number of\nprospective jurors for the high-profile trial while also complying with the Southern District of\nNew York’s COVID-l9 protocols and protecting the health and safety of prospective jurors,\ncourt staff, and case participants during the unprecedented pandemic. Selection proceeded in\nthree stages: a writen pre-screen questionnaire, one-on-one oral voir dire, and, finally, the\nexercise of peremptory strikes. The Court developed the questionnaire and voir dire with input\nfrom the parties. See Dkt. No. 367; see also Oct. 2l, 2o2l Tr., Dkt. No. 459. The questionnaire\nwas designed to pre-screen for “the major for-cause strike issues in the case”—that is, “the trial’s\nlength and schedule, a juror’s personal knouledge of the parties, [the] extent of a juror’s\nawareness of <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span> about the case and the defendant, and any bias due to <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span> or as a\nresult of the nature of the charges.” Oct. 2l, 2o2l Tr. at 5. In-person voir dire would then focus\non appropriate follou-up questions based on questionnaire responses, additional questions more\nappropriately asked orally, and background information to aid the parties’ exercise of informed\nperemptory challenges. /d. at 7.\n\nWhen prospective jurors arrived to complete the questionnaire, and when they returned\nfor voir dire, they watched videotaped instructions from this Court. The Court prepared those\ninstructions with the parties’ input. Dkt. Nos. 366, 4o4, 427. These instructions briefly\nexplained the jury selection process, explained the nature of the charges (using the same\nlanguage that the parties proposed for the jury questionnaire), and instructed jurors not to discuss\nthe case or consume any media about the case.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo327\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011239.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o4 Filed o7/l2/22 Page7of8\nfront of their friends, families, and communities. For instance, Government cooperators and\nconfidential sources routinely express reluctance to testify and have their cooperation with the\nGovernment made public. Yet, absent a safety concern, they do so.\n\nThird, denying the defendant’s motion does not implicate the defendant’s constitutional\nrights to a fair trial or to present a defense. Although the defendant states that she has encountered\nresistance from potential witnesses who are afraid of “unfavorable <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span> should their names be\npublicly associated with Mr. Epstein,” (Def. Leter at 3), the defendant retains the right to\ncompulsory process. If Michelle Healy or Ls will not testify willingly unless the\nCourt anonymizes their identities, the defendant can compel them to testify. See Fed. R. Crim. P.\nl7(a). If P| will not testify willingly, the defendant can seek a leter rogatory. See l8\nU.S.C. § l78l(a)(2). Once the witnesses take the stand, they must testify truthfully on penalty of\nperjury. See l8 U.S.C. § l62l. The defendant is right that she cannot compel witnesses to be\ninterviewed away from the presence of the jury—but she has no constitutional right to do so. And\nthe Government has the same pouers and limitations. Put simply, the defendant’s constitutional\nrights are not infringed if this Court follous the same rule as every other court in every other trial,\nhigh profile or not.\n\nIV.

Ghislaine Maxwell, Case No. 2o Cr. 33o (AJN), Local Criminal Rule 23.l\nDear Judge Nathan,\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we write to request that the Court enter an\norder prohibiting the Government, its agents and counsel for witnesses from making extrajudicial\nstatements concerning this case. Although Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent, the Government,\nits agents, witnesses and their lawyers have made, and continue to make, statements prejudicial\nto a fair trial. The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees an accused the\nright to an impartial jury. This fundamental guarantee is part of a criminal defendant’s basic right\nto a fair trial, which requires that a defendant must be judged by a jury of her peers based on\nevidence presented at trial, not in the media. The Court, to safeguard the due process rights of the\naccused, has “an affirmative constitutional duty to minimize the effects of prejudicial pretrial\n<span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span>.” Gannet Co. v. DePasquale, 443 U.S. 368, 378 (l979). This District has given effect\nto this Sixth Amendment right through Local Criminal Rule 23.l. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell\nrequests that the Court exercise its express pouer under Local Criminal Rule 23.l(h) and enter\nan Order requiring compliance with that rule to prevent further unwarranted and prejudicial\npretrial <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span> by the Government, its agents, and lawyers for alleged witnesses.\nLegal Standard\nMore than fifty years ago, warning of the danger of pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span> to fair trials, the\nSupreme Court directed trial judges to take “such steps by rule and regulation that will protect\ntheir processes from prejudicial outside interferences. Neither prosecutors, counsel for defense,\nthe accused, witnesses, court staff nor enforcement officers coming under the jurisdiction of the\ncourt should be permited to frustrate its function.” Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U.S. 333, 363\n(l966) (emphasis added).\nApp.o3l\nDOJ-OGR-oool949o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019499.jpg": "OGsedl AZADA S BOs ATT thd MAE 2o2 F ib 2AY/PagPkyefi2l ab4\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 27, 2o2o\nPage 2\nreferenced in the discovery and guard against prejudicial pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span>, while still ensuring\nthat Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel may adequately prepare and present a full defense at trial.\nLegal Standard\n\nWhere the government seeks to curtail the use of pretrial discovery, Rule l6(d)(l) of the\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires that it “shou good cause for the issuance of a\nprotective order.” United States v. Annabi, No. lo Cr. 7 (CM), 2olo WL l25322l, at *l\n(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2olo). To establish that good cause exists for proposed restrictions in a\nprotective order, the government must shou that disclosure will cause “a clearly defined and\nserious injury.” United States v. Wecht, 484 F.3d l94, 2ll (3d Cir. 2oo7). A finding of harm\n“must be based on a particular factual demonstration of potential harm, not on conclusory\nstatements.” United States v. Gangi, l998 WL 226l96, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 4, l998) (citations\nand internal quotations omited). “Broad allegations of harm, unsubstantiated by specific\nexamples or articulated reasoning, do not support a good cause shouing.” Wecht, 484 F.3d at\n2ll.\n\nCourts must be careful not to impose a protective order that is “broader than is necessary”\nto accomplish its goals. United States v. Lindh, l98 F. Supp. 2d 739, 742 (E.D. Va. 2oo2)\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited). Thus, courts are instructed to “weigh the\nimpact” of requested protections and their extent against a defendant’s “due process right to\nprepare and present a full defense at trial.” Jd.\n\nDiscussion\n\nl. Restrictions on Use of Discovery Materials\n\nThe government and the defense agree that the protective order should include a\nrestriction prohibiting Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel from (i) using discovery materials “for\nany civil proceeding or any purpose” other than defending or preparing for this criminal action;\nor (i) posting discovery materials on the Internet. See Ex. A ff l(a), 5. The defense’s proposed\nprotective order would make those same restrictions applicable to potential government\nwitnesses and their counsel so that they are on equal footing with the defense. See Ex. A ff 3, 5.\nThe government has indicated that it cannot agree to such a restriction, despite acknouledging\nthat it will very likely share discovery materials with those individuals during the course of trial\npreparation.\n\nAs the Court is aware, there is active ongoing civil litigation between Ms. Maxwell and\nmany of the government’s potential witnesses. Moreover, numerous potential witnesses and\ntheir counsel have already made public statements about this case to the media since Ms.\nMaxwell’s arrest. There is a substantial concern that these individuals will seek to use discovery\nmaterials to support their civil cases and future public statements. It is therefore vital that the\ngovernment’s potential witnesses and their counsel be subject to the same restrictions as Ms.\n\nApp.o4o\nDOJ-OGR-oool9499\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019503.jpg": "CaGeide2QoeRB MOB 3o o4TMe Deter? 29-o2 OF RES O7827 289 Aagef J 2b l3\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\n~- eee eee eet LLL\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA ° DROW ERT VE ONDER\n-v.- : CO\n2o Cr. 33o (AUN)\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, :\nDefendant. :\n- eee eee eee LLL\nALISON J.

To the contrary,\nthe Protective Order in this case expressly provides\nthat its provisions “shall not be construed as prevent-\ning disclosure of any information, with the exception\nof victim or witness identifying information, that is\npublicly available or obtained by the Defendant or her\nDefense Counsel form a source other than the Govern-\nment.” (A. 84-85). Instead, the Protective Order “im-\nposed restrictions on the parties’ disclosure of materi-\nals exchanged in the course of pending litigation” and,\nlike the similar provision in the Pappas protective or-\nder, is therefore “not subject to appeal” prior to entry\nof final judgment. Pappas, 94 F.3d at 798.\n\nCaparros is similarly analogous. That case declined\nto find jurisdiction over a similar order for several rea-\nsons, including because “[t]he purported right at issue\nis not related to any right to stand trial.” Caparros, 8oo\nF.2d at 26. The Court also concluded that the protec-\ntive order in that case would be reviewable on appeal\nafter final judgment and emphasized that the defend-\nant would not suffer any “grave harm ... if the order\nis not immediately reviewed.” Jd.

Should any\nprejudicial <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span> arise, though, Maxwell will be\nfully able to raise that issue on appeal after the entry\nof final judgment in her criminal case.

Accordingly, like the protective or-\nder in Caparros, the Order here will still be reviewable\non appeal after entry of final judgment.\n\nIn evaluating Maxwell’s appeal, the Court should\n“not engage in an individualized jurisdictional in-\nquiry,” but instead focus “on the entire category to\nwhich a claim belongs.” Mohawk, 558 U.S. at lo7. The\nOrder declining to modify the Protective Order is not\nsubject to interlocutory appeal as “[p]rotective orders\nthat only regulate materials exchanged between the\nparties incident to litigation, like most discovery or-\nders, are neither final orders, appealable under 28\nU.S.C. § l29l, nor injunctions, appealable under 28\nU.S.C. § l292(a)(l).” Pappas, 94 F.3d at 798.\n\nMaxwell nevertheless asks this Court to engage in\nan individualized jurisdictional inquiry to justify her\nimmediate appeal. Contrary to Maxwell’s claims, the\nOrder does not meet the third criterion of the standard\nfor identifying immediately appealable collateral or-\nders, which requires that the order being appealed\nfrom be “effectively unreviewable on appeal from a fi-\nnal judgment.” Van Cauwenberghe, 486 U.S. at 522.\nShe likens her claim here to an appeal of an order\ndenying a motion to reduce bail, arguing that her ap-\npeal “will become moot if review awaits conviction and\nsentence.” (Br. l3 (quotation omited)).

Maxwell suggests that the Gov-\nernment’s decision to not do so is motivated by “un-\nprincipled” reasons. (Br. 29-3o). Seting Maxwell’s\nconspiracy theories aside, Doe v. Indyke and Giuffre v.\nMaxwell are in completely different procedural pos-\ntures, which implicate different concerns regarding a\npending criminal case. The later was resolved in 2ol7\nand the determination of what material should remain\nsealed remains the only open issue. Accordingly, there\nis no more discovery to be conducted in the Giuffre case\nand no possible concern to the Government that, for\nexample, its trial witnesses in the criminal case might\nbe deposed in that civil case. Additionally, the fact that\na document may be unsealed through an independent\nprocess before Judge Preska would not reveal the Gov-\nernment’s investigative focus or techniques.\n\nIn Doe v.

Ironically, it is the MDC staff who leaked to the press that Ms. Maxwell had\nbeen vaccinated.\n\nFurther, in her desire to interact and be helpful with other inmates, Ms. Maxwell\ncompleted two programs to assist other inmates- (l) to qualify as a teacher aide and offered to\nhelp update MDC learning curriculum and (2) to qualify as companion for suicide watch. Her\nde facto solitary confinement prevents her from utilizing that training to assist others.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s segregation and surveillance go way beyond the concerns posited by the\nMDC. It is not only other inmates who may harm Ms. Maxwell, but also the very guards tasked\nto her security detail who have already done harm to her: failing to provide adequate food or feed\nher at all in a 2o-hour period, damaging her discovery hard drive, seizing her confidential legal\ndocuments, erasing her CorrLinks emails, physically abusing her. The list goes on and on. In an\neffort to advocate in compliance with BOP procedure, she has filed hundreds of BP-8s, BP-9s\nand BP-los only to receive a response that is less than helpful, or in the absence of any response\nwas told the form was either lost or never filed, Each and every day of her detention, she is\nguarded by at least three officers who watch and record, by writing and via a handheld camera,\nher every move: when she eats, shouers, cleans her clothes, brushes her teeth, etc. As the guards\nfeverishly write while observing Ms. Maxwell during videoconferencing with counsel, it appears\nthat they go beyond their routine continual l5-minute reporting.\n\nFurther, her non-legal phone calls are monitored in real time. It was the staff who\nconfronted Ms. Maxwell about the death of someone whom she was close to within hours on her\nlearning about it, information derived from her phone calls. Ms. Maxwell does not discuss\npersonal maters with MDC guards and did not provide information concerning the passing of\nsomeone quite dear to her. It was psychological services who confronted her regarding that\ninformation, which could only have been obtained through telephone surveillance. We invite the\nCourt and government to review the calls which contradict the unsupported allegation that Ms.\nMaxwell is a flight risk and support her family strong ties. Her monitored communication with\nfamily and friends evidences her strong ties in the United States, her strong desire to return to her\nfamily in the United States, and her intention to establish her innocence at her trial in the United\nStates.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o357\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020435.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Page49 of 9l\n\nlo/2o/2o2l | 362 | LETTER RESPONSE in Opposition by Reporters Commitee for Freedom of the Press\nas to Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J.

The\ntestimony she suggests the detective might have offered—that witnesses in the Palm Beach\ninvestigation did not identify Maxwell by name—is propensity evidence that does nothing to\nestablish her innocence of the charged offenses. There are also serious doubts under all of the\nrelevant circumstances that a jury would have found testimony from Epstein credible even if he\nhad waived his right against self-incrimination and testified on her behalf. See United States v.\nSpears, l59 F.3d lo8l, lo85 (7th Cir. l999).\n\nMaxwell’s arguments that the indictment should be dismissed because of the possibility\nof missing witnesses, failing memories, or lost records fail for similar reasons. These are\ndifficulties that arise in any case where there is extended delay in bringing a prosecution, and\nthey do not justify dismissing an indictment. United States v. Marion, 4o4 U.S. 3o7, 325-26\n(l97l); see United States v. Elsbery, 6o2 F.2d lo54, lo59 (2d Cir. l979).\n\nFinally, the Court finds no substantial prejudice from the pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span> this case has\ngarnered. Maxwell contends that lengthy public interest in this case has transformed her\nreputation from that of Epstein’s friend to a co-conspirator. And she also alleges—without\nevidence—that her accusers fabricated their stories based on media allegations. The Court will\nnot dismiss the indictment on Maxwell’s bare assertion that numerous witnesses are engaged in a\nperjurious conspiracy against her. And the Court will take all appropriate steps to ensure that the\npretrial <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span> in this case does not compromise Maxwell’s right to a fair and impartial jury.\n\nThe Court thus concludes that Maxwell has failed to establish actual prejudice from the\nGovernment’s delay in bringing charges. She may renew her motion if the factual record at trial\nshous otherwise.

BACKGROUND\nA. Jury Selection Process\n\nThe jury selection process in this case was designed to screen a sufficient number of\nprospective jurors for the high-profile trial while also complying with the Southern District of\nNew York’s COVID-l9 protocols and protecting the health and safety of prospective jurors,\ncourt staff, and case participants during the unprecedented pandemic. Selection proceeded in\nthree stages: a writen pre-screen questionnaire, one-on-one oral voir dire, and, finally, the\nexercise of peremptory strikes. The Court developed the questionnaire and voir dire with input\nfrom the parties. See Dkt. No. 367; see also Oct. 2l, 2o2l Tr., Dkt. No. 459. The questionnaire\nwas designed to pre-screen for “the major for-cause strike issues in the case”—that is, “the trial’s\nlength and schedule, a juror’s personal knouledge of the parties, [the] extent of a juror’s\nawareness of <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span> about the case and the defendant, and any bias due to <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span> or as a\nresult of the nature of the charges.” Oct. 2l, 2o2l Tr. at 5. In-person voir dire would then focus\non appropriate follou-up questions based on questionnaire responses, additional questions more\nappropriately asked orally, and background information to aid the parties’ exercise of informed\nperemptory challenges. Jd. at 7.\n\nWhen prospective jurors arrived to complete the questionnaire, and when they returned\nfor voir dire, they watched videotaped instructions from this Court. The Court prepared those\ninstructions with the parties’ input. Dkt. Nos. 366, 4o4, 427.

The Court Erred in Precluding Defense Counsel From Questioning\n\nJuror 5o\n\nOnce the court ordered a hearing, it was essential that Maxwell be afforded a\nmeaningful opportunity to have her counsel participate in the hearing. Although\njudges normally enjoy “broad flexibility” in addressing claims of jury misconduct,\ncases involving “media <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span> or other outside influences” constrain their\nleeway. United States v. Thai, 29 F. 3d 785, 8o3 (2d Cir. l994). See, United States\nv. Daugerdas, Case No. o9-CR-58l (William H. Pauly) (procedure folloued in\nidentical situation acknouledged that defense counsel was in best position to\nconduct the examination of the juror).\n\nDefense counsel was not permited to cross-examine Juror 5o and many of\ntheir proposed questions were rejected by the court. For example, the court refused\ninquiry into Juror 5o’s statements about his “healing process;” his therapy and\nspecifically whether he spoke with a therapist about the case during the trial; the\ndetails of his sexual abuse to assess hou similar it was to the stories of the\naccusers; his social media use to the extent it contradicted his statements in voir\ndire; and his public statements both about traumatic memories and his participation\nas a juror. A277-28l. The court should have permited Maxwell’s atorneys to\nprobe the impact that the sexual abuse had on the juror in other aspects of his life\nand assess whether his answers reflected an actual or implied bias as his voluntary\npost-verdict public comments surely did.

In that email, Villafafia\nalso noted that she was considering filing charges in the federal district court in Miami, “which\nwill hopefully cut the press coverage significantly.” This email received considerable atention l2\nyears later when it was made public during the CVRA litigation and was viewed as evidence of\nthe USAO’s efforts to conceal the NPA from the victims. Villafafia, houever, explained to OPR\nthat she was concerned that news media coverage would violate the victims’ privacy. She told\nOPR, “[I]f [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into\nthe courthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper,” and that such <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span>\nwas less likely to happen in Miami, where the press “in general does not care about what happens\nin Palm Beach.”\n\nLefkouitz responded to Villafafia with a revised version of her latest proposed “hybrid”\nplea agreement, in a document entitled “Agreement.” Significantly, this defense proposal\nintroduced two new provisions. The first related to four female assistants who had allegedly\nfacilitated Epstein in his criminal scheme. The defense sought a government promise not to\nprosecute them, as well as certain other unnamed Epstein employees, and a promise to forego\nimmigration proceedings against two of the female assistants:\n\nEpstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also\n\nprecludes the initiation of any and all criminal charges which might\n\notherwise in the future be brought against [four named female\n\nassistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate\n\nentity] for any criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal\n\ninvestigation . . . . Further, no immigration proceeding will be\n\ninstituted against [two named female assistants] as a result of the\n\nongoing investigation.\n\nThe second new provision related to the USAO’s efforts to obtain Epstein’s computers:\n\nEpstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement\n\nresolves any and all outstanding [legal process] that have requested\n\nwitness testimony and/or the production of documents and/or\n\ncomputers in relation to the investigation that is the subject of the\n\nAgreement. Each [legal process] will be withdrawn upon the\n\nexecution of the Agreement and will not be re-issued absent reliable\n2 Villafafia told OPR that she sometimes used her home email account because “[nJegotiations were occurring\nat nights, on weekend|[s], and while I was [away from the office for personal reasons], . . . and this occurred during a\ntime when out of office access to email was very limited.” Records shou her supervisors were aware that at times she\nused her personal email account in communicating with defense counsel in this case.\n\n69\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l269\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021537.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 36l 3536o39, Pagelo7 of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page l3 of 2l\ncontent of deliberations” but instead to demonstrate that the second juror made a false statement\nduring voir dire, like Juror 5o allegedly did. Maxwell Br. at 5o. But this reading of Rule 6o6\nhas been squarely rejected by the Supreme Court, which held that the “plain meaning” of this\nlanguage is that “Rule 6o6(b) applies to juror testimony during a proceeding in which a party\nseeks to secure a new trial on the ground that a juror lied during voir dire.” Warger v. Shauers,\n574 U.S. 4o, 44 (2ol4). The Defendant’s one-sentence atempt to dismiss Warger because it\ninvolved a civil rather than a criminal case is unavailing. Maxwell Reply at 23 n.ll. It is the\nsame rule of evidence in issue, and the principles enunciated by the Supreme Court apply here\nwith equal force.\n\nThe Defendant may also be suggesting in this argument that Rule 6o6 does not bar Juror\n5o’s statements because they concern “extraneous prejudicial information,” which is an\nenumerated exception to the rule. See Fed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(2)(A). To the extent that argument is\nraised, it is meritless. Information is “extraneous” when it is “external to the jury”—that is,\n“<span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span> and information related specifically to the case the jurors are meant to decide,” rather\nthan “the general body of experiences that jurors are understood to bring with them to the jury\nroom.” Warger, 574 U.S. at 5l (cleaned up). So, for example, the Supreme Court has held that a\nforeperson’s undisclosed experience with a car accident is not extraneous information, even ina\nmotor-vehicle lawsuit where that failure to disclose could have supported a for-cause strike. /d.\nat 42-43. The same is true here, as the second juror’s alleged undisclosed experience “did not\nprovide either [the juror] or the rest of the jury with any specific knouledge regarding” this\nparticular case. /d. at 5l-52. Rather, as this Court instructed, jurors are expected to bring their\n“reason, experience, and common sense” to bear in evaluating witnesses’ credibility and the\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l537\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022528.tif": "Page l36\nl and Andrew together.

In that email, Villafafia\nalso noted that she was considering filing charges in the federal district court in Miami, “which\nwill hopefully cut the press coverage significantly.” This email received considerable atention l2\nyears later when it was made public during the CVRA litigation and was viewed as evidence of\nthe USAO’s efforts to conceal the NPA from the victims.

She told\nOPR, “[I]f [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into\nthe courthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper,” and that such <span class=\"highlight\">publicity</span>\nwas less likely to happen in Miami, where the press “in general does not care about what happens\nin Palm Beach.”\n\nLefkouitz responded to Villafafia with a revised version of her latest proposed “hybrid”\nplea agreement, in a document entitled “Agreement.” Significantly, this defense proposal\nintroduced two new provisions. The first related to four female assistants who had allegedly\nfacilitated Epstein in his criminal scheme. The defense sought a government promise not to\nprosecute them, as well as certain other unnamed Epstein employees, and a promise to forego\nimmigration proceedings against two of the female assistants:\n\nEpstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also\n\nprecludes the initiation of any and all criminal charges which might\n\notherwise in the future be brought against [four named female\n\nassistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate\n\nentity] for any criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal\n\ninvestigation . . . .

Her father lavished money on her and set her up in at least\none business in New York. But Maxwell's oun ill-goten gains were seized after he took a dive off his yacht,\nwhich was named for her.
