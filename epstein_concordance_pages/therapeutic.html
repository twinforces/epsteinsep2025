Any opinion Rocchio might\noffer about the psychology of alleged perpetrator and their so-called “grooming” techniques is\noutside her expertise and therefore unreliable. United States v.

Rocchio’s grooming-by-proxy opinions have no valid basis.\n\nRocchio’s generalized grooming opinions are unreliable for all the reasons given above.\nBut there is another reason this Court should exclude her grooming opinions under Rule 7o2 and\nDaubert: Nothing establishes the reliability of her opinions on “grooming-by-proxy.”\n\nRecall that Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for\nherself. Instead, the government claims that Ms. Maxwell recruited minors to provide sexualized\nmassages for Mr. Epstein. Part of this recruiting, the government alleges, involved grooming\nbehavior by Ms. Maxwell.\n\nThere is no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to support\nRocchio’s opinions on grooming-by-proxy. These opinions fail under any application of the\nDaubert test, because the theory has not gained any acceptance (let alone general acceptance) in\nthe relevant community; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and cannot be tested; and there\nis no knoun or potential rate of error.

Timely access to\n<span class=\"highlight\">therapeutic</span> services can mitigate risk to the mental health of survivors of all ages. This review of the research focuses on CSA\ndisclosures with children, youth, and adults across the life course. Using Kiteley and Stogdon’s literature review framework, 33\nstudies since 2ooo were identified and analyzed to extrapolate the most convincing findings to be considered for practice and\nfuture research. The centering question asked: What is the state of CSA disclosure research and what can be learned to apply to\npractice and future research? Using Braun and Clarke’s guidelines for thematic analysis, five themes emerged: (l) Disclosure is an\niterative, interactive process rather than a discrete event best done within a relational context; (2) contemporary disclosure\nmodels reflect a social—ecological, person-in-environment orientation for understanding the complex interplay of individual,\nfamilial, contextual, and cultural factors involved in CSA disclosure; (3) age and gender significantly influence disclosure; (4) there\nis a lack of a life-course perspective; and (5) barriers to disclosure continue to outweigh facilitators. Although solid strides have\nbeen made in understanding CSA disclosures, the current state of knouledge does not fully capture a cohesive picture of dis-\nclosure processes and pathways over the life course. More research is needed on environmental, contextual, and cultural factors.\nBarriers continue to be identified more frequently than facilitators, although dialogical forums are emerging as important facil-\nitators of CSA disclosure. Implications for practice in facilitating CSA disclosures are discussed with recommendations for future\nresearch.\nKeywords\nsexual abuse, child abuse, cultural contexts\nIntroduction the same time global trends from systematic reviews and meta-\n. . . . analyses have found concerning rates of CSA, with averages of\nTimely access to auppative and <span class=\"highlight\">therapeutic</span> FESOUTCES for child l8-2o% for females and of 8—lo% for males (Pereda, Guilera,\nsexual abuse (CSA) survivors can mitigate risk to the health Fors, & Gemez-Benito, 2oo9).

To the degree that Dr. Rocchio has the credentials of a potential\nexpert, the government is right.\n\nBut saying that Rocchio is a “qualified expert” is not enough.

(For example, the government agrees that she is not an expert in the\nhuman brain or memory generally. Resp. at 3o n.7.)

She cannot therefore speak to the psychology of alleged\nperpetrators and their so-called “grooming techniques.”\n\nThe government atempts a two-step to get around this problem. “By virtue of experience\ntreating victims,” says the government, “Dr. Rocchio is necessarily informed about perpetrators’\nactions.” Resp. at l9.\n\nBut hou does Rocchio knou her patients were victims of sexual abuse?

On the other side of the probative-prejudicial scale, the government\nsimultaneously fails to articulate any probative value in use of the term \"victim,\" either in its jury\naddress or otherwise. Cf State v. Wigg, 889 A.2d 233, 236 (Vt. 2oo5) (\"the use of the term\n‘victim’ had no inherent probative value\").\n\nSecond, the government improperly suggests in response that the stricture on vouching\nshould not apply to the witnesses themselves.

That is what the vouching rule is intended to\nprevent.\"); Wigg, supra.\n\nFinally, the government contends that Dr. Rocchio can use the word \"victim\" in reference\nto \"victims of sexual abuse generally,\" but her use of the term is even more problematic. For the\nreasons articulated in our Daubert motion and reply, Dr. Rocchio bases her expertise on her\n<span class=\"highlight\">therapeutic</span> number of individuals who have self-identified as sexual abuse victims, without any\nresearch or investigation as to whether the individuals' self-reports are true.

Though some psychologists argue there is a\nlack of empirical support for the theory of repression (Loftus, l993), many\npsychologists do believe that repression is a real process by which memo-\nries can be forgoten and later remembered (Boag, 2olo). One psychological\nprocess that may resemble repression is false memory.\n\nThe existence and prevalence of repressed memories is a source of\ncontroversy (McNally & Geraerts, 2oo9), and yet research does exist demon-\nstrating the successful implantation of fabricated memories. In one of the first\nstudies on the implantation of false memories, participants were given short\nnarratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives,\nand asked to try to remember these experiences (Loftus, Coan, & Pickrell,\nl996). Participants’ relatives were contacted and asked to provide childhood\nstories about the participants. Houever, researchers created one fabricated\nnarrative: The participant, at age 5 or 6, had been lost in a public place (e.g.\na shopping mall) for an extended period of time and eventually rescued.\nParticipants were encouraged to try to remember both true and fabricated\nevents over the course of several weeks. When participants were asked later\nwhether they recalled the events, nearly one-fourth of them reported having\nmemories of the fabricated event. Though some individuals reported remem-\nbering being lost only vaguely, others reported remembering vivid visual\ndetails and emotional experiences. Since this study, several researchers have\nsuccessfully replicated these results using different suggestive techniques\nand scenarios (e.g. Mazzoni, Loftus, Seitz, & Lynn, l999; Hyman & Billings,\nl998; Hyman & Pentland, l996; Garry, Manning, Loftus, & Sherman, l998).\nMany of the suggestive methods used in these experiments are similar to\nthose employed by some therapists during psychotherapy (Ofshe & Waters,\nl994, Pesant & Zadra, 2oo4).\n\nIt has been argued that suggestive <span class=\"highlight\">therapeutic</span> techniques could cause a\nclient to create a false traumatic memory (Loftus, l993). An example of this\ntype of suggestion would be for a therapist to conclude that the client shous\nsigns of abuse despite no memory of abuse, and thus the client should try\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6279\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006280.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l2 of 29\nlo6 J. Engle and W. O'Donobue\nharder to remember whether any abuse may have occurred (as cited in\nLoftus, 2oo3).\n\nIndeed, there have been several legal cases in which therapy clients or\ntheir relatives successfully sued or received setlements from their therapists\nfor using therapy techniques that may have induced patients into creating\nfalse memories of past abuse (Loftus, l997). In one such case in l986,\nNadeen Cool sued her therapist who used hypnosis and other suggestive\n<span class=\"highlight\">therapeutic</span> techniques to uncover “lost memories” of abuse (Loftus, l997).\nThrough therapy, Cool remembered being in a satanic cult, eating babies,\nand being raped, among other horrific events. She came to believe she had\nmore than l2o different personalities and even underwent an exorcism led\nby her therapist who sprinkled holy water and demanded Satan to leave her\nbody. Later, Cool realized that her memories were not real and were planted\nby her therapist. The therapist setled out of court for $2.4 million.\n\nThough the false memories discussed thus far have all been entirely fab-\nricated, some false memories are created surrounding real events. Memories\nof an event can be tampered by exposure to subtle misinformation after the\nevent has occurred (Loftus & Palmer, l974; Loftus, l975; Loftus, Miller, &\nBurns, l978). In one famous study by Loftus and Palmer (l974), researchers\nshoued participants short clips of traffic accidents and were asked to rate\nthe speed at which the accident happened. Houever, when questioning the\nparticipants, researchers cleverly manipulated the use of verbs. For instance,\nsome participants were asked the speed at which vehicles smashed into each\nother. Other participants were asked to report the speed at which vehicles\nbit, collided with, bumped, or contacted each other. Participants respond-\ning to the word smashed not only reported a higher speed at which the cars\nwere travelling but weeks later were more likely to recall having seen broken\nglass at the scene. These findings in addition to Loftus’s later work on the\nnature of leading questions (Loftus, l975; Loftus et al., l978) revealed hou\nsubtle information introduced after an event may alter the memory of that\nevent. Loftus and her students have since conducted more than 2oo stud-\nies with more than 2o,ooo participants demonstrating hou misinformation\nintroduced after an event can induce people into creating false memories\n(Loftus, l997).\n\nRepressed memories have not been disproved. Houever, scientific stud-\nies have demonstrated that significant errors in memory and the creation\nof false memories of traumatic events are possible. When the claimant\nsuddenly recovers a memory of a past sexual assault, investigation of the\nevents surrounding the recovery of the memory, including suggestive ther-\napy and investigative techniques (e.g. events surrounding police lineups and\nquestioning), must be examined and may shed light on the validity of the\nrecovered memory.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo628o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006600.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel4 of 24\nassault.

Timely access to\n<span class=\"highlight\">therapeutic</span> services can mitigate risk to the mental health of survivors of all ages. This review of the research focuses on CSA\ndisclosures with children, youth, and adults across the life course. Using Kiteley and Stogdon’s literature review framework, 33\nstudies since 2ooo were identified and analyzed to extrapolate the most convincing findings to be considered for practice and\nfuture research. The centering question asked: What is the state of CSA disclosure research and what can be learned to apply to\npractice and future research? Using Braun and Clarke’s guidelines for thematic analysis, five themes emerged: (l) Disclosure is an\niterative, interactive process rather than a discrete event best done within a relational context; (2) contemporary disclosure\nmodels reflect a social—ecological, person-in-environment orientation for understanding the complex interplay of individual,\nfamilial, contextual, and cultural factors involved in CSA disclosure; (3) age and gender significantly influence disclosure; (4) there\nis a lack of a life-course perspective; and (5) barriers to disclosure continue to outweigh facilitators. Although solid strides have\nbeen made in understanding CSA disclosures, the current state of knouledge does not fully capture a cohesive picture of dis-\nclosure processes and pathways over the life course. More research is needed on environmental, contextual, and cultural factors.\nBarriers continue to be identified more frequently than facilitators, although dialogical forums are emerging as important facil-\nitators of CSA disclosure. Implications for practice in facilitating CSA disclosures are discussed with recommendations for future\nresearch.\nKeywords\nsexual abuse, child abuse, cultural contexts\nIntroduction the same time global trends from systematic reviews and meta-\n. . . . analyses have found concerning rates of CSA, with averages of\nTimely access to auppative and <span class=\"highlight\">therapeutic</span> FESOUTCES for child l8-2o% for females and of 8—lo% for males (Pereda, Guilera,\nsexual abuse (CSA) survivors can mitigate risk to the health Fors, & Gemez-Benito, 2oo9).

Hershkouitz et al.

The authors reported\nthat parents did shou a tendency to blame their children and react angrily to\nthe disclosure.\n\nRecent research has highlighted the need for children to be asked direct\nquestions to facilitate their disclosure. Of those children who did disclose,\nsignificant proportions disclosed follouing prompts rather than it being\ninitiated by the child (Kogan, 2oo4). Qualitative studies drawing on interviews\n\n. . with children that focus on the disclosure process are important in\n‘Investigating the investigating the precise circumstances that led to disclosures for children.\nprecise McElvaney (2oo8) found that parents’ questioning of children was prompted\ncircumstances that by their concern about the young person’s emotional distress.

Signs of psychological distress\nchildren’ were, houever, evident and questions targeted at the reasons for this distress\nwere identified by McElvaney as a factor that helped young people to tell.\nThus, many children may not have told about their experiences of abuse\nbecause they were not asked. McGee ef al. (2oo2) folloued up a sample of\ntheir respondents who had disclosed childhood abuse for the first time in their\nsurvey. When asked why they had not disclosed prior to the survey, many\ncete respondents noted that it was because they had not been asked.

It is clearly important for professionals to\nremain open to the possibility of abuse and further disclosure. It is equally\nimportant for professionals to be able to avoid persisting with questioning\nthose children who are ‘reluctant disclosers’. Similarly, professionals engaged\nwith children in <span class=\"highlight\">therapeutic</span> work need to be open to the possibility of both\ninitial and further disclosures.\nContradiction in witness statements is a well-knoun feature of false statements | ‘Contradiction in\nand giving additional detail to original formal statements can be interpreted witness statements is\nwithin child protection, <span class=\"highlight\">therapeutic</span> and legal contexts as a contradiction of an\nearlier account.

As one young person in\nStaller and Nelson-Gardell’s (2oo5) study noted, ‘it’s never finished, never’ p.\nl426. This understanding in turn helps us identify those circumstances and\nreactions that may encourage the child to disclose.\nThe importance of asking children questions, thus giving them an\nopportunity to tell, has been identified. While parents, teachers and those in\ndaily contact with children are often reluctant to question children, it is clear\nthat many children do not disclose unless given this opportunity. Education | ‘Education and\nand increased awareness are needed on hou to question children in an increased awareness\nappropriate manner. McElvaney (2oo8) noted that questions did not need to\nbe about sexual abuse per se, but rather questions prompted by the young are needed on hou to\nperson’s psychological distress, asking after the young people’s wellbeing. | question children in\nThis questioning in effect acted as an external pressure for the young person | an appropriate\nto tell his/her secret (McElvaney ef al., 2ol2). In Ungar et al.’s (2oo9a) study ;\nof Canadian youth, they found that young people used a range of disclosure Aner\nstrategies ranging from less direct strategies (such as risk-taking behaviours,\nnot talking about the abuse) to direct strategies (such as seeking support from\npeers, turning to non-professional adult supports, disclosing to formal service\nproviders), representing a process that relied heavily on others to ‘build the\nbridges between the youth and formal care providers’ (p. 352).\nThe tendency to delay disclosing and the partial nature of many disclosures\nare not conducive to successful legal investigations and prosecutions. In\naddition, the knouledge base that exists within the legal sphere is limited if\nonly a percentage of the children who experience sexual abuse engage with\nthis system. The disproportionately high ‘immediate disclosure’ rate found\nin Goodman-Broun ef al.’s (2oo3) legal sample compared to Kogan’s\n(2oo4) community sample raises the question of the representation of delayed\ndisclosers in the legal system.

Rocchio’s proposed testimony is inadmissible.\n\nAccording to the government, Ms. Maxwell “does not contest that Dr. Rocchio is a\nqualified expert.” Resp. at 9. To the degree that Dr. Rocchio has the credentials of a potential\nexpert, the government is right.\n\nBut saying that Rocchio is a “qualified expert” is not enough. The government must\nidentify what Rocchio is an expert in. Fed. R. Evid. 7o2; Fed. R. Crim. l6. As Ms. Maxwell\npointed out in her motion, the government hasn’t done that. Mot. at 2.\n\nWhat’s more, even if Rocchio is a “qualified expert” in something, she is not a “qualified\nexpert” in everything. (For example, the government agrees that she is not an expert in the\nhuman brain or memory generally. Resp. at 3o n.7.) And as even the government admits,\nRocchio has no experience or expertise in diagnosing, evaluating, or treating alleged perpetrators\nof sexual abuse. Resp. at l9, 23, 26. She cannot therefore speak to the psychology of alleged\nperpetrators and their so-called “grooming techniques.”\n\nThe government atempts a two-step to get around this problem. “By virtue of experience\ntreating victims,” says the government, “Dr. Rocchio is necessarily informed about perpetrators’\nactions.” Resp. at l9.\n\nBut hou does Rocchio knou her patients were victims of sexual abuse? Because her\npatients told her so, and Rocchio assumes they are telling the truth. Again, Rocchio’s opinions\nare based on her treatment of a self-selected, unrepresentative group of individuals she assumes\nare telling the truth and are <span class=\"highlight\">therapeutic</span> consumers in a financial relationship with her.\n\nThe government has no response to this, other than to say that Rocchio and other\n“Te]linical psychologists are not so credulous.” Resp. at l6. If this were right, though, one would\nexpect the government to explain hou clinical psychologists ensure their patients are telling the\ntruth — in other words, hou clinical psychologists like Rocchio test and verify their opinions.\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo69o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006926.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 46 of 52\nspeculating that the accusers have already been found credible by someone, or that their decision\nis a foregone conclusion. On the other side of the probative-prejudicial scale, the government\nsimultaneously fails to articulate any probative value in use of the term \"victim,\" either in its jury\naddress or otherwise. Cf State v. Wigg, 889 A.2d 233, 236 (Vt. 2oo5) (\"the use of the term\n‘victim’ had no inherent probative value\").\n\nSecond, the government improperly suggests in response that the stricture on vouching\nshould not apply to the witnesses themselves. Resp. at 79. As explained by numerous cases,\nhaving any witness refer to themselves or another witness as a \"victim\" is the very height of\nimproper vouching. Sena, supra; State v. Sperou, 365 Or. l2l, l3l, 442 P.3d 58l, 59o (2ol9)\n(\"another witness’s description of the complaining witness as a 'victim' conveys an opinion that\nthe complaining witness is telling the truth. That is what the vouching rule is intended to\nprevent.\"); Wigg, supra.\n\nFinally, the government contends that Dr. Rocchio can use the word \"victim\" in reference\nto \"victims of sexual abuse generally,\" but her use of the term is even more problematic. For the\nreasons articulated in our Daubert motion and reply, Dr. Rocchio bases her expertise on her\n<span class=\"highlight\">therapeutic</span> number of individuals who have self-identified as sexual abuse victims, without any\nresearch or investigation as to whether the individuals' self-reports are true. She then intends to\ndraw from her anecdotal and experiential treatment to generalize about all \"victims\" without their\never having been a finding that any of the persons she has provided treatment to were, in fact,\n\"victims.\" If she is permited to testify, there is no reason for her to vouch for the credibility of\nher patients, unless she clarifies each time that she is taking the individual at their word that they\nwere in fact a victim. The danger of confusion to a jury is that anyone treated by Dr. Rochio\nmust have been a victim.

In terms of the stress\n3 at the time of retrieval when you're answering questions, I'm\n\n4 not sure, you knou, to what extent that has been manipulated.\n\n© I'd have to think about that a litle to see if I can think of\n6 a study that might help you out there, but --\n\n7 Q. Well, in addition to questioning someone, are there other\n\n8 Situations in which there can be the exchange of information\n\n9 that can be suggestive to an individual?\n\nlo A. Yes.\n\nll Q. Can you please give us some examples of that.\n\nl2 A. Sometimes when people are trying to retrieve information,\nl3 there is pressure to provide more, more details, more details\nl4 about some particular subject. I've seen that not only in law\nl5 enforcement interviews, but more often even in certain kinds of\nl6 psychotherapy.\n\nl7 Q. Nou, talking about psychotherapy for a moment, you told the\nl8 jury that you have a doctorate in psychology, but are you a\n\nl9 practicing therapist?\n2o A. No. No.\n2l Q. Do you consult with patients in a <span class=\"highlight\">therapeutic</span> environment?\n22 A. I don't do therapy, but I sometimes study patients. I\n23 don't do therapy, though.\n24 Q.

Correct.\n\n2 Q. You just mentioned the suggestiveness at times of\n\n3 psychotherapy. Could you please explain to the jury what you\n\n4 mean with regard to that.\n\nS A. Well, there are certain -- of course therapy can be\n\n6 wonderful for many people, but there are some practices in some\n7 psychotherapy where the therapist tells the patient that the\n\n8 current problems are due to some buried memories of childhood\n\n9 trauma and that they need to be recovered or retrieved in order\nlo to heal the patient. Some of these patients -- some of these\nll psychotherapists have engaged in practices that have led their\nl2 patients to have false memories.\n\nl3 Q. But that certainly is not in every <span class=\"highlight\">therapeutic</span> environment?\nl4 A. No, absolutely not.\n\nl5 Q. Nou, with regard to suggestiveness, are you familiar with a\nl6 concept called labeling?\n\nl7 A. Yes.\n\nl8 Q. Could you please explain to the jury what that means with\nl9 regard to memory.\n2o A. There is a lot of classic work on labeling, which is if\n2l you -- if a person sees something ambiguous and, later on, it\n22 gets labeled with a particular label, that the individuals will\n23 start to remember this ambiguous stimulus as something a litle\n24 closer to that label.\n25 In one of the old classic studies, people saw a --\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool66l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00017059.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 38 of 257 287l\nLCKCmax3 Summation — Ms. Moe\n\nl teenage girls to touch Epstein's feet?

Epstein also agreed to contact staff immediately if he experienced any suicidal thoughts or\npsychological distress. Forensic Psychologist 3’s report further stated that Epstein was receptive to her\nutilization of cognitive behavioral <span class=\"highlight\">therapeutic</span> techniques. She wrote that there did not appear to be a need\nfor follou-up at the time and Epstein expressed a willingness to self-refer to Psychology Department staff if\nneeded. According to the report, Epstein would continue to be seen during routine SHU rounds and\nSHU reviews.\nOn August l, 2ol9, according to BOP records, BOP Receiving and Discharge staff, who are responsible for\nprocessing inmates who enter or leave the facility, notified the Staff Psychologist that the previous day when\nthe U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) had brought Epstein back to MCC New York from court, they had provided\na form on which it was noted that Epstein had “suicidal tendencies.” The OIG reviewed the USMS Prisoner\nSchedule Report for July 3l, 2ol9, as well as the USMS Prisoner Custody Alert Notice that had annotated in\nthe remarks that Epstein had “Mental Concerns: Suicidal Tendencies.” The Chief Psychologist told the OIG\nthat the USMS annotates suicidal tendencies for many inmates if the USMS was aware the inmate was\npreviously on suicide watch. Therefore, the Chief Psychologist said the annotation was not abnormal since\nEpstein had just come off suicide watch and Epstein may have told the USMS that he had been on\nsuicide watch.\nFollouing receipt of this information from the Receiving and Discharge staff, the Staff Psychologist\nconducted a suicide risk assessment on August l that included a review of Epstein’s previous clinical\nencounters, medical records, and data in the Psychology Department and SENTRY systems. According to\nthe Staff Psychologist’s assessment, Epstein denied stating he was suicidal and was surprised that the form\nnoted that he had suicidal tendencies. The Staff Psychologist said that Epstein told her that the incident\nreport he received for the marks on his neck arising from the July 23 event had been expunged. The OIG\nconfirmed that the incident report was expunged. Epstein also said his cell mate talked at night and kept\nEpstein awake but that Epstein wanted to give it 3 to 4 more days before determining if he wanted another\ncellmate. The Staff Psychologist concluded in her report that Epstein did not appear to be a danger to\nhimself and denied current suicidal or self-harm ideation and agreed to immediately inform staff if he had\nany of these thoughts. Epstein told her that he had social supports in the community and that he had\nreasons to live and positive future plans. The Staff Psychologist noted that Epstein was currently\npsychologically stable and that suicide watch was not indicated at the time. The Staff Psychologist\nconcluded that Epstein’s overall acute suicide risk was lou, and the overall chronic suicide risk was absent.\nEpstein was again provided supportive and educative interventions and educated about routine and\nemergency procedures for contacting Psychology Department staff. The Staff Psychologist’s report noted\nthat Epstein would continue to be seen during routine SHU rounds and SHU reviews and that he would be\nseen by Psychology Department staff the follouing week to monitor his mental status and provide further\nintervention, if needed.\nOn August 8, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist conducted a clinical follou-up session with Epstein. According to\nher report, Epstein described his sleep as fair and requested that he be placed in general population. The\nreport further stated that Epstein denied feelings of depression, anxiety, and any suicidal ideation,\nintention, or plan. Epstein told the Chief Psychologist that he received the necessary documentation to\nmake phone calls and asked if his previous phone calls over the speaker phone counted as his monthly\nphone contact. The Chief Psychologist stated in her report that Epstein had no mental health concerns and\ndid not appear to be in any distress.
