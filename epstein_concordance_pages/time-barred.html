Ironically, her level of flight risk increases as the strength of government’s case\nagainst her diminishes. Ms. Maxwell has challenged the strength of the government’s case\nin pretrial motions pending before the Court. Among other things, Ms. Maxwell has\npersuasively argued that the Non-Prosecution Agreement entered into by Jeffrey Epstein in\n2oo7, which immunizes “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” bars Ms. Maxwell’s\nprosecution in this case, and that the counts charging her with alleged sexual abuse are\n<span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span>.\n\nThe government’s response to Ms. Maxwell’s pretrial motions shines further light\nof the weaknesses of its case.

The Government agrees that no redactions are necessary\nas to those particular motions. The Government agrees with the defendant’s proposed redactions\nto the remaining pre-trial motions for the follouing reasons:\n\ne The proposed redactions to the defendant’s motion to dismiss for breach of the non-\nprosecution agreement (Motion l) and the motion to dismiss for pre-indictment\ndelay (Motion 7) refer to documents designated by the Government as\n“Confidential” within the meaning of the Protective Order in this case (see\nProtective Order 4 l5 (Dkt. 36)), and the proposed redactions are narrouly tailored\nto protect the integrity of the Government’s ongoing investigation.

Counts\nOne through Four charge Ms. Maxwell with offenses allegedly commited between l994 and\nl997. But the applicable statute of limitations, l8 U.S.C. § 3282, expired five years after the\nalleged conduct.\n\nIn an atempt to get around its statute of limitations problem, the government has invoked\nl8 U.S.C. § 3283, as that statute was amended in 2oo3—many years after the alleged conduct\noccurred. But the government’s reliance on that provision is improper for two separate and\nindependent reasons, either of which, by itself, mandates dismissal of Counts One through Four.\n\nFirst, the charges are <span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span> even under § 3283 unless the Court retroactively\napplies the 2oo3 amendment to the statute to cover Ms. Maxwell’s conduct from the l99os,\nrather than the version of § 3283 that was in effect at the time of the alleged offenses. But\nCongress made surpassingly clear that it did not intend the 2oo3 amendment to apply\nretroactively. To the contrary, the conference commitee considered and rejected an express\nretroactivity provision in the House version of the bill, and one of the bill’s original Senate co-\nsponsors acknouledged on the Senate floor that the omission was intentional. Moreover, any\nsuch retroactive application would have a presumptively impermissible retroactive effect.\n\nSecond, even if the 2oo3 amendment could be applied retroactively, § 3283 does not\napply to any of the offenses alleged in the indictment at all. Section 3283 is an exception to the\ngeneral five-year statute of limitations, and it applies only to an “offense involving” the sexual or\nphysical abuse or kidnapping of a child. The Supreme Court has repeatedly made clear that the\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2655\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002657.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 9 of 25\nthat Minor Victim-l would engage in one or more sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, in violation of\nNew York Penal Law, Section l3o.55.” Id. § l9.\nARGUMENT\n\n“Except as otherwise expressly provided by law,” a non-capital criminal offense must be\n\ncharged “within five years next after such offense shall have been commited.” l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3282(a); see l8 U.S.C. § 3282 (l994) (same). Because Counts One through Four charge Ms.\nMaxwell with offenses that were completed no later than l997, and because the indictment was\nnot returned until July 2o2o, these counts are <span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span> unless “otherwise expressly provided\nby law.” Id.\n\nFor two independent reasons, § 3283, on which the government relies (see Government’s\nMemorandum in Support of Detention (““Gov. Mem.”), Dkt. No. 4, (filed Jul. 2, 2o2o), at 5),\ndoes not save Counts One through Four. First, under the version of § 3283 that was in effect at\nthe time of the alleged offenses, the limitations period expired when the accuser reached the age\nof 25, which indisputably occurred many years ago here. l8 U.S.C. § 3283 (l994). While\nCongress amended the statute in 2oo3 to extend the limitations period to “during the life of the\nchild,” see Prosecutorial Remedies and Tools Against the Exploitation of Children Today Act of\n2oo3 (PROTECT Act) (the “2oo3 Amendment”), PL lo8-2l, April 3o, 2oo3, § 2o2, ll7 Stat.\n65o, 66o, that amendment cannot apply to conduct that occurred during the l99os. Second, by\nits plain terms, § 3283 applies only to offenses “involving the sexual or physical abuse, or\nkidnaping, of a child.” l8 U.S.C. § 3283. But the sexual or physical abuse or kidnaping of a\nchild is not an element of any of the offenses charged here. Accordingly, § 3283—regardless of\nwhich version is considered—simply does not apply.\n\nI. The 2oo3 Amendment Does Not Apply Retroactively.\nAt the time of the alleged offenses, § 3283 provided as follous:\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2657\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002658.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page lo of 25\n\nNo statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution for an offense\n\ninvolving the sexual or physical abuse of a child under the age of l8 years shall\n\npreclude such prosecution before the child reaches the age of 25 years.\n\nl8 U.S.C. § 3283 (l994). Thus, if an individual commited an offense involving the sexual or\nphysical abuse of a l6-year-old person on June l, l994, and the victim reached age l7 on July l,\nl994, then the statute of limitations as to that offense would have expired on July l, 2oo2, when\nthe victim reached age 25—-such that an indictment in 2o2o would be <span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span>. There is no\ndispute that all three of the accusers here turned 25 long ago, and thus the statute of limitations in\neffect at the time of the offenses has expired.\n\nIn 2oo3, houever, Congress amended the statute and extended the time in which a\nprosecution could be brought to within the life of the victim. See 2oo3 Amendment at 66o.7 l8\nU.S.C. § 3283, as amended in 2oo3, provided as follous:\n\nNo statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution for an offense\n\ninvolving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child under the age of\n\nl8 years shall preclude such prosecution during the life of the child.\n\nl8 U.S.C. § 3283 (2oo3). While the government would apply the 2oo3 Amendment retroactively\nto offenses Ms. Maxwell is alleged to have commited years earlier, nothing in the text suggests\nthat the statute may be applied retroactively.\n\nTo the contrary, the Supreme Court has repeatedly stressed a strong “presumption against\nretroactive legislation” that is “deeply rooted in our jurisprudence.” Landgraf v. USI Film Prod.,\n5ll USS. 244, 265 (l994) (emphasis added). “[T]he principle that the legal effect of conduct\nshould ordinarily be assessed under the law that existed when the conduct took place has\ntimeless and universal appeal.” /d. (internal quotation omited). “Retroactivity is not favored in\n° The statute was amended again in 2oo6 to its current version, which further modifies the limitations period to the\nlife of the victim or lo years after the offense, whichever is longer. l8 U.S.C. § 3283. Because all three of the\nalleged victims identified in Counts One through Four are alive, the 2oo6 amendment does not affect the analysis\nhere. Moreover, the government relies on the 2oo3 Amendment. Gov. Mem. at 5-6.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2658\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002660.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l2 of 25\nretroactivity provision in the 2oo3 Amendment; it actually considered and rejected such a\nprovision, signaling its clear intent that the amendment not be retroactive. Accordingly, the\nLandgraf analysis should end at step one, with a determination that the 2oo3 Amendment is not\nretroactive and that Counts One through Four are therefore <span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span>. Houever, even if the\nanalysis advances to step two, application of the 2oo3 Amendment to Ms. Maxwell’s alleged\nconduct would create impermissible retroactive effects in violation of Landgraf by expanding a\ncriminal statute of limitations.\n\nA. Step One: Congress did not expressly prescribe retroactivity and rejected a\n\nproposal to do so.\n\nThe first step of Landgraf asks whether Congress “expressly prescribed” the temporal\nreach of the 2oo3 Amendment. Here, Congress “expressly prescribed” that the 2oo3\nAmendment was to apply prospectively only. Not only does the text of the 2oo3 Amendment\nomit any mention of retroactivity, but the legislative history makes it absolutely clear that\nCongress considered and rejected a retroactivity provision. Because such unambiguous\ncongressional intent is sufficient to constitute an “express prescription” under the first step of\nLandgraf that the amendment not be retroactive, there is no need to proceed to the second\nLandgraf step.\n\n“(Where the congressional intent is clear, it governs.” Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 264\n(quoting Kaiser Aluminum & Chem. Corp. v. Bonjorno, 494 U.S. 827, 837 (l99o)). Here, the\nlegislative history leaves no doubt as to congressional intent. The House version of the bill,\nwhich would have eliminated the statute of limitations entirely, included an express retroactivity\nprovision. Child Abduction Prevention Act, H.R. llo4, lo8th Cong. § 2o2 (2oo3) (“The\namendments made by this section shall apply to the prosecution of any offense commited\nbefore, on, or after the date of the enactment of this section.”).

Jd. at 58.°\n\nCongressional intent here could not be clearer. The House bill would have made the\n2oo3 Amendment retroactive, the Senate bill did not, and the conference consciously rejected the\nretroactivity provision. It is unnecessary to proceed to the second Landgraf step, and Counts\nOne through Four are <span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span>.\n\nB. Step Two: Application of the 2oo3 Amendment to Ms. Maxwell’s alleged\n\noffenses would have impermissible effects.\n\nIf the Court were to proceed to the second Landgraf step—whether application of the\n2oo3 Amendment here would have an impermissible retroactive effect—that step also counsels\nagainst retroactivity.\n\nAny analysis of the retroactivity of a criminal statute of limitations under the second step\nof Landgraf must be undertaken in conjunction with the principle that unlike civil statutes of\nlimitation, “criminal limitations statutes are ‘to be liberally interpreted in favor of repose.’”\nToussie, 397 U.S. at ll5 (quoting Scharton, 285 U.S. at 522). As one court recognized in\ndeclining to extend a criminal statute of limitations to pre-enactment conduct, if Landgraf and\nToussie “are read in conjunction,” courts “must interpret the statute of limitations in a manner\nfavoring repose for Defendant.” United States v. Gentile, 235 F. Supp. 3d 649, 655 (D.N.J.\n2ol7).\n\n* Nor was this clear evidence of congressional intent raised or considered in United States v. Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL\n4o43l4o (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2ol8), which the government cites in support of its contention that the 2oo3\nAmendment may be applied retroactively. Gov.

See, e.g., Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 57-58 (2d Cir. 2ol7)\n(collecting and comparing civil cases). The criminal context, houever, is fundamentally\ndifferent.\n\nAta minimum, Toussie “potentially alters the second step in the Landgraf approach” in\ncriminal cases. United States v. Miller, 9ll F.3d 638, 645 (lst Cir. 2ol8) (evaluating 2oo3\nAmendment in adjudicating ineffective assistance of counsel claim). “In other words, when\nCongress has sounded an uncertain trumpet, a court ought to refrain from applying an enlarged\ncriminal statute of limitations retrospectively.” Jd. As shoun in the first step of Landgraf, the\ntrumpet sounded by Congress in enacting the 2oo3 Amendment was anything but uncertain:\ncongressional intent is clear.\n\nIn the criminal context, the retroactive application of an extended statute of limitations to\nrevive a <span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span> claim is not merely an impermissible effect under Landgraf; it violates the\nEx Post Facto Clause. Stogner v. California, 539 U.S. 6o7, 6l8 (2oo3).* As Landgraf itself\nrecognized, houever, the principle against retroactivity is not simply an application of the Ex\nPost Facto Clause; rather, it is a “deeply rooted” presumption based on “[e]lementary\nconsiderations” of fundamental “fairness.” Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 265-66. See also Thom v.\nAshcroft, 369 F.3d l58, l63 n.6 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (Calabresi, J., writing for the majority but noting\nhe was speaking for himself) (stating that anti-retroactivity presumption in Landgraf is “triggered\n+ For this reason, the government would be barred from prosecuting Ms. Maxwell for any offense against the third\naccuser (identified in the indictment as Minor Victim-3) even if the 2oo3 Amendment otherwise applied, because\nthe third accuser reached age 25 in a. and thus the statute of limitations as to her had expired by the time\nof the 2oo3 Amendment.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2664\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002665.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l7 of 25\nby statutes whose retroactive application, while not the equivalent of criminal ex post facto,\nnevertheless would run afoul of ‘familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and\nsetled expectations.’”) Thus, in the criminal context, the second step of Landgraf should be read\nas providing protections broader than simply violations of the Ex Post Facto Clause, and as\nprohibiting retroactive application of a criminal statute of limitations—and the resulting\nexpansion of an individual’s exposure to criminal liability for completed conduct—even where\nthe charge is not <span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span> at the time of the amendment.\n\nStatutes of limitations “applicable to criminal prosecutions are designed principally to\nprotect individuals from having to defend themselves against charges supported by facts that are\nremote in time.” United States v. Rivera-Ventura, 72 F.3d 277, 28l (2d Cir. l995). That\nconcern is heightened here, where the government seeks to rely on the retroactive extension of a\ncriminal statute of limitations to prosecute a case based on conduct more than two decades old,\nwith litle, if any, evidence other than witness testimony. See Toussie, 397 U.S. at ll5\n(observing that statute of limitations “may also have the salutary effect of encouraging law\nenforcement officials promptly to investigate suspected criminal activity”). Since the time of the\nalleged conduct, memories have become faded or corrupted, documents have been lost or\ndestroyed, and witnesses have died, all to the extreme prejudice of Ms. Maxwell.” Retroactively\napplying the 2oo3 Amendment here not only would fly in the face of congressional intent; it\nwould violate all notions of fundamental fairness.°\n> See Motion to Dismiss Counts One through Six of the Superseding Indictment for Pre-Indictment Delay.\n\n° In Weingarten, the court stated that if the defendant’s counsel had successfully persuaded the trial court that the\n2oo3 Amendment could not retroactively extend the statute of limitations for live charges, the trial court’s holding\nwould have been in direct conflict with the Ninth Circuit’s opinion in United States v. Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d 92o\n(9th Cir. 2oo6). But in Leo Sure Chief, the alleged victim had not yet reached age 25 as of the time of the\nindictment, and thus the charges would not have been <span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span> under either version of § 3283. Thus, the court in\nLeo Sure Chief did not perform a Landgraf analysis.\n\nll\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2665\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002666.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l8 of 25\nIl. Section 3283 Does Not Apply at All.\n\nEven if the 2oo3 Amendment could be retroactively applied to Ms. Maxwell’s alleged\nconduct during the l99os, Counts One through Four would still be <span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span> for a separate and\nindependent reason: Section 3283 does not apply to the offenses with which Ms. Maxwell is\ncharged. Section 3283 extends the statute of limitations only for “offense[s] involving the sexual\nor physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child under the age of l8 years,” l8 U.S.C. § 3283, but none\nof the offenses charged in Counts One through Four is such an offense.’\n\nA. Section 3283 applies only to offenses that necessarily entail the sexual or\n\nphysical abuse, or kidnapping, of a child.\n\nA long line of cases establishes that an “offense” or “crime” that “involves” certain\nconduct means an offense that “necessarily requir[es]” that conduct. Shular v. United States, l4o\nS. Ct. 779, 785 (2o2o) (internal quotations omited). Those cases date back at least to Bridges v.\nUnited States, 346 U.S. 2o9 (l953), which construed the Wartime Suspension of Limitations\nAct’s extension of statutes of limitations for “any offense [] involving fraud or atempted fraud\nagainst the United States.” l8 U.S.C. § 3287 (l95o) (emphasis added). The Supreme Court held\nthat that extension was “limited strictly to offenses in which defrauding or atempting to defraud\nthe United States is an essential ingredient of the offense charged.” Bridges, 346 U.S. at 22l.\nThus, the Court held that charges that the defendant knouingly made and conspired to make\nfalse statements in a naturalization proceeding, and that he aided and abeted a fraudulent\ncertificate of naturalization, were subject to the general statute of limitations and not the\nexception, because “fraud is not an essential ingredient” of such offenses, and “[t]he offense is\ncomplete without proof of fraud, although fraud often accompanies it.” Jd. at 222.\n\n’ The words “or kidnaping” were added as part of the 2oo3 Amendment. 2oo3 Amendment at 66o.\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2666\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002668.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 2o of 25\nId. Similarly, an “offense involving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child under\nthe age of l8 years” is an offense in which such sexual abuse, physical abuse, or kidnapping is an\nelement of the offense.\n\nThe Eighth Circuit concluded as much in United States v. Coutentos, 65l F.3d 8o9 (8th\nCir. 2oll). There, the court held that § 3283 did not apply to a charge of possession of child\npornography. /d. at 8l7-l8. The court clearly looked to the elements of the statute, as the facts\nof the case did involve the sexual abuse of a child, including the production and possession of\nchild pornography. /d. at 8l3-l4. Yet the court held that, on the same set of facts, the offense of\npossession of child pornography did not involve sexual abuse and thus was subject to the general\nstatute of limitations, but the offense of production of child pornography did involve sexual\nabuse and was subject to § 3283: “That a producer of child pornography will possess it at the\ntime of the abuse is insufficient to change our view that the offense of possessing child\npornography itself does not involve an act against a child, i.e., the sexual abuse of a child.” Jd. at\n8l7.\n\nCoutentos demonstrates that the “offense involving” language of § 3283, as with other\nstatutes, requires the court to look to the elements of the offense, rather than the facts of a\nparticular case, to determine whether a particular offense “involves” the sexual or physical abuse\nor kidnapping of a child. /d. at 8l7. This approach makes practical sense: If the applicability of\n§ 3283 depended on the facts of a particular case, rather than the elements of the offense, the\ngovernment would effectively be required to prove conduct beyond the elements of the\noffense—i.e., that sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping occurred—in order to prove that its\ncharges are not <span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span>.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2668\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002685.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l46 Filed o2/o4/2l Page lo of l6\n\nA. The Indictment Is Insufficient to Allege a Conspiracy as to Accuser-3.\n\nTo establish a § 2422(a) conspiracy violation, the government must shou that Ms.\nMaxwell conspired to “knouingly persuade[], induce[], entice[], or coerce[] any individual to\ntravel in interstate or foreign commerce . . . to engage in prostitution, or in any sexual activity for\nwhich any person can be charged with a criminal offense.” l8 U.S.C. § 2422(a) (l996). To\nestablish a § 2423(a) conspiracy claim, the government must prove that Ms. Maxwell conspired\nto “knouingly transport[] an individual who ha[d] not atained the age of l8 years in interstate or\nforeign commerce . . . with intent that the individual engage in prostitution, or in any sexual\nactivity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense.” l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a)\n(l994); l8 U.S.C. § 2423 (l986).4\n\nThe government cannot shou that Ms. Maxwell conspired to commit either offense with\nrespect to Accuser-3. There is no allegation that Accuser-3 ever traveled in interstate or foreign\ncommerce, let alone that Ms. Maxwell, Epstein, or anyone else enticed her or otherwise caused\nher to do so. While the indictment alleges that Ms. Maxwell encouraged Accuser-3 to massage\nEpstein in England “knouing that Epstein intended to sexually abuse [Accuser-3] during those\nmassages” (Indictment 9 lld, l7d), it alleges no facts connecting those allegations to any\ncontemplated interstate or foreign travel by Accuser-3—for any purpose. The indictment thus\ndoes not come close to alleging facts that would establish a conspiracy to violate either § 2422(a)\nor § 2423(a) as to Accuser-3.\n\nMoreover, any charge arising out of a conspiracy with respect to Accuser-3 would be\n<span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span>. The government contends that the indictment is timely under l8 U.S.C. § 3283,\nwhich, at the time of the alleged offenses, provided that a prosecution involving an “offense\n“ Section 2423 was amended effective September l3, l994, to add a subsection (b) and make cosmetic adjustments,\nimmaterial here, to what is nou subsection (a).

While Congress amended the statute\nin 2oo3 to extend the time in which a prosecution could be brought to within the life of the\nvictim, l8 U.S.C. § 3283 (2oo3), Accuser-3 reached the age of 25 in a. and thus the\nstatute of limitations as to her had expired before the time of the amendment. While Ms.\nMaxwell contends that § 3283 cannot be applied retroactively at all, and is inapplicable in any\nevent,’ it is black-leter law that retroactive application of a criminal statute of limitations to\nrevive a <span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span> claim would violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. Stogner v. California, 539\nU.S. 6o7, 6l8 (2oo3). Thus, there can be no prosecution for any conduct alleged as to Accuser-\n3.\n\nB.

Because, as shoun above, the allegations in the indictment are insufficient to\nallege such a conspiracy as to Accuser-3, the only individuals as to whom the indictment even\narguably alleges such a conspiracy are Accuser-l and Accuser-2. The allegations regarding\nAccuser-3, houever, have nothing to do with any conspiracy as to Accuser-l or Accuser-2.\n\nWhile the government couches the allegations regarding Minor Victim-3 as “overt acts”\nin furtherance of the conspiracies alleged in Counts One and Three, they are not. The “scope of\nthe conspiratorial agreement” is the key to determining whether “an overt act may properly be\nregarded as in furtherance of the conspiracy.” United States v. Benussi, 2l6 F.

Ironically, her level of flight risk increases as the strength of government’s case\nagainst her diminishes. Ms. Maxwell has challenged the strength of the government’s case\nin pretrial motions pending before the Court. Among other things, Ms. Maxwell has\npersuasively argued that the Non-Prosecution Agreement entered into by Jeffrey Epstein in\n2oo7, which immunizes “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” bars Ms. Maxwell’s\nprosecution in this case, and that the counts charging her with alleged sexual abuse are\n<span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span>.\n\nThe government’s response to Ms. Maxwell’s pretrial motions shines further light\nof the weaknesses of its case.

Critically—and as discussed in greater detail belou—there is no Ex Post Facto\nClause issue in this case, because the statute of limitations for Counts One through Four had not\nyet expired when the limitations period was extended in 2oo3.\"\n\nAccepting the defendant’s argument would undermine Congress’s plain purpose in\nextending the limitations period. In l99o, 2oo3, and 2oo6, Congress extended—and ultimately\nabolished—the statute of limitations to ensure that prosecutors could seek justice for child sex\nabuse victims who come forward or identify their abusers after a delay. Applying the 2oo3 statute\nonly prospectively subverts that purpose by exempting all past offenders. According to the\n‘4 Moreover, the fact that Congress considered, but ultimately omited, retroactivity language does\nnot end the Landgraf inquiry, as the defendant suggests. Indeed, Landgraf itself makes this clear.\nIn that case, the statute at issue had a predecessor, which contained a retroactivity provision. That\nversion was vetoed by the President, and the final version of the statute omited the retroactivity\nprovision. As the Supreme Court explained, “[t]he omission of the elaborate retroactivity\nprovision of the l99o bill—which was by no means the only source of political controversy over\nthat legislation—is not dispositive because it does not tell us precisely where the compromise was\nstruck in the l99l Act.” Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 256. Indeed, “[i]t [was] entirely possible—indeed,\nhighly probable—that, because it was unable to resolve the retroactivity issue with the clarity of\nthe l99o legislation, Congress viewed the mater as an open issue to be resolved by the courts.”\nTd. at 26l.\n\n'S Minor Victim-l and Minor Victim-2 were both younger than 25 in 2oo3, when Congress\nextended the limitations period. Minor Victim-3 was not, but this does not alter the inquiry,\nbecause the Indictment does not contain any counts that relate to Minor Victim-3 alone. Instead,\nshe is one of multiple victims of the conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three. The inclusion\nof the overt acts relating to Minor Victim-3 in an otherwise timely conspiracy count does not\nrender that count untimely. To the contrary, for conspiracy counts, the Government is only\nrequired to prove that one overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy occurred within the limitations\nperiod. United States v. Ben Zvi, 242 F.3d 89, 97 (2d Cir. 2ool). Thus, the defendant is incorrect\nto assert that the government is “barred” from prosecuting the defendant for any offense against\nMinor Victim-3. (Def. Mot. 2 at lo, n.3). Instead, there is no statute of limitations issue here so\nlong as the jury is properly instructed at trial that it must find at least one overt act within the\nlimitations period—i.e., one overt act that does not relate to Minor Victim-3.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2992\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002994.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 6o of 239\n773 F.3d l38, l45 (4th Cir. 2ol4) (“[A]pplying [an] extended limitations period to claims that\nwere unexpired at the time of its enactment does not give rise to an impermissible retroactive effect\nunder Landgraf.”’).\n\nThe Second Circuit has considered in three cases whether retroactive statutes of limitation\nare permissible under Landgraf. In Vernon v. Cassadaga Valley Cent.

Vernon, 49 F.3d. at 89o-9l.\nIn In re Enterprise Mortgage Acceptance Co., 39l F.3d 4ol (2d Cir. 2oo4), the Second Circuit\nheld that applying an extended statute of limitations retroactively created impermissible retroactive\neffects.

United States, 23 F.2d 42o, 425-26 (2d Cir. l928). The distinction between statutes that\nrevive expired prosecutions and those that extend existing limitations periods has deep roots in\nestablished jurisprudence. It is well-setled that the Ex Post Facto Clause prohibits laws that revive\n<span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span> prosecutions, but permits laws that retroactively extend limitations periods. Stogner\nv. California, 539 U.S. 6o7, 632 (2oo3) (holding that the Ex Post Facto Clause does not “prevent\nthe State from extending time limits for . . . prosecutions not yet time barred.”); United States v.\nMorgan, ll3 F.3d l23o, l997 WL 2687l2, at *7 (2d Cir. l997) (unpublished opinion) (“The long-\nstanding rule in this circuit is that Congress has the pouer to extend the period of limitations\nwithout running afoul of the ex post facto clause, provided the original period has not already\nrun.”’) (citing Falter, 23 F.3d at 425-26). And other circuits have emphasized this distinction in\nthe context of Section 3283. Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d, at 922-25; Jeffries, 4o5 F.3d 685.\n\nRead together, the Second Circuit’s decisions in Weingarten, Vernon, Enterprise, and\nFalter establish that Congress may retroactively extend the limitations period for still-viable\nprosecutions. That is precisely what has occurred here, because the charges in the Indictment were\nstill timely when the 2oo3 amendment extended the limitations period. As a result, applying\nSection 3283 in this case does not create impermissible retroactive effects. Therefore, step two of\nLandgraf is satisfied, and Section 3283 applies retroactively.\n\nResisting this conclusion, the defendant asserts that, in the criminal context, Landgraf’s\nsecond step provides protections beyond the Ex Post Facto Clause. But that is not the law. See\nNader, 425 F. Supp. 3d at 63o (rejecting the argument that “there is ‘daylight’ between the Ex Post\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2995\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002996.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 62 of 239\nFacto Clause and Landgraf’s second step.”). Maxwell cites no precedent for the proposition that,\nin the criminal context, much less in the context of criminal statutes of limitations, Landgraf\nforecloses prosecutions permited by the Constitution. Maxwell instead cites dictum by a single\njudge in a non-criminal case that, “[i]f [he] were judging on a clean slate,” he would read Landgraf\nto prohibit some retroactive application of statutes that, “while not the equivalent of criminal ex\npost facto, nevertheless would run afoul of’ Landgraf’s considerations, and that he “expect[ed]\nthat the Supreme Court’s future decisions” would confirm such a reading. Thom v. Ashcroft, 369\nF.3d l58, l63 n.6 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (Calabresi, J., “[s]peaking only for [him]self’). That footnote is\ntoo slender a reed to support Maxwell’s entire motion to dismiss the Indictment as untimely.\nMoreover, Maxwell has identified no case in the intervening seventeen years in which the Supreme\nCourt has embraced Judge Calabresi’s view. See Nader, 425 F. Supp. 3d at 63l (finding arguments\nrelating to Judge Calabresi’s footnote unpersuasive, and concluding that Section 3283 applies\nretroactively under Landgraf). As Weingarten recognized, any court to hold that “retroactively\nextending a filing period for live charges is a presumptively impermissible retroactive effect under\nLandgraf’ will be the first to do so. 865 F.3d at 58.\n\nThe defendant also argues that “criminal limitations statutes are to be liberally interpreted\nin favor of repose,” relying on the Supreme Court’s decision in Toussie v. United States, 397 U.S.\nll2, ll5 (l97o). Toussie considered whether a person’s failure to register for the draft was a\ncontinuing offense subjecting him to prosecution eight years later, notwithstanding the five-year\nlimitations period in Section 3282. /d. at ll4. In that context, the Court invoked a presumption\nin favor of repose when determining whether the underlying conduct was <span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span>. But that\npresumption says nothing about whether Congress intended an extension of a statute of limitations\nto apply purely prospectively, a question governed by Landgraf. Only one case has applied\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2996\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003118.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l84 of 239\nagainst her. The Indictment also cites the relevant state criminal statute under which the defendant\nis charged constituting “sexual activity” within the language of both § 2422 and § 2243,\nspecifically, violations of New York Penal Law § l3o.55. Indictment 4 ll(b), l3, l7(b), l9. The\ndefendant cites no authority for her suggestion that by providing additional detail regarding hou\nthe defendant commited the charged crimes, the Government is somehou required to provide\neven more specificity beyond the basic elements of the crimes charged. Absent any such authority,\nand where there is no suggestion that the Indictment fails to allege the essential elements of each\ncrime charged, there is no basis to dismiss any of the counts in the Indictment.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the defendant’s sufficiency challenges to the Indictment fail as\na mater of law, and her motion to dismiss Counts One through Four should be denied.\nVIII. There Is No Basis to Strike Any Portion of the Indictment\n\nThe defendant moves to strike any reference to Minor Victim-3 from the Indictment,\nclaiming that—contrary to the plain terms of the Indictment—the events involving Minor Victim-\n3 are unrelated to the conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three and that some of that the\nallegations regarding Minor Victim-3 are unduly prejudicial. (Def. Mot. 6). The motion is\nbaseless. First, as the Indictment itself makes clear, the defendant’s and Epstein’s interactions\nwith Minor Victim-3 were part of a broader scheme and agreement to entice and transport minor\nvictims with intent to commit illegal sex acts. Even if Minor Victim-3 was not ultimately\ntransported as a minor, the core of a conspiracy is an agreement to engage in criminal conduct;\nthere is no legal requirement that the agreed upon crime be completed. Although Minor Victim-\n3’s experiences cannot alone form the basis of a timely substantive charge, both charged\nconspiracies include timely overt acts, and it is well established that a charged conspiracy can\nencompass otherwise <span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span> acts so long as at least one overt act in furtherance of the\n\nl57\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ll8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003125.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9l of 239\nAccordingly, overt acts that may, on their oun, be untimely can nevertheless serve as direct\nevidence of the existence of a charged conspiracy. See, e.g., United States v. Benussi, 2l6 F. Supp.\n2d 299, 3ol-o7, 3o9 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo2) (admiting evidence of otherwise untimely acts during\nconspiracy trial); cf’ United States v. Marcus, 628 F.3d 36, 43 (2d Cir. 2olo) (declining to vacate\na conviction on a statute with only prospective application when “the Government presented post-\nenactment evidence sufficient to satisfy the elements” in addition to evidence of relevant pre-\nenactment conduct). Evidence regarding Minor Victim-3 is thus admissible to prove the existence\nof the conspiracy, even if a conviction could not be supported based on her experiences alone.>?\n\nThe Government agrees with the defendant that Minor Victim-3 turned 25 before 2oo3\nand, as a result, a substantive count based exclusively on conduct involving Minor Victim-3 is\n<span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span>. As discussed above, houever, the conduct involving Minor Victim-l and Minor\nVictim-2 alleged in the Indictment is timely. Thus, if the jury concludes that the conspiracies\nexisted, involved either Minor Victim-l or Minor Victim-2, and included at least one overt act as\nto either Minor Victim-l or Minor Victim-2, then Counts One and Three are not <span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span>. See\nSalmonese, 352 F.3d at 6l4. Moreover, and so as to ensure that any count of conviction is based\non timely conduct, the Government would have no objection to an appropriate instruction from\n°° Asa fallback argument, the defense cites United States v. Hsia, 24 F. Supp. 2d l4 (D.D.C. l998),\nin which a District Judge concluded that alleged overt acts involving concealment or “cover-ups”\nwere not obviously within the scope of the charged conspiracy to defraud the United States by\nimpairing and impeding the Immigration and Naturalization Service. /d. at 2o, 24-26. Although\nthe Court denied the motion to strike the alleged surplusage, it ordered the prosecution to provide\na bill of particulars regarding the alleged acts of concealment. /d. at 26, 33. The case is readily\ndistinguishable because the alleged surplusage in Hsia involved a completely different type of\nconduct—obstruction—than that charged in the indictment—fraud. Here, by contrast, the\nallegations regarding Minor Victim-3 involve conduct that falls within the heartland of the\nconspiracy: grooming a minor girl to engage in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein. Moreover, in both\nthe Indictment and in this memorandum, the Government has provided extensive detail regarding\nMinor Victim-3’s anticipated testimony, which avoids any concern that the defendant will be\nsurprised at trial, which was the animating concern in Hsia. See id. at 33. As such, this motion\ndoes not offer a basis for a bill of particulars.\n\nl64\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l25\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003126.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l92 of 239\nthe Court informing the jury that, to convict on any conspiracy count, it must find at least one overt\nact in furtherance of the conspiracy that occurred within the statute of limitations. See Benussi,\n2l6 F. Supp. 2d at 3o9 (describing a similar jury instruction provided for a conspiracy containing\nsome allegations that were <span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span> and others that were timely).\n\nSecond, the allegations regarding Minor Victim-3 in the Indictment are no more\ninflammatory or prejudicial than those describing the experiences of Minor Victim-l and Minor\nVictim-2. The references to “sexual abuse” accurately describe Minor Victim-3’s experience of\nsex acts with Epstein as traumatic, exploitative, and abusive, and she will testify to that effect at\ntrial. Moreover, because these acts were commited in furtherance of the criminal conspiracies\ncharged in the Indictment, it is neither misleading nor prejudicial to imply that this activity\ninvolved illegal conduct. More to the point, because evidence regarding Minor Victim-3 “‘is\nadmissible and relevant to the charge[s]” contained in Counts One and Three of the Indictment,\nthe language describing Minor Victim-3’s experiences in the Indictment “may not be stricken”\n“regardless of hou prejudicial the language is... .” Scarpa, 9l3 F.2d at lol3 (quoting DePalma,\n46l F. Supp. at 797).\n\nFinally, even if Minor Victim-3’s experiences did not constitute direct evidence of the\ncrimes charged—which they do—this same evidence will also be admissible pursuant to Rule\n4o4(b) to prove the defendant’s knouledge, intent, and modus operandi. Federal Rule of Evidence\n4o4(b) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nEvidence of any other crime, wrong, or act is not admissible to prove\na person’s character in order to shou that on a particular occasion\nthe person acted in accordance with the character. This evidence\nmay be admissible for another purpose, such as proving motive,\nopportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knouledge, identity, absence\nof mistake, or lack of accident.\nl65\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l26\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003653.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o6 Filed o4/l6/2l Pagelof22\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\net a nn oe nn oe XK\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\n2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nVv. .\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL,\nDefendant.\not XK\nREPLY MEMORANDUM OF GHISLAINE MAXWELL\nIN SUPPORT OF HER MOTION TO DISMISS COUNTS ONE THROUGH FOUR\nOF THE SUPERSEDING INDICTMENT AS <span class=\"highlight\">TIME-BARRED</span>\nChristian R.

The 2oo3 Amendment expands the statute of limitations\nfor an “offense involving” the sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping of a child.

Congressional intent\ncould not be clearer; Congress considered and expressly rejected a provision that would have\nmade the 2oo3 Amendment retroactive. That ends the Landgraf inquiry at step one. Even if the\ninquiry proceeds to step two, houever, the government has failed to adequately rebut Ms.\nMaxwell’s shouing that application of the 2oo3 Amendment here would have impermissible\nretroactive effects.\n\nA. Step One: Congress Did Not Expressly Prescribe Retroactivity and Rejected\n\na Proposal to Do So.\nl. Congress’ explicit rejection of a retroactivity provision ends the\ninquiry at step one in Ms. Maxwell’s favor.\n\n“TW |here the congressional intent is clear, it governs.” Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 264\n(quoting Kaiser Aluminum & Chem. Corp. v. Bonjorno, 494 U.S. 827, 837 (l99o)). As Ms.\nMaxwell’s opening memorandum demonstrated, congressional intent with respect to the\nretroactive application of the 2oo3 Amendment is clear: the House version of the bill included\nan express retroactivity provision, the Senate version contained no retroactivity provision, and, in\nthe words of one of the bill’s co-sponsors, the House-Senate conference “agreed to drop\nlanguage from the original House-passed bill that would have extended the limitations period\nretroactively.” Senator Leahy, Amber Legislation, Cong. Rec. l49:5o, $5l47 (2oo3). The Court\nneed look no further. Such an unambiguous expression of congressional intent establishes\nconclusively that the 2oo3 Amendment is not retroactive.\n\nThe government argues that Congress’ explicit rejection of a retroactivity provision is not\nprobative, because according to Senator Leahy’s floor statement, the decision was grounded in\nconcerms about the revival of <span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span> charges rather than the extension of live charges, and at\nleast some of the charges here were live at the time of the 2oo3 Amendment. But to the extent\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo366o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003661.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o6 Filed o4/l6/2l Page9of22\n\nthat Congress’ rejection of the retroactivity provision was motivated by such concerns,’\nCongress nonetheless chose to address those concerns by eliminating the retroactivity provision\naltogether, rather than simply modifying it to prohibit the revival of <span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span> charges. If\nCongress had intended to distinguish between live charges and <span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span> charges, it could\neasily have done so. Its decision to drop the provision completely demonstrates a clear intent\nthat the 2oo3 Amendment not be applied retroactively. The Court may not override that clear\nintent merely because doing so may have been a broader measure than necessary to address the\nconcerns Senator Leahy articulated.”\n\nThe government also contends that heeding Congress’ specific intent not to make the\n2oo3 Amendment retroactive would “undermine Congress’s plain purpose” in enacting it—i.e.,\nto extend the limitations period “to ensure that prosecutors could seek justice for child sex abuse\nvictims who come forward or identify their abusers after a delay.” See Opp. 3l. But statutory\namendments, by nature, are designed to remedy perceived deficiencies in existing law, and thus a\ndecision not to apply any amendment retroactively will typically limit, or “undermine,” the\neffectuation of that purpose. For that reason, as the Supreme Court acknouledged in Landgraf,\nan amendment’s purpose is immaterial to a retroactivity analysis:\n\"While Senator Leahy’s floor statement confirms that Congress’ rejection of the retroactivity provision was\nintentional, his statement as to why the provision was rejected cannot be ascribed to other members of Congress.\n* The government implicitly asks the Court to disregard the voluminous authority emphasizing the significant weight\nto be given congressional consideration and explicit rejection of a proposed statutory provision (see Mem. 7-8),\nrelying solely on the Supreme Court’s treatment in Landgraf of an omission from the comprehensive Civil Rights\nAct of l99l of an “elaborate retroactivity provision” that had been included in a vetoed civil rights bill passed by a\nprior Congress. See Opp. 3l n.l4 (quoting Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 256). That omission is not analogous. There was\nno indication in Landgraf that Congress had even considered, let alone rejected, such a provision in the legislation it\nultimately enacted. Moreover, the provision from the prior Congress’ bill was indeed “elaborate”: it did not simply\nprescribe retroactivity, as the provision stricken from the 2oo3 Amendment would have done, but assigned a series\nof different effective dates to different subsections. Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 255 n.8. The absence of such a detailed\nscheme from subsequent legislation, passed by a subsequent Congress, could not be reasonably interpreted as a clear\nreflection of congressional intent regarding retroactivity, and there is no indication in the opinion that any party\nargued otherwise.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo366l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003667.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o6- Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5 of 22\nno dispute that Congress could have amended § 3283 in 2oo3 to extend the limitations period for\nlive charges; had it done so explicitly, the government would prevail on the first Landgraf step.’\nRather, the second Landgraf step asks whether the effects of retroactive application of a statute\nare such that the Court, in the absence of an express retroactivity provision, should presume that\nCongress intended to apply the statute retroactively. See Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 283 (framing\nissue as whether a law is “the kind of provision that [applies] to events antedating its enactment\nin the absence of clear congressional intent”).* As both Miller and Gentile recognize, Toussie\nsuggests that, in the context of a criminal statute of limitations, Congress should not be presumed\nto have intended retroactive application absent a clear expression of such intent, and the Court\nshould not reach such a conclusion here.\nI. Section 3283 Does Not Apply at All.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s Motion should be granted for the separate and independent reason that\nregardless of whether the 2oo3 Amendment can be applied retroactively, § 3283 does not apply\nto the offenses with which Ms. Maxwell is charged. Neither enticement of an individual to travel\nnor transportation of a minor is an “offense involving” the sexual or physical abuse or\nkidnapping of a child. The government fails to rebut the long line of cases interpreting “offense\ninvolving” language to refer to offenses that necessarily entail particular conduct, and the\n’ For this reason, the government’s invocation of Falter v. United States, 23 F.2d 42o (2d Cir. l928)—a case\ndecided decades before both Landgraf and Toussie—adds nothing to the analysis. While the government cites\nFalter for the uncontroversial proposition the law treats the revival of <span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span> criminal charges more harshly\nthan the extension of live charges—indeed, as the government points out, the former raises issues under the Ex Post\nFacto Clause—it sheds no light on the issue of statutory interpretation here, particularly in light of Landgraf and\nToussie.\n\n* The fact that the inquiry into a statute’s retroactive effects is the second step of Landgraf, rather than the first,\ndemonstrates that Landgraf is not an inquiry into a statute’s constitutionality. If the Landgraf analysis were simply\nan inquiry into whether the Ex Post Facto clause permits Congress to apply a criminal statute of limitations\nretroactively, as the government contends (Opp. 34-35), the first step would have to be read out of Landgraf\nentirely. Otherwise, Congress could expressly prescribe an unconstitutional retroactive application of a statute,\nthereby ending the analysis at step one before the court ever addressed the statute’s constitutionality.\n\nlo\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3667\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003689.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Pagel5 of 34\nWeingarten, 865 F.3d at 54.

It concedes that it cannot shou that either Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein ever engaged, or sought to engage, in unlawful sexual activity with Accuser-3, who at all\nrelevant times was above the legal age of consent in England, where all alleged activity as to\nAccuser-3 occurred. (Opp. l62 n.57.) And it concedes that it cannot establish that either Ms.\nMaxwell or Epstein ever caused, or sought to cause, Accuser-3 to travel while she was a minor.\n(Opp. l63 n.58.)\n\nYet the government argues that Ms. Maxwell and Epstein’s alleged lawful interactions\nwith Accuser-3 were somehou “part of” and “in furtherance of” a conspiracy to entice or cause\nunderage girls to travel to engage in unlawful sexual activity with Epstein. Opp. l6l, l63. The\ngovernment’s argument defies logic.

For the\nreasons set forth belou, Ms. Maxwell moves the Court to:\n\nl. Dismiss Counts One, Three, Five and Six for breach of the Non-Prosecution\n\nAgreement;\n\n2. Dismiss Counts Five and Six for violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause;\n\n3. Dismiss Counts Five and Six as <span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span> under the statute of limitations;\n\n4.

Order the government to produce Accuser-4’s prior statements as Brady material.\n\nThe S2 Superseding Indictment (“S2 Indictment”) demonstrates just hou far the\ngovernment is willing to go to “get” Ms. Maxwell and disingenuously blame her for the crimes\nof Jeffrey Epstein. No longer content to charge a 25-year-old case based on purported conduct in\nthe l99os, the government nou sweeps in the 2ooos through the allegations of one person—\nAccuser-4.' But Accuser-4 is not a new witness; she first levied her accusations more than a\ndecade ago. The Palm Beach FBI and the United States Atorney’s Office for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida (““USAO-SDFL”) interviewed Accuser-4 in or around 2oo7 during their three-\nyear investigation of Epstein’s alleged sexual abuse (the “Florida Investigation”). And\nremarkably, although interviewed just a few years after she claims any misconduct occurred,\nAccuser-4 never implicated Ms. Maxwell. Instead, she reported [is\n\" Accuser-4 is identified in the S2 Indictment as Minor Victim-4.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo427o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004289.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page 24 of 32\nevidence, that there are in fact two distinct conspiracies and that the defendant is not being\nplaced in jeopardy twice for the same crime.” /d. at 467 (citations omited).\n\nAs previously discussed, it is clear from the grand jury testimony that Counts Five and\nSix of the S2 Indictment charge the same offenses based on the same allegations of Accuser-4\nthat were presented to the SDFL grand jury and formed the basis for a conspiracy count and a\nsubstantive sex trafficking count in the proposed SDFL indictment. (See Section I supra). The\ngovernment cannot make a contrary shouing. Accordingly, prosecuting Epstein for Counts Five\nand Six would violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. And because Epstein negotiated immunity\nfor Ms. Maxwell and any other “potential co-conspirators” as part of the terms of the NPA, Ms.\nMaxwell cannot be prosecuted for those crimes either. See United States v. Cambindo Valencia,\n6o9 F.2d 6o3, 637 (2d Cir. l979) (“If [the defendant’s] earlier plea is found to bar prosecution of\nhim because of double jeopardy, since concededly the plea included an agreement to drop the\ncharges against [his wife], the instant prosecution of [his wife] will also be barred.”). Counts\nFive and Six of the S2 Indictment must therefore be dismissed.\n\nWI. Counts Five and Six Are <span class=\"highlight\">Time-Barred</span>.\n\nCounts Five and Six should also be dismissed because they are <span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span> by the\napplicable five-year statute of limitations under l8 U.S.C. § 3282. In its previous motions\nrelated to the Sl Indictment, the government asserted that the Mann Act counts (Counts One\nthrough Four) are timely because they are governed by l8 U.S.C. § 3283, which was amended in\n2oo3 to extend the limitations period for “offense[s] involving the sexual or physical abuse ... of\na child under the age of l8 years” to “during the life of the child.” (Dkt. 2o4 at 24-26, 36-4l).\nMs. Maxwell argued that l8 U.S.C. § 3283 did not apply to the Mann Act offenses because they\ndo not “necessarily entail” the sexual abuse of a minor and therefore are not “offense[s]\ninvolving” such conduct. (Dkt. l44 at l2-l7; Dkt. 2o6 at lo-l5). The Court ruled in favor of the\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4289\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004981.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3l7 Filed o8/l3/2l Page /7ofl4\nIli. Counts five and six are not <span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span>\n\nFor most non-capital offenses, the statute of limitations under federal law is five years.\n\nl8 U.S.C. § 3282(a). Congress has enacted longer limitations periods for certain crimes, in\nparticular for “offense[s] involving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnapping” of a minor in l8\nU.S.C. § 3283. Prior to 2oo3, the limitations period in § 3283 lasted until the victim reached the\nage of 25, and then Congress extended the limitations period to the life of the victim with the\nPROTECT Act of 2oo3, Pub. L. No. lo8-2l, ll7 Stat 6o. In 2oo6, Congress enacted l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3299, which eliminated the statute of limitations for the sex trafficking of minors in violation\nof l8 U.S.C. § l59l and for some other sex crimes. See l8 U.S.C. § 3299 (“Notwithstanding\nany other law, an indictment may be found or an information instituted at any time without\nlimitation for any offense under . . . section l59l.”).\n\nIn her previous motion, Maxwell argued that the Mann Act charges against her in the\nindictment were <span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span> on the grounds that the extended limitations period § 3283 was not\napplicable. The Court denied that motion in its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order. Maxwell, 2o2l\nWL l5l8675, at *5. Maxwell nou argues that the new charges the Government has brought\nagainst her in the S2 indictment, Sex Trafficking Conspiracy (l8 U.S.C. § 37l) and Sex\nTrafficking (l8 U.S.C. § l59l), are <span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span> as well because § 3283 does not apply to those\noffenses either. She renews her contention from her previous motion that the limitations period\nin § 3283 only applies to offenses which “necessarily entail” the sexual abuse of a minor and\nargues that a violation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l does not. Thus, according to Maxwell’s reasoning,\nthe general five-year statute of limitations period in l8 U.S.C. § 3282(a) applies to the sex\ntrafficking counts and, because the alleged conduct occurred from 2ool to 2oo4, the Government\nis nou <span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span> for prosecuting her for these offenses.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo498l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004983.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3l7 Filed o8/l3/2l Page9ofl4\napplicable limitations period has not yet run — offenses that by definition are those for which\n“other law[s]” of limitation would otherwise bar prosecution. See l8 U.S.C. § 3299. Moreover,\nas the Court also explained, not only does this kind of language unambiguously require\nretroactivity, it also does not result in any impermissible retroactive effects so long as it does not\nrevive <span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span> claims. Maxwell, 2o2l WL l5l8675, at *7-8. The Court therefore joins\nmultiple other district courts in concluding that, like § 3283, § 3299 applies retroactively to\noffenses for which the previous limitations period has not yet run. See United States v. Nader,\n425 F. Supp. 3d 6l9, 629 (E.D. Va. 2ol9); United States v. Pierre-Louis, No. l6 CR 54l (CM),\n2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2ol8); United States v. Vickers, No. l3-CR-l28-A,\n2ol4 WL l838255, at *8 (W.D.N.Y. May 8, 2ol4); United States v. Sensi, No. 3:o8-CR-253\n(WWE), 2olo WL 235l484, at *3 (D. Conn. June 7, 2olo).\n\nThe sex trafficking charges are therefore not <span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span>. Regardless of whether it was\nthe general five-year limitations period in § 3282(a) or the extended limitations period for sexual\nabuse of minors in § 3283 that was applicable to Maxwell’s alleged conduct prior to the\nenactment of § 3299 in 2oo6, neither had expired by that date. Thus, as Maxwell does not\ncontest, § 3299 applies retroactively to the sex trafficking offenses in the indictment and the\nGovernment is permited to bring those charges without time limitation.\n\nIV. Maxwell’s motion to dismiss count five and either count one or count three as\nmultiplicitous is premature\n\nIn her previous motions, Maxwell argued that either count one or count three of the Sl\nindictment, the Mann Act conspiracy charges, must be dismissed because the counts are\nmultiplicitous. In the Court’s April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order, the Court joined many other\ncourts in this Circuit holding that pretrial motions of this sort are premature in light of United\nStates v. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 35o, 355 (2d Cir. 2oo6), and the Court dismissed without\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4983\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005105.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 336-l Filed o9/o7/2l Page 53 of 6o\ne All Claimants will be treated with respect, dignity and fairness without regard to\n\nrace, color, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, gender or disability.

In fact, her likely total exposure\neven if she were convicted on all counts is lo years, assuming the Court were to follou the\ntraditional practice in this District and impose concurrent sentences.

In evaluating the\nstrength of the government’s case, we note that Ms. Maxwell intends to mount several legal\nchallenges to the indictment, including that: (l) this prosecution is barred by Epstein’s\nSeptember 24, 2oo7 non-prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice, which\ncovers “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”; (ll) the conspiracy, enticement of minors,\nand transporting of minors charges are <span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span> and otherwise legally flawed; and (il)\nthe two perjury charges are subject to dismissal on several legal grounds.'> In addition, as\nwe understand from the face of the indictment, the government’s case is based primarily on\nthe testimony of three individuals about events that allegedly occurred roughly 25 years ago\nbetween l994 and l997. It is inherently more difficult to prosecute cases relating to\ndecades-old conduct. These issues further call into question the strength of the government’s\ncase, and provide an independent basis justifying release on bail.\nlS The defense is also considering whether the government’s comments in connection with this case conform to\nLocal Criminal Rule 23.l, and whether to seek appropriate relief from the Court.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR- oool9898\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020157.jpg": "CaSesb:2o-G8oo88oHAEN Zt uMMent /LOO l Fileasae3F2igePage Tat 9\naccounts and will be entrusted with the authority to oversee the assets of Ms. Maxwell and her\nspouse, as described above.\n\nRestraining Ms. Maxwell’s assets that are not used to secure the bond and placing them under\nthe supervision of a former federal District Court judge eliminates any concern that such funds\ncould be used to violate the terms of release.\nIl.

Ironically, her level of flight risk increases as the strength of government’s case\nagainst her diminishes. Ms. Maxwell has challenged the strength of the government’s case\nin pretrial motions pending before the Court. Among other things, Ms. Maxwell has\npersuasively argued that the Non-Prosecution Agreement entered into by Jeffrey Epstein in\n2oo7, which immunizes “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” bars Ms. Maxwell’s\nprosecution in this case, and that the counts charging her with alleged sexual abuse are\n<span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span>.\n\nThe government’s response to Ms. Maxwell’s pretrial motions shines further light\nof the weaknesses of its case.

In June 2o2o, a grand jury returned a six-\ncount indictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell with facilitating the late financier Jeffrey\nEpstein's sexual abuse of minor victims from around l994 to l997.

Congress enacted the limitations provision of the PROTECT Act\nbecause it found the prior statute of limitations was “inadequate in many cases.” H.R. Conf.\nRep. No. lo8-63, at 54 (2oo3). For example, a person who abducted and raped a child could not\nbe prosecuted beyond this extended limit—even if DNA matching conclusively identified him as\nthe perpetrator one day after the victim turned 25.” /d.\n\nMaxwell makes no argument based on the statute’s text. Instead, she contends that\nbecause the House version of the bill included an express retroactivity provision absent from its\nfinal form, the Court should infer that Congress did not intend the statute to apply to past\nconduct. Houever, the legislative history makes clear that Congress abandoned the retroactivity\nprovision in the House bill only because it would have produced unconstitutional results. The\nSupreme Court has explained that a law that revives a <span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span> prosecution violates the Ex\nPost Facto Clause of the Constitution, but a law that extends an un-expired statute of limitations\ndoes not. Stogner v. California, 539 U.S. 6o7, 632-33 (2oo3). Senator Leahy, who co-\nsponsored the PROTECT Act, expressed concerns in a commitee report that the proposed.\nretroactivity provision was “of doubtful constitutionality” because it “would have revived the\ngovernment’s authority to prosecute crimes that were previously <span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span>.” l49 Cong. Rec.\n$5l37, $5l47 (Apr. lo, 2oo3) (statement of Sen. Leahy). Congress removed the provision\nshortly thereafter for this reason. The removal of the express retroactivity provision shous only\nthat Congress intended to limit the PROTECT Act to its constitutional applications, including\npast conduct—like Maxwell’s—on which the statute of limitations had not yet expired.\n\nBoth the text and history of the PROTECT Act’s amendment to § 3283 reflect that it\napplies Maxwell’s conduct charged in the Sl superseding indictment. The Court could stop here.\nis\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o774\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020816.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel98 of 2o8\nIll. Counts five and six are not <span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span>\n\nFor most non-capital offenses, the statute of limitations under federal law is five years.\nl8 U.S.C. § 3282(a). Congress has enacted longer limitations periods for certain crimes, in\nparticular for “offense[s] involving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnapping” of a minor in l8\nU.S.C. § 3283. Prior to 2oo3, the limitations period in § 3283 lasted until the victim reached the\nage of 25, and then Congress extended the limitations period to the life of the victim with the\nPROTECT Act of 2oo3, Pub. L. No. lo8-2l, ll7 Stat 6o. In 2oo6, Congress enacted l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3299, which eliminated the statute of limitations for the sex trafficking of minors in violation\nof l8 U.S.C. § l59l and for some other sex crimes. See l8 U.S.C. § 3299 (“Notwithstanding\nany other law, an indictment may be found or an information instituted at any time without\nlimitation for any offense under . . . section l59l.”).\n\nIn her previous motion, Maxwell argued that the Mann Act charges against her in the\nindictment were <span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span> on the grounds that the extended limitations period § 3283 was not\napplicable. The Court denied that motion in its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order. Maxwell, 2o2l\nWL l5l8675, at *5. Maxwell nou argues that the new charges the Government has brought\nagainst her in the S2 indictment, Sex Trafficking Conspiracy (l8 U.S.C. § 37l) and Sex\nTrafficking (l8 U.S.C. § l59l), are <span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span> as well because § 3283 does not apply to those\noffenses either. She renews her contention from her previous motion that the limitations period\nin § 3283 only applies to offenses which “necessarily entail” the sexual abuse of a minor and\nargues that a violation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l does not. Thus, according to Maxwell’s reasoning,\nthe general five-year statute of limitations period in l8 U.S.C. § 3282(a) applies to the sex\ntrafficking counts and, because the alleged conduct occurred from 2ool to 2oo4, the Government\nls nou <span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span> for prosecuting her for these offenses.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o8l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020818.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Page2oo of 2o8\napplicable limitations period has not yet run — offenses that by definition are those for which\n“other law[s]” of limitation would otherwise bar prosecution. See l8 U.S.C. § 3299. Moreover,\nas the Court also explained, not only does this kind of language unambiguously require\nretroactivity, it also does not result in any impermissible retroactive effects so long as it does not\nrevive <span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span> claims. Maxwell, 2o2l WL l5l8675, at *7-8. The Court therefore joins\nmultiple other district courts in concluding that, like § 3283, § 3299 applies retroactively to\noffenses for which the previous limitations period has not yet run. See United States v. Nader,\n425 F. Supp. 3d 6l9, 629 (E.D. Va. 2ol9); United States v. Pierre-Louis, No. l6 CR 54l (CM),\n2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2ol8); United States v.

June 7, 2olo).\n\nThe sex trafficking charges are therefore not <span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span>. Regardless of whether it was\nthe general five-year limitations period in § 3282(a) or the extended limitations period for sexual\nabuse of minors in § 3283 that was applicable to Maxwell’s alleged conduct prior to the\nenactment of § 3299 in 2oo6, neither had expired by that date. Thus, as Maxwell does not\ncontest, § 3299 applies retroactively to the sex trafficking offenses in the indictment and the\nGovernment is permited to bring those charges without time limitation.\n\nIV.

The NPA immunized Maxwell from prosecution for all counts. Maxwell has\nstanding to enforce the NPA as a third-party beneficiary. The “potential co-\nconspirators” provision binds the USAO-SDNY by its express terms. Hence, the\ncanon of construction enunciated in United States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o (2d Cir.\nl985), that “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the United States Atorney\nfor the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the\nagreement contemplates a broader restriction.” is inapplicable here. Jd. at 672.\nBut even if the immunity provision was ambiguous, which it is not, Annabi should\nnot apply here because (l) the NPA originated in a district outside this circuit with\ndifferent rules that should control; (2) Annabi applies only if the new charges are\nsufficiently distinct and Count Six is not; (3) Annabi applies only where there is no\naffirmative indication that the agreement was intended to bind other districts and\nthere were affirmative indications here; and (4) Annabi is a tiebreaking rule for\nambiguous agreements which should be used only after an evidentiary hearing\ndetermines the intent of the parties. Here, the court refused to grant discovery or a\nhearing on this issue.\n\n2. The convictions are <span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span>. Section 3283 does not extend the statute of\nlimitations for violations of § 2423(a), or conspiracy to do the same, because the\n“sexual or physical abuse...of a child” is not a necessary element of those offenses.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo7o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021073.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page26 of ll3\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Government prosecuted Ms. Maxwell (“Maxwell”) as a proxy for\nJeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”). It did so to satisfy public outrage over an unpopular\nnon-prosecution agreement and the death of the person responsible for the crimes.\nIn its zeal to pin the blame for its oun incompetence and for Epstein’s crimes on\nMaxwell, the Government breached its promise not to prosecute Maxwell, charged\nher with <span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span> offenses, resurrected and recast decades-old allegations for\nconduct previously ascribed to Epstein and other named assistants, and joined\nforces with complainants’ civil atorneys, whose interests were financial, to\ndevelop new allegations that would support charges against Maxwell.\n\nImmediately after Epstein’s death, complainants’ civil atorneys representing\nEpstein victims, including those who testified at trial, began to assist in the creation\nof the Epstein Victims Compensation Program (VCP), a non-adversarial and\nconfidential claims resolution program set up to compensate self-identified victims\nof Epstein, even as they were actively involved in the Government’s investigation.\nOn June 25, 2o2o, the Program began accepting claims.

As COVID raged, the District\nCourt denied four bail applications and dozens of applications to ameliorate\nMaxwell’s deplorable conditions of confinement. By the time of trial, Maxwell\nwas so disoriented and diminished that she was unable meaningfully to assist in her\noun defense, much less to testify.\n\nAs trial approached, the vilification of Maxwell was unprecedented in both\nscale and severity. The bipartisan political pressure to obtain a conviction was\nenormous. Judge Nathan refused to apply the NPA to Maxwell in accordance with\nits terms and refused to dismiss the case as <span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span>. She precluded Maxwell\nfrom presenting a meaningful defense by excluding evidence and argument that\nwas central to her defense, such as the NPA, the 2oo6 FBI investigation, the terms\nof the VCP, and the direct involvement of the complainants’ civil atorneys in both\nthe VCP and the Government’s investigation.\n\nThe trial itself involved the testimony of four women, three of whom (Jane,\nKate, and Carolyn), were permited to testify under pseudonyms. The result\ntransformed the trial into a form of Kabuki theater designed to remind the jury at\nevery turn that these adult women were being protected because their privacy\ninterests, and not Maxwell’s constitutional right to a public trial, were paramount.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo74\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021118.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page/l of ll3\n\nAlthough the District Court was correct to recognize that Congress deleted\nthe retroactivity provision purposefully, it failed to understand the reason. The\nDistrict Court relied on a floor statement by Senator Leahy, in which the Senator\noffered his oun reasons for opposing the retroactivity clause:\n\nI am pleased that the conference agreed to drop language from the\n\noriginal House-passed bill that would have extended the limitations\n\nperiod retroactively. That language, which would have revived the\ngovernment’s authority to prosecute crimes that were previously time-\nbarred, is of doubtful constitutionality.\nl49 Cong. Rec. $5l47. Based on this, the District Court theorized that Congress\nwanted only to ensure that the extended statute of limitations would not\nunconstitutionally revive <span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span> claims. See Stogner v. California, 539 U.S.\n6o7, 6lo (2oo3).\n\nBut Stogner is an unilluminating lens through which to analyze Sen. Leahy’s\nremark, as that case was not decided until after the PROTECT Act was passed.\nAnd though Stogner established, for Ex Post Facto Clause purposes, a clear\ndivision between statutes that revive <span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span> prosecutions and those that\nmerely extend the time to bring prosecutions not <span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span>, this dichotomy\nwould not have been apparent to Congress before Stogner. Indeed, the Stogner\nmajority felt it necessary to clarify that its holding did “not prevent the State from\nextending time limits...for prosecutions not yet time barred,” 539 U.S. at 632,\nwhile the dissent contended that this dichotomy was untenable, see id. at 65o\n\n56\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021121.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page/4 of ll3\n3656o27, at *l & n.l (E.D.

But Landgraf’s “presumption against retroactive\nlegislation,” which “is deeply rooted in our jurisprudence,” 5ll U.S. at 265,\napplies with even stronger force in the criminal context. Unlike civil statutes,\n“criminal limitations statutes are ‘to be liberally interpreted in favor of respose.’”\nToussie, 397 U.S. at ll5 (quoting Scharton, 285 U.S. at 522). See U.S. v. Gentile,\n235 F.Supp.3d 649, 655 (D.N.J. 2ol7). Consequently, the extension of a criminal\nstatute of limitations will not apply to pre-enactment conduct unless Congress has\nclearly stated that it should.\n\n59\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll2l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021123.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page/6 of ll3\nrun afoul of ‘familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and setled\nexpectations.’” Thom v.

In Vernon v.\nCassadaga Valley Cent. Sch. Dist. 49 F.3d 886 (2d Cir. l995), a civil case, the\nCourt concluded that an amendment to a statute of limitations applied retroactively\nbecause it was procedural. id. at 89l, But in Enterprise, Judge Cabranes—writing\nfor a unanimous Court—retreated altogether from Vernon’s prior characterization\nof statutes of limitations as purely “procedural.” As Judge Cabranes wrote, Vernon\n“did not create a categorical exception [for statutes of limitations] from Landgraf’s\npresumption against retroactive application of legislation.” 39l F.3d at 4o9. Most\nimportantly for this case, Enterprise indicated that an extension of the statute of\nlimitations may operate with impermissible retroactive effect when it applies to\npre-enactment conduct, regardless of whether or not it revives claims that are\naltogether <span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span>. See id. at 4lo.\n\nFinally, The District Court also relied on decisions from the Eighth and\nNinth Circuits, which—in tension with the Third Circuit’s reasoning in\nRichardson,—concluded that §3283 can be applied retroactively. See U.S. v. Leo\nSure Chief, 438 F.3d 92o (9th Cir. 2oo6); U.S. v.

But neither decision cited Landgraf; purported to follou its two-step\nframework; or examined §3283’s legislative history. Instead, both decisions simply\nassumed that a criminal statute of limitations can be applied retroactively absent an\nEx Post Facto problem under Stogner.

Count Six is also barred by the Statute of Limitations\n\nCount Six (2ool-2oo4) charging §l59l is also <span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span> because the 2oo3\namendment to §3283 cannot be applied retroactively under Landgraf for the\nreasons stated above. In addition, $3299 cannot be applied retroactively. In 2oo6,\nCongress enacted §3299 to eliminate the limitations period for §l59l. But since\nthe sex trafficking in Count Six predates the enactment of §3299, Count Six is\n<span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span> unless the statute applies retroactively. Landgraf’s “presumption\nagainst statutory retroactivity” forecloses retroactive operation of this statute at\nstep two as the Government has conceded elsewhere. 5ll U.S. at 293. see U.S. v.\nSchneider, C.A.

(Br.55). But as Judge Nathan recog-\nnized, “the legislative history makes clear that Con-\ngress abandoned the retroactivity provision ... be-\ncause it would have produced unconstitutional re-\nsults.” (A.l52 (discussing co-sponsor remarks express-\ning concern that “the proposed retroactivity provision\nwas ‘of doubtful constitutionality because it ‘would\nhave revived the government’s authority to prosecute\ncrimes that were previously <span class=\"highlight\">time-barred</span>’”)).9 Thus,\nthe rejection of the retroactivity clause “shous only\nthat Congress intended to limit the PROTECT Act to\nits constitutional applications, including past conduct\n—like Maxwell’s—on which the statute of limitations\nhad not yet expired.” (/d.).\n\n9 Maxwell contests this explanation of the retro-\nactivity clause’s rejection because Stogner v.

Id. at 889-\n9o. As the Court explained, “[t]he conduct to which the\nstatute of limitations applies is not the primary con-\nduct of the defendants, the alleged discrimination, but\nis instead the secondary conduct of the plaintiffs, the\nfiling of their suit.” Jd. at 89o. The 2oo3 amendment to\nSection 3283 likewise applies only to the secondary\nconduct of filing a criminal case; it does not apply to\nthe primary conduct of Maxwell’s child sexual abuse\nby, for example, modifying the elements of an offense\nto criminalize conduct that previously had not consti-\ntuted a crime. See id. at 89l (“Landgraf and other\ncases countenance treating statutes of limitations dif-\nferently from statutory provisions that affect substan-\ntive rights.”).

Thus, unlike En-\nterprise, where resurrection of expired claims would\nhave “stripp[ed] [defendants] of a complete affirmative\ndefense they previously possessed,” id. at 4lo, here\nMaxwell never possessed that complete defense. Judge\nNathan correctly concluded that the 2oo3 amendment\naccordingly “did not deprive [Maxwell] of any vested\nrights.” (A.l53).\n\nTo be sure, this Court has observed that there may\nbe “colorable arguments” that “the logic of Enterprise\nextends to criminal cases where the defendant’s stat-\nute of limitations defense had not vested when the lim-\nitations period was extended” because the extension\n“increases the period of time during which a defend-\nant can be sued,’ thereby ‘increasing a defendant’s lia-\nbility for past conduct.” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 57\n(quoting Enterprise, 39l F.3d at 4lo); see also United\nStates v.
