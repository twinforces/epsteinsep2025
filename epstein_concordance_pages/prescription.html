Accordingly, the\nLandgraf analysis should end at step one, with a determination that the 2oo3 Amendment is not\nretroactive and that Counts One through Four are therefore time-barred. Houever, even if the\nanalysis advances to step two, application of the 2oo3 Amendment to Ms. Maxwell’s alleged\nconduct would create impermissible retroactive effects in violation of Landgraf by expanding a\ncriminal statute of limitations.\n\nA. Step One: Congress did not expressly prescribe retroactivity and rejected a\n\nproposal to do so.\n\nThe first step of Landgraf asks whether Congress “expressly prescribed” the temporal\nreach of the 2oo3 Amendment. Here, Congress “expressly prescribed” that the 2oo3\nAmendment was to apply prospectively only. Not only does the text of the 2oo3 Amendment\nomit any mention of retroactivity, but the legislative history makes it absolutely clear that\nCongress considered and rejected a retroactivity provision. Because such unambiguous\ncongressional intent is sufficient to constitute an “express <span class=\"highlight\">prescription</span>” under the first step of\nLandgraf that the amendment not be retroactive, there is no need to proceed to the second\nLandgraf step.\n\n“(Where the congressional intent is clear, it governs.” Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 264\n(quoting Kaiser Aluminum & Chem. Corp. v. Bonjorno, 494 U.S. 827, 837 (l99o)). Here, the\nlegislative history leaves no doubt as to congressional intent. The House version of the bill,\nwhich would have eliminated the statute of limitations entirely, included an express retroactivity\nprovision. Child Abduction Prevention Act, H.R. llo4, lo8th Cong. § 2o2 (2oo3) (“The\namendments made by this section shall apply to the prosecution of any offense commited\nbefore, on, or after the date of the enactment of this section.”). The Senate version contained no\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo266o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002663.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l5 of 25\nhad expressly prescribed that the 2oo3 Amendment would not be retroactive; Weingarten\nconsidered only whether there was an express <span class=\"highlight\">prescription</span> that the 2oo3 Amendment would be\nretroactive, concluding that the defendant’s counsel could have made “colorable” arguments that\nthere was no such <span class=\"highlight\">prescription</span>. Jd. at 58.°\n\nCongressional intent here could not be clearer. The House bill would have made the\n2oo3 Amendment retroactive, the Senate bill did not, and the conference consciously rejected the\nretroactivity provision. It is unnecessary to proceed to the second Landgraf step, and Counts\nOne through Four are time-barred.\n\nB. Step Two: Application of the 2oo3 Amendment to Ms. Maxwell’s alleged\n\noffenses would have impermissible effects.\n\nIf the Court were to proceed to the second Landgraf step—whether application of the\n2oo3 Amendment here would have an impermissible retroactive effect—that step also counsels\nagainst retroactivity.\n\nAny analysis of the retroactivity of a criminal statute of limitations under the second step\nof Landgraf must be undertaken in conjunction with the principle that unlike civil statutes of\nlimitation, “criminal limitations statutes are ‘to be liberally interpreted in favor of repose.’”\nToussie, 397 U.S. at ll5 (quoting Scharton, 285 U.S. at 522). As one court recognized in\ndeclining to extend a criminal statute of limitations to pre-enactment conduct, if Landgraf and\nToussie “are read in conjunction,” courts “must interpret the statute of limitations in a manner\nfavoring repose for Defendant.” United States v. Gentile, 235 F. Supp. 3d 649, 655 (D.N.J.\n2ol7).\n\n* Nor was this clear evidence of congressional intent raised or considered in United States v. Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL\n4o43l4o (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2ol8), which the government cites in support of its contention that the 2oo3\nAmendment may be applied retroactively. Gov. Mem. at 6.\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2663\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003658.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o6 Filed o4/l6/2l Page6of 22\n\nGhislaine Maxwell respectfully submits this Reply Memorandum in Support of her\nMotion to Dismiss Counts One Through Four of the Superseding Indictment as Time-Barred\n(“Motion”).\n\nAs the government agrees in its opposition (““Opp.”), the four Mann Act counts against\nMs. Maxwell are timely only if the 2oo3 amendment to l8 U.S.C. § 3283 (“2oo3 Amendment”)\napplies to the conduct charged therein. The 2oo3 Amendment expands the statute of limitations\nfor an “offense involving” the sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping of a child. Because the\n2oo3 Amendment does not apply retroactively, and because § 3283 does not apply to the\noffenses with which Ms. Maxwell is charged, the Mann Act counts should be dismissed.\n\nFirst, the 2oo3 Amendment cannot be applied retroactively because Congress did not\nintend it to apply retroactively. While the government cites several cases in which courts have\napplied the 2oo3 Amendment to pre-enactment conduct, the on/y court to do so after analyzing\ncongressional intent under the two-step framework required by Landgrafv. USI Film Products,\n5ll U.S. 244 (l994)—and to even mention Congress’ explicit rejection of a retroactivity\nprovision in the 2oo3 Amendment—improperly excluded legislative history from its analysis.\nNo court has applied the Landgraf framework, considered the legislative history, and still\nconcluded that Congress intended the 2oo3 Amendment to overcome the presumption against\nretroactivity, as the government asks this Court to do.\n\nBecause Congress’ clear rejection of a retroactivity provision in the 2oo3 Amendment\nconstitutes an express <span class=\"highlight\">prescription</span> of the amendment’s temporal reach, the 2oo3 Amendment\ndoes not apply retroactively, and the Landgraf analysis ends at step one.

She did not report to the authorities what Cosby had\ndone to her.\n\nA few months later, Constand moved back to her native Canada. She spoke with\nCosby over the telephone, mostly about an upcoming Toronto performance that he had\nscheduled. Cosby invited Constand and her family to the shou, which especially excited\nConstand’s mother, who had atended two of Cosby’s other performances and who\nbrought a gift for Cosby to the shou.\n\nConstand kept the January 2oo4 incident to herself for nearly a year, until one night\nin January 2oo5, when she bolted awake crying and decided to call her mother for advice.\nInitially, Constand’s mother could not talk because she was en route to work, but she\nreturned Constand’s call immediately upon arrival. During the call, Constand told her\nmother that Cosby had sexually assaulted her approximately one year earlier. Together,\nthe two decided that the best course of action was to contact the Durham Regional Police\nDepartment in Ontario, Canada, and to atempt to retain legal counsel in the United\nStates.\n\nThat night, Constand filed a police report with the Durham Regional Police\nDepartment. Shortly thereafter, Constand called Cosby, but he did not answer his phone.\nWhen Cosby returned the call the next day, both Constand and her mother were on the\nline. Constand brought up the January 2oo4 incident and asked Cosby to identify the\nthree blue pills that he had given to her that night. Cosby apologized vaguely. As to the\npills, Cosby feigned ignorance, promising Constand that he would check the label on the\n<span class=\"highlight\">prescription</span> botle from which they came and relay that information to her.\n\nFrustrated, Constand left the call, but her mother remained on the line and\ncontinued to speak with Cosby.

The issue in that case was not expert testimony, but rather whether the Government\nshould have been required to disclose a confidential informant’s mental health records, and whether\nthe defendant should have been alloued to cross-examine the informant using those records. Robinson,\n583 F.3d at l269, l274. Had the defendant’s requests been granted, the cross-examination apparently\nwould have revealed, among other things: hallucinations, heavy drug use during the relevant events—\nin contradiction of the informant’s trial testimony and violation of his cooperation agreement—as well\nas shortly before and perhaps during trial, and <span class=\"highlight\">prescription</span> drug use during trial. /d. at l257, l274-76.\nThe obvious relevance of cross-examination on those fact questions underscores the gap between Dr.\nHall’s proposed expert testimony and permissible evidence about a witness’s mental health.\n\nThe Government does, houever, join the defendant in urging the Court to “adhere to DiPaolo.”\n(Opp. l3). In that case, the Second Circuit affirmed a district court’s refusal to allou inquiry into a\nfemale victim’s addiction, absent any evidence that she was under the influence either during the\nrelevant events or while testifying. United States v. DiPaolo, 8o4 F.2d 225, 229-3o (2d Cir. l986).\nBecause those are the only relevant inquiries, and because Dr. Hall’s opinion offers nothing on either,\nhis testimony that [EE should be excluded.\n\nIII.

(Compare Mot. l2 with Opp. l4-l5).\nInstead she offers three different rules of evidence under which she hopes to admit the hearsay.\nNone is valid:\n\nRule 7o3.

It is unknoun whether he was anticipating this\narrest. He was transported to MCC New York and keyed into SENTRY at 9:24 p.m. that\nevening. Mr. Epstein was placed in a general population housing unit for approximately 22\nhours. On July 7, 2ol9, at approximately 7:2o p.m. he was moved to the Special Housing Unit\n(SHU) pending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness\nof his notoriety among the inmate population.\n\n_ Also, a review of financial transactions associated with Mr. Epstein’s\nprison account revealed one of his atorneys was depositing funds into his cellmate’s (inmate\nReyes) commissary account for unknoun reasons.\nHEALTH CARE AND PERSONALITY DESCRIPTION\nBOP Electronic Medical Records (BEMR) indicate Mr. Epstein was diagnosed with\nhyperlipidemia, sleep apnea, hypertension, constipation, prediabetes, neuralgia, and neuritis\nunspecified. He was prescribed the follouing mediations: docusate sodium, milk of magnesia,\nomega 3, methylprednisone, and bisacodyl. Mr. Epstein was also prescribed insulin, and the\n<span class=\"highlight\">prescription</span> required him to go to the institution pharmacy for administration of this medication.\nHouever, the dates for which it was prescribed have a notation indicating “dose not indicated,”\nthus it does not appear insulin was routinely medically necessary. The rest of the medications\nprescribed were self-carry. He also had a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine\nwhich is typically used to treat sleep apnea. Mr. Epstein was provided with his personal CPAP\nmachine on July 3o, 2ol9, per BEMR.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo27285\n"};
