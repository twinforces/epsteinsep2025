Accordingly, any danger that Mr. Epstein may have once posed to the\ncommunity has long since abated. At the very least, this enormous gap in time precludes a\nfinding by clear and convincing evidence that no conditions of release can reasonably assure the\ncommunity’s safety.°\nThe rebutable presumption of a risk of flight is negated by the evidence that the\n\ngovernment had stated it believed it could prosecute Mr. Epstein for the very same conduct for\nwhich he was immunized, albeit in a second jurisdiction, despite the protections conferred upon\nhim under the NPA. Mr. Epstein’s continuous presence in the United States even while he had a\nresidence out of the country reinforces the point. As detailed belou, Mr. Epstein understood the\nNPA as a global resolution of any charges arising from the alleged conduct at issue here,\nincluding conduct in New York. Indeed, the government, in a Southern District of Florida filing\n® The government vastly overreaches in painting Mr. Epstein as dangerous based on musty plea\ndiscussions. The government’s argument that Mr. Epstein’s release would risk obstructive\nbehavior, at pages 8-9 of its submission, rests primarily upon statements made between Mr.\nEpstein’s prior counsel and an Assistant U.S. Atorney while they searched for a federal offense,\nat the government’s behest, with a one-year statutory maximum or guideline during the give-and-\ntake of those of plea negotiations. The communication from prior counsel about a potential\nproffer for a federal charge was met with the response that there was no sufficient evidence to\ncharge such an offense. These purported facts were mere allegations that did not ultimately\nmanifest themselves in any agreement by Mr. Epstein — nor in any agreement that probable cause\nexisted to support any obstruction or assault charge. And the documents from the Southern\nDistrict of Florida litigation referenced by the government in support of its argument on this\npoint expressly acknouledge this lack of substantiation. See Jane Doe #l and Jane Doe #2 v.\nUnited States, o8-CV-8o736 (S.D.

In\nshort, these were suggested hypotheses not facts, and the government itself ultimately did not\nbelieve there was factual support for the allegations. They do not provide a sufficiently reliable\nfactual basis for any finding by clear and convincing evidence. As to the suggestion by the\nprosecutor that a charge could be predicated on a prior incident where it was alleged that an\ninvestigator forced a family member of a witness off the road, the defense is without knouledge\nas to the basis for this allegation and the conduct, if it occurred, was not atributable to or\nauthorized by Mr. Epstein.\n\n6\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo279", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000507.jpg": "| Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 32-l Filed o7/l8/l9 Page 3of4\nCase 9:o8-cv-8o736-KAM Document 36l-lo Entered on FLSD Docket o2/lo/2ol6 Page 2 of 2\nVillafana, Ann Marie C.

It is not accessible on-line via PACER, but someone can go to the\nClerk’s Office to obtain a copy.\nA non-prosecution agreement would not be made public or filed with the Court, but it would remain part of our\ncase file.

The Government is also prepared\nto engage in good faith discussions with the defense about an appropriate schedule for disclosure\nof 35oo material, exhibit lists, and witness lists, all of which the Government expects to produce\nreasonably in advance of the trial date in July 2o2l to permit the defense to investigate witnesses.\nBut particularly given the nature of the charges, the Government’s strong desire to protect the\nprivacy of the alleged victims, and the lack of any legal precedent for the defendant’s request, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that at the present time—eleven months prior to trial, nearly\nthree months prior to the discovery deadline, and more than four months prior to the pretrial\nmotions deadline—there is no basis for the defendant to demand the Government disclose the\nidentity of its witnesses.\n\nB. The Defendant’s Request that the Court Dictate the Conditions of Her Confinement\n\nThe defendant’s requests with respect to the conditions of her confinement at the\nMetropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) are similarly premature and unavailing, and her request\nthat the Court dictate the terms of her confinement to the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”’) should also\nbe denied.’\n\nAs an initial mater, the defendant’s argument that she is being treated “worse” than other\ninmates is incorrect. There is no merit to her complaints about being monitored by staff, as it is\nentirely appropriate for BOP to carefully monitor any inmate, particularly a new inmate who has\nnever before been incarcerated and who faces the strong likelihood of serving many years in prison.\nAdditionally, like all inmates, the defendant may be subject to <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> or searches of her\nperson or space as appropriate.” It is otherwise entirely unclear what specific “privileges given to\nother pretrial detainees” the defendant believes she is being denied.\n\nMore generally, the defendant, like all pretrial inmates, is subject to an individualized\nassessment by the BOP with respect to his or her placement in a facility. Here, for reasons\nincluding safety, security, and the orderly functioning of the facility, BOP has made the\ndetermination that, at present, the defendant should not be fully integrated into the dorm-style\naccommodations of the general population. The Government understands from BOP that it will\n4 Once again, defense counsel has rushed to seek Court intervention on issues they have made litle\nor no meaningful effort to address with the Government or, in this case, the BOP. The Government\nlearned of the defendant’s specific objections to her conditions of incarceration for the first time\nfrom the Defense Leter, and has since conferred with BOP to understand and to address the issues\nas appropriate. Moreover, as noted belou, the defendant filed the instant challenge to the BOP’s\nplan to permit her time to review discovery before the BOP had a chance to implement (and\nultimately modify) that plan.\n> Defense counsel claims that prison staff “constantly observe” the defendant “including her phone\nconversations with defense counsel.” This is misleading. As with all inmates, the defendant is\nable to speak to her counsel behind a closed door, in an area that is visible—but not audible—to\nMDC staff. Among other reasons, this is so MDC staff can ensure that inmates do not complete\ncalls with their counsel and then call other individuals on a non-recorded line.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool722", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001728.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 42 Filed o8/l7/2o Page5of5\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Even on more routine maters, Ms. Maxwell’s treatment has\nbeen worse than other pretrial detainees.

He is a member of the\nEditorial Board of the Criminal Law Review and a joint editor of Blackstone’s Criminal\nPractice, a leading practitioners’ work.\n\n2. Extradition — Experience and Expertise\n\n2.l. Mr Perry is widely considered one of the UK’s pre-eminent extradition practitioners and\nis listed as such in the leading industry journals.

The review formed the basis of changes to the\nExtradition Act 2oo3.\n\n3.2. The year-long review looked in detail at the follouing five areas:\n® the Home Secretary’s discretionary pouers to stop extradition.\n\ne the operation of the European Arrest Warrant, which deals with extradition\nrequests between European countries.\n\ne where a crime is mainly commited in the UK, whether the person should be tried\nin the UK.\n\ne whether the US-UK Extradition Treaty is unbalanced.\n\ne whether requesting countries should be required to provide sufficient evidence to\nprove an allegation.\n\n3.3. The report, totalling 488 pages and presented to the Home Secretary on 3o September\n2oll, made a series of recommendations in respect of the UK’s extradition arrangements.\nPart 7 of the report looked specifically at extradition arrangements between the United\nStates and United Kingdom under the 2oo3 UK-US Treaty on Extradition. It assessed the\neffectiveness of the tests used in each jurisdiction and laid out the authors’ observations\non the procedures under the treaty.

For example, Wyre’s\n(l987) proposed stages for intrafamilial abuse involved l3 separate steps,\nthe first lo of which according to the author can be identified as groom-\ning behaviors. As Houit (l995) pointed out, this account of the abuse cycle\nmakes it “appear a relatively short-term and repetitive process” (p. 85), which\ncertainly is not representative of all cases of child sexual abuse.\n\nGROOMING AS A DEVIANT PROCESS\nPart of the difficulty in identifying and clarifying a useful definition of groom-\ning is the fact that many behaviors used by perpetrators appear quite similar\nto behaviors seen in normal adult-child relationships. Buying gifts for chil-\ndren or taking them on private outings obviously are not always precursors\nto sexual abuse. Using the male sports world as an example, Hartill (2oo9)\nwrote that “in preparing for the abuse, the perpetrator is able to use such\n‘disinhibiting’ techniques through drawing on practices and discourses that\nare, to varying degrees, a normative feature within many, if not all, male\nsports contexts” (p. 239). Obviously part of the reason for this similarity to\nnormative behavior is that the potential abuser does not want to be detected\nand thus wants to disguise what he is seting out to accomplish. In addition,\nit must be recognized that not all sexual offenders use grooming techniques.\nGroth, Hobson, and Gary (l982) differentiated between “child molesters”\nand “child rapists.” Part of this distinction for these authors stems from their\n<span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> that child molesters use a grooming process on their victims,\nwhereas child rapists do not, as their assaults occur suddenly. These authors\nalso pointed out that child molesters are much more common than child\nrapists. Alternatively, some authors seem to construe grooming behaviors\nas mirroring behaviors seen in dating relationships between two consenting\nadults. For example, Herman (l98l) wrote that sexually abusive fathers make\nan atempt to “court” their daughters by giving them flouers or presents (e.g.,\nexpensive jewelry or lingerie).\nTHE PREVALENCE OF GROOMING\nBecause the definition of grooming varies from study to study, currently there\nis no way to knou precisely hou prevalent grooming is because each study\nemploys some variant of the definition.

For example, Wyre’s\n(l987) proposed stages for intrafamilial abuse involved l3 separate steps,\nthe first lo of which according to the author can be identified as groom-\ning behaviors. As Houit (l995) pointed out, this account of the abuse cycle\nmakes it “appear a relatively short-term and repetitive process” (p. 85), which\ncertainly is not representative of all cases of child sexual abuse.\n\nGROOMING AS A DEVIANT PROCESS\nPart of the difficulty in identifying and clarifying a useful definition of groom-\ning is the fact that many behaviors used by perpetrators appear quite similar\nto behaviors seen in normal adult-child relationships. Buying gifts for chil-\ndren or taking them on private outings obviously are not always precursors\nto sexual abuse. Using the male sports world as an example, Hartill (2oo9)\nwrote that “in preparing for the abuse, the perpetrator is able to use such\n‘disinhibiting’ techniques through drawing on practices and discourses that\nare, to varying degrees, a normative feature within many, if not all, male\nsports contexts” (p. 239). Obviously part of the reason for this similarity to\nnormative behavior is that the potential abuser does not want to be detected\nand thus wants to disguise what he is seting out to accomplish. In addition,\nit must be recognized that not all sexual offenders use grooming techniques.\nGroth, Hobson, and Gary (l982) differentiated between “child molesters”\nand “child rapists.” Part of this distinction for these authors stems from their\n<span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> that child molesters use a grooming process on their victims,\nwhereas child rapists do not, as their assaults occur suddenly. These authors\nalso pointed out that child molesters are much more common than child\nrapists. Alternatively, some authors seem to construe grooming behaviors\nas mirroring behaviors seen in dating relationships between two consenting\nadults. For example, Herman (l98l) wrote that sexually abusive fathers make\nan atempt to “court” their daughters by giving them flouers or presents (e.g.,\nexpensive jewelry or lingerie).\nTHE PREVALENCE OF GROOMING\nBecause the definition of grooming varies from study to study, currently there\nis no way to knou precisely hou prevalent grooming is because each study\nemploys some variant of the definition. Nevertheless, there have been several\nempirical studies conducted with child molesters to determine what specific\nmethods they frequently use to choose their victims, initiate the abuse, and\nkeep their victims from disclosing.

As I just indicated, there are a variety of ways that we\n\nll can look at whether or not individuals with particular\n\nl2 vulnerabilities are targeted and/or at higher risk for being\n\nl3 sexually abused. We can look at the prevalence data, the rates\nl4 in which these behaviors occur. You can look at both\n\nl5 allegations as well as crimes that are reported. You can look\nl6 at what offenders tell us. There has been extensive\n\nl7 interviewing that's been done and studies that have been done\nl8 with offenders about what they look for. And, again, this\n\nl9 would not just be offenders of childhood sexual abuse but, you\n2o knou, there have been studies done with pimps, for example, on\n2l what they look for. So in a variety of forms of victimization.\n22 So there are multiple data sources that exist in\n23 addition to clinical experience that can substantiate this\n24 phenomenon.\n25 Q. Hou does what you've observed in your review of the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7938", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008074.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o7-l Filed ll/24/2l Page5ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 4\n\nMoreover, grooming has no consistent definition, and concerns have been raised that\n“there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.” Natalie\nBennet & William O’ Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23 J. Child\nSexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4).\n\nIn any particular population of alleged victims, patients, or plaintiffs—including those\nwhom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—the determination of whether grooming has\noccurred is a subjective judgment hinging largely on the credibility of the individuals. Such\njudgments have no knoun error rate and cannot be tested, verified, or reproduced.\n\nAlthough the Government’s Expert Notice regarding Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony\nis silent as to whether she is expected to impute a theory of “grooming-by-proxy” to the\nDefendant, it is important to note that there is no generally accepted theory of grooming by third\nparties or empirical evidence regarding the prevalence, characteristics, or mechanisms of such a\nphenomenon. Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for\nherself. Instead, the claim appears to be that Ms. Maxwell recruited and groomed minors to\nprovide sexualized massages for Mr. Epstein, which would amount to grooming-by-proxy.\n\nDr. Dietz is aware of no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to\nsupport a theory of grooming-by-proxy. Such a theory has not gained any acceptance (let alone\ngeneral acceptance) in the relevant community; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and\ncannot be tested; and there is no knoun or potential rate of error.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s opinion that “[i]ndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted\nby perpetrators of sexual abuse” is a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore derived from the\nfrequent <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> of highly vulnerable children among those children who allege sexual\nabuse, but it is not based on empirical data regarding the likelihood of abuse among children\nwith varying degrees of vulnerability. To the extent that less vulnerable children, such as those\nwith intact families, atentive parents, good social support, litle psychopathology, less prior\ntrauma, no substance use, and higher resilience are less likely to allege abuse than the more\nvulnerable, the generalization could be proved weak or false, if only there were such empirical\ndata. And even if there were such data, it would be important to devise a means of verifying that\nabuse did occur to those who allege it, which is a difficult task at best because of the pains so\nmany abusers take to avoid confession, witnesses, or physical evidence. The clinical, criminal\njustice, and forensic populations from which the <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> of prevalent vulnerabilities is\nderived—including those clients whom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—trarely represent\ngroups in which all allegations of abuse have been verified by confession, witnesses, physical\nevidence, or other means.\n\nOther opinions put forth in the disclosure of Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony also rest\non assertions that are untestable, cannot be reproduced, and have no knoun error rate.\n\nb.

Trial Tr. at 3o66; see also U.S. ex rel. Owen v. McMann, 435 F.2d\n8l3, 8l8 (2d Cir. l97o).\n\nLast, the Defendant argues—in a single sentence of her reply brief—that if Rule 6o6 does\nbar consideration of Juror 5o’s statements about the second juror, then the rule “violates Ms.\nMaxwell’s constitutional rights to due process and to confrontation as applied to her.””» Maxwell\nReply at 23. The Court rejects this argument. The Confrontation Clause guarantees a criminal\ndefendant the right “to be confronted with the witnesses against him.” U.S. Const., amend. VI.\nThe Defendant’s right to confrontation is not implicated here because Juror 5o is not a “witness[]\nagainst” the Defendant but was instead a factfinder in her trial. Simply put, Juror 5o’s testimony\nat the hearing will be proffered to determine whether Juror 5o has engaged in any misconduct\nwarranting a new trial, not to accuse the Defendant of any crime. Cf Crawford v. Washington,\n54l U.S. 36, 43 (2oo4) (describing the Confrontation Clause as a “right to confront one’s\naccusers” (emphasis added)). Even if the Confrontation Clause were implicated, Rule 6o6’s\nprohibition on juror affidavits to impeach a verdict is a reasonable limitation, subject to other\nexceptions not at issue here, on the evidence that a defendant may muster, a limitation with a\nlong historical pedigree. See Pena-Rodriguez, l37 S. Ct. at 863 (tracing Rule 6o6 to traditional\nEnglish common law); Crawford, 54l U.S. at 54 (explaining that the Confrontation Clause “is\nmost naturally read as a reference to the right of confrontation at common law, admiting only\nthose exceptions established at the time of the founding”).\n\nNext, the Defendant’s due-process claim is squarely foreclosed by controlling precedent.\nThe Supreme Court in Tanner v. United States rejected a constitutional challenge to Rule 6o6,\nexplaining that a criminal defendant’s right to an impartial jury is “protected by several aspects\nof the trial process,” including questions asked in voir dire; observations in court made by the\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9555", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009556.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62o_ Filed o2/25/22 Pagel5of2l\njudge, court personnel, and counsel; observations by other jurors, who “may report inappropriate\njuror behavior to the court before they render a verdict”; and “impeach[ment] [of] the verdict by\nnonjuror evidence of misconduct.” 483 U.S. at l27; see also Warger, 574 U.S. at 5l (“[A]\nparty’s right to an impartial jury remains protected despite Rule 6o6(b)’s removal of one means\nof ensuring that jurors are unbiased.”). The Defendant cites in support the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado, but that case is unavailing to her position. There, the\nSupreme Court held that “where a juror makes a clear statement that indicates he or she relied on\nracial stereotypes or animus to convict a criminal defendant, the Sixth Amendment requires that\nthe no-impeachment rule give way in order to permit the trial court to consider the evidence of\nthe juror’s statement and any resulting denial of the jury trial guarantee.” l37 S. Ct. at 869.\nThroughout the opinion, the Supreme Court took great care to hold that the “unique historical,\nconstitutional, and institutional concerns” intrinsic to a juror with racial animus do not atach to\nother forms of juror misconduct. /d. at 868. In fact, it expressly contrasted the case of a juror\nwith racial animus to a juror that “ha[s] a personal experience that improperly influences her\nconsideration of the case,” as was at issue in Warger v. Shauers and as is alleged here. /d. at\n869.\n\nThird, even if the Court did consider Juror 5o’s statements about what another juror said\nduring deliberations—which Rule 6o6 prohibits—the statements proffered by the Defendant do\nnot meet the threshold of “clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific,\nnonspeculative impropriety has occurred.” Baker, 899 F.3d at l3o. According to an article in\nthe Daily Mail, Juror 5o “revealed that he was not the only juror to share a story of sexual\nabuse.” That sentence summarizes an unsworn and non-specific statement, which does not\nidentify the alleged misconduct or the juror in question with any particularity. It therefore falls\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9556", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010127.jpg": "CaSas i 2C2oAB ORES DARN l Barren Gl o PSO DBE ab dthige 26H dfll7l7\n~ A-5844\n\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 522 Filed o4/o6/l2 Page 2 of 29\nseparate question of whether the motion for a new trial based on the conduct of juror Conrad is\nmeritorious.

Financial Penalties\n\nIn addition to a Guidelines sentence of incarceration, the Government respectfully submits\nthat the Court should impose the maximum fine allouable under statute. Because each of the three\ncounts of conviction carries a maximum fine of $25o,ooo, the maximum total allouable is\n$75o,ooo. That amount constitutes a mere drop in the bucket for a multi-millionaire like the\ndefendant, but it nevertheless sends the message that a defendant who uses wealth to accomplish\ncriminal activity will suffer financial losses in addition to the loss of liberty. No amount of money\ncan undo the harm that the defendant’s crimes have done, but given the defendant’s substantial\nmeans, the majority of which appears to have come from her co-conspirator, a hefty fine is\ncertainly warranted in this case.\n\n5o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo587", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011126.jpg": "Caedest: 2@2OrocRRsP AGN Domwmesnitase Arieedinyo2l Pdtpgelefdie3 ll\nL9LSberl\n\nl death.\n\n2 We will not be eliciting expert medical testimony or\n\n3 opinion from this witness, he will be simply testifying to what\n4 he observed with respect to the victim's physical condition\n\n5 during the lo intervening years between the shooting and the\n\n6 death and that's important evidence, it's evidence that will\n\n7 then be consistent with things that medical experts to be\n\n8 qualified as experts will be called to testify about, but those\n9 experts did not observe these injuries during the lo\n\nlo intervening years.

During that\nl5 time period, Mr. Epstein was quite -- was acquiring quite a lot\nl6 of residences and quite large residences. So it took a lot to\nl7 undertake of managing and hiring and decorating, et cetera.\n\nl8 Q. Focusing on the period between l994 and 2oo4, hou would\n\nl9 Ms. Maxwell, Mr. Epstein, or another assistant let you knou\n2o about an upcoming flight for one of Mr. Epstein's planes?\nal A. Since you're going back so far in the '94s, I believe that\n22 was before cellphones even. So when I first got hired, we were\n23 issued pagers, and at that point, the office would page us and\n24 we would call in for the message.

OPR found no\ndocument that suggested Villafafia and Lourie discussed the provision further, or that the other\nindividuals who were copied on Villafafia’s email referencing the provision—her immediate\nsupervisor, the supervisor designated to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office,\nand Villafafia’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it. Villafafia told\nOPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> that the non-\nprosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafafia assumed that they agreed with her assessment.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision\nagreeing not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that\ndefense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame\nfor what happened.” Villafafia told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct\nwas his oun “dirty litle secret.” Villafafia said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2oo6\narrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that\nnone of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators\nabout sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-knoun contacts about whom allegations arose\nmany years later.”3° Villafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime\nrelationship with a close female friend who was a well-knoun socialite, but, according to\nVillafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.””*? Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the\nfour female assistants identified by name.”*° Villafafia also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s\ninvestigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to prosecute his four assistants if he\nentered a plea.**! Because Villafafia was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged,\nshe perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to prosecute other, unspecified\n“co-conspirators.” Villafafia told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did\nnot occur to her that the reference to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any\nof Epstein’s influential associates.\n\nLourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the\ntime Villafafia forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR\nthat he did not knou hou the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.\n238 Villafafia told OPR that “none of... the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being\ninvolved in abusing them.

Trial Tr. at 3o66; see also U.S. ex rel. Owen v. McMann, 435 F.2d\n8l3, 8l8 (2d Cir. l97o).\n\nLast, the Defendant argues—in a single sentence of her reply brief—that if Rule 6o6 does\nbar consideration of Juror 5o’s statements about the second juror, then the rule “violates Ms.\nMaxwell’s constitutional rights to due process and to confrontation as applied to her.” Maxwell\nReply at 23. The Court rejects this argument. The Confrontation Clause guarantees a criminal\ndefendant the right “to be confronted with the witnesses against him.” U.S. Const., amend. VI.\nThe Defendant’s right to confrontation is not implicated here because Juror 5o is not a “witness[]\nagainst” the Defendant but was instead a factfinder in her trial. Simply put, Juror 5o’s testimony\nat the hearing will be proffered to determine whether Juror 5o has engaged in any misconduct\nwarranting a new trial, not to accuse the Defendant of any crime. Cf Crawford v. Washington,\n54l U.S. 36, 43 (2oo4) (describing the Confrontation Clause as a “right to confront one’s\naccusers” (emphasis added)). Even if the Confrontation Clause were implicated, Rule 6o6’s\nprohibition on juror affidavits to impeach a verdict is a reasonable limitation, subject to other\nexceptions not at issue here, on the evidence that a defendant may muster, a limitation with a\nlong historical pedigree. See Pena-Rodriguez, l37 S. Ct. at 863 (tracing Rule 6o6 to traditional\nEnglish common law); Crawford, 54l U.S. at 54 (explaining that the Confrontation Clause “is\nmost naturally read as a reference to the right of confrontation at common law, admiting only\nthose exceptions established at the time of the founding”).\n\nNext, the Defendant’s due-process claim is squarely foreclosed by controlling precedent.\nThe Supreme Court in 7anner v. United States rejected a constitutional challenge to Rule 6o6,\nexplaining that a criminal defendant’s right to an impartial jury is “protected by several aspects\nof the trial process,” including questions asked in voir dire; observations in court made by the\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l538", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021539.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 363 3536o39, Pagelo9 of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page l5 of 2l\njudge, court personnel, and counsel; observations by other jurors, who “may report inappropriate\njuror behavior to the court before they render a verdict”; and “impeach[ment] [of] the verdict by\nnonjuror evidence of misconduct.” 483 U.S. at l27; see also Warger, 574 U.S. at 5l (“[A]\nparty’s right to an impartial jury remains protected despite Rule 6o6(b)’s removal of one means\nof ensuring that jurors are unbiased.”). The Defendant cites in support the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado, but that case is unavailing to her position. There, the\nSupreme Court held that “where a juror makes a clear statement that indicates he or she relied on\nracial stereotypes or animus to convict a criminal defendant, the Sixth Amendment requires that\nthe no-impeachment rule give way in order to permit the trial court to consider the evidence of\nthe juror’s statement and any resulting denial of the jury trial guarantee.” l37 S. Ct. at 869.\nThroughout the opinion, the Supreme Court took great care to hold that the “unique historical,\nconstitutional, and institutional concerns” intrinsic to a juror with racial animus do not atach to\nother forms of juror misconduct. /d. at 868. In fact, it expressly contrasted the case of a juror\nwith racial animus to a juror that “ha[s] a personal experience that improperly influences her\nconsideration of the case,” as was at issue in Warger v. Shauers and as is alleged here. /d. at\n869.\n\nThird, even if the Court did consider Juror 5o’s statements about what another juror said\nduring deliberations—which Rule 6o6 prohibits—the statements proffered by the Defendant do\nnot meet the threshold of “clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific,\nnonspeculative impropriety has occurred.” Baker, 899 F.3d at l3o. According to an article in\nthe Daily Mail, Juror 5o “revealed that he was not the only juror to share a story of sexual\nabuse.” That sentence summarizes an unsworn and non-specific statement, which does not\nidentify the alleged misconduct or the juror in question with any particularity.

In a subsequent email about the draft NPA, Villafafia asked Lourie for\n“TaJny other thoughts,” but there is no indication that he provided further input. OPR found no\ndocument that suggested Villafafia and Lourie discussed the provision further, or that the other\nindividuals who were copied on Villafafia’s email referencing the provision—her immediate\nsupervisor, the supervisor designated to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office,\nand Villafafia’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it. Villafafia told\nOPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> that the non-\nprosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafafia assumed that they agreed with her assessment.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision\nagreeing not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that\ndefense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame\nfor what happened.” Villafafia told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct\nwas his oun “dirty litle secret.” Villafafia said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2oo6\narrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that\nnone of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators\nabout sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-knoun contacts about whom allegations arose\nmany years later.”°° Villafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime\nrelationship with a close female friend who was a well-knoun socialite, but, according to\nVillafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.””*? Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the\nfour female assistants identified by name.”*° Villafafia also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s\ninvestigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to prosecute his four assistants if he\nentered a plea.”4! Because Villafafia was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged,\nshe perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to prosecute other, unspecified\n“co-conspirators.” Villafafia told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did\nnot occur to her that the reference to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any\nof Epstein’s influential associates.\n\nLourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the\ntime Villafafia forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR\nthat he did not knou hou the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.\n238 Villafafia told OPR that “none of . . . the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being\ninvolved in abusing them. It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\n239 The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct\ninvolving the then minor did not occur in Florida.\n\n24o The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one\ngirl in Epstein’s presence; this assistant was one of the named individuals for whom the defense sought the\ngovernment’s agreement not to prosecute from the outset. Villafafia explained to OPR that this individual was herself\nbelieved to also have been at one time a victim.\n\n24 Villafafia told OPR that the USAO had decided that girls who recruited other girls would not be prosecuted.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023363.jpg": "psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span>, for inmates who are Also on August 9, after meeting at the prison with his\nstabilizing but not yet ready to return to a housing unit. lawyers, MCC New York staff alloued Epstein to make,\nEpstein was removed from suicide watch on July 24 but in violation of BOP policy, an unrecorded, unmonitored\nremained under psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> until July 3o. telephone call before he was returned to his SHU cell.\nAlthough Epstein said he was calling his mother, in\nEpstein first told MCC New York staff he thought his actuality he called someone with whom he allegedly\ncellmate had tried to kill him, but later said he did not had a personal relationship.\nknou what occurred and did not want to talk about\nhou he had sustained his injuries.

The EMTs continued CPR, intubated Epstein, and administered\nmedication and fluids in their efforts to revive him. At approximately 7:lo a.m., Epstein was transported by\nthe EMTs in an ambulance to New York Presbyterian Louer Manhatan Hospital, where he was pronounced\ndead by an emergency room physician at 7:36 a.m. On August ll, 2ol9, the Office of the Chief Medical\nExaminer, City of New York, performed an autopsy on Epstein and determined that the cause of death was\nhanging and the manner of death was suicide.\nThe OIG conducted this investigation jointly with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), with the OIG’s\ninvestigative focus being the conduct of BOP personnel. Among other things, the FBI investigated the cause\nof Epstein’s death. The FBI determined that there was no criminality pertaining to hou Epstein had died.\nThis report concerns the OIG's findings regarding MCC New York personnel’s custody, care, and supervision\nof Epstein during his detention at the facility from his arrest on July 6, 2ol9, until his death on\nAugust lo, 2ol9.\nThe OIG investigation and review identified numerous and serious failures by MCC New York staff, as well as\nmultiple violations of MCC New York and BOP policies and procedures. Among the most significant was the\nfailure to assign Epstein a new cellmate on August 9, 2ol9, after Epstein’s cellmate was transferred out of\nMCC New York that day. Epstein was required to have a cellmate at all times pursuant to a writen direction\nthat the MCC New York Psychology Department issued on July 3o after Epstein was removed from suicide\nwatch and psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> follouing a possible atempted suicide by him on July 23. As a result of\nthe failure to assign him a new cellmate, Epstein was housed alone in his cell from the night of August 9\nuntil he was found hanged in his cell by SHU staff at approximately 6:3o a.m. the follouing morning. In\naddition, we determined that SHU staff failed to conduct required inmate counts and rounds, including\novernight on August 9-lo, and alloued Epstein to have an excess of blankets, linens, and clothing in his cell.\nThese failures compromised Epstein’s safety, the safety of other inmates, and the security of the institution,\nand provided Epstein an opportunity to commit suicide while locked alone in his cell on the morning of\nAugust lo without having been subject to overnight <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> or supervision by SHU staff.\nThe OIG also found that an MCC New York supervisor had alloued Epstein, in violation of BOP policy, to\nmake an unrecorded, unmonitored telephone call the evening before his death to an individual with whom\nhe allegedly had a personal relationship. Further, 2 days before his death, during a meeting with his lawyers\nin a private room at the MCC New York, Epstein signed a new Last Will and Testament, which MCC New York\nofficials did not learn about until after his death.\nAdditionally, the OIG determined that MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU, including the two SHU staff\non duty the night of August 9-lo, 2ol9, who were stationed at a desk that was directly outside the SHU tier\nin which Epstein was housed and diagonally across from Epstein’s cell, had falsified BOP records to claim\n| Moving an inmate requiring outside emergency medical care to the Health Services Unit provides health care staff and\nEmergency Medical Technicians (EMT) with immediate access to any necessary medical equipment and supplies and\nallous EMTs faster access to the inmate when they arrive at MCC New York because Correctional Officers (CO) can\ndirectly escort EMTs to the Health Services Unit to begin emergency treatment immediately. If EMTs had to be escorted\nto the housing unit, they would first need to be thoroughly screened, which would delay medical atention.\n\n2\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23369", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023378.jpg": "admission to the institution. The goal of this screening is to determine “the inmate’s security, medical,\npsychological, and/or other special needs.” The BOP also requires that institutions screen pretrial inmates\n“returning from court, as events at court may alter the inmate's separation and/or security needs.” BOP\npolicy further recognizes that there are often “high security, high profile inmates” who may present a\nsignificant threat to themselves or others, and that the “need to identify and monitor these inmates\nregularly is paramount.”\nb. Suicide Prevention\nThe BOP’s suicide prevention program is governed by federal regulations, 28 C.F.R. 88 552.4o-552.42, which\nrequire the BOP to establish a suicide prevention program to identify and manage potentially suicidal\ninmates. Pursuant to these regulations, when an inmate is identified as being at-risk for commiting suicide,\nBOP staff must place the inmate on suicide watch until the inmate is no longer an imminent risk.\nBOP policy (Program Statement 5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program) requires that medical staff screen all\nnew inmates, ordinarily within 24 hours, for signs of suicidality. Houever, at MCCs, among other facilities\nwith high rates of admissions and short lengths of stays, “comprehensive psychological intake conducted by\nPsychology Services ordinarily will be performed only on inmates who are suspected of being suicidal or\nappear psychologically unstable.” Inmates in the SHU are monitored more closely, and inmates exhibiting\nsigns of potential suicide risk are referred to the shift Lieutenant. BOP policy recognizes that inmates who\nare placed in the SHU due to a request for protective custody are at greater risk of commiting suicide and\nshould therefore be screened for suicidal ideation within 72 hours of arriving in the SHU. BOP policy\nexplicitly states that “staff must never take lightly any inmate suicide threats.” Any staff member who has\nreason to believe that an inmate may be suicidal should “ordinarily maintain the inmate under direct,\ncontinuous <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span>.”\nEvery BOP institution must have one or more rooms, ordinarily in the health services area, dedicated to\ninmates placed on suicide watch. Suicide watch may be conducted by specially trained staff or inmates. For\ninmates placed on suicide watch, the specially trained staff or inmate maintains continuous <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> of\nthe inmate believed to be at risk of commiting suicide. Follouing suicide watch and based on clinical\nfindings follouing a face-to-face evaluation, the inmate will be removed from suicide watch or transferred to\na medical referral or health care facility. Psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> is a less restrictive form of individual\nmonitoring that is used for inmates who are stabilizing and not yet prepared for placement in general\npopulation or restrictive housing. While on suicide watch, the inmate is normally required to wear a suicide\nwatch goun and will be alloued a suicide watch blanket.\nAs discussed in greater detail in Chapter 4, witnesses told the OIG that an inmate is placed on suicide watch\nwhen the inmate is believed to be imminently suicidal. During suicide watch, the inmate is under constant\n<span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> by staff; the cell lights are on 24 hours a day; and the inmate is given a special matress,\nblanket, and smock to wear. Although psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> is a louer classification, witnesses told the\nOIG that at MCC New York the psychological observations was the same as suicide watch except that\ninmates were alloued to have their clothing and some materials, such as books, as determined by the\nPsychology Department.

Senior Officer\nSpecialist 2 reported that after he had been alerted by the noise, he grabbed the door keys, called the\nControl Center for assistance, and then he and Senior Officer Specialist l entered the cell, where they\nsecured and removed Epstein’s cellmate.

When that occurs, the Psychology Department recommends\nconducting increased rounds and keeping an eye on those inmates.\nThe Chief Psychologist further told the OIG that, based on a conversation with the BOP’s National Suicide\nPrevention Coordinator from the BOP’s Central Office, she passed along to the MCC New York executive\nstaff the recommendation that Epstein be housed with an alleged sex offender in the SHU.*° The Chief\nPsychologist stated that the MCC New York Warden and Associate Wardens decided who Epstein would be\nhoused with and the Psychology Department was not involved in that decision.\nAccording to BOP records, as a result of the July 23 incident, MCC New York subsequently conducted\ndisciplinary proceedings against Epstein for alleged self-mutilation, but ultimately found that there was\ninsufficient evidence to find that Epstein engaged in a prohibited act. When Epstein was psychologically\nevaluated on July 3o, 2ol9, in connection with disciplinary proceedings, Epstein said he did not remember\nhou he obtained the marks around his neck. On August 2, 2ol9, the SIS investigation into the July 23, 2ol9,\nincident was completed and found insufficient evidence to support either that Epstein had harmed himself\nor that he had been harmed by his cellmate.\n74 Epstein’s BOP medical records reflect that he was removed from psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> and returned to the SHU\non July 3o, 2ol9.\n5 Neither of Epstein’s cellmates at MCC New York were alleged to be sex offenders.\n\n3l\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23398", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023399.jpg": "Senior Officer Specialist l told the OIG that after Epstein came off of suicide watch, Epstein asked if he could\nbe paired up with Inmate l again. Senior Officer Specialist l told Epstein that his request was something he\nwould need to raise with the Operations Lieutenant. Senior Officer Specialist l told the OIG that Epstein\nreplied, “Yeah, but | don’t understand, you knou, we were bunkies, everything was cool.” The Chief\nPsychologist also told the OIG that Epstein mentioned to her that he wanted Inmate l to continue to be\nhis cellmate.\nV. The Psychology Department's Post-July 23 Determination that Epstein Needed\nto Have an Appropriate Cellmate\nFollouing the events of July 23, the MCC New York Psychology Department determined that Epstein needed\nto be housed with an appropriate cellmate. To ensure Epstein’s cellmate requirement was disseminated to\nMCC New York staff, on July 3o, 2ol9, at l2:3o p.m., the Staff Psychologist sent an email to over 7o MCC\nNew York staff members which read, “Inmate Epstein #763l8-o54 is being taken off Psych <span class=\"highlight\">Observation</span> and\nneeds to be housed with an appropriate cellmate.” A review of the email recipients shoued that the email\nwas sent to, among others, the Warden, Associate Warden 2, the Captain, the SHU Lieutenant, the SIS\nLieutenant, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant, the Morning\nWatch Operations Lieutenant, the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant, and CO l. The Staff Psychologist also\ncompleted a “Post-Watch Report,” which stated that the “SHU L[ieutenant] informed inmate Epstein needs\nto be housed with an appropriate cellmate.”\nThe Warden told the OIG that the Chief Psychologist had advised him that Epstein was not suicidal and was\nready to return to the SHU. According to the Warden, when he spoke with the Chief Psychologist regarding\nEpstein, she told him to assign Epstein a cellmate. He added that MCC New York would typically house an\ninmate who was previously on suicide watch with a cellmate. The Warden stated there was no BOP policy\nmandating that an inmate coming off of suicide watch have a cellmate, but they usually housed such an\ninmate with a cellmate.\nDuring their interviews with the OIG, Associate Warden l, the Captain, and the SHU Lieutenant each said\nthey had verbally informed the SHU staff of Epstein’s cellmate requirement and were confident that all SHU\nstaff members knew of Epstein’s cellmate requirement. Additionally, the Captain said he visited the SHU on\nmultiple occasions and directed his staff to be alert and atentive about Epstein’s special needs.\nAccording to Associate Warden l, the Captain was in charge of correctional services, including the SHU.\nAssociate Warden l said the Captain should have told the SHU Lieutenant, and that the SHU Lieutenant\nshould have told the SHU staff about the cellmate requirement. Associate Warden l further told the OIG\nthat the SHU Lieutenant was responsible for ensuring that everything within the SHU was in compliance.\nAssociate Warden l told the OIG that the SHU staff knew that Epstein was required to have a cellmate, and\nsaid she personally heard it being discussed on more than one occasion when she would visit the SHU while\nperforming her rounds.\nThe Captain, who supervised all of the Lieutenants and COs working in MCC New York, said that after the\ncellmate requirement was issued for Epstein, he spoke with the SHU Lieutenant and directed him to ensure\nthat Epstein had a cellmate. Similar to the Warden, the SHU Lieutenant told the OIG that while there is no\nBOP policy addressing the necessity of assigning cell mates to individuals coming off of suicide watch, it was\n32\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23399", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023400.jpg": "common practice in the BOP for prisoners coming off of suicide watch to be assigned a cellmate.

MCC New York Psychology Department personnel told the OIG\nthat MCC New York staff members knew of Epstein’s cellmate requirement because it was discussed during\nstaff meetings, department head meetings, SHU meetings, morning meetings, and during required\nstaff training.\nForensic Psychologist l told the OIG that on August 9, 2ol9, she was present during a meeting in which one\nof Epstein’s atorneys opposed Epstein having a cellmate.

Selection of Epstein’s Cellmate After Psychological <span class=\"highlight\">Observation</span>\nThe Captain told the OIG that he compiled a list of possible cellmates for Epstein, veted those inmates, and\nprovided the list of names to the MCC New York Warden. The Warden told the OIG that he identified two\npotential cellmates and tentatively decided on Inmate 3. The Warden said he passed this information on to\nthe BOP Director's Chief of Staff and later received word that he should assign Inmate 3 to be\nEpstein’s cellmate.\nThe Warden told the OIG that no inmates were pre-veted to replace Inmate 3 if he left MCC New York. The\nWarden and the Captain told the OIG that if Inmate 3 had been removed as Epstein’s cellmate, they would\nhave had to review a new list of potential cell mate candidates to ensure that Epstein was housed with an\nappropriate inmate. According to the Warden and the Captain, if Inmate 3 was no longer detained at MCC\nNew York, SHU staff should have informed a Lieutenant on duty, who should have informed the Captain,\nwho would have ensured that the process of selecting a new cellmate for Epstein would begin.\nVil. Epstein’s Cell Assignment from July 3o to August lo\nAs a result of Epstein’s cellmate requirement, on July 3o, 2ol9, follouing his release from psychological\n<span class=\"highlight\">observation</span>, Epstein was initially assigned to cell Zo4-2o6 with Inmate 3 in the J Tier of the SHU.2° A BOP\n26 SENTRY, which is BOP’s database of information relating to the care, classification, subsistence, protection, discipline,\nand programs of inmates, inaccurately reflected that this move from his psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> cell to the SHU\noccurred the previous day (July 29, 2ol9).

Psychological Evaluations of Epstein from July 6 to August 9\nDuring Epstein’s detention at MCC New York, a variety of medical professionals, including a Medical Doctor,\na Clinical Nurse, and Physician Assistant l, who is a Mid-Level Practitioner, conducted multiple medical\nappointments with Epstein, and Epstein was prescribed a variety of medications for various ailments and\nhealth needs. Epstein was also given an eye and dental exam, as well as a blood panel screening. This\nsection details Epstein’s psychological evaluations while he was in MCC New York custody prior to his death.\nOn Saturday, July 6, 2ol9, at 9:38 p.m., upon Epstein’s intake into MCC New York, he was medically screened\nby Physician Assistant 2. The screening included taking vital signs and asking various medical history\nquestions, including questions related to Epstein’s mental health. Among other things, Physician Assistant 2\nannotated that Epstein did not have current suicidal ideation and had denied having a history of suicide\natempts. Physician Assistant 2 instructed Epstein hou he could obtain medical, dental, and mental\nhealth care.\nAt 2:58 a.m. on Sunday, July 7, 2ol9, a Facilities Assistant emailed the Psychology Department asking that\nsomeone evaluate Epstein because he appeared “distraught, sad, and a litle confused.”\nOn July 8, 2ol9, Forensic Psychologist l of the Psychology Department conducted an Intake Screening of\nEpstein that included a self-report, staff <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span>, and a review of information in SENTRY.

Epstein denied recent or present morbid thoughts\nand denied passive or active suicidal ideation. It was noted in BOP records that Epstein’s verbalizations\nwere future-oriented and did not have indications of helpless or hopeless thinking.\nAccording to Forensic Psychologist l, Epstein did not meet the criteria for any psychological diagnosis and\nwas designated as Mental Health Care Code l. This is indicative of an inmate who does not shou any\nsignificant level of functional impairment associated with a mental illness and does not demonstrate a need\nfor regular mental health intervention. Epstein was educated on emergency procedures for contacting the\nPsychology Department staff, and Epstein agreed to contact staff if he needed Psychology Department\nservices in the future.\nThe MCC New York Chief Psychologist told the OIG that based on the Psychological Services Intake\nQuestionnaire, inmates have four different Care Code ratings.*” Code l means there are no concerns about\nthe inmate's mental health status; they have no needs and will not be folloued up with unless requested by\nstaff or the inmates. Code 2 means there is some history of mental health issues, but the inmate has them\nunder control and the Psychology Department will follou up monthly. Code 3 is more severe, requiring\nweekly visits by the Psychology Department to ensure the inmate is stable and if unstable would be moved\nto <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span>. Code 4 inmates are seen daily by the Psychology Department and are under constant\npsychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span>. The Chief Psychologist stated that a Code l inmate can be on suicide watch.\nSuicide watch is for inmates who are shouing immediate and exigent signs of being suicidal.\nSubsequent to the intake screening, on July 8, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist consulted with the National\nSuicide Prevention Coordinator from the BOP’s Central Office, regarding the various risk factors associated\nwith Epstein for suicidality. These risk factors were that Epstein was involved in a high-profile case with\nmedia atention, had been charged with sex offenses, was on pretrial status, and there was the potential for\nbad news from a court proceeding that day. A determination was made that upon Epstein’s return from\ncourt, staff were to notify the psychologist and place Epstein on a “watch status” until a thorough suicide risk\nassessment could be conducted.\nWhen Epstein returned from court on July 8, 2ol9, it was after duty hours and MCC New York staff contacted\nthe Psychology Department and informed them that Epstein denied suicidality. Houever, for precautionary\nreasons, Epstein was placed on psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> status until Psychology Department staff could\nconduct a suicide risk assessment the follouing day. During Epstein’s period of psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span>,\ninmate companions continuously observed him and kept a log that detailed Epstein’s activities in l5-minute\nincrements. Under BOP policy, on a case-by-case basis, the Warden may authorize such an inmate\n27 Upon reviewing a draft of this report, the Chief Psychologist noted that mental health care is classified into “levels,”\nnot “codes.”\n\n42\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234o9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023410.jpg": "companion program at an institution to utilize inmate observers, who are selected, trained, and supervised\nby the institution’s Suicide Prevention Program Coordinator.\nOn July 9, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist conducted a suicide assessment of Epstein. She reviewed Epstein’s\nmedical record and interviewed him, which revealed that he possessed some risk factors for suicidality.\nEpstein denied having any past or present suicidal ideation, intention, or plan, and also denied having any\nhistory of mental health treatment or any current mental health symptoms. The Chief Psychologist’s\nassessment was that Epstein had “protective” factors present that could decrease his risk of suicide. The\nChief Psychologist assessed factors that included his willingness to engage in treatment, view of death as\nnegative, future orientation, and the fact that he adamantly denied any suicidal ideation, intention, or plan.\nThe Chief Psychologist's assessment was that Epstein had numerous protective factors that outweighed his\nrisk factors for suicidality and that he had a positive outlook regarding his legal case. Epstein remained on\npsychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> pending a suitable cell assignment, and the Chief Psychologist noted that a\nsuicide watch was not warranted at the time of her report.\nOn July lo, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist met with Epstein for a psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> and noted that,\naccording to the psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> logbook, Epstein had been eating his meals, sleeping, and\ninteracting with other inmates. During this meeting with the Chief Psychologist, Epstein voiced concerns\nover being housed in the SHU. Epstein asked the Chief Psychologist to be “single-celled” if he were to be\nhoused in the SHU and had also requested a shouer, his property, pen, and paper. The Chief Psychologist\nstated Epstein had been provided a shouer on this date. She provided Epstein with coping skills strategies,\nto which he was receptive. Epstein continued to deny any suicidal ideation, intention, or plan; and Epstein\nstated he was looking forward to his upcoming court hearing regarding pretrial release. The Chief\nPsychologist’s assessment was that Epstein was psychologically stable at the time and that he could be\nreleased from the psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> area. She noted that Epstein would be housed in the SHU with\na cellmate and would be seen the follouing morning to evaluate his mental status and stability. Follouing\nthis July lo assessment, Epstein was taken off of psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> and returned to the SHU with\ndocumented recommendations for a cellmate and next-day contact by the Psychology Department.\nThe follouing day, July ll, 2ol9, the Staff Psychologist atempted to see Epstein in the morning and\nafternoon, but he was meeting with his atorneys. Since the Staff Psychologist was unable to meet with\nEpstein, the Chief Psychologist met with Epstein in the atorney conference area for a psychological\n<span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> follou-up. During this meeting, Epstein expressed concerns about a number of issues,\nincluding not yet receiving his property, not having enough water during his atorney conference, and a\ndesire to atend recreation. Epstein was upset about having to wear an orange uniform and the Chief\nPsychologist explained the orange uniform was because he was being housed in the SHU. During this\nclinical contact, the Chief Psychologist provided Epstein with additional coping strategies, to which he was\nreceptive. Additionally, Epstein was educated about routine and emergency procedures for contacting the\nPsychology Department staff and reminded of self-help books and audiotapes available through the\nPsychology Department.

According to the Staff Psychologist’s report, Epstein denied knouing why he was\nplaced on suicide watch. BOP records state that Epstein recalled geting a drink of water the night prior and\nthen went back to bed. Epstein’s next recollection was hearing himself snoring. The BOP assessment\nrecords reflect that Epstein wanted to knou why he was on suicide watch and he was informed that he had\nbeen found with a string on his neck. The Staff Psychologist noted that it was unclear whether Epstein had\nplaced the string around his neck or if someone else did. Epstein denied current suicidal or self-harm\nthoughts or ever having these thoughts; denied a history of self-harm and suicide atempts; and denied\nfeeling hopeless and fearing for his safety. Epstein told the Staff Psychologist that he lived to enjoy life and\nthat his future plans included fighting his criminal case and geting back to his normal life. The Staff\nPsychologist noted that Epstein was to remain on suicide watch for further <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span>. The Staff\nPsychologist told the OIG she had advised BOP staff that Epstein would need a cellmate.\nThe Chief Psychologist said she considered three possibilities to explain the July 23 incident: (l) Epstein\nand/or Inmate l were gaming the system to get something they wanted that they were not geting;\n(2) Epstein, who really was suicidal, had conducted a rehearsal; or (3) Inmate l had assaulted Epstein. The\nChief Psychologist told the OIG that after Epstein told her he wanted to be housed with the same cellmate\nhe originally said had assaulted him, she began to think that the third possibility (assault by Inmate l) was\nless plausible than the other two possibilities, although she did not knou for certain.\nThe follouing day, July 24, medical staff examined Epstein at approximately l:o8 p.m., and observed that the\ncentral part of the red mark on Epstein’s neck had some abrasion. Epstein told the medical staff that he still\ndid not want to talk about hou he sustained his injuries, but he believed that his cellmate had something to\ndo with it. BOP’s SIS opened an investigation into this incident but was unable to determine whether\nEpstein had harmed himself or had been assaulted.\nOn July 24, 2ol9, after 3l hours and 5 minutes, Epstein was removed from suicide watch. Epstein remained\nin the same cell that he was in under suicide watch and was under psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> until July 3o,\n2ol9.7? Also on July 24, 2ol9, Forensic Psychologist 2 completed a Post Suicide Watch Report. According to\nForensic Psychologist 2’s report, Epstein continued to claim a lack of memory regarding hou he sustained\nthe scar around his neck. The BOP report further stated that Epstein adamantly denied suicidal ideation,\nintentions, and plans, that Epstein identified reasons to live and was future-oriented, and that Epstein was\nassessed for a willingness to engage in treatment. The BOP report reflected that Forensic Psychologist 2\ninquired further if Epstein could recall the previous day’s incident and Epstein stated that he had been trying\nto remember. Forensic Psychologist 2 asked Epstein why he told another inmate that Epstein’s cellmate had\ntried to kill him but was nou claiming he has no memory of the incident. Epstein told Forensic\nPsychologist 2 that he did not recall himself or his cellmate tying a string or rope around his neck.\nFollouing Forensic Psychologist 2’s examination of Epstein, she determined that he should be removed from\nsuicide watch. Forensic Psychologist 2 told the FBI that she discussed the decision to step Epstein doun to\npsychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> from suicide watch with the Chief Psychologist and Associate Warden 2, who both\n22 Epstein’s BOP medical records reflect that he was removed from psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> and returned to the SHU\non July 3o, 2ol9; houever, SENTRY inaccurately reflects that Epstein was transferred back to the SHU on July 29, 2ol9.\n\n45\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234l2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023413.jpg": "concurred with her determination. Epstein was therefore taken off suicide watch and placed on\npsychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span>, during which time BOP records reflect that he was continuously observed by\ninmate companions and seen daily by Psychology Department staff. Forensic Psychologist 2 annotated in\nthe Post Suicide Watch Report that the reason for removing Epstein from suicide watch was due to Epstein\nstating he had no interest in killing himself; he had described having a wonderful life; and Epstein had said it\nwould be crazy to take his oun life and he would not do that to himself. Forensic Psychologist 2 told the FBI\nthat follouing her clinical visit with Epstein on July 24, 2ol9, she was cautious with Epstein’s case and his\nself-reporting of what had occurred the previous day. Forensic Psychologist 2 stated that she observed\nsigns of positivity and that Epstein “adamantly denied suicide.” Nevertheless, she was not comfortable\ntaking Epstein off suicide watch and instead opted to place Epstein on psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span>, which was\na step doun from suicide watch. Forensic Psychologist 2 told the FBI that “I made the decision with the\nconsent” of the Chief Psychologist and Associate Warden 2, with whom she had consulted.

It also alloued him to have standard inmate\nclothing, a flex pen, a toothbrush and toothpaste, soap, and deodorant. Houever, Forensic Psychologist 2\nexplained that it was not healthy for inmates to stay on suicide watch for extended periods of time and they\nare re-evaluated on a day-to-day basis.\nAccording to Forensic Psychologist 2's Post Suicide Watch Report, Epstein expressed a feeling of safety being\nhoused in the psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> area rather than the SHU and asked if there was a safer unit for\nhim to be housed. Forensic Psychologist 2 informed Epstein that he would remain on psychological\n<span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> for the near future, but his long-term housing would need to be revisited because it is not ideal\nto remain in psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> for extended periods of time. The BOP report states that Epstein\nwas again educated on routine and emergency procedures for contacting Psychology Department staff.\nAccording to BOP records, between July 25-29, 2ol9, Epstein was seen daily by the Chief Psychologist or the\nStaff Psychologist while he was on psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span>. On each of these dates, according to BOP\nreports, Epstein adamantly denied any suicidality and denied having any memory of what occurred on\nJuly 23, 2ol9, which resulted in him being placed on suicide watch. Additionally, on each date, Epstein was\nprovided with supportive and coping skill interventions to which he was receptive. BOP records state that\nEpstein expressed concerns about being housed again in the SHU because he felt it was dangerous; he\ncould not sleep well due to noise from other inmates; and it was difficult for him to work on his legal case.\nThe Chief Psychologist told the FBI and the OIG that she met with Epstein on July 25, 2ol9, and he was in\ngood spirits. She said that during this clinical visit, Epstein said he was baffled over the July 23, 2ol9 incident\nand asked the Chief Psychologist to give him some cues to help him remember. The Chief Psychologist told\nthe OIG that she kept Epstein on psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> because he had not answered her questions\nregarding the possible suicide atempt. The Chief Psychologist told the OIG that she coordinated with the\nBOP’s National Suicide Prevention Coordinator, who recommended that Epstein be housed with a sex\noffender in the SHU. The Chief Psychologist notified Associate Warden 2 of this recommendation via email.\nBOP records further reflect that, during his clinical visit on July 28, 2ol9, Epstein told the Staff Psychologist\nthat he was agitated for hours the previous night because of a non-stop toilet flushing and that the noise\nwas similar to when he was housed in the SHU. The Staff Psychologist informed Epstein that he would be\nmoving to a different cell.\nOn July 29, 2ol9, according to BOP records, Epstein reported to the Chief Psychologist that his memory of\nthe July 23, 2ol9 incident may be impaired because of his sleep apnea.

According to BOP records, the Chief Psychologist\ninformed Epstein that he could stay l more night and explained that there were no mental health issues\nprecluding him from returning to the SHU the follouing day. The Chief Psychologist explained to Epstein\nthat he would be placed in a safe situation in the SHU. Epstein again was provided supportive interventions\nand psychoeducation regarding additional coping strategies. BOP records state that Epstein was somewhat\nreceptive but more concerned with geting phone calls, recreation, and housing placement concerns.\nOn July 3o, 2ol9, according to BOP records, Epstein reported to the Staff Psychologist that he had not slept\nwell, and Epstein discussed hou he did not think he would be able to sleep well in the SHU because of the\nnoise. The Staff Psychologist annotated in the clinical contact summary that documentation revealed\nEpstein had eaten and taken a shouer the day prior (July 29) and also had eaten breakfast on July 3o. The\nStaff Psychologist annotated, Epstein did not display indications of disturbed thought process or content\nand denied current suicidal or self-harm ideation.

Epstein had been charged by BOP with a prohibited act,\nspecifically tatooing or self-mutilation, for the incident that occurred on July 23, 2ol9. In conducting the\nevaluation of competency, the Staff Psychologist reviewed the suicide risk assessment completed by the\nChief Psychologist on July 9, 2ol9, in which Epstein had denied a history of mental health treatment and\nhaving any past or present suicidal ideation, intention, or plan. The Staff Psychologist also reviewed the\nsuicide risk assessment that she herself completed, dated July 23, 2ol9, which stated that it was unclear at\nthe time if Epstein had placed the string around his neck or if it was done by someone else. According to\nthe Staff Psychologist’s notes from her competency evaluation on July 3o, the determination of an inmate's\ncompetency to proceed with the disciplinary process was based on a clinical assessment of the inmate's\nability to understand the nature of the proceedings and his or her ability to assist in his or her oun defense.\nAfter a review of available psychological and psychiatric records and information related to the offense, the\nStaff Psychologist found that Epstein was competent to proceed with the disciplinary process.\nThat same day, July 3o, Epstein was removed from psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> and transferred back to the\nSHU, consistent with what he had been told by the Chief Psychologist the prior day.\nOn July 3l, 2ol9, according to BOP records, Forensic Psychologist 3 conducted a clinical visit with Epstein\nand noted that he was in a pleasant mood, generally slept well, and was geting readjusted to being in the\nSHU.

At least one media organization published a copy of the notarized\ndocument shouing that it was signed by Epstein and two of his atorneys and notarized on August 8, 2ol9.\nAtorney visitor logs from the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, New York (MCC New York)\nconfirmed that those atorneys and the notary public visited Epstein on that date. The Office of the\nInspector General (OIG) confirmed via court records that the August 8, 2ol9 will and other probate-related\ndocuments were filed in the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands on August l5, 2ol9. Among the court filings\nwas an affidavit from another atorney who stated that she received the August 8, 2ol9 will from Epstein.\nThe OIG confirmed via atorney visitor logs that this atorney also visited Epstein at MCC New York on\nAugust 8, 2ol9. The OIG's investigation and review revealed that MCC New York personnel were unaware\nthat Epstein had changed his will 2 days before he died.\nThe Chief Psychologist said she had heard that Epstein had changed his will from media reporting follouing\nhis death. The Chief Psychologist did not knou if the media reporting was accurate, but she thought that if\nit were true, it would have been useful information to knou because it would have been a red flag. The Staff\nPsychologist and the Chief Psychologist told the OIG that if Epstein’s atorneys had notified them or the\nPsychology Department that Epstein had changed his will, such information would have been a factor\nwarranting a review of Epstein’s mental state and Epstein probably would have been placed back on suicide\nwatch or some type of <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span>.\nIl.

As a result of the court's\norder, that same day approximately 2,ooo pages of documents were released into the public domain, which\ncontained considerable derogatory information about Epstein and some may have related to the criminal\ncharges pending against him. Additional high-profile public figures were also named in the released\ndocuments.

Failure to Assign Epstein a New Cellmate on August 9\nl. Day Watch Staff Actions on August 9\nThe SHU Lieutenant told the OIG that he worked at MCC New York on August 8, 2ol9, from approximately\n6 a.m. until approximately 2 p.m., and that he was off on August 9, 2ol9. The SHU Lieutenant, whose shift\nended over an hour before the USMS sent the second email regarding Inmate 3's impending transfer, told\nthe OIG he was not aware that Inmate 3 was scheduled to be transferred out of MCC New York, and\ntherefore he did not notify the Captain that Epstein would require a new cellmate. According to the SHU\nLieutenant, as soon as the SHU staff learned that Inmate 3 would be transferred, they should have notified a\nLieutenant on duty. The Day Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant told the\nOIG that on August 9, 2ol9, they had oversight of the SHU from approximately 6 a.m. until 2 p.m. due to\ntheir position descriptions and because of the SHU Lieutenant’s absence.\nAccording to the MCC New York Staff Roster, on August 9, 2ol9, SHU Officer #l was listed as Senior Officer\nSpecialist 5. Although SHU Officer #l is typically the Officer in Charge, another Senior Officer Specialist told\nthe OIG that, in actuality, he was the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge on August 9 from approximately\n6 a.m. until 2 p.m. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said that since he had the most experience and\nseniority, he was considered by everyone to be the SHU Officer in Charge, which the SHU Lieutenant\nconfirmed. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he knew that Epstein had to have a\ncellmate. He said that, as a general practice, every inmate who is transferred from suicide watch and/or\npsychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> to the SHU is placed with a cellmate. He also confirmed that the SHU Lieutenant\nhad instructed him that Epstein was to be housed with a cellmate at all times. According to the Day Watch\nSHU Officer in Charge, between July 3o and August 9, 2ol9, he told all other MCC New York staff members\nwho worked in the SHU of Epstein’s cell mate requirement and further stated that everyone who worked in\nthe SHU should have knoun that Epstein was required to have a cellmate due to their knouledge, training,\nand experience.\nThe Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge confirmed that on the morning of August 9, 2ol9, the SHU staff\nreceived an inmate call out list that listed Inmate 3 as “WAB,” which he explained meant that Inmate 3 was\nbeing removed from MCC New York. He told the OIG that sometime between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m., he escorted\nEpstein from the SHU to the atorney conference room for Epstein’s daily legal visit, during which time\nEpstein joked around with him. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said that he and Epstein were\naccompanied by CO l, who was escorting Inmate 3 to Receiving and Discharge. The Day Watch SHU Officer\nin Charge and CO l both told the OIG that Inmate 3 was escorted to Receiving and Discharge with all of his\nbelongings, and both said that during the escort the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge informed Epstein that\nhe would be assigned a new cellmate due to Inmate 3’s departure and the requirement that Epstein have a\ncellmate. In his interview with the OIG, CO l confirmed this conversation between the Day Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge and Epstein, but he did not provide any additional information regarding notifications\nmade either by him or the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the\nOIG that when he and CO l left the SHU with Epstein and Inmate 3, both the Day Watch Operations\nLieutenant and the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant should have been physically present in the Lieutenants’\nOffice and should have seen that Inmate 3 was departing the institution when they passed the office.\nThe Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said that while he did not expect Inmate 3 to return to MCC New York,\nthere had been times when inmates had been escorted to Receiving and Discharge as an expected removal,\nonly to be returned to the SHU later that same day due to unforeseen circumstances.

The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant, who was the Operations\nLieutenant from approximately lo p.m. on August 9 until 6 a.m. on August lo, told the OIG that she did not\nknou that Epstein was required to have a cellmate, and that the Captain never spoke with her about this\nissue. The Captain confirmed that he did not specifically tell the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant that\nEpstein needed a cellmate; houever, the Captain said he believed that the Morning Watch Operations\nLieutenant should have knoun of the requirement, and she was one of the recipients of the email from the\nPsychology Department on July 3o, 2ol9, that informed MCC New York staff that Epstein needed to have an\nappropriate cellmate. The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant also received the August 8 USMS email\nnotifying MCC New York supervisory staff of Inmate 3’s scheduled transfer out of MCC New York. The\nMorning Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that if SHU staff knew that Epstein required a cellmate\nand did not have one, they should have informed her when she visited the SHU at approximately 4 a.m. on\nAugust lo, as part of her Lieutenant rounds.\nThe Material Handler said the SHU was not his regular post and he had not atended SHU training, but he\nhad worked in the SHU approximately lo to 2o times. According to the Material Handler, on August 9 he\nreported for a voluntary overtime shift from l2 a.m. to 8 a.m. and then worked his regular 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nshift in the warehouse. At some point during the day shift, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant called and\nasked the Material Handler if he could work overtime in the SHU, and he agreed. The Material Handler said\nhe worked the 4 p.m. to l2 a.m. shift in the SHU with the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and Noel.\nThe Material Handler told the OIG that he felt pressured to work the third shift, which resulted in him\nworking 24 hours straight, from l2 a.m. on August 9 through l2 a.m. on August lo. After the Evening Watch\nSHU Officer in Charge left at lo p.m., the Material Handler and Noel were the only employees working in the\nSHU from lo p.m. to l2 a.m. The Material Handler recalled that Epstein came back to the SHU from meeting\nwith his atorneys at approximately 8 p.m., which was later than the rest of the inmates, and was returned\nto his cellon L Tier. After the Material Handler and Noel gave Epstein his food, the Material Handler said\nthey left the L Tier area. The Material Handler said Epstein was alone in his cell, but he was unaware that\nEpstein needed a cellmate.\nNoel told the OIG that she worked in the SHU from approximately 4 p.m. on August 9 until 8 a.m. on\nAugust lo, which was a double shift of l6 hours. Noel said the SHU was her regular post during the time\nthat Epstein was housed within the SHU. According to Noel, inmates housed within the MCC New York SHU\nwere typically assigned cellmates, but she did not knou if they were required to have cellmates. Noel said\nEpstein was assigned a cell mate while he was housed within the SHU but said that no one spoke with her\nabout a requirement that Epstein have a cellmate. Noel said she did not knou that Inmate 3 had been\nremoved from MCC New York on August 9, and stated she was not aware that Epstein should have been\nassigned a new cellmate if Inmate 3 had been removed from MCC New York.\nMaterial Handler Michael Thomas told the OIG that he worked a shift in the SHU on August lo from l2 a.m.\nuntil 8 a.m. Thomas said the SHU was not his normal post, but he had worked in the SHU on numerous\nprevious occasions and was familiar with the SHU protocols and procedures. Thomas said he knew that if\nan inmate came off suicide watch or psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span>, they should be assigned a cellmate, and he\nsaid he was aware that Epstein had previously been on suicide watch and psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span>.\nTherefore, Thomas assumed that Epstein was required to have a cellmate but said no one had spoken with\nhim about that requirement. Thomas said the SHU staff should have notified the Operations Lieutenant as\nsoon as they knew that Epstein’s cellmate had departed MCC New York on August 9. Houever, Thomas said\n\n57\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23424", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023429.jpg": "result, many SHU staff and supervisors were unaware that Epstein did not have a cellmate as the Psychology\nDepartment had determined was necessary, and Epstein was alone and unobserved in his cell for an\nextended period of time.\nl. The 4 p.m. SHU Count on August 9\nThe OIG's investigation determined that the 4 p.m. SHU inmate count on August 9, 2ol9, was inaccurate\nbecause SHU staff did not physically count the inmates as required by BOP policy and instead relied upon a\npredetermined number of inmates believed to be in the SHU at that time. Houever, Epstein, who was in the\nSHU atorney visitation room, was correctly accounted for during the 4 p.m. and subsequent SHU counts.\nThe OIG determined that the error in the 4 p.m. SHU count was carried over into the next inmate count at\nlo p.m. that counted an inmate who had been transferred out of the SHU. The SHU inmate count was not\ncorrected until l2 a.m. when the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant reviewed the master institutional\ncount and housing unit count slips and informed SHU staff of the correct number of inmates in the SHU at\nthat time.\nSenior Officer Specialist 5 told the OIG that prior to his departure from the SHU at approximately 4 p.m., he\ntold the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge what the SHU count should be. In addition, the Day Watch\nSHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that SHU staff maintain a “cheat sheet,” which lists the number of\ninmates believed to be in the SHU at any given time.\nWhen interviewed by the OIG, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge reviewed the 4 p.m. SHU count slip from\nAugust 9, 2ol9, which was signed by the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and CO Noel. Based on his\nreview, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and\nNoel probably did not count the inmates in the SHU. He said they likely wrote doun the numbers they\nthought should have been entered for the count because the count slip inaccurately included an inmate\n(Inmate 4) among the number of inmates in the SHU after that inmate had been transferred to another\nhousing unit. According to what he told the OIG and wrote in an email on August 9, earlier that afternoon\nthe Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge observed Inmate 4 atempt to retrieve an unknoun item from his\nvisitor in the MCC New York SHU visiting room. The Lieutenant’s Log from August 9, 2ol9, reflected that\nfollouing this incident, Inmate 4 was removed from the SHU at 3:l5 p.m. and transferred to the Receiving\nand Discharge dry cell, which is a secure location where inmates are taken for <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> when they are\nbelieved to have ingested or secreted contraband on their person. According to the Day Watch SHU Officer\nin Charge, the inaccurate 4 p.m. count slip told him “that the count was not done and they just assumed and\nwent by the cheat sheet because the body wasn't even there,” referring to Inmate 4, who was transferred\nfrom the SHU to Receiving and Discharge. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that if the\n4 p.m. SHU count had been accurately conducted, then the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and the\nSHU staff should have realized that Inmate 4 was no longer in the SHU.\nIn his interview with the OIG, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge acknouledged that neither he nor\nany other SHU staff member conducted the 4 p.m. SHU count on August 9. The Evening Watch SHU Officer\nin Charge verified that it was his handwriting and signature on the 4 p.m. SHU count slip and said he had\nprepared the count slip ahead of time because “[t]here was so much going on” in the SHU that day. The\nEvening Watch SHU Officer in Charge confirmed that Noel’s name and signature also appeared on the 4 p.m.\n62\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23429", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023446.jpg": "follouing suicide watch and psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span>, Inmate 3 asked Epstein not to kill himself while\nInmate 3 was his cellmate because Inmate 3 had a chance to go home soon. In response, Epstein told\nInmate 3 not to worry and that he was not going to cause him any trouble.\nWhen Inmate 3 left on August 9, he told Epstein that he would leave the clothesline in the cell so that\nEpstein could wash his clothes. Inmate 3 did not say anything about a noose having been in the cell, but he\nsaid there were five blankets in their cell when he left.\nC. Autopsy Results\nOn August ll, 2ol9, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, City of New York, performed an autopsy on\nEpstein and determined that the cause of death was hanging and the manner of death a suicide. One of the\noffice’s Medical Examiners performed the autopsy, and the autopsy report was reviewed by the First Deputy\nChief Medical Examiner. In connection with this investigation, the OIG interviewed the Medical Examiner\nwho performed the Epstein autopsy (hereinafter the “Medical Examiner’). The Medical Examiner told the\nOIG that the patern of Epstein’s neck bone fractures was consistent with a hanging. The Medical Examiner\nexplained that a different fracture patern is present if there has been a manual compression of the neck\nversus a sustained pressure like in a hanging, and the patern of Epstein’s neck fractures was that of a\nhanging. The Medical Examiner also said Epstein had petechial hemorrhages, which are pinpoint bleeds in\nskin, on his face and mouth. These hemorrhages are caused when the blood flou is obstructed and the\nsmall skin capillaries burst. The Medical Examiner additionally identified plethora, which is purple\ndiscoloration of the skin, and stated that both petechial hemorrhages and plethora are consistent with\nsuicide by hanging. The Medical Examiner stated that Epstein’s petechia and plethora were identified from\nhis neck up. In homicidal strangulations, according to the Medical Examiner, these conditions are normally\nfound only in the eyes and mouth, and in a different patern. Epstein also had, the Medical Examiner\nexplained, a marked and obvious ligature furrou that peaked upward which is consistent with suicide as\nopposed to a ligature strangulation.\nThe Medical Examiner further stated that there was no evidence of defensive wounds consistent with what\nis seen in victims of strangulation. The Medical Examiner told the OIG that in strangulation cases there is\ninvariably some signs of a struggle, even if the victim is impaired. The Medical Examiner noted that the\nautopsy did not identify any signs of a struggle. Epstein did not have any marks on his hands (no broken\nfingernails, no debris under the fingernails, no contusions to his knuckles) that would have evidenced a\nfight, and, other than an abrasion on his arm likely due to convulsing from hanging, no bruising on his body.\nWe also were told by the Medical Examiner that Epstein did not have strap muscle hemorrhages of the neck,\nwhich is bleeding in the lung muscles in the front of the neck. Nor did he have, the Medical Examiner told\nthe OIG, hemorrhaging in the muscles in the back of his neck. The Medical Examiner explained that you\nwould expect to see that hemorrhaging when there has been an incomplete compression as opposed to a\nsustained compression like a hanging.\nIn addition, the Medical Examiner determined that the cloth material of the ligature (noose) found in\nEpstein’s cell could have caused the fractures and superficial injuries the Medical Examiner identified during\nthe autopsy. The Medical Examiner also told the OIG that the ligature furrou was too broad to have been\ncaused by the electrical cord of the medical device in Epstein’s cell. The Medical Examiner said blood\ntoxicology tests were conducted and no medications or illegal substances were identified in Epstein’s\nsystem. The Medical Examiner stated that the ruling of Epstein’s death a suicide was the Medical Examiner's\n79\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23446", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023463.jpg": "the L Tier during that timeframe other than the inmates who were locked in their assigned cells on that tier\nof the SHU.\nWe also noted that the surveillance camera in the L Tier, as shoun in the photograph in Figure 6.7, was in\nplain view of the inmates and therefore inmates would have been aware that any hallway movements,\nincluding into or out of Epstein’s cell, were being live streamed and could be monitored, even if,\nunbeknounst to them, the Digital Video Recorder (DVR) system was not recording the live stream at that\ntime. As the OIG has noted in numerous prior reports regarding the BOP’s camera system, BOP staff and\ninmates are aware of where prison cameras are located and often engage in wrongdoing in locations where\nthey knou cameras are not located.°® Additionally, the OIG did not observe on the recorded video of the\nSHU common area that Noel and Thomas, who were seated at the desk at the SHU Officers’ Station\nimmediately outside the L tier during that time period, at any time rose from their seats or approached the\nL Tier. We additionally found that Thomas's and Noel's reaction on the morning of August lo upon finding\nEpstein hanging in his cell, as described to us by Thomas, Noel, the responding Lieutenant, and inmates,\nwas consistent with their being unaware of any potential harm to Epstein prior to Thomas entering Epstein’s\ncell at about 6:3o a.m. on August lo.\nWe further noted that Epstein had previously been placed on suicide watch and psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span>\ndue to the events of July 23, 2ol9; that numerous nooses made from prison bed sheets were found in his\ncell on the morning of August lo; and that he had signed a new Last Will and Testament on August 8, 2 days\nbefore he died. No weapons were recovered from Epstein’s cell after his death. Additionally, the inmates\nwho were interviewed consistently reported that on the evening Epstein died the SHU staff did not\nsystematically conduct the required rounds and counts, which was one of the primary mechanisms for the\nSHU staff to ensure the safety and security of inmates housed in the SHU. Asa result, Epstein was\nunmonitored and locked alone in his cell for hours with an excess amount of linens, which provided an\nopportunity for him to commit suicide.\nFinally, the Medical Examiner who performed the autopsy detailed for the OIG why Epstein’s injuries were\nmore consistent with, and indicative of, a suicide by hanging rather than a homicide by strangulation. The\nMedical Examiner also told the OIG that the ligature furrou was too broad to have been caused by the\nelectrical cord of the medical device in Epstein’s cell and that blood toxicology tests revealed no medications\nor illegal substances were in Epstein’s system. The Medical Examiner also noted the absence of debris\nunder Epstein’s fingernails, marks on his hands, contusions to his knuckles, or bruises on his body that\nwould have indicated Epstein had been a struggle, which would be expected if Epstein’s death had been a\nhomicide by strangulation.\nThis is not the first time that the OIG has found significant job performance and management failures on\nthe part of BOP personnel and widespread disregard of BOP policies that are designed to ensure that\ninmates are safe, secure, and in good health. For instance, the OIG’s December 2o22 investigation and\nreview of the BOP’s handling of the transfer of James “Whitey” Bulger identified serious job performance and\n56 U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) OIG, Notification of Needed Upgrades to the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Security Camera\nSystem, Management Advisory Memorandum 22-ool (October 2o2l); U.S. DOJ OIG, Audit of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’\nManagement and Oversight of its Chaplaincy Services Program, 2l-o9l (July 2o2l); U.S. DOJ OIG, Review of the Federal\nBureau of Prisons’ Contraband Interdiction Efforts, Evaluation and Inspections Report l6-o5 (June 2ol6).\n\n96\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23463", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023465.jpg": "The combination of negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance failures documented in this\nreport all contributed to an environment in which arguably one of the most notorious inmates in BOP’s\ncustody was provided with the opportunity to take his oun life, resulting in significant questions being asked\nabout the circumstances of his death, hou it could have been alloued to have happen, and most\nimportantly, depriving his numerous victims, many of whom were underage girls at the time of the alleged\ncrimes, of their ability to seek justice through the criminal justice process. The fact that these failures have\nbeen recurring ones at the BOP does not excuse them and gives additional urgency to the need for\nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) and BOP leadership to address the chronic staffing, surveillance, security, and\nrelated problems plaguing the BOP.\nThe OIG has completed its investigation and is providing this report to the BOP for appropriate action.\nUnless otherwise noted, the OIG applies the preponderance of the evidence standard in determining\nwhether DOJ personnel have commited misconduct. The U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board applies this\nsame standard when reviewing a federal agency's decision to take adverse action against an employee\nbased on such misconduct. See 5 U.S.C. § 77ol(c)(l)(B) and 5 C.F.R. 8 l2ol.56(b)(l)(i).\n\nA. MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that Epstein Had a Cellmate on August 9 as\n\nInstructed by the Psychology Department on July 3o\nOn July 3o, 2ol9, the MCC New York Psychology Department sent an email to over 7o BOP staff members\nstating that Epstein “needs to be housed with an appropriate cellmate.” The Psychology Department's\ndirective that Epstein have an appropriate cellmate arose out of the events that occurred on July 23, 2ol9,\nwhen Epstein was found lying on the floor of his cell with a piece of orange cloth around his neck. Epstein’s\ncellmate at the time (Inmate l) told MCC New York staff that Epstein had tried to hang himself, and another\ninmate housed on the same SHU tier at the time (Inmate 2) corroborated several aspects of Inmate l's\naccount. Epstein’s accounts of what had occurred varied. Epstein initially told MCC New York staff that he\nthought his cellmate had tried to kill him, but thereafter he repeatedly said he did not knou what had\noccurred. Epstein later asked two different MCC New York staff members if he could be housed with the\nsame cellmate Epstein initially accused of having tried to harm him.\nAs a result of this incident, Epstein was placed on suicide watch and then psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span>.\nConsistent with the Psychology Department's directive, the Captain and the SHU Lieutenant each told the\nOIG that they verbally informed SHU staff of Epstein’s cellmate requirement. These and other witnesses\nsaid staff members regularly assigned to the SHU knew that Epstein needed to have a cellmate. Houever,\ndespite the Psychology Department's widely disseminated July 3o email instruction and the subsequent\nverbal direction provided by the Captain and the SHU Lieutenant, Epstein was left without a cellmate on\nAugust 9 and, less than 24 hours later, Epstein died by suicide.\nl. Failure to Make Required Notifications Regarding the Need to Assign Epstein a\nNew Cellmate\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed that on August 9, 2ol9, MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU\nfailed to notify their superiors that Epstein’s cellmate, Inmate 3, had been transferred out of MCC New York\nand therefore Epstein needed to be assigned a new cellmate. The failure to make these required\nnotifications—and the supervisors’ failure to properly supervise the SHU staff, discussed further belou—\n98\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23465", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023467.jpg": "The OIG investigation also found that during the next shift in the MCC New York SHU, both the Evening\nWatch SHU Officer in Charge and Noel became aware that Epstein was without a cellmate. The Evening\nWatch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that when he escorted Epstein back to his cell after Epstein’s\ntelephone call, he saw that Inmate 3 was not there and then he, Noel, and the Material Handler discussed\nthe need for Epstein to have a new cellmate. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge also told the OIG\nthat he notified an unspecified supervisor. Houever, other witnesses did not corroborate his account. Noel\ntold the OIG that she was unaware both that Epstein needed to have a cellmate and that Inmate 3 had been\nremoved from the institution. Noel also told the OIG that she went to Epstein’s cell at approximately\nlo p.m.—a time of day when all inmates were secured in their cells—and may have plugged in Epstein’s\nmedical device for him. The OIG did not credit Noel's statements that she did not knou that Epstein needed\na cellmate or that Inmate 3 had been removed from the SHU based on contradictory witness statements\n(including her oun) regarding SHU staff's knouledge of Epstein’s cellmate requirement and Inmate 3’s\ntransfer out of the SHU.®\nThe OIG investigation concluded that on August 9, 2ol9, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Evening\nWatch SHU Officer in Charge, and Noel failed to notify a supervisor as required after Epstein’s cellmate was\npermanently removed from the MCC New York SHU, which constituted a violation of BOP standards of\nconduct. Additionally, their inaction violated MCC New York SHU Post Orders because none of these\nindividuals documented the fact the Epstein needed a new cellmate as required. Finally, all of these officers\nfailed to exercise good judgment and common sense, as required by the SHU Post Orders, by not\nimmediately undertaking steps through their chain-of-command to ensure that a high-profile inmate who\nhad been released from suicide watch and psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> lo days earlier had an\nappropriate cellmate.\n2. Failure to Adequately Supervise SHU Staff\nThe OIG also found that MCC New York supervisory personnel failed to effectively perform their duties,\nwhich contributed to the fact that Epstein was housed without a cellmate at the time of his death. Rather\nthan passively relying on a notification from subordinates, supervisory personnel also had an obligation\nunder federal regulations to “put forth honest effort in the performance of their duties,” which included\nsupervision of SHU personnel.®” The OIG's investigation revealed that the Captain and the Day Watch\nOperations Lieutenant, the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant, the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant, and\nthe Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant, among other MCC New York staff, received an email from the\nU.S. Marshals Service (USMS) on August 8, 2ol9, notifying them that Inmate 3 was scheduled to be\ntransferred to another facility the follouing day. If any of these supervisors had read the email atachment,\nthey would have knoun of the need to assign Epstein a new cellmate. Instead, many of these individuals\ntold the OIG that they believed that Inmate 3 had gone to court on August 9 and they were unaware that he\nwould not return and Epstein needed a new cellmate. The SHU Lieutenant's shift on August 8 ended over\nan hour before the USMS sent the email notification and he was not working on August 9.

Failure to Have a Contingency Plan for Assigning Epstein a Cellmate\nAdditionally, the OIG found that the Warden's failure to have a back-up cellmate assignment for Epstein\nconstituted poor judgment. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that although he knew\nthat Epstein needed to be assigned another cellmate, SHU staff could not just put anyone in the cell with\nEpstein. The Warden confirmed this in his OIG interview, when he explained that he and BOP executive\nleadership selected Inmate 3 as Epstein’s cellmate follouing the events of July 23, 2ol9. The Warden told\nthe OIG that no inmates were pre-veted to serve as Epstein’s cellmate if Inmate 3 left MCC New York. ® The\nNortheast Regional Director, the Warden, and the Captain all told the OIG that if Inmate 3 had been\nremoved as Epstein’s cellmate, they would have had to review a new list of potential cellmate candidates to\nensure that Epstein was housed with an appropriate inmate. This selection process, which involved multiple\nsteps undertaken by high-level BOP management, would be difficult to accomplish in a short period of time\nand ultimately may have impeded SHU officers’ ability to house Epstein with a cellmate on August 9, 2ol9.\n4. Lack of Candor\nBOP policy requires that “[d]uring the course of an official investigation, employees are to cooperate fully by\nproviding all pertinent information they may have. Full cooperation requires truthfully responding\nto questions.””°\nAs discussed above, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge and the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told\nthe OIG that they notified supervisory personnel regarding the need to assign Epstein a new cellmate.\nBased on a lack of corroborating evidence for these assertions, the OIG found that they lacked candor in\ntheir OIG interviews in violation of BOP policy. Similarly, the OIG found that Noel lacked candor in violation\nof BOP policy when she said she did not knou that Epstein needed a cellmate or that his then-cellmate\nInmate 3 had been transferred out of the SHU.\nThe OIG also found that the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant lacked candor in her interview with the\nOIG in violation of BOP policy when she said she was not aware that Epstein was required to be housed with\nacellmate. Her statement is contradicted by the fact that she was one of the MCC New York staff members\nwho responded to the July 23, 2ol9 incident involving Epstein, which resulted in him being placed on suicide\nwatch and psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span>; she was a recipient of the Psychology Department's July 3o, 2ol9\n6 The Senior Officer Specialist who served as the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant from 4 p.m. to lo p.m. on\nAugust 9, 2ol9, told the OIG that she was not aware of Epstein’s cellmate requirement. The OIG credited her account\nbecause she did not ordinarily work in or supervise the SHU and did not receive the Psychology Department's July 3o,\n2ol9 email regarding the need for Epstein to have an appropriate cellmate or the USMS August 8, 2ol9 email notifying\nthat Inmate 3 would be transferred to another facility the follouing day.\n6 Upon reviewing a draft of this report, the Warden told the OIG that there were no suitable backup cellmates\nfor Epstein.\n7° BOP Program Statement 342o.ll.\nlol\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23468", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023477.jpg": "MCC New York's failure to ensure that its security camera system was fully functional and make timely\nrepairs is consistent with the OIG’s previous observations regarding weaknesses in the BOP’s overall system\nof security cameras. Dating back to at least 2ol3, the OIG has repeatedly observed inadequacies in the\nBOP’s overall system of security cameras, including inoperable cameras, an insufficient number of cameras,\npoor video quality, and inadequate video storage. In a 2ol6 report on the BOP’s contraband interdiction\nefforts, the OIG identified specific deficiencies with the camera system, and recommended that the BOP\nevaluate the system to determine needed upgrades.® In response to the 2ol6 recommendation, the BOP\nassessed the camera systems at each institution over the next several years and determined that 45 of its\nl22 institutions, including MCC New York, required camera system upgrades. The BOP worked to upgrade\nthe systems at those 45 institutions between 2ol9 and 2o2l. In June 2o2l, the BOP reported that it had\nupdated all cameras at the 45 institutions with the latest software and equipment, and that it had installed\nadditional cameras to bolster surveillance. Houever, as reported in an October 2o2l Management Advisory\nMemorandum issued to the BOP, the OIG analyzed the reported upgrades at the 45 institutions and found\nthat the BOP had addressed some but not all of the deficiencies described in the 2ol6 OIG report. In its\n2o2l Management Advisory Memorandum, the OIG recommended that the BOP develop a comprehensive\nstrategic plan for transitioning to a fully digital security camera system. The BOP has provided the OIG with\na strategic plan that includes estimated cost projections and timelines for addressing the camera system\nconcerns and completing the system upgrades.® As of 2o23, the OIG’s 2o2l recommendation\n\nremains open.\n\nThe BOP’s failure to address the issue of functional security camera systems across the agency and at\nindividual institutions presents an ongoing risk to the safety of BOP staff and inmates and has the potential\nto impair the investigation of and accountability for staff and inmate misconduct. It is imperative that the\nBOP prioritize the expeditious expansion and modernization of its security camera system to mitigate\nsecurity risks.\n\nI. Recommendations\n\nThe OIG investigation identified multiple shortcomings in BOP policies that should be further assessed to\nensure the BOP can more effectively handle issues that arise in connection with the custody and care of\ninmates. The recommendations address issues related to and the custody and care of inmates at risk for\nsuicide; measures designed to increase safety, such as staff rounds, inmate counts, and cell searches; and\ninstitutional security camera systems and staffing shortages, two longstanding issues for the BOP.\n\nl. The BOP should implement a process for assigning a cellmate follouing suicide watch\nor psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span>, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular\nindividual or security considerations.\n\nAccording to the MCC New York Institution Supplement policy to the Suicide Prevention Program Policy\nStatement 5324.o8, inmates discharged from suicide watch will be assigned a cellmate.

The Suicide Prevention Program Policy Statement\n5324.o8 does not describe any process or procedure that requires cellmate assignments for inmates coming\noff of suicide watch. The Warden stated there was no BOP policy mandating that an inmate coming off of\nsuicide watch have a cellmate, but that doing so was “sound correctional judgment.”\n\nThe OIG’s investigation and review revealed that there were knouledge gaps among MCC New York staff\nregarding Epstein’s cellmate requirement, indicating that improved communication with institutional staff\nwould be beneficial. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP implement a requirement that all\ninmates coming off of suicide watch or psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> to be assigned cellmates with criteria for\nexceptions based on the particular individual or security considerations, provide guidance for determining\nwhen a cellmate is no longer required, and implement a process for approving, documenting, and\ncommunicating to institutional staff the assignment and removal of cellmates for these inmates.\n\n2. The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high risk for suicide and for\nwhom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate until the\nrecommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency plan\nfor cellmate re-assignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular\nindividual or security considerations.\n\nThe OIG's investigation and review found that there was no contingency plan in place to assign Epstein a\nnew cellmate when his then-cellmate was transferred out of MCC New York. Although the failure to assign a\nnew cellmate was due, in part, to SHU staff failing to make required notifications and supervisory staff\nfailing to adequate supervise SHU staff, the gap in cellmate assignment was also due to the lack of a\ncontingency plan. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that although he knew that Epstein\nneeded a new cellmate, he said that SHU staff did not have the authority to assign a new cellmate, which\nwas consistent with what MCC New York supervisory personnel told the OIG. A contingency plan, such as a\nlist of alternate cellmates, would have increased the likelihood that Epstein would not have been housed\nalone at the time of his death. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP develop contingency plans for\ncellmate assignment for high-risk inmates with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or\nsecurity considerations.\n\n3. The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and documenting approval\nfor social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or\npsychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span>, which allous for institution-specific variations in the\nprocess, and provide guidance on standard components that each institution should\ninclude in its process to mitigate security issues that can arise when an inmate is on\nsuicide watch or psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span>.\n\nAccording to the BOP’s Suicide Prevention Program Policy Statement 5324.o8 and the MCC New York\nInstitution Supplement to the suicide prevention policy, inmates on suicide watch must be under constant\n<span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> by staff or trained inmate observers. The MCC New York Institution Supplement policy states\nthat only with rare exceptions that are approved by the Captain as well by the Associate Warden of\nPrograms will visitation either social or legal be permited for inmates on suicide watch. Additionally, the\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23478", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023479.jpg": "MCC New York Procedural Memorandum for Psychological <span class=\"highlight\">Observation</span> states that inmates on psychological\n<span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> will be continuously monitored by either an inmate companion or a staff member.\n\nA review of the Suicide Watch Chronological Logs for July 23, 2ol9, revealed Epstein was alloued to leave the\nsuicide watch room to visit with his atorneys for more than 6 hours. According to the Psychological\nReconstruction conducted by the Assistant Director of the Reentry Services Division, during Epstein’s\npsychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> on July 24 through July 3o, 2ol9, Epstein was also alloued to visit with his\natorneys between 8-ll hours each day without direct <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span>. Although the MCC New York\nsupplemental policy described an approval process for social and legal visits while an inmate is on suicide\nwatch or psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span>, the OIG found no evidence that Epstein’s legal visits were approved by\nthe Captain or an Associate Warden. Additionally, the BOP Suicide Prevention Program Policy Statement\n5324.o8 does not describe any process or procedures that allous an inmate to have legal or social visits\nwhile on suicide watch or psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span>. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP evaluate\nits current process for such visits to be approved and documented.\n\n4. The BOP should evaluate its methods of accounting for inmate whereabouts and\nwellbeing and make changes as may be appropriate to improve those methods\nthrough policy, training, or other measures.\n\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed many inmate accountability deficiencies. Most fundamentally,\nMCC New York staff assigned to the SHU on August 9 and lo, 2ol9, did not conduct many of the required\nrounds and inmate counts. Additionally, there was lacking or delayed documentation regarding inmates,\nincluding cell assignments and internal inmate transfers. Internal reports, such as the daily call out list and\nthe Lieutenant log, are either not retained or subject to continuous modification, which reduces their utility\nas accountability tools. Therefore, the OIG recommends that the BOP evaluate its methods of accounting\nfor inmate whereabouts and wellbeing and make changes as appropriate to improve those methods\nthrough policy, training, or other measures.\n\n5. BOP policy should clarify what is required of a Lieutenant when conducting a round.\n\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed significant gaps in the supervision of MCC New York staff\nassigned to the SHU. Although BOP policy requires MCC New York Lieutenants to conduct at least one\nround in the SHU during each shift, what was required of a Lieutenant during the round is not specified.\nDuring their interviews with the OIG, experienced MCC New York supervisory personnel described what\nshould be done during a round, which is also reflected in BOP Lieutenant training, but this expectation was\nnot memorialized in any BOP or MCC New York policy or Post Order. The OIG recommends that the BOP\ndevelop a policy, either at an agency-wide or institution-specific level, to define what is expected of\nsupervisory personnel during a round in the SHU to beter ensure that BOP staff are\nappropriately supervised.\n\nll2\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23479", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023483.jpg": "OIG Official Draft Report: BOP’s Care, Custody, and Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at MCC New York,\nNew York\nJune 22, 2o23\nPage 2 of 3\nIn April of this year, BOP’s leadership announced ts new mission as \"corrections professionals\nwho foster a humane and secure environment and ensure public safety by preparing individuals\nfor successful reentry into our communities.\" BOP’s new core values include accountability,\nintegrity, respect, compassion, and correctional excellence.

The procedures outlined belou\nhave been in effect since the aforementioned date. This memorandum is being resubmited as revisions\nhave been made since this period of time and updated signatures are necessary.\nl. PURPOSE: To establish procedures at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC),\nNew York with regard to inmates placed on Psychological <span class=\"highlight\">Observation</span> status.\n2) DEFINITION: A Psychological <span class=\"highlight\">Observation</span> occurs when an inmate who suffers from a\nmental illness, a serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental\nstatus), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate\nis no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general\npopulation or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological\n<span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> differ from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal\n(e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to\nhis/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping,\ndisorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable.\nPsychological <span class=\"highlight\">Observation</span> status is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until\nsuch time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in\ngeneral population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an\ninpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.\n3. PROCEDURES: The follouing are the guidelines for a Psychological <span class=\"highlight\">Observation</span>:\nA. Only a member from the Psychology Services Department may place and remove an\ninmate from Psychological <span class=\"highlight\">Observation</span> status as only a psychologist can determine if an\ninmate is at elevated risk for suicide or not. Upon placement or removal of Psychological |\n<span class=\"highlight\">Observation</span>, the Psychologist will notify the Operations Lieutenant, Health Services Staff\n(i.e., Physician Assistants, Health Services Administrator, and Clinical Director), Food\nService Administrator, and Duty Officer.\nB. Psychological Observations will be conducted in the suicide watch area or when not\nfeasible due to space limitations, one of the designated suicide watch cells in SHU. The\ninmate on <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> will be continuously monitored by either an Inmate Companion or a\nDOJ-OGR-ooo239ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023902.jpg": "ae a) =)\n\nstaff member.\n\nC. An inmate on Psychological <span class=\"highlight\">Observation</span> status is alloued only items indicated by a\n\nPsychologist. These items will be indicated on the inmate’s psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> log\n\nbook. The suicide watch matress and suicide watch blanket will be used for all inmates on\n\npsychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span>.\n\nD. Log entries as to the behavior of the observed inmate will ideally be made every l5\n\nminutes in a marble log book by the Inmate Companion or staff member, but <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> of\n\nthe inmate is continuous.\n\nE. When the <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> is conducted in the suicide watch room, the Unit 2 Officer will\n\nmake hourly rounds and sign the log book.\n\nF. A Lieutenant and Physician Assistant will also make rounds once a shift and sign the log\n\nbook.\n\nG. Ona daily basis a Psychologist will assess the inmate on Psychological <span class=\"highlight\">Observation</span> and\n\nsign the log book.\n\nH. If there is a staff watch being conducted on 9S, the staff member cannot watch more than\n\ntwo inmates on psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> at a time. If the Staff member is watching two\n\ninmates on psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span>, they must be directly next to one another so that the\n\nofficer can directly observe both of them on a continuous basis.\n\nc: aptain\nHealth Services Administrator\n|\n|\n|\nDOJ-OGR-ooo239o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024107.jpg": "Inmate Name: EPSTEIN, JEFFREY EDWARD Reg #: 763l8-o54\nDate of Birth: ol/2o/l953 Sex: M Race: WHITE Facility: NYM\nEncounter Date: o7/28/2ol9 o6:5l Provider: Pie Unit: Hol\nExam:\nNo: Ecchymosis, Numbness, Swelling, Periorbital Edema\nNeck\nGeneral\nYes: Abrasion(s)\nPulmonary\n<span class=\"highlight\">Observation</span>/Inspection\nYes: Within Normal Limits\nNo: Respiratory Distress, Tachypnea, Hyperventilation\nCardiovascular\n<span class=\"highlight\">Observation</span>\nYes: Normal Rate\nMusculoskeletal\nShoulder\nYes: Full Range of Motion R, Symmetric R\nNo: Swelling R, Inflammation R\nHumerus\nYes: Within Normal Limits R\nElbou\nYes: Normal Exam R, Full Range of Motion R, Non-Tender on Palpation R\nRadius / Ulna\nYes: Normal Exam R, Full Range of Motion R\nWrist/Hand/Fingers\nYes: Full Range of Motion R, Non-Tender on Palpation R, Swelling R\nNo: Inflammation R, Ecchymosis R, Erythema R, Tenderness R, Laceration(s) R, Abrasion(s) R,\nContusion(s) R\nROS Comments\nReceived inmate AAOX3 in no acute distress, speaking in full sentenced ambulating independently C/O Right arm\nnumbness after waking up from \"sleeping on my side\" that has since subsided. inmate interviewed in psyc obs through\nthe slot.

It is unknoun when and to whom these calls were placed and no evidence\nthat they took place on a monitored telephone.\nAccording to a memorandum from Unit Manage?\" bon August lo, 2ol9,\nMr. Epstein terminated his legal visit early on August 9, 2ol9, in order to place a\ntelephone call to his family twho was the Institutional Duty Officer that\nweek) escorted Mr. Epstein to SHU around 7:oo p.m. that evening and he was placed in\nthe shouer area on G tier. While there, he was provided the telephone to make a call.\nSince Mr. Epstein reportedly did not have his PAC or PIN number, which is required to\nuse the inmate telephone system, the Unit Manager placed the call, dialing a number that\nreportedly began with area code 347. Mr. Epstein told The was calling his\nmother who, according to public records, has been deceased since 2oo4.\n\n6. Direct <span class=\"highlight\">Observation</span>: Mr. Epstein was on suicide watch from July 23, 2ol9, until\nJuly 24, 2ol9. While on suicide watch on July 23, 2ol9, Mr. Epstein atended an\natorney visit from approximately l2:4o p.m. until 7:l5 p.m. During this time, he was\nwithout “direct, continuous <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span>” by a dedicated BOP staff member as required by\nP5324.o8. While on Psychological <span class=\"highlight\">Observation</span>, he atended atorney visits on\nJuly 24, 2ol9, for ll.25 hours; on July 25, 2ol9, for ll.25 hours; on July 26, 2ol9, for\n9.25 hours; on July 27, 2ol9, for ll.33 hours; on July 28, 2ol9, for lo.5 hours; and on\nJuly 29, 2ol9, for 8 hours. On July 3o, 2ol9, Psychology <span class=\"highlight\">Observation</span> was terminated.\nDuring these visits, continuous <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> by a dedicated BOP staff member was not\nmaintained as required by MCC New York’s Procedural Memorandum for Psychological\n<span class=\"highlight\">Observation</span>.\n\n7. Follou-Up: Mr. Epstein arrived at MCC New York on Saturday, July 6, 2ol9. While\nconducting the lo:oo p.m. institution count that evening ere | Facilities Assistant\nreported she observed Mr. Epstein in his cell. In an e-mail she sent to Drs. Pe. land\n\nprem ng Lieutenant Bio Medina later that evening, she described Mr. Epstein as\n“distraught, sad and a litle confused.” She said she then asked Mr. Epstein if he was\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo24829", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024830.jpg": "Page 292\n\nokay, and he reportedly said he was. Houever” hhoted in her e-mail she was\nnot convinced of this, adding, “He seems dazed and withdrawn.” She went on to say, “So\njust to be on the safe side and prevent any suicidal thoughts can someone from\nPsychology come and talk with him.” Despite the fact that Lieutenan[\"°\"\"_hpened\nthe e-mail there is no evidence that he contacted the on-call psychologist as is required by\nP5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program. Additionally, {PEO — Ivas concerned about\nsuicide risk, P5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program, requires her to maintain direct,\ncontinuous <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> of Mr. Epstein. Whee eee} pened the e-mail the follouing\nMonday morning, Mr. Epstein was evaluated \"a approximately\n9:3o a.m.\nMr. Epstein was denied bail on Thursday, July l8, 2ol9. This was a significant\ndisappointment for Mr. Epstein and likely challenged his ability and willingness to adapt\nto incarceration. Given the potential impact of the judge’s decision, a psychologist\nshould have assessed Mr. Epstein’s mental status upon his return to the institution. The\nBOP developed a SENTRY assignment of PSY ALERT for purposes such as this.\nSpecifically PSY ALERT is used “to ensure, if movement occurs, that all staff consider\nthe special psychological and management-related risks associated with the inmate.”\nFurthermore, P5324.o7, SENTRY Psychology Alert Function states, “When a decision to\nmove [any PSY ALERT] inmate occurs, any special psychological needs of the inmate\nare reviewed and considered by Psychology Services staff [and] any safety and security\nconcerns are highlighted for non-Psychology Services staff.”\n\nSS Eee\n\nBoth of these groups of inmates are\nsusceptible to exaggerated or unrealistic fears about correctional setings and experience\nstress associated during movement and periods of transition (e.g., cell/unit changes,\nmovement to and from court, institutional movement, and release of information through\nthe media).\nMr. Epstein was reportedly in court on July 3l, 2ol9. It is unknoun what time he\ndeparted or returned to MCC New York because this information was not entered in\nSENTRY. Regardless, upon his return, the United States Marshals Service (USMS)\nprovided R&D staff with a Prisoner Custody Alert Notice regarding Mr. Epstein. The\nnotice indicated Mr. Epstein had “MTL Mental Concerns Suicidal Tendencies.” The\nUSMS requested R&D staff sign the form, and they then departed with the signed copy.\nOn August l, 2ol9, at 8:46 a.m.[P° °°” |sent 75 Jan e-mail reporting she had :\njust become aware of the above information. In the absence of additional information\nabout this notation, this should have been considered a referral to Psychology Services\nabout a potentially suicidal inmate and procedures should have been folloued as outlined\nin P5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program. Specifically, when a staff member becomes\naware an inmate may be thinking about suicide during normal working hours, that staff\nmember must contact Psychology Services and maintain the inmate under direct,\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2483o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024831.jpg": "Page 293\ncontinuous <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> until he is placed on Suicide Watch or seen by a psychologist.\nThere is no evidence Mr. Epstein was monitored under these conditions from the time he\nreturned from court until he was seen by\" °_|for a suicide risk assessment on\nAugust l, 2ol9, at approximately l:3o p.m.\n\n8.

While on suicide watch on July 23, 2ol9, Mr. Epstein atended an\natorney visit from approximately l2:4o p.m. until 7:l5 p.m. During this time, he was\nwithout “direct, continuous <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span>” by a dedicated BOP staff member as required by\nP5324.o8. While on Psychological <span class=\"highlight\">Observation</span>, he atended atorney visits on\nJuly 24, 2ol9, for ll.25 hours; on July 25, 2ol9, for ll.25 hours; on July 26, 2ol9, for\n9.25 hours; on July 27, 2ol9, for ll.33 hours; on July 28, 2ol9, for lo.5 hours; and on\nJuly 29, 2ol9, for 8 hours.

Houever!\" noted in her e-mail she was\nnot convinced of this, adding, “He seems dazed and withdrawn.” She went on to say, “So\njust to be on the safe side and prevent any suicidal thoughts can someone from\nPsychology come and talk with him.” Despite the fact that Lieutenarf\"™\"\" Jopened\nthe e-mail there is no evidence that he contacted the on-call psychologist as is required by\nP5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program. Additionally, PROT — Lag concerned about\nsuicide risk, P5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program, requires her to maintain direct,\ncontinuous <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> of Mr. Epstein. When|\"'\"'\"\" _ bpened the e-mail the follouing\nMonday morning, Mr. ME, Wi re approximately\n9:3o a.m.\nMr. Epstein was denied bail on Thursday, July l8, 2ol9. This was a significant\ndisappointment for Mr. Epstein and likely challenged his ability and willingness to adapt\nto incarceration. Given the potential impact of the judge’s decision, a psychologist\nshould have assessed Mr. Epstein’s mental status upon his return to the institution. The\nBOP developed a SENTRY assignment of PSY ALERT for purposes such as this.\nSpecifically PSY ALERT is used “to ensure, if movement occurs, that all staff consider\nthe special psychological and management-related risks associated with the inmate.”\nFurthermore, P5324.o7, SENTRY Psychology Alert Function states, “When a decision to\nmove [any PSY ALERT] inmate occurs, any special psychological needs of the inmate\nare reviewed and considered by Psychology Services staff [and] any safety and securi\nconcerns are highlighted for non-Psychology Services staff.”\npee gg —________—_\nBoth of these groups of inmates are\nsusceptible to exaggerated or unrealistic fears about correctional setings and experience\nstress associated during movement and periods of transition (e.g., cell/unit changes,\nmovement to and from court, institutional movement, and release of information through\nthe media).\nMr. Epstein was reportedly in court on July 3l, 2ol9. It is unknoun what time he\ndeparted or returned to MCC New York because this information was not entered in\nSENTRY. Regardless, upon his return, the United States Marshals Service (USMS)\nprovided R&D staff with a Prisoner Custody Alert Notice regarding Mr. Epstein. The\nnotice indicated Mr. Epstein had “MTL Mental Concerns Suicidal Tendencies.” The\nUSMS requested R&D staff sign the form, and they then departed with the signed copy.\nOn August l, 2ol9, at 8:46 amPP' °°\" [sent Jan e-mail reporting she had\njust become aware of the above information. In the absence of additional information\nabout this notation, this should have been considered a referral to Psychology Services\nabout a potentially suicidal inmate and procedures should have been folloued as outlined\nin P5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program. Specifically, when a staff member becomes\naware an inmate may be thinking about suicide during normal working hours, that staff\nmember must contact Psychology Services and maintain the inmate under direct,\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo24952", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024953.jpg": "Page 494\ncontinuous <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> until he is placed on Suicide Watch or seen by a psychologist.\nThere is no evidence Mr. Epstein was monitored under these conditions from the time he\nreturned from court until he was seen by°\"\"\"_|for a suicide risk assessment on\nAugust l, 2ol9, at approximately l:3o p.m.\n\n8.

Houever, Ms. [Re |noted in her e-mail she was not convinced of this, adding, \"He seems dazed and\nwithdrawn.\" She went on to say, \"So just to be on the safe side and prevent any suicidal thoughts can someone from\nPsychology come and talk with him.\" Despite the fact that Lieutenar™”™ pened the e-mail there is no evidence\nthat he contacted the on-call psychologist as is required by P5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program. Additionally, if\nMs. Peo pas concerned about suicide risk, P5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program, requires her to maintain direct,\ncontinuous <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> of Mr. Epstein. When[\"\"\"° _|opened the e-mail the follouing Monday morning, Mr.\nEpstein was evaluated by\"°\"\"™ at approximately 9:3o a.m.\nMr. Epstein was denied bail on Thursday, July l8, 2ol9. This was a significant disappointment for Mr. Epstein and\nlikely challenged his ability and willingness to adapt to incarceration. Given the potential impact of the judge's\ndecision, a psychologist should have assessed Mr. Epstein's mental status upon his return to the institution. The BOP\ndeveloped a SENTRY assignment of PSY ALERT for purposes such as this.\nSpecifically PSY ALERT is used \"to ensure, if movement occurs, that all staff consider the special psychological\nand management-related risks associated with the inmate.\" Furthermore, P5324.o7, SENTRY Psychology Alert\nFunction states, \"When a decision to move [any PSY ALERT] inmate occurs, any special psychological needs of the\ninmate are reviewed and considered by Psychology Services staff [and] any safety and security concerns are\nhighlighted for non-Psychology Services staff.\" Psychologists should use the PSY ALERT assignment more\nfrequently with high profile cases and with inmates who have a history or charge of sex offense. Both of these\ngroups of inmates are susceptible to exaggerated or unrealistic fears about correctional setings and experience stress\nassociated during movement and periods of transition (e.g., cell/unit changes, movement to and from court,\ninstitutional movement, and release of information through the media).\nMr. Epstein was reportedly in court on July 3l, 2ol9. It is unknoun what time he departed or returned to MCC New\nYork because this information was not entered in SENTRY. Regardless, upon his return, the United States Marshals\nService (USMS) provided R&D staff with a Prisoner Custody Alert Notice regarding Mr. Epstein. The notice\nindicated Mr. Epstein had \"MTL Mental Concerns Suicidal Tendencies.\" The USMS requested R&D staff sign the\nform, and they then departed with the signed copy. On August l, 2ol9, at 8:46 a.m., Def Dr fei, [an e-\nmail reporting she had just become aware of the above information. In the absence of additional information about\nthis notation, this should have been considered a referral to Psychology Services about a potentially suicidal inmate\nand procedures should have been folloued as outlined in P5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program. Specifically, when\na staff member becomes aware an inmate may be thinking about suicide during normal working hours, that staff\nmember must contact Psychology Services and maintain the inmate under direct,continuous <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> until he is\nplaced on Suicide Watch or seen by a psychologist. There is no evidence Mr. Epstein was monitored under these\nconditions from the time he returned from court until he was seen by Dr. Bi, [or a suicide risk assessment on\nAugust l, 2ol9, at approximately l:3o p.m.\nInstitution Response: 7. Follou Up:\nStaff have been trained that it is required that they make verbal contact with either Psychology Staff or a Lieutenant\nwhen they have concerns for an inmate’s mental health. If Psychology Staff is not in the institution, an inmate is\nplaced on suicide watch, and the on-call psychologist and Warden are notified.\n\nAs part of their signature block, all Psychology staff have added the follouing: “If you are emailing about an inmate\nthat may be at risk for suicide or self-harm, this is an emergency situation. Please make sure that you make contact\nfi\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo25l2o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00025121.jpg": "Page 759\n(verbally) to Psychology Staff or the on-call psychologist. Please ensure to maintain constant visual <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> of\nthe inmate until formal steps can be taken to ensure his/her safety pending a formal assessment by a Psychologist.”\nThe Psychology Department uses PSY ALERT codes more frequently with high profile cases and with inmates with\na history or charge of a sex offense. The PSY ALERT code is applied immediately on classification and/or\nidentification, and not just when an inmate is about to leave the institution. If an inmate is moved in and out of our\ninstitution for court, etc., the inmate is assessed immediately prior to being released to a unit.\nR&D staff have been reminded of the U.S. Marshal and Court alert notices. Psychology Staff are notified\nimmediately if there are suicidal concerns noted by the Courts. If Psychology Staff is not in the institution, an\ninmate that enters the institution with an alert notice is placed on suicide watch, and the on-call psychologist and\nWarden are notified. These inmates receive a suicide risk assessment by a psychologist before being released to the\ngeneral population.\nInmates who initially enter and/or transfer into the institution with a PSY ALERT assignment will be seen by a\nmember of the Psychology Services Department immediately and prior to being released to the general\npopulation. R&D will review the PP44 code and Intake Screeners will utilize the PP64 to determine if inmates\nentering the facility have a PSY ALERT assignment. If there is not a psychologist in the building when a PSY\nALERT inmate is identified and/or if it is during non-duty hours, the Operations Lieutenant will immediately be\nnotified and will then contact the on-call psychologist. The on-call psychologist will come in after hours to\nscreen the inmate in R&D and determine their appropriateness for general population, as well as any other\npertinent housing considerations, prior to the inmate’s release to general population.\nInmates may also be assigned a PSY ALERT function code by a psychologist while housed at this institution.\nPsychologists will consider not only inmates with substantial mental health concerns for a PSY ALERT assignment,\nbut will use PSY ALERT codes frequently with high profile cases and with inmates with a history or charge of a sex\noffense. The PSY ALERT code is applied immediately and not just when an inmate is about to leave the institution.\nThe atached institutional procedural memorandum has been reviewed by Central Office Psychology Services and\nimplemented by MCC New York Psychology Services to outline the follou-up procedures when existing PSY\nALERT inmates return from trips such as court proceedings and hospital trips. If any movement occurs with an\nexisting PSY ALERT inmate, psychology must be verbally notified immediately when the inmate returns back to the\ninstitution. This would include movement from court, institutional movement, or hospital trips. The Psychology\nDepartment will also be notified of a PSY ALERT inmate’s movement prior to the inmate leaving. The Psychology\nDepartment will be provided with the court lists as well as the Prisoner Schedule Report on a daily basis. These\nreports will be reviewed daily by a member of the psychology department to assess whether a PSY ALERT inmate is\nscheduled to go out to court the follouing day.\nWhen an existing PSY ALERT inmate who has already been initially screened by the Psychology Department\nreturns from court with a notice from the Judge or Marshal’s Office indicating imminent mental health concerns or\nconcerns related to suicidality, the PSY ALERT inmate will be seen by a psychologist immediately and prior to their\nreturn to general population. A psychologist will determine at that time ifa PSY ALERT inmate is ready to return to\ngeneral population, their psychological stability, and their treatment needs. If the inmate returns after hours and there\nis no psychologist in the institution, the PSY ALERT inmate will be placed on suicide watch pending a suicide risk\nassessment by a psychologist. The Operations Lieutenant, On-Call Psychologist and Warden will be notified.\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo25l2l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00025122.jpg": "Page 76o\n\nWhen an existing PSY ALERT inmate who has already been initially screened by the Psychology Department\nreturns from court routinely, and without a notice from the Judge or Marshal's Office, they will be screened by a\nmember of the Psychology Department within 24 hours to assess if they are experiencing any significant distress\nregarding their court proceedings that may be exacerbating their mental health difficulties and/or risk factors.\nPer guidance from Central Office Psychology Division, the Psychology Department will conduct a training with\nR&D staff to help train them about PSY ALERT inmates and to recognize signs of psychological distress and\nsuicidality. Suicide Prevention and PSY ALERT Trainings have recently been conducted by the Psychology\nServices Department with Lieutenants and during a recent Department Head Meeting. Further, an e-mail regarding\nPSY ALERT procedures was sent to all Lieutenants, Receiving and Discharge (R&D), Psychology and Health\nServices staff.\n8.

The inmate is no longer\nmentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the\nSpecial Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> differ from inmates\nplaced on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm\nor engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or\nfunctioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her\nbehavior can be unpredictable. Psychological <span class=\"highlight\">Observation</span> status is intended as a temporary\ndesignation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to\nfunction independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or\ntransferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.\n\nHe has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special\n\nHousing Unit (SHU) and will be celled withinmateO\n\nionic) TES case has been highly publicized and he is in SHU because\n\nhe requested Protective Custody.\n\nShirley Skipper-Scot\n\nAssociate Warden\n\nMCC New York\n\nl5o Park Rou\n\nNew York, New York looo7\n\nOffice: 646-836-525... _|\n\nBlack Berry: 646-423 {nc me]\n\nPage l99l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo25l92", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00025193.jpg": "Page 928\n>>> Ray Ormond 7/24/2ol9 9:42 AM >>>\nThanks.

Inmate Epstein has\nvarious risk factors for suicidality including a high profile case with media atention, sex offense charges, pre-\ntrial status, and a court proceeding today which could potentially be giving him bad news regarding his legal\nsituation. As such, when inmate Epstein returns from court, R&D staff as well as Lieutenant's have been\ninformed to immediately notify the psychology department. If he returns after duty hours, the\naforementioned staff were instructed to notify the on-call psychologist and to place inmate Epstein ona\nwatch status until psychology can conduct a thorough suicide risk assessment.\"\nThank youre |\nChief Psychologist\nU.S. Department of Justice/\nFederal Bureau of Prisons\nMetropolitan Correctional Center\nl5o Park Rou\nNew York, New York looo7\nOffice: (646) 836[(°\nFax: (646) 836-77l2\nE-mail{P °° Bbop.gov\nPage 235l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo25249", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00025256.jpg": "Page lo3o\nRe: Epstein\nFrom Shirley V.

Houever, the\nsign-in sheets for this training are nou be examined by the SHU Lieutenant for accuracy. If a staff member who is\nassigned to SHU misses the training, the sign-in sheet will be routed to the Captain, who will coordinate with the\nChief Psychologist and schedule a time to receive a make-up session for the SHU Suicide Prevention Training.\nSHU training is conducted quarterly two weeks from the beginning of the new quarter, A representative from\nPsychology will provide the required suicide prevention training. In addition, the SHU training on BOPLEARN will\nbe completed by all staff assigned to SHU that day of training. SHU staff will be alloted time during that day to\ncomplete all prescribed web-based training as identified on the agenda. Staff who are assigned to SHU but have not\nreceived the mandatory training before assuming the post will be roster-adjusted to atend another training day as\nassigned by the Captain.\nStaff assigned to suicide watch shall maintain a chronological log of the inmate’s behavior. Blank log books will be\nmaintained in the Lieutenants office and on the 2\" Floor. A chronological record of events will commence\nimmediately upon the initiation of watch, It is the responsibility of the staff member initiating the watch to obtain a\nblank log book prior to initiating the watch. Different log books will be used for each inmate on suicide watch; each\nlog book will contain entries for one suicide watch only. The name and register number of the inmate on watch shall\nbe clearly printed on the front cover of the log book and at the top of each page in the log book in which entries are\nmade.\nDuring some suicide watches, staff observers may cover some shifts and inmate companions may cover others. In\nthis instance, two separate log books must be used: one for the shifts during which staff are maintaining constant\nvisual <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> (blue) and another for shifts during which inmate companions are providing constant visual\n<span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> (yellou). When separate inmate companion log books are used, staff must sign the inmate companion\nlog book every 6o minutes.\nLights will remain on inside the cell 24 hours day to ensure the inmate on watch can be seen. A Lieutenant will\nmake rounds every shift and remove the inmate from the cell and perform a cursory search. No food items, trays,\neating utensils, milk cartons, toilet paper, plastic bags, reading materials, pens, pencils, or anything else not\nprescribed by Psychology staff should be in the cell.\nThe inmate will be outfited in a suicide preventive smock, suicide preventive blanket, suicide preventive matress.\nand if necessary a suicide preventive helmet. Inmate Companions will be searched prior to assuming duties. Inmate\nCompanions are not alloued to have radios, mp3 players, magazines, books or anything that would distract them\nfrom maintaining constant supervision. Inmate Companions will not have direct or physical contact with inmates on\nsuicide watch.\nl2. Staffing: The Drug Abuse Program Coordinator positon at MCC New York was abolished during Phase I of the\nstaff realignment during fiscal year 2ol8.

In\naddition, we determined that SHU staff failed to conduct required inmate counts and rounds, including\novernight on August 9-lo, and alloued Epstein to have an excess of blankets, linens, and clothing in his cell.\nThese failures compromised Epstein’s safety, the safety of other inmates, and the security of the institution,\nand provided Epstein an opportunity to commit suicide while locked alone in his cell on the morning of\nAugust lo without having been subject to overnight <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> or supervision by SHU staff.\nThe OIG also found that an MCC New York supervisor had alloued Epstein, in violation of BOP policy, to\nmake an unrecorded, unmonitored telephone call the evening before his death to an individual with whom\nhe allegedly had a personal relationship. Further, 2 days before his death, during a meeting with his lawyers\nin a private room at the MCC New York, Epstein signed a new Last Will and Testament, which MCC New York\nofficials did not learn about until after his death.\nAdditionally, the OIG determined that MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU, including the two SHU staff\non duty the night of August 9-lo, 2ol9, who were stationed at a desk that was directly outside the SHU tier\nin which Epstein was housed and diagonally across from Epstein’s cell, had falsified BOP records to claim\nl Moving an inmate requiring outside emergency medical care to the Health Services Unit provides health care staff and\nEmergency Medical Technicians (EMT) with immediate access to any necessary medical equipment and supplies and\nallous EMTs faster access to the inmate when they arrive at MCC New York because Correctional Officers (CO) can\ndirectly escort EMTs to the Health Services Unit to begin emergency treatment immediately.

The goal of this screening is to determine “the inmate’s security, medical,\npsychological, and/or other special needs.” The BOP also requires that institutions screen pretrial inmates\n“returning from court, as events at court may alter the inmate's separation and/or security needs.” BOP\npolicy further recognizes that there are often “high security, high profile inmates” who may present a\nsignificant threat to themselves or others, and that the “need to identify and monitor these inmates\nregularly is paramount.”\nb. Suicide Prevention\nThe BOP’s suicide prevention program is governed by federal regulations, 28 C.F.R. 88 552.4o-552.42, which\nrequire the BOP to establish a suicide prevention program to identify and manage potentially suicidal\ninmates. Pursuant to these regulations, when an inmate is identified as being at-risk for commiting suicide,\nBOP staff must place the inmate on suicide watch until the inmate is no longer an imminent risk.\nBOP policy (Program Statement 5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program) requires that medical staff screen all\nnew inmates, ordinarily within 24 hours, for signs of suicidality. Houever, at MCCs, among other facilities\nwith high rates of admissions and short lengths of stays, “comprehensive psychological intake conducted by\nPsychology Services ordinarily will be performed only on inmates who are suspected of being suicidal or\nappear psychologically unstable.” Inmates in the SHU are monitored more closely, and inmates exhibiting\nsigns of potential suicide risk are referred to the shift Lieutenant. BOP policy recognizes that inmates who\nare placed in the SHU due to a request for protective custody are at greater risk of commiting suicide and\nshould therefore be screened for suicidal ideation within 72 hours of arriving in the SHU. BOP policy\nexplicitly states that “staff must never take lightly any inmate suicide threats.” Any staff member who has\nreason to believe that an inmate may be suicidal should “ordinarily maintain the inmate under direct,\ncontinuous <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span>.”\nEvery BOP institution must have one or more rooms, ordinarily in the health services area, dedicated to\ninmates placed on suicide watch. Suicide watch may be conducted by specially trained staff or inmates. For\ninmates placed on suicide watch, the specially trained staff or inmate maintains continuous <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> of\nthe inmate believed to be at risk of commiting suicide. Follouing suicide watch and based on clinical\nfindings follouing a face-to-face evaluation, the inmate will be removed from suicide watch or transferred to\na medical referral or health care facility. Psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> is a less restrictive form of individual\nmonitoring that is used for inmates who are stabilizing and not yet prepared for placement in general\npopulation or restrictive housing. While on suicide watch, the inmate is normally required to wear a suicide\nwatch goun and will be alloued a suicide watch blanket.\nAs discussed in greater detail in Chapter 4, witnesses told the OIG that an inmate is placed on suicide watch\nwhen the inmate is believed to be imminently suicidal. During suicide watch, the inmate is under constant\n<span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> by staff; the cell lights are on 24 hours a day; and the inmate is given a special matress,\nblanket, and smock to wear. Although psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> is a louer classification, witnesses told the\nOIG that at MCC New York the psychological observations was the same as suicide watch except that\ninmates were alloued to have their clothing and some materials, such as books, as determined by the\nPsychology Department.

Senior Officer Specialist l reported that he then reentered the\ncell, placed Epstein on his side, and removed “an orange homemade rope” from his neck. In his interview\nwith the OIG, Senior Officer Specialist l said Epstein had a sheet around his neck, which was atached to the\nbunkbed ladder in the cell. Senior Officer Specialist l said that Epstein was siting on the floor of the cell\nwith his back against the bunkbed ladder. Senior Officer Specialist l's report said that Epstein was\nbreathing, but unresponsive, so he began chest compressions, at which time the Morning Watch Operations\nLieutenant and other staff arrived. Senior Officer Specialist l confirmed in his OIG interview that they\nstarted cardiopulmonary resuscitation but stopped when they realized that Epstein was already breathing.\nThe Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant documented in a BOP report that when she arrived at the SHU,\nshe saw Epstein lying in the fetal position in his cell, breathing heavily and snoring, wearing only a t-shirt and\nboxers. The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant observed that Epstein’s neck was red, but she saw no\nfurther injuries. She called out to Epstein, who flickered his eyes and continued snoring.

During suicide watch, the inmate is under constant\n<span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> by staff; the cell lights are on 24 hours a day; and the inmate is given a special matress,\nblanket, and smock to wear. The Chief Psychologist explained that although psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> is a\nlouer classification, at MCC New York the psychological observations were the same as suicide watch except\nthat inmates were alloued to have their clothing and some materials, such as books, as determined by\nPsychology Department.

According to her, the Psychology Department always recommends that inmates coming off\nof suicide watch be housed with other inmates; houever, she said the recommendations cannot always be\ncarried out due to other security factors. When that occurs, the Psychology Department recommends\nconducting increased rounds and keeping an eye on those inmates.\nThe Chief Psychologist further told the OIG that, based on a conversation with the BOP’s National Suicide\nPrevention Coordinator from the BOP’s Central Office, she passed along to the MCC New York executive\nstaff the recommendation that Epstein be housed with an alleged sex offender in the SHU.*° The Chief\nPsychologist stated that the MCC New York Warden and Associate Wardens decided who Epstein would be\nhoused with and the Psychology Department was not involved in that decision.\nAccording to BOP records, as a result of the July 23 incident, MCC New York subsequently conducted\ndisciplinary proceedings against Epstein for alleged self-mutilation, but ultimately found that there was\ninsufficient evidence to find that Epstein engaged in a prohibited act.

The Psychology Department's Post-July 23 Determination that Epstein Needed\nto Have an Appropriate Cellmate\nFollouing the events of July 23, the MCC New York Psychology Department determined that Epstein needed\nto be housed with an appropriate cellmate.

The Staff Psychologist also\ncompleted a “Post-Watch Report,” which stated that the “SHU L[ieutenant] informed inmate Epstein needs\nto be housed with an appropriate cellmate.”\nThe Warden told the OIG that the Chief Psychologist had advised him that Epstein was not suicidal and was\nready to return to the SHU. According to the Warden, when he spoke with the Chief Psychologist regarding\nEpstein, she told him to assign Epstein a cellmate. He added that MCC New York would typically house an\ninmate who was previously on suicide watch with a cellmate. The Warden stated there was no BOP policy\nmandating that an inmate coming off of suicide watch have a cellmate, but they usually housed such an\ninmate with a cellmate.\nDuring their interviews with the OIG, Associate Warden l, the Captain, and the SHU Lieutenant each said\nthey had verbally informed the SHU staff of Epstein’s cellmate requirement and were confident that all SHU\nstaff members knew of Epstein’s cellmate requirement.

The Warden said he passed this information on to\nthe BOP Director's Chief of Staff and later received word that he should assign Inmate 3 to be\nEpstein’s cellmate.\nThe Warden told the OIG that no inmates were pre-veted to replace Inmate 3 if he left MCC New York. The\nWarden and the Captain told the OIG that if Inmate 3 had been removed as Epstein’s cellmate, they would\nhave had to review a new list of potential cell mate candidates to ensure that Epstein was housed with an\nappropriate inmate. According to the Warden and the Captain, if Inmate 3 was no longer detained at MCC\nNew York, SHU staff should have informed a Lieutenant on duty, who should have informed the Captain,\nwho would have ensured that the process of selecting a new cellmate for Epstein would begin.\nVil.

Epstein denied recent or present morbid thoughts\nand denied passive or active suicidal ideation. It was noted in BOP records that Epstein’s verbalizations\nwere future-oriented and did not have indications of helpless or hopeless thinking.\nAccording to Forensic Psychologist l, Epstein did not meet the criteria for any psychological diagnosis and\nwas designated as Mental Health Care Code l. This is indicative of an inmate who does not shou any\nsignificant level of functional impairment associated with a mental illness and does not demonstrate a need\nfor regular mental health intervention. Epstein was educated on emergency procedures for contacting the\nPsychology Department staff, and Epstein agreed to contact staff if he needed Psychology Department\nservices in the future.\nThe MCC New York Chief Psychologist told the OIG that based on the Psychological Services Intake\nQuestionnaire, inmates have four different Care Code ratings.*” Code l means there are no concerns about\nthe inmate's mental health status; they have no needs and will not be folloued up with unless requested by\nstaff or the inmates.

The Chief Psychologist stated that a Code l inmate can be on suicide watch.\nSuicide watch is for inmates who are shouing immediate and exigent signs of being suicidal.\nSubsequent to the intake screening, on July 8, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist consulted with the National\nSuicide Prevention Coordinator from the BOP’s Central Office, regarding the various risk factors associated\nwith Epstein for suicidality. These risk factors were that Epstein was involved in a high-profile case with\nmedia atention, had been charged with sex offenses, was on pretrial status, and there was the potential for\nbad news from a court proceeding that day. A determination was made that upon Epstein’s return from\ncourt, staff were to notify the psychologist and place Epstein on a “watch status” until a thorough suicide risk\nassessment could be conducted.\nWhen Epstein returned from court on July 8, 2ol9, it was after duty hours and MCC New York staff contacted\nthe Psychology Department and informed them that Epstein denied suicidality.

The Chief Psychologist’s\nassessment was that Epstein had “protective” factors present that could decrease his risk of suicide. The\nChief Psychologist assessed factors that included his willingness to engage in treatment, view of death as\nnegative, future orientation, and the fact that he adamantly denied any suicidal ideation, intention, or plan.\nThe Chief Psychologist's assessment was that Epstein had numerous protective factors that outweighed his\nrisk factors for suicidality and that he had a positive outlook regarding his legal case. Epstein remained on\npsychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> pending a suitable cell assignment, and the Chief Psychologist noted that a\nsuicide watch was not warranted at the time of her report.\nOn July lo, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist met with Epstein for a psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> and noted that,\naccording to the psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> logbook, Epstein had been eating his meals, sleeping, and\ninteracting with other inmates. During this meeting with the Chief Psychologist, Epstein voiced concerns\nover being housed in the SHU. Epstein asked the Chief Psychologist to be “single-celled” if he were to be\nhoused in the SHU and had also requested a shouer, his property, pen, and paper. The Chief Psychologist\nstated Epstein had been provided a shouer on this date. She provided Epstein with coping skills strategies,\nto which he was receptive. Epstein continued to deny any suicidal ideation, intention, or plan; and Epstein\nstated he was looking forward to his upcoming court hearing regarding pretrial release. The Chief\nPsychologist’s assessment was that Epstein was psychologically stable at the time and that he could be\nreleased from the psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> area.

According to the Staff Psychologist’s report, Epstein denied knouing why he was\nplaced on suicide watch. BOP records state that Epstein recalled geting a drink of water the night prior and\nthen went back to bed. Epstein’s next recollection was hearing himself snoring. The BOP assessment\nrecords reflect that Epstein wanted to knou why he was on suicide watch and he was informed that he had\nbeen found with a string on his neck. The Staff Psychologist noted that it was unclear whether Epstein had\nplaced the string around his neck or if someone else did. Epstein denied current suicidal or self-harm\nthoughts or ever having these thoughts; denied a history of self-harm and suicide atempts; and denied\nfeeling hopeless and fearing for his safety. Epstein told the Staff Psychologist that he lived to enjoy life and\nthat his future plans included fighting his criminal case and geting back to his normal life. The Staff\nPsychologist noted that Epstein was to remain on suicide watch for further <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span>. The Staff\nPsychologist told the OIG she had advised BOP staff that Epstein would need a cellmate.\nThe Chief Psychologist said she considered three possibilities to explain the July 23 incident: (l) Epstein\nand/or Inmate l were gaming the system to get something they wanted that they were not geting;\n(2) Epstein, who really was suicidal, had conducted a rehearsal; or (3) Inmate l had assaulted Epstein. The\nChief Psychologist told the OIG that after Epstein told her he wanted to be housed with the same cellmate\nhe originally said had assaulted him, she began to think that the third possibility (assault by Inmate l) was\nless plausible than the other two possibilities, although she did not knou for certain.\nThe follouing day, July 24, medical staff examined Epstein at approximately l:o8 p.m., and observed that the\ncentral part of the red mark on Epstein’s neck had some abrasion. Epstein told the medical staff that he still\ndid not want to talk about hou he sustained his injuries, but he believed that his cellmate had something to\ndo with it. BOP’s SIS opened an investigation into this incident but was unable to determine whether\nEpstein had harmed himself or had been assaulted.\nOn July 24, 2ol9, after 3l hours and 5 minutes, Epstein was removed from suicide watch.

The BOP report further stated that Epstein adamantly denied suicidal ideation,\nintentions, and plans, that Epstein identified reasons to live and was future-oriented, and that Epstein was\nassessed for a willingness to engage in treatment. The BOP report reflected that Forensic Psychologist 2\ninquired further if Epstein could recall the previous day’s incident and Epstein stated that he had been trying\nto remember.

Epstein was therefore taken off suicide watch and placed on\npsychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span>, during which time BOP records reflect that he was continuously observed by\ninmate companions and seen daily by Psychology Department staff. Forensic Psychologist 2 annotated in\nthe Post Suicide Watch Report that the reason for removing Epstein from suicide watch was due to Epstein\nstating he had no interest in killing himself; he had described having a wonderful life; and Epstein had said it\nwould be crazy to take his oun life and he would not do that to himself. Forensic Psychologist 2 told the FBI\nthat follouing her clinical visit with Epstein on July 24, 2ol9, she was cautious with Epstein’s case and his\nself-reporting of what had occurred the previous day. Forensic Psychologist 2 stated that she observed\nsigns of positivity and that Epstein “adamantly denied suicide.” Nevertheless, she was not comfortable\ntaking Epstein off suicide watch and instead opted to place Epstein on psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span>, which was\na step doun from suicide watch. Forensic Psychologist 2 told the FBI that “I made the decision with the\nconsent” of the Chief Psychologist and Associate Warden 2, with whom she had consulted. Forensic\nPsychologist 2 told the FBI that placing Epstein on psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> alloued him to possess hygiene\nproducts, two novels, atend legal visits, and take shouers. It also alloued him to have standard inmate\nclothing, a flex pen, a toothbrush and toothpaste, soap, and deodorant. Houever, Forensic Psychologist 2\nexplained that it was not healthy for inmates to stay on suicide watch for extended periods of time and they\nare re-evaluated on a day-to-day basis.\nAccording to Forensic Psychologist 2’s Post Suicide Watch Report, Epstein expressed a feeling of safety being\nhoused in the psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> area rather than the SHU and asked if there was a safer unit for\nhim to be housed. Forensic Psychologist 2 informed Epstein that he would remain on psychological\n<span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> for the near future, but his long-term housing would need to be revisited because it is not ideal\nto remain in psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> for extended periods of time. The BOP report states that Epstein\nwas again educated on routine and emergency procedures for contacting Psychology Department staff.\nAccording to BOP records, between July 25-29, 2ol9, Epstein was seen daily by the Chief Psychologist or the\nStaff Psychologist while he was on psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span>. On each of these dates, according to BOP\nreports, Epstein adamantly denied any suicidality and denied having any memory of what occurred on\nJuly 23, 2ol9, which resulted in him being placed on suicide watch. Additionally, on each date, Epstein was\nprovided with supportive and coping skill interventions to which he was receptive. BOP records state that\nEpstein expressed concerns about being housed again in the SHU because he felt it was dangerous; he\ncould not sleep well due to noise from other inmates; and it was difficult for him to work on his legal case.\nThe Chief Psychologist told the FBI and the OIG that she met with Epstein on July 25, 2ol9, and he was in\ngood spirits. She said that during this clinical visit, Epstein said he was baffled over the July 23, 2ol9 incident\nand asked the Chief Psychologist to give him some cues to help him remember. The Chief Psychologist told\nthe OIG that she kept Epstein on psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> because he had not answered her questions\nregarding the possible suicide atempt. The Chief Psychologist told the OIG that she coordinated with the\nBOP’s National Suicide Prevention Coordinator, who recommended that Epstein be housed with a sex\noffender in the SHU. The Chief Psychologist notified Associate Warden 2 of this recommendation via email.\nBOP records further reflect that, during his clinical visit on July 28, 2ol9, Epstein told the Staff Psychologist\nthat he was agitated for hours the previous night because of a non-stop toilet flushing and that the noise\nwas similar to when he was housed in the SHU. The Staff Psychologist informed Epstein that he would be\nmoving to a different cell.\nOn July 29, 2ol9, according to BOP records, Epstein reported to the Chief Psychologist that his memory of\nthe July 23, 2ol9 incident may be impaired because of his sleep apnea. On this date, Epstein was to receive\n\n46\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234l3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023414.tif": "his personally ouned medical device.

Epstein\nasked to stay on psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span>, where he felt safe, for one more night to get some sleep and\nthen return to the SHU with a cellmate the follouing day. According to BOP records, the Chief Psychologist\ninformed Epstein that he could stay l more night and explained that there were no mental health issues\nprecluding him from returning to the SHU the follouing day. The Chief Psychologist explained to Epstein\nthat he would be placed in a safe situation in the SHU. Epstein again was provided supportive interventions\nand psychoeducation regarding additional coping strategies. BOP records state that Epstein was somewhat\nreceptive but more concerned with geting phone calls, recreation, and housing placement concerns.\nOn July 3o, 2ol9, according to BOP records, Epstein reported to the Staff Psychologist that he had not slept\nwell, and Epstein discussed hou he did not think he would be able to sleep well in the SHU because of the\nnoise. The Staff Psychologist annotated in the clinical contact summary that documentation revealed\nEpstein had eaten and taken a shouer the day prior (July 29) and also had eaten breakfast on July 3o. The\nStaff Psychologist annotated, Epstein did not display indications of disturbed thought process or content\nand denied current suicidal or self-harm ideation. BOP records further stated that Epstein agreed to\nimmediately report to staff if he began to have suicidal or self-harm thoughts and that Epstein was future-\noriented and did not appear to be a danger to himself. The Staff Psychologist noted in her clinical contact\nreport that she had consulted with the Chief Psychologist and that psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> of Epstein\nwould be discontinued. According to her clinical contact report, the Staff Psychologist educated Epstein\nabout routine and emergency procedures for contacting Psychology Department staff and noted that\nEpstein would be seen the follouing day to monitor his mental status and provide further intervention if\nneeded. The Staff Psychologist also noted in her report that the SHU Lieutenant was informed that Epstein\nneeded to be housed with an appropriate cellmate.\nAlso on July 3o, 2ol9, the Staff Psychologist completed an evaluation of competency related to Epstein being\nable to proceed with the disciplinary process. Epstein had been charged by BOP with a prohibited act,\nspecifically tatooing or self-mutilation, for the incident that occurred on July 23, 2ol9. In conducting the\nevaluation of competency, the Staff Psychologist reviewed the suicide risk assessment completed by the\nChief Psychologist on July 9, 2ol9, in which Epstein had denied a history of mental health treatment and\nhaving any past or present suicidal ideation, intention, or plan. The Staff Psychologist also reviewed the\nsuicide risk assessment that she herself completed, dated July 23, 2ol9, which stated that it was unclear at\nthe time if Epstein had placed the string around his neck or if it was done by someone else. According to\nthe Staff Psychologist’s notes from her competency evaluation on July 3o, the determination of an inmate’s\ncompetency to proceed with the disciplinary process was based on a clinical assessment of the inmate’s\nability to understand the nature of the proceedings and his or her ability to assist in his or her oun defense.\nAfter a review of available psychological and psychiatric records and information related to the offense, the\nStaff Psychologist found that Epstein was competent to proceed with the disciplinary process.\nThat same day, July 3o, Epstein was removed from psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> and transferred back to the\nSHU, consistent with what he had been told by the Chief Psychologist the prior day.\nOn July 3l, 2ol9, according to BOP records, Forensic Psychologist 3 conducted a clinical visit with Epstein\nand noted that he was in a pleasant mood, generally slept well, and was geting readjusted to being in the\nSHU. Epstein told Forensic Psychologist 3 that he was geting along with his cellmate.

The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant, who was the Operations\nLieutenant from approximately lo p.m. on August 9 until 6 a.m. on August lo, told the OIG that she did not\nknou that Epstein was required to have a cellmate, and that the Captain never spoke with her about this\nissue. The Captain confirmed that he did not specifically tell the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant that\nEpstein needed a cellmate; houever, the Captain said he believed that the Morning Watch Operations\nLieutenant should have knoun of the requirement, and she was one of the recipients of the email from the\nPsychology Department on July 3o, 2ol9, that informed MCC New York staff that Epstein needed to have an\nappropriate cellmate. The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant also received the August 8 USMS email\nnotifying MCC New York supervisory staff of Inmate 3’s scheduled transfer out of MCC New York. The\nMorning Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that if SHU staff knew that Epstein required a cellmate\nand did not have one, they should have informed her when she visited the SHU at approximately 4 a.m. on\nAugust lo, as part of her Lieutenant rounds.\nThe Material Handler said the SHU was not his regular post and he had not atended SHU training, but he\nhad worked in the SHU approximately lo to 2o times. According to the Material Handler, on August 9 he\nreported for a voluntary overtime shift from l2 a.m. to 8 a.m. and then worked his regular 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nshift in the warehouse. At some point during the day shift, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant called and\nasked the Material Handler if he could work overtime in the SHU, and he agreed. The Material Handler said\nhe worked the 4 p.m. to l2 a.m. shift in the SHU with the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and Noel.\nThe Material Handler told the OIG that he felt pressured to work the third shift, which resulted in him\nworking 24 hours straight, from l2 a.m. on August 9 through l2 a.m. on August lo. After the Evening Watch\nSHU Officer in Charge left at lo p.m., the Material Handler and Noel were the only employees working in the\nSHU from lo p.m. to l2 a.m. The Material Handler recalled that Epstein came back to the SHU from meeting\nwith his atorneys at approximately 8 p.m., which was later than the rest of the inmates, and was returned\nto his cellon L Tier. After the Material Handler and Noel gave Epstein his food, the Material Handler said\nthey left the L Tier area. The Material Handler said Epstein was alone in his cell, but he was unaware that\nEpstein needed a cellmate.\nNoel told the OIG that she worked in the SHU from approximately 4 p.m. on August 9 until 8 a.m. on\nAugust lo, which was a double shift of l6 hours. Noel said the SHU was her regular post during the time\nthat Epstein was housed within the SHU. According to Noel, inmates housed within the MCC New York SHU\nwere typically assigned cellmates, but she did not knou if they were required to have cellmates. Noel said\nEpstein was assigned a cell mate while he was housed within the SHU but said that no one spoke with her\nabout a requirement that Epstein have a cellmate. Noel said she did not knou that Inmate 3 had been\nremoved from MCC New York on August 9, and stated she was not aware that Epstein should have been\nassigned a new cellmate if Inmate 3 had been removed from MCC New York.\nMaterial Handler Michael Thomas told the OIG that he worked a shift in the SHU on August lo from l2 a.m.\nuntil 8 a.m. Thomas said the SHU was not his normal post, but he had worked in the SHU on numerous\nprevious occasions and was familiar with the SHU protocols and procedures. Thomas said he knew that if\nan inmate came off suicide watch or psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span>, they should be assigned a cellmate, and he\nsaid he was aware that Epstein had previously been on suicide watch and psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span>.\nTherefore, Thomas assumed that Epstein was required to have a cellmate but said no one had spoken with\nhim about that requirement.

The 4 p.m. SHU Count on August 9\nThe OIG’s investigation determined that the 4 p.m. SHU inmate count on August 9, 2ol9, was inaccurate\nbecause SHU staff did not physically count the inmates as required by BOP policy and instead relied upon a\npredetermined number of inmates believed to be in the SHU at that time. Houever, Epstein, who was in the\nSHU atorney visitation room, was correctly accounted for during the 4 p.m. and subsequent SHU counts.\nThe OIG determined that the error in the 4 p.m. SHU count was carried over into the next inmate count at\nlo p.m. that counted an inmate who had been transferred out of the SHU. The SHU inmate count was not\ncorrected until l2 a.m. when the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant reviewed the master institutional\ncount and housing unit count slips and informed SHU staff of the correct number of inmates in the SHU at\nthat time.\nSenior Officer Specialist 5 told the OIG that prior to his departure from the SHU at approximately 4 p.m., he\ntold the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge what the SHU count should be. In addition, the Day Watch\nSHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that SHU staff maintain a “cheat sheet,” which lists the number of\ninmates believed to be in the SHU at any given time.\nWhen interviewed by the OIG, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge reviewed the 4 p.m. SHU count slip from\nAugust 9, 2ol9, which was signed by the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and CO Noel. Based on his\nreview, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and\nNoel probably did not count the inmates in the SHU. He said they likely wrote doun the numbers they\nthought should have been entered for the count because the count slip inaccurately included an inmate\n(Inmate 4) among the number of inmates in the SHU after that inmate had been transferred to another\nhousing unit. According to what he told the OIG and wrote in an email on August 9, earlier that afternoon\nthe Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge observed Inmate 4 atempt to retrieve an unknoun item from his\nvisitor in the MCC New York SHU visiting room. The Lieutenant’s Log from August 9, 2ol9, reflected that\nfollouing this incident, Inmate 4 was removed from the SHU at 3:l5 p.m. and transferred to the Receiving\nand Discharge dry cell, which is a secure location where inmates are taken for <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> when they are\nbelieved to have ingested or secreted contraband on their person. According to the Day Watch SHU Officer\nin Charge, the inaccurate 4 p.m. count slip told him “that the count was not done and they just assumed and\nwent by the cheat sheet because the body wasn't even there,” referring to Inmate 4, who was transferred\nfrom the SHU to Receiving and Discharge. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that if the\n4 p.m. SHU count had been accurately conducted, then the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and the\nSHU staff should have realized that Inmate 4 was no longer in the SHU.\nIn his interview with the OIG, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge acknouledged that neither he nor\nany other SHU staff member conducted the 4 p.m. SHU count on August 9. The Evening Watch SHU Officer\nin Charge verified that it was his handwriting and signature on the 4 p.m. SHU count slip and said he had\nprepared the count slip ahead of time because “[t]here was so much going on” in the SHU that day. The\nEvening Watch SHU Officer in Charge confirmed that Noel’s name and signature also appeared on the 4 p.m.\n62\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23429", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023467.tif": "The OIG investigation also found that during the next shift in the MCC New York SHU, both the Evening\nWatch SHU Officer in Charge and Noel became aware that Epstein was without a cellmate. The Evening\nWatch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that when he escorted Epstein back to his cell after Epstein’s\ntelephone call, he saw that Inmate 3 was not there and then he, Noel, and the Material Handler discussed\nthe need for Epstein to have a new cellmate. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge also told the OIG\nthat he notified an unspecified supervisor. Houever, other witnesses did not corroborate his account. Noel\ntold the OIG that she was unaware both that Epstein needed to have a cellmate and that Inmate 3 had been\nremoved from the institution. Noel also told the OIG that she went to Epstein’s cell at approximately\nlo p.m.—a time of day when all inmates were secured in their cells—and may have plugged in Epstein’s\nmedical device for him. The OIG did not credit Noel's statements that she did not knou that Epstein needed\na cellmate or that Inmate 3 had been removed from the SHU based on contradictory witness statements\n(including her oun) regarding SHU staff's knouledge of Epstein’s cellmate requirement and Inmate 3’s\ntransfer out of the SHU.®\nThe OIG investigation concluded that on August 9, 2ol9, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Evening\nWatch SHU Officer in Charge, and Noel failed to notify a supervisor as required after Epstein’s cellmate was\npermanently removed from the MCC New York SHU, which constituted a violation of BOP standards of\nconduct. Additionally, their inaction violated MCC New York SHU Post Orders because none of these\nindividuals documented the fact the Epstein needed a new cellmate as required. Finally, all of these officers\nfailed to exercise good judgment and common sense, as required by the SHU Post Orders, by not\nimmediately undertaking steps through their chain-of-command to ensure that a high-profile inmate who\nhad been released from suicide watch and psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> lo days earlier had an\nappropriate cellmate.\n2. Failure to Adequately Supervise SHU Staff\nThe OIG also found that MCC New York supervisory personnel failed to effectively perform their duties,\nwhich contributed to the fact that Epstein was housed without a cellmate at the time of his death. Rather\nthan passively relying on a notification from subordinates, supervisory personnel also had an obligation\nunder federal regulations to “put forth honest effort in the performance of their duties,” which included\nsupervision of SHU personnel.®” The OIG's investigation revealed that the Captain and the Day Watch\nOperations Lieutenant, the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant, the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant, and\nthe Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant, among other MCC New York staff, received an email from the\nU.S. Marshals Service (USMS) on August 8, 2ol9, notifying them that Inmate 3 was scheduled to be\ntransferred to another facility the follouing day. If any of these supervisors had read the email atachment,\nthey would have knoun of the need to assign Epstein a new cellmate. Instead, many of these individuals\ntold the OIG that they believed that Inmate 3 had gone to court on August 9 and they were unaware that he\nwould not return and Epstein needed a new cellmate.

Failure to Have a Contingency Plan for Assigning Epstein a Cellmate\nAdditionally, the OIG found that the Warden's failure to have a back-up cellmate assignment for Epstein\nconstituted poor judgment. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that although he knew\nthat Epstein needed to be assigned another cellmate, SHU staff could not just put anyone in the cell with\nEpstein. The Warden confirmed this in his OIG interview, when he explained that he and BOP executive\nleadership selected Inmate 3 as Epstein’s cellmate follouing the events of July 23, 2ol9. The Warden told\nthe OIG that no inmates were pre-veted to serve as Epstein’s cellmate if Inmate 3 left MCC New York. ® The\nNortheast Regional Director, the Warden, and the Captain all told the OIG that if Inmate 3 had been\nremoved as Epstein’s cellmate, they would have had to review a new list of potential cellmate candidates to\nensure that Epstein was housed with an appropriate inmate. This selection process, which involved multiple\nsteps undertaken by high-level BOP management, would be difficult to accomplish in a short period of time\nand ultimately may have impeded SHU officers’ ability to house Epstein with a cell mate on August 9, 2ol9.\n4. Lack of Candor\nBOP policy requires that “[d]uring the course of an official investigation, employees are to cooperate fully by\nproviding all pertinent information they may have. Full cooperation requires truthfully responding\nto questions.””°\nAs discussed above, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge and the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told\nthe OIG that they notified supervisory personnel regarding the need to assign Epstein a new cellmate.\nBased on a lack of corroborating evidence for these assertions, the OIG found that they lacked candor in\ntheir OIG interviews in violation of BOP policy. Similarly, the OIG found that Noel lacked candor in violation\nof BOP policy when she said she did not knou that Epstein needed a cellmate or that his then-cellmate\nInmate 3 had been transferred out of the SHU.\nThe OIG also found that the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant lacked candor in her interview with the\nOIG in violation of BOP policy when she said she was not aware that Epstein was required to be housed with\nacellmate. Her statement is contradicted by the fact that she was one of the MCC New York staff members\nwho responded to the July 23, 2ol9 incident involving Epstein, which resulted in him being placed on suicide\nwatch and psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span>; she was a recipient of the Psychology Department's July 3o, 2ol9\n6 The Senior Officer Specialist who served as the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant from 4 p.m. to lo p.m. on\nAugust 9, 2ol9, told the OIG that she was not aware of Epstein’s cell mate requirement. The OIG credited her account\nbecause she did not ordinarily work in or supervise the SHU and did not receive the Psychology Department's July 3o,\n2ol9 email regarding the need for Epstein to have an appropriate cellmate or the USMS August 8, 2ol9 email notifying\nthat Inmate 3 would be transferred to another facility the follouing day.\n6 Upon reviewing a draft of this report, the Warden told the OIG that there were no suitable backup cellmates\nfor Epstein.\n7° BOP Program Statement 342o.ll.\nlol\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23468", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023478.tif": "policy does not, houever, describe hou long the cellmate requirement should last or if any staff must\napprove the removal of the cellmate requirement. The Suicide Prevention Program Policy Statement\n5324.o8 does not describe any process or procedure that requires cellmate assignments for inmates coming\noff of suicide watch. The Warden stated there was no BOP policy mandating that an inmate coming off of\nsuicide watch have a cellmate, but that doing so was “sound correctional judgment.”\n\nThe OIG’s investigation and review revealed that there were knouledge gaps among MCC New York staff\nregarding Epstein’s cellmate requirement, indicating that improved communication with institutional staff\nwould be beneficial. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP implement a requirement that all\ninmates coming off of suicide watch or psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> to be assigned cellmates with criteria for\nexceptions based on the particular individual or security considerations, provide guidance for determining\nwhen a cellmate is no longer required, and implement a process for approving, documenting, and\ncommunicating to institutional staff the assignment and removal of cellmates for these inmates.\n\n2. The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high risk for suicide and for\nwhom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate until the\nrecommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency plan\nfor cellmate re-assignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular\nindividual or security considerations.\n\nThe OIG's investigation and review found that there was no contingency plan in place to assign Epstein a\nnew cellmate when his then-cellmate was transferred out of MCC New York. Although the failure to assign a\nnew cellmate was due, in part, to SHU staff failing to make required notifications and supervisory staff\nfailing to adequate supervise SHU staff, the gap in cellmate assignment was also due to the lack of a\ncontingency plan. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that although he knew that Epstein\nneeded a new cellmate, he said that SHU staff did not have the authority to assign a new cellmate, which\nwas consistent with what MCC New York supervisory personnel told the OIG. A contingency plan, such as a\nlist of alternate cellmates, would have increased the likelihood that Epstein would not have been housed\nalone at the time of his death. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP develop contingency plans for\ncellmate assignment for high-risk inmates with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or\nsecurity considerations.\n\n3. The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and documenting approval\nfor social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or\npsychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span>, which allous for institution-specific variations in the\nprocess, and provide guidance on standard components that each institution should\ninclude in its process to mitigate security issues that can arise when an inmate is on\nsuicide watch or psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span>.\n\nAccording to the BOP’s Suicide Prevention Program Policy Statement 5324.o8 and the MCC New York\nInstitution Supplement to the suicide prevention policy, inmates on suicide watch must be under constant\n<span class=\"highlight\">observation</span> by staff or trained inmate observers. The MCC New York Institution Supplement policy states\nthat only with rare exceptions that are approved by the Captain as well by the Associate Warden of\nPrograms will visitation either social or legal be permited for inmates on suicide watch.

Although the MCC New York\nsupplemental policy described an approval process for social and legal visits while an inmate is on suicide\nwatch or psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span>, the OIG found no evidence that Epstein’s legal visits were approved by\nthe Captain or an Associate Warden. Additionally, the BOP Suicide Prevention Program Policy Statement\n5324.o8 does not describe any process or procedures that allous an inmate to have legal or social visits\nwhile on suicide watch or psychological <span class=\"highlight\">observation</span>. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP evaluate\nits current process for such visits to be approved and documented.\n\n4. The BOP should evaluate its methods of accounting for inmate whereabouts and\nwellbeing and make changes as may be appropriate to improve those methods\nthrough policy, training, or other measures.\n\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed many inmate accountability deficiencies. Most fundamentally,\nMCC New York staff assigned to the SHU on August 9 and lo, 2ol9, did not conduct many of the required\nrounds and inmate counts. Additionally, there was lacking or delayed documentation regarding inmates,\nincluding cell assignments and internal inmate transfers. Internal reports, such as the daily call out list and\nthe Lieutenant log, are either not retained or subject to continuous modification, which reduces their utility\nas accountability tools. Therefore, the OIG recommends that the BOP evaluate its methods of accounting\nfor inmate whereabouts and wellbeing and make changes as appropriate to improve those methods\nthrough policy, training, or other measures.\n\n5. BOP policy should clarify what is required of a Lieutenant when conducting a round.\n\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed significant gaps in the supervision of MCC New York staff\nassigned to the SHU. Although BOP policy requires MCC New York Lieutenants to conduct at least one\nround in the SHU during each shift, what was required of a Lieutenant during the round is not specified.\nDuring their interviews with the OIG, experienced MCC New York supervisory personnel described what\nshould be done during a round, which is also reflected in BOP Lieutenant training, but this expectation was\nnot memorialized in any BOP or MCC New York policy or Post Order. The OIG recommends that the BOP\ndevelop a policy, either at an agency-wide or institution-specific level, to define what is expected of\nsupervisory personnel during a round in the SHU to beter ensure that BOP staff are\nappropriately supervised.\n\nll2\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23479", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023486.tif": "individualized approach to the care and custody of adults in custody.
