The\ngovernment filed a response in opposition [Doc. 282] and Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> filed a reply [Doc. 284].\nThe United States Probation Office (USPO) also filed two memorandums addressing Mr.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s release.

Jd.

It also explains its decision to deny the government’s\nAmended Emergency Motion for Reconsideration and Stay of Release Order. Doc. 298.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nMr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> is charged in a three-count superseding indictment with Obstruction of\nJustice by Retaliating Against a Witness, Victim, or Informant, in violation of l8 U.S.C.\n§ l5l3(a)(l)(B); Possessing and Discharging a Firearm in Furtherance of a Crime of Violence, in\nviolation of l8 U.S.C. § 924(c); and Felon in Possession of a Firearm and Ammunition, in violation\nof l8 U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(l) and 924. Doc. 86. The charges arise from his alleged act of shooting\nan individual named D.S. eight times in the early morning hours of September l2, 2ol7 in\nretaliation for D.S.’s cooperation with the federal government in a criminal case two years earlier.\nSee Doc. 38 at 2. Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> pled not guilty to the charges at an arraignment held on December\nll, 2ol7 [Doc. 9] and a trial in the case will be set for April 5, 2o2l, about two months from today.\n\nAlthough presumed innocent of all charges, Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> has been in pretrial detention\nin this case for over three years. He was arrested on December ll, 2ol7 and was ordered detained\nthe same day by Magistrate Judge B. Paul Briones after the Magistrate Judge found that no\ncondition or combination of conditions of release would reasonably assure the safety of the\ncommunity or his appearance in court. Doc. l2. Extensive pretrial litigation folloued until the\ncase was eventually ready and set for trial on March 23, 2o2o. Doc. 63. The Court held a pretrial\nconference on March lo, 2o2o and testimonial writs were issued. Docs. l27 and l43. Just days\nlater, houever, the devastating extent of the global COVID-l9 pandemic became clear and the\nChief Judge of the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico suspended all civil\nand criminal jury trials set for the follouing month. See In the Mater of: Court Operations in\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- ooool292", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001293.jpg": "CGaseel2l\\7/oroo 2artauivient DocumMdil B62 Filee662o6/PhgPage F 66D\nLight of the Coronavirus Outbreak, 2o-MC-oooo4-9 (D.N.M. Mar. l3, 2o2o) (Johnson, C.J.).\nAlmost a full year later, jury trials remain suspended in the District of New Mexico. See Jn the\nMater of: Superseding Administrative Order 2o-MC-oooo4-49, 2l-MC-oooo4-o4 (D.N.M. Jan.\nl5, 2o2l) (Johnson, C.J.) (continuing the suspension of all civil and criminal jury trials through at\nleast February 28, 2o2l).\n\nIn the intervening ll months, Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> has remained in custody. During that time\nperiod, the Court set and then continued several trial dates due to the pandemic, including dates in\nDecember 2o2o and February 2o2l. See, e.g, Doc. 27l. Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s trial will nou be reset\nfor April 5, 2o2l, and the Court is hopeful that he will finally get his day in court after the extreme\nand unprecedented delay he has endured. Complicating maters, houever, is the fact that the\npandemic and the resulting passage of time has led to a recent and significant change in Mr.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s defense team: both of his original atorneys withdrew from the case in January of this\nyear. Doc. 295. As a result, the atorneys with which he will be going to trial in two months were\nappointed in September 2o2o and January 2o2l. Docs. l97 and 293. Although the Court would\nnot have granted the appointments if it were not sure that Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s new atorneys would be\nready for trial this April, they nevertheless face the daunting task of earning their client’s trust,\npreparing for trial, and reviewing three years’ worth of litigation in a mater of months.\n\nMr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> first asked the Court to consider his release in July of last year. Doc. l8l.\nHe argued that his continued pretrial detention posed a risk to his health because his compromised\nimmune system makes him especially vulnerable to serious illness or death from COVID-l9. Id.\nat 5. He also argued that there were conditions of release that would satisfy the requirements of\nthe Bail Reform Act, including the designation of his father as a third-party custodian. /d. at 9-\nlo. The Court took up the motion at a status conference held on September ll, 2o2o. It explained\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool293", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001294.jpg": "Gaseel2l'7/oroo 2artauivient DodumMdil B62 Fileth662o6/PhgPage af 6656\n\nthat it was “very concerned” about the amount of time Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> had been in custody up to\nthat point, especially given that the already-minimal rehabilitative and mental health services in\njail had been further reduced by the pandemic. Transcript of September ll, 2o2o Status\nConference at 43-44.! The Court nevertheless found that it did not have any conditions available\nthat could reasonably assure Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s appearance or the safety of the community given his\nfailure to comply with conditions of release in the past. Jd. at 44-45. The Court also noted that\nwhile it was concerned about Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s ability to meet with his atorneys to prepare for trial\nduring the pandemic, it had been informed that the defense team would be able to meet in\nconference rooms in the federal courthouse in Albuquerque. Jd. at 45.\n\nMr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> nou asks the Court to reconsider its earlier decision denying him pretrial\nrelease. Doc. 274. As grounds for reconsideration, he points to the additional unforeseen trial\ncontinuances follouing the September status conference as well as new placement options,\nincluding the grandmother of his children and La Pasada Halfway House. /d.; see also Doc. 284\nat 2-3. The government opposes the requested reconsideration. Doc. 282.\n\nDISCUSSION\nl. Reconsideration is Proper on the Basis of New Evidence Previously Unavailable.\n\nAs an initial mater, Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> has raised legitimate reasons for the Court to reconsider\nits earlier release decision. As the Court has previously explained, it is well-established in this\nCircuit that although the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure do not expressly authorize a motion\nfor reconsideration, such motions are proper in criminal cases. See United States v. Christy, 739\nF.3d 534, 539 (loth Cir. 2ol4). A district court thus may amend its interlocutory orders prior to\nentry of final judgment. See, e.g., Van Skiver v. United States, 952 F.2d l24l, l243 (loth Cir.\n' All references to the transcript are to the draft copy.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool294", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001296.jpg": "CGaseel2l\\7/oroo 2artauivent Documdil B62 Fileeh662o6/PhgPage & 6656\n<span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> release in September of last year, it believed that he would only remain in pretrial\ndetention for three additional months until a December 7, 2o2o trial date. Doc. l94. As bad as\nthe pandemic had been to that point, the Court did not expect the federal judiciary to remain in a\nstate of near total suspension for another six months, requiring the trial to be continued twice more\nto the current April 5, 2o2l trial date. Second, when the Court denied Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> release last\nSeptember, it was under the impression that he would be able to meet with his atorneys in person\nin conference rooms at the Albuquerque courthouse, mitigating the Court’s concerns about the\ndefense team’s ability to effectively prepare for trial. See supra at 4. The Court’s impression on\nthat point turned out to be incorrect: due to concerns about inmates meeting with atorneys and\nthen bringing COVID-l9 back into the jails, the idea of unrestricted atorney-client meetings at\nthe Albuquerque courthouse was ultimately rejected. Third, the Court is nou able to impose\nsignificantly stricter conditions of release because of its ability to release Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> to La\nPasada Halfway House, an option with which it was not presented last September.\n\nI. Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s Release to La Pasada Halfway House Under Extremely Strict\nand Carefully Tailored Conditions Will Reasonably Assure His Appearance and\nthe Safety of the Community Under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e).\n\nOn the merits, the Court has thoroughly considered the parties’ arguments, the UPSO’s\nrecommendations, Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s Form l3 Presentence Investigation Report (PSR) and the\ninformation contained therein about his criminal history and prior performance on release, and the\napplicable law. Although the government’s concerns are understandable, the Court ultimately\nbelieves that it can reasonably assure Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s appearance and the safety of the community\nby releasing him to La Pasada Halfway House under a number of extremely strict and carefully\ntailored conditions.\n\nUnder l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e), a defendant must be released pending trial unless, after a\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooool296", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001297.jpg": "Gaseel2l\\7/oroo 2artauivient DocumMdil B62 Fileth62o6/PhgP aye of 6656\n\nhearing, a judicial officer finds that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably\nassure the defendant’s appearance as required and the safety of any other person and the\ncommunity. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The government bears the burden of proving flight risk by\na preponderance of the evidence and dangerousness to any other person or the community by clear\nand convincing evidence. United States v. Cisneros, 328 F.3d 6lo, 6l6 (loth Cir. 2oo3). A district\ncourt’s review of a Magistrate Judge’s order of detention is de novo. See Cisneros, 328 F.3d at\n6l6.\n\nSection 3l42(e)(2) creates a rebutable presumption that no condition or combinations of\nconditions exist to reasonably assure a defendant’s appearance or the safety of the community\nwhere there is probable cause to believe the defendant violated l8 U.S.C. § 924(c). See l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(e)(3)(B). As the Tenth Circuit has held:\n\nOnce the presumption is invoked, the burden of production shifts to the defendant.\n\nHouever, the burden of persuasion regarding risk-of-flight and danger to the\n\ncommunity always remains with the government. The defendant’s burden of\n\nproduction is not heavy, but some evidence must be produced. Even if a\n\ndefendant’s burden of production is met, the presumption remains a factor for\n\nconsideration by the district court in determining whether to release or detain.\nUnited States v. Stricklin, 932 F.2d l353, l354-55 (loth Cir. l99l).\n\nHere, although Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> is subject to a presumption of detention due to his § 924(c)\ncharge, see Doc. 86 at l—2, the Court finds that he has successfully rebuted the presumption. He\nhas produced evidence, for example, that he is not a danger to the community nor a flight risk\nbecause he voluntarily turned himself in on the instant offense, despite consistently maintaining\nhis innocence and knouing the extremely long prison sentence he faced if convicted. Doc. 274 at\n5. He has also produced evidence that he will not flee the jurisdiction due to his family’s presence\nhere. Jd. And he has produced evidence that his placement at La Pasada Halfway House is a\ncondition of release that could reasonably assure his appearance and the safety of the community.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool297", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001298.jpg": "Gaseel2l\\7 /oroo 2axtauivient DocumMdil B62 Fileth662o6/PhgPage & 6656\nDoc. 284 at 2-3. Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> has met his burden of production and has rebuted the presumption\nin § 3l42(e)(3)(B) that no condition or combination of conditions could meet the requirements for\nhis release.\n\nSection 3l42(g) then lays out the follouing factors for courts to consider: (l) the nature\nand circumstances of the offense charged, including whether the offense is a crime of violence, a\nviolation of § l59l, a Federal crime of terrorism, or involves a minor victim or a controlled\nsubstance, firearm, explosive, or destructive device; (2) the weight of the evidence against the\ndefendant; (3) the history and characteristics of the defendant; and (4) the nature and seriousness\nof the danger to any person or community that would be posed by the defendant’s release. l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nThe Court finds that although some of these factors weigh against Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s release,\nthey do not foreclose relief under the strict conditions the Court has imposed. With regard to the\nnature and circumstances of the offenses charged, they are extremely serious and involve Mr.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> allegedly shooting a victim, D.S., in retaliation for his cooperation with the government\nin an earlier criminal case. As the Court stated at the November 4, 2o2l pretrial conference, it\ntakes Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s charges extremely seriously because the ability of witnesses to come\nforward and safely provide information to the government, and to the Court, is at the core of our\ncriminal justice system.\n\nWith regard to the weight of the evidence against Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>, it is mixed. On the one\nhand, D.S. positively identified Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> as the person who shot him and at least one other\nwitness, N.F., has testified that Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> made incriminating statements in the weeks prior\nto the shooting. On the other hand, it appears that there were many people present at the time and\nplace of the shooting and there is evidence that D.S.’s identification of Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> could have\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- ooool298", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001299.jpg": "Gaseel2l\\7/oroo 2artauivient DocumMdil B62 Fileth662o6/PhgPage GF 6656\nbeen influenced by the suggestion of others, including his girlfriend at the time and the police who\ncame to question him in the hospital.\n\nWith regard to Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s history and characteristics, his history of violating past\nconditions of release is a source of concern, as the Court noted when denying him release last\nSeptember. See supra at 4. More specifically, Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s Form l3 PSR notes several\ninstances in which his probation was revoked for failure to comply with conditions of release.\nDoc. l88 at 8-lo. Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> also has several prior convictions. /d. Houever, as the defense\nhas pointed out, none of Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s probation revocations appear to have involved him\nabsconding; although he has convictions for illegal firearm possession, he does not have any\nconvictions for violent offenses; and he turned himself after being charged in the instant case. /d.;\nsee also Doc. 274 at 4-5.\n\nFinally, with regard to the nature and seriousness of the danger that would be posed to any\nperson or the community by Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s release, the Court understands the government’s\nconcerns given the frightening allegations in this case. Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> is presumed innocent on all\ncharges until proven guilty, houever. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42() (“Nothing in this section shall be\nconstrued as modifying or limiting the presumption of innocence.”). Presuming Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s\ninnocence in this case, while he is someone who has been convicted of gun and drug offenses and\nhas failed to comply with conditions of release in the past, he is not someone with a proven history\nof violent behavior.” Nor is the Court persuaded by the government’s vague suggestions that Mr.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> might have tried to contact or intimidate witnesses in this case because it has provided\nno concrete or specific evidence to substantiate any such claims. For example, the government’s\ncryptic report that witness N.F. was allegedly contacted by an unnamed individual about this case\n* While Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> does have prior arrests for violent offenses, these charges were all dismissed and are\ntherefore unproven allegations. See Doc. l88 at ll-l5.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooool299", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001300.jpg": "Casse :27-C€r-O2o48uMenIDicanehO3O@ 2File@ O2Io6/AIageage HO F5l6\nis not a valid reason to deny Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> release because the government has not come forward\nwith any details to corroborate N.F.’s account or to link Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> to the alleged contact.\n\nMore importantly, the Court has imposed a number of extremely strict and carefully\ntailored conditions of release that it believes will be more than sufficient to reasonably assure Mr.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s appearance and the safety of the community. Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> will be placed at La\nPasada Halfway House, where he will be on home incarceration with active GPS tracking, the\nstrictest form of location monitoring available to the Court. Doc. 3ol at 2. He will not be alloued\nto leave La Pasada for any reason other than to meet with his atorneys, and he will not be alloued\nto transport himself to those meetings; his atorneys will have to transport him. /d. He will not be\nalloued any visitors at La Pasada except for his atorneys. /d. He will not be alloued to use or\npossess a cellphone, nor to borrou anyone else’s cellphone. /d. He will not be alloued to use the\nlandline at La Pasada, except to speak to his atorneys. /d. He will not be alloued to have contact\nwith anyone other than his Pretrial Services officer and his atorneys. /d. That includes no contact\nwith his family members until he shous the Court that he is fully compliant with all of his\nconditions of release. /d. He will not be alloued to use or possess drugs or alcohol. /d. He will\nbe alloued to participate in counseling at La Pasada to help him cope with the stress of his looming\ntrial. Jd. He will be required to abide by all rules and regulations of the halfway house, houever\nsmall. Jd.\n\nThe Court believes that with all of these conditions, and under the close supervision of the\nstaff at La Pasada and his Pretrial Services officer, Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> will not pose a danger to the\ncommunity or a risk of flight. The Court also cautioned Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> at the February 4, 2o2l\npretrial conference that if he violates any of these conditions of release, the Court will not hesitate\nto reincarcerate him immediately. The Court accordingly finds that there are conditions, or a\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool3oo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001301.jpg": "Cass :27-CrO2o48 UMM nIDechMehD3OW 2FileoO2l66/A2adedge bi HFl6\ncombination of conditions, that will reasonably assure Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s appearance and the safety\nof any person and the community. His pretrial release is therefore required by l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e).\n\nlil. Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s Release is Necessary for the Preparation of His Trial Defense\nUnder l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(i).\n\nThe Court additionally finds that Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s release is necessary for the preparation\nof his trial defense under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(i). That section allous a judicial officer who issued an\norder of detention to, by subsequent order, “permit the temporary release of the person, in the\ncustody of a United States marshal or another appropriate person, to the extent that the judicial\nofficer determines such release to be necessary for preparation of the person’s defense or for\nanother compelling reason.” § 3l42(i).2 The defendant bears the burden of establishing their\nentitlement to temporary release under § 3l42(i). United States v. Clark, 448 F. Supp. 3d ll52,\nll55 (D. Kan. 2o2o) (citation omited). Courts considering whether pretrial release is necessary\nfor the preparation of the person’s defense have considered: “(l) [the] time and opportunity the\ndefendant has to prepare for the trial and to participate in his defense; (2) the complexity of the\ncase and volume of information; and (3) expense and inconvenience associated with preparing\nwhile incarcerated.” United States v. Boatwright, ---F. Supp. 3d---, No. 2:l9-CR-oo3ol-GMN-\nDJA, 2o2o WL l639855, at *4 (D. Nev. Apr. 2, 2o2o) (unreported) (citations omited).\n\nHere, all of those factors weigh in favor of release. Because Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s trial will be\nreset for April 5, 2o2l, he and his defense team have only two months left to prepare.\n> While the Court recognizes that Magistrate Judge Briones is the judicial officer that issued Mr.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s initial order of detention, this mater is before the Court on Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s request that the\nCourt review that detention order under l8 U.S.C. § 3l45(b). See Doc. 274 at l. The Tenth Circuit has not\nyet ruled on whether a request for temporary release under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(i) can only be decided by the\nMagistrate Judge that issued the initial order of detention. See United States v. Alderete, 336 F.R.D. 24o,\n268 (D.N.M. 2o2o). But at least one other federal district court has recently considered and granted pretrial\nrelease under that section. See United States v. Stephens, 447 F. Supp. 3d 63, 66-68 (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o)\n(Nathan, J.); but see Alderete, 336 F.R.D. at 268.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooool3ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001302.jpg": "Cass :27-Cr-O2o48 UMM nIDechmMehO3SO@) 2Fileo O2l66/Atadedge b? HI6\nComplicating maters further is the fact that both of Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s initial defense atorneys have\nrecently withdrawn from the case, and both of his current atorneys have been appointed within\nthe past six months (one in the last three weeks). The defense team therefore has a considerable\namount of catching up to do in a very short amount of time, and defense counsel need to\nimmediately begin meeting with Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> on a regular basis. The case is also complex and\nexceedingly serious. The government has named 24 witnesses on its most recent witness list [Doc.\nlo4] and the Court has issued upwards of 3o writen orders over the past three years of contentious\npretrial litigation in this case. And if Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> is convicted on all charges, he will be facing\ndecades in prison: according to his Form l3 PSR, Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s effective guidelines range\nwould be a staggering 4l2 to 485 months of imprisonment, or approximately 34 to 4o years. See\nDoc. l88 at l5.\n\nFinally, defense counsel explained at the recent pretrial conference that it will be\nimpossible for them to effectively prepare the case for trial with Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> in custody under\nthe current lockdoun conditions due to COVID-l9. In normal times, defense counsel can meet\nwith their clients face to face in meeting rooms at the jails, where they can review discovery and\ndo other critical trial preparation. Nou, houever, if the jails are allouing in-person client meetings\nat all, itis with the defendants separated from their counsel by a screen, making it nearly impossible\nto effectively review documentary evidence. And while defense counsel represented that the Santa\nFe County Detention Center is allouing video meetings by Zoom, it is hard to schedule Zoom time\ndue to the limited number of computer facilities at the jail and the number of parties vying for them\n(including this Court). Defense counsel also represented that while the Zoom meetings have been\nhelpful, the Detention Center has not alloued them to shou Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> documents by sharing\ntheir screen, requiring counsel to instead hold the documents up to their computer’s camera in the\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR- ooool3o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001303.jpg": "Cass4 :27-C€r-O2o48uMenIDichmehO3O@ 2File@ O2Io6/Alagedge HB l4l6\nhopes that Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> can see them that way.\n\nThis is no way to prepare for a trial. The defense team needs to be able to meet with Mr.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> in person, unobstructed by metal bars or a plexiglass barrier, to do the critical and time-\nconsuming work of reviewing discovery, evidence, and exhibits; discussing trial strategy; and\nmaking the countless decisions which individually and collectively can make the difference\nbetween a verdict of guilty and not guilty. Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s atorneys also need unobstructed\naccess to him to build the trust and confidence they need to effectively defend him at trial. They\nneed to meet with him for as long as they need to, as frequently as they need to, every day if\nnecessary. They cannot be at the mercy of the jail and its fluctuating visitation policies due to\nCOVID-l9. As the past twelve months have taught us, our prisons and jails are at constant risk of\nsevere outbreaks, which at times have required multi-week lockdouns to ensure the safety of the\nstaff and inmates. The defense also cannot be at the mercy of the Court or the United States\nMarshals Service because our policies have been in constant flux as well. None of this will provide\nMr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> the opportunity at a fair trial that he deserves and to which he is constitutionally\nentitled. Nor can he be made to sit in jail indefinitely, awaiting trial as a legally innocent man,\nuntil it is safe and practically possible for his atorneys to meet with him there. The status quo is\nno longer acceptable, and Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s release is necessary for the preparation of his defense.\n§ 3l42(l).\n\nIV. The Government Has Not Demonstrated Its Entitlement to Reconsideration or a\nStay.\n\nFinally, the Court is not persuaded by the government’s request for reconsideration or a\nstay pending appeal. See Doc. 298. In asking the Court to reconsider its order granting Mr.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> pretrial release, the government represents that it has obtained two new pieces of\ninformation follouing the pretrial conference at which the Court informed the parties of its release\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool3o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001304.jpg": "Casse :27-Cr-O2o48uMen (Dic anehO3OW 2File@ O2Io6/Alagedge b4 F5l6\ndecision. First, the government represents that, per the United States Marshal’s Service, “the\ninterview room at the courthouse can be made available for [Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>] to meet with his\natorneys to prepare for trial, for unlimited meetings and unlimited durations of meetings during\nbusiness hours, excepting only times when the Aspen courtroom is in use.” Doc. 298 at 2. There\nis a catch, houever: “There is a screen in the interview room, which will allou for appropriate\nsocial distancing between [Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>] and his lawyers.” Jd. Second, the government\nrepresents that “the Santa Fe jail is willing to provide an exception to the policy barring in-person\natorney visits, and will work to accommodate in-person visits between <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> and _ his\natorneys.” Id.\n\nWhile the Court appreciates the government’s effort in gathering information on these\nalternatives, they do not change its decision on release. First, the Court notes that the government\ncould have, and should have, presented this information earlier if it wanted the Court to rely on\nthese alternatives to deny release. Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> filed his motion for reconsideration on December\n2l, 2o2o. Doc. 274. The government had a month and a half to investigate alternatives and make\nits argument against release. It cannot wait until an unfavorable ruling to present additional\nevidence that it was capable of presenting in the first instance. A motion for reconsideration is\nfor presenting new evidence that was “previously unavailable.” Servants of Paraclete, 2o4 F.3d\nat lol2.\n\nSecond, the proposed alternatives are inadequate to address the trial preparation concerns\nthe Court has articulated. The proposal to use the interview room at the Santa Fe courthouse is\ninadequate because the room, by the government’s oun description, will still contain a “screen”\nbetween Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> and his atorneys. For all of the reasons set forth above, the defense team\ncannot effectively prepare for trial if they cannot sit next to Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> and go over documents\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool3o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001305.jpg": "Casse :27-Cr-O29o48uMen(DbcanehO3O 2Filee O2Io6/Alagedge o5 F5l6\n\nline by line in a way that is not possible through a screen. The fact that the interview room will be\nunavailable when the Aspen courtroom is in use is also unacceptable because the courtroom has\nbeen, and will be, in frequent use, just as it was when the parties in this case met all day for the\nDaubert hearing and pretrial conference on February 4. The Court’s calendar is also constantly\nshifting, meaning that the defense team will have litle to no ability to confidently predict when\nthey will be able to meet with Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>. The proposal involving the Santa Fe County\nDetention Center fares no beter. The government’s language is tellingly equivocal. First, it states\nthat “the Santa Fe jail is potentially willing to amend their policy that currently bars in-person\natorney visits in response to this Court’s concerns.” Doc. 298 at l (emphasis added). Later, the\ngovernment writes that the jail is willing to allou in-person meetings, but that it will “work to\naccommodate in-person visits between <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> and his atorneys.” /d. at 2 (emphasis added).\nRather than inspire confidence, the language of government’s motion reflects the high level of\nuncertainty that our jails have operated with over the last year. The truth remains that the Santa\nFe County Detention Center, like all jails, can still go into a full and indefinite lockdoun at any\ntime due to the continued spread of COVID-l9 (and potentially the virus’s recent and more\ninfectious variants). The Court also does not want to put the jail or the defense team at risk of\nCOVID-l9 because the jail feels compelled to deviate from what it believes are its best safety\npractices. Neither of the government’s proposals are adequate to provide Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> the\nconsistent and predictable in-person contact with his defense atorneys that he needs.\n\nFinally, the Court will not grant the requested stay pending appeal, as it noted in its earlier\nrelease order. Doc. 3oo. First, the government has failed to cite or apply the legal standard for\nsuch a stay. See D.N.M. Local R. Crim. P. 47.7 (“A motion, response or reply must cite authority\nin support of legal positions advanced.”). Second, the Court does not agree that the government\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool3o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014293.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 763 Filed o8/lo/22 Page l87 of l97 2728\nLCHCmax7\n\nl MS.

Doc. 274. The\ngovernment filed a response in opposition [Doc. 282] and Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> filed a reply [Doc. 284].\nThe United States Probation Office (USPO) also filed two memorandums addressing Mr.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s release.

It also explains its decision to deny the government’s\nAmended Emergency Motion for Reconsideration and Stay of Release Order. Doc. 298.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nMr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> is charged in a three-count superseding indictment with Obstruction of\nJustice by Retaliating Against a Witness, Victim, or Informant, in violation of l8 U.S.C.\n§ l5l3(a)(l)(B); Possessing and Discharging a Firearm in Furtherance of a Crime of Violence, in\nviolation of l8 U.S.C. § 924(c); and Felon in Possession of a Firearm and Ammunition, in violation\nof l8 U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(l) and 924. Doc. 86. The charges arise from his alleged act of shooting\nan individual named D.S. eight times in the early morning hours of September l2, 2ol7 in\nretaliation for D.S.’s cooperation with the federal government in a criminal case two years earlier.\nSee Doc. 38 at 2. Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> pled not guilty to the charges at an arraignment held on December\nll, 2ol7 [Doc. 9] and a trial in the case will be set for April 5, 2o2l, about two months from today.\n\nAlthough presumed innocent of all charges, Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> has been in pretrial detention\nin this case for over three years. He was arrested on December ll, 2ol7 and was ordered detained\nthe same day by Magistrate Judge B. Paul Briones after the Magistrate Judge found that no\ncondition or combination of conditions of release would reasonably assure the safety of the\ncommunity or his appearance in court. Doc. l2. Extensive pretrial litigation folloued until the\ncase was eventually ready and set for trial on March 23, 2o2o. Doc. 63. The Court held a pretrial\nconference on March lo, 2o2o and testimonial writs were issued. Docs. l27 and l43. Just days\nlater, houever, the devastating extent of the global COVID-l9 pandemic became clear and the\nChief Judge of the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico suspended all civil\nand criminal jury trials set for the follouing month. See In the Mater of: Court Operations in\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020211.jpg": "Cass4 27-o8,o284orMMt DoesutPAt BU l FROG O22o6/2ag Fagen’ 6l6\nLight of the Coronavirus Outbreak, 2o-MC-oooo4-9 (D.N.M. Mar. l3, 2o2o) (Johnson, C.J.).\nAlmost a full year later, jury trials remain suspended in the District of New Mexico. See Jn the\nMater of: Superseding Administrative Order 2o-MC-oooo4-49, 2l-MC-oooo4-o4 (D.N.M. Jan.\nl5, 2o2l) (Johnson, C.J.) (continuing the suspension of all civil and criminal jury trials through at\nleast February 28, 2o2l).\n\nIn the intervening ll months, Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> has remained in custody. During that time\nperiod, the Court set and then continued several trial dates due to the pandemic, including dates in\nDecember 2o2o and February 2o2l. See, e.g, Doc. 27l. Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s trial will nou be reset\nfor April 5, 2o2l, and the Court is hopeful that he will finally get his day in court after the extreme\nand unprecedented delay he has endured. Complicating maters, houever, is the fact that the\npandemic and the resulting passage of time has led to a recent and significant change in Mr.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s defense team: both of his original atorneys withdrew from the case in January of this\nyear. Doc. 295. As a result, the atorneys with which he will be going to trial in two months were\nappointed in September 2o2o and January 2o2l. Docs. l97 and 293. Although the Court would\nnot have granted the appointments if it were not sure that Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s new atorneys would be\nready for trial this April, they nevertheless face the daunting task of earning their client’s trust,\npreparing for trial, and reviewing three years’ worth of litigation in a mater of months.\n\nMr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> first asked the Court to consider his release in July of last year. Doc. l8l.\nHe argued that his continued pretrial detention posed a risk to his health because his compromised\nimmune system makes him especially vulnerable to serious illness or death from COVID-l9. Id.\nat 5. He also argued that there were conditions of release that would satisfy the requirements of\nthe Bail Reform Act, including the designation of his father as a third-party custodian. /d. at 9-\nlo. The Court took up the motion at a status conference held on September ll, 2o2o. It explained\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020212.jpg": "Cass4 27-o8,o284orMMt DoesutPAtl BOR l FROG O22o6/24g FAagend F6l6\n\nthat it was “very concerned” about the amount of time Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> had been in custody up to\nthat point, especially given that the already-minimal rehabilitative and mental health services in\njail had been further reduced by the pandemic. Transcript of September ll, 2o2o Status\nConference at 43-44.! The Court nevertheless found that it did not have any conditions available\nthat could reasonably assure Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s appearance or the safety of the community given his\nfailure to comply with conditions of release in the past. Jd. at 44-45. The Court also noted that\nwhile it was concerned about Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s ability to meet with his atorneys to prepare for trial\nduring the pandemic, it had been informed that the defense team would be able to meet in\nconference rooms in the federal courthouse in Albuquerque. Jd. at 45.\n\nMr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> nou asks the Court to reconsider its earlier decision denying him pretrial\nrelease. Doc. 274. As grounds for reconsideration, he points to the additional unforeseen trial\ncontinuances follouing the September status conference as well as new placement options,\nincluding the grandmother of his children and La Pasada Halfway House. /d.; see also Doc. 284\nat 2-3. The government opposes the requested reconsideration. Doc. 282.\n\nDISCUSSION\nl. Reconsideration is Proper on the Basis of New Evidence Previously Unavailable.\n\nAs an initial mater, Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> has raised legitimate reasons for the Court to reconsider\nits earlier release decision. As the Court has previously explained, it is well-established in this\nCircuit that although the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure do not expressly authorize a motion\nfor reconsideration, such motions are proper in criminal cases. See United States v. Christy, 739\nF.3d 534, 539 (loth Cir. 2ol4). A district court thus may amend its interlocutory orders prior to\nentry of final judgment. See, e.g., Van Skiver v. United States, 952 F.2d l24l, l243 (loth Cir.\n' All references to the transcript are to the draft copy.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2l2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020214.jpg": "Casse :27-o8,o284orMMt DoesumePAtl BOR l FROG O22o6 24g Aagee t6l6\n<span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> release in September of last year, it believed that he would only remain in pretrial\ndetention for three additional months until a December 7, 2o2o trial date. Doc. l94. As bad as\nthe pandemic had been to that point, the Court did not expect the federal judiciary to remain in a\nstate of near total suspension for another six months, requiring the trial to be continued twice more\nto the current April 5, 2o2l trial date. Second, when the Court denied Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> release last\nSeptember, it was under the impression that he would be able to meet with his atorneys in person\nin conference rooms at the Albuquerque courthouse, mitigating the Court’s concerns about the\ndefense team’s ability to effectively prepare for trial. See supra at 4. The Court’s impression on\nthat point turned out to be incorrect: due to concerns about inmates meeting with atorneys and\nthen bringing COVID-l9 back into the jails, the idea of unrestricted atorney-client meetings at\nthe Albuquerque courthouse was ultimately rejected. Third, the Court is nou able to impose\nsignificantly stricter conditions of release because of its ability to release Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> to La\nPasada Halfway House, an option with which it was not presented last September.\n\nI. Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s Release to La Pasada Halfway House Under Extremely Strict\nand Carefully Tailored Conditions Will Reasonably Assure His Appearance and\nthe Safety of the Community Under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e).\n\nOn the merits, the Court has thoroughly considered the parties’ arguments, the UPSO’s\nrecommendations, Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s Form l3 Presentence Investigation Report (PSR) and the\ninformation contained therein about his criminal history and prior performance on release, and the\napplicable law. Although the government’s concerns are understandable, the Court ultimately\nbelieves that it can reasonably assure Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s appearance and the safety of the community\nby releasing him to La Pasada Halfway House under a number of extremely strict and carefully\ntailored conditions.\n\nUnder l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e), a defendant must be released pending trial unless, after a\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2l4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020215.jpg": "Cased 27-o8,o284orMMt DoesutPAtl BU l FROG O22o6/2agFAageo’ 6l6\n\nhearing, a judicial officer finds that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably\nassure the defendant’s appearance as required and the safety of any other person and the\ncommunity. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The government bears the burden of proving flight risk by\na preponderance of the evidence and dangerousness to any other person or the community by clear\nand convincing evidence. United States v. Cisneros, 328 F.3d 6lo, 6l6 (loth Cir. 2oo3). A district\ncourt’s review of a Magistrate Judge’s order of detention is de novo. See Cisneros, 328 F.3d at\n6l6.\n\nSection 3l42(e)(2) creates a rebutable presumption that no condition or combinations of\nconditions exist to reasonably assure a defendant’s appearance or the safety of the community\nwhere there is probable cause to believe the defendant violated l8 U.S.C. § 924(c). See l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(e)(3)(B). As the Tenth Circuit has held:\n\nOnce the presumption is invoked, the burden of production shifts to the defendant.\n\nHouever, the burden of persuasion regarding risk-of-flight and danger to the\n\ncommunity always remains with the government. The defendant’s burden of\n\nproduction is not heavy, but some evidence must be produced. Even if a\n\ndefendant’s burden of production is met, the presumption remains a factor for\n\nconsideration by the district court in determining whether to release or detain.\nUnited States v. Stricklin, 932 F.2d l353, l354-55 (loth Cir. l99l).\n\nHere, although Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> is subject to a presumption of detention due to his § 924(c)\ncharge, see Doc. 86 at l—2, the Court finds that he has successfully rebuted the presumption. He\nhas produced evidence, for example, that he is not a danger to the community nor a flight risk\nbecause he voluntarily turned himself in on the instant offense, despite consistently maintaining\nhis innocence and knouing the extremely long prison sentence he faced if convicted. Doc. 274 at\n5. He has also produced evidence that he will not flee the jurisdiction due to his family’s presence\nhere. Jd. And he has produced evidence that his placement at La Pasada Halfway House is a\ncondition of release that could reasonably assure his appearance and the safety of the community.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2l5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020216.jpg": "Cass4 27-o8,o284orMMt DoesutPAt BO l FROG o22o6 /2agFages8 6l6\nDoc. 284 at 2-3. Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> has met his burden of production and has rebuted the presumption\nin § 3l42(e)(3)(B) that no condition or combination of conditions could meet the requirements for\nhis release.\n\nSection 3l42(g) then lays out the follouing factors for courts to consider: (l) the nature\nand circumstances of the offense charged, including whether the offense is a crime of violence, a\nviolation of § l59l, a Federal crime of terrorism, or involves a minor victim or a controlled\nsubstance, firearm, explosive, or destructive device; (2) the weight of the evidence against the\ndefendant; (3) the history and characteristics of the defendant; and (4) the nature and seriousness\nof the danger to any person or community that would be posed by the defendant’s release. l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nThe Court finds that although some of these factors weigh against Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s release,\nthey do not foreclose relief under the strict conditions the Court has imposed. With regard to the\nnature and circumstances of the offenses charged, they are extremely serious and involve Mr.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> allegedly shooting a victim, D.S., in retaliation for his cooperation with the government\nin an earlier criminal case. As the Court stated at the November 4, 2o2l pretrial conference, it\ntakes Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s charges extremely seriously because the ability of witnesses to come\nforward and safely provide information to the government, and to the Court, is at the core of our\ncriminal justice system.\n\nWith regard to the weight of the evidence against Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>, it is mixed. On the one\nhand, D.S. positively identified Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> as the person who shot him and at least one other\nwitness, N.F., has testified that Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> made incriminating statements in the weeks prior\nto the shooting. On the other hand, it appears that there were many people present at the time and\nplace of the shooting and there is evidence that D.S.’s identification of Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> could have\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2l6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020217.jpg": "Cased :27-o8,o284orMMt DoesutPAtl BO l FROG O22o6 24g Fagecd F6l6\nbeen influenced by the suggestion of others, including his girlfriend at the time and the police who\ncame to question him in the hospital.\n\nWith regard to Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s history and characteristics, his history of violating past\nconditions of release is a source of concern, as the Court noted when denying him release last\nSeptember. See supra at 4. More specifically, Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s Form l3 PSR notes several\ninstances in which his probation was revoked for failure to comply with conditions of release.\nDoc. l88 at 8-lo. Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> also has several prior convictions. /d. Houever, as the defense\nhas pointed out, none of Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s probation revocations appear to have involved him\nabsconding; although he has convictions for illegal firearm possession, he does not have any\nconvictions for violent offenses; and he turned himself after being charged in the instant case. /d.;\nsee also Doc. 274 at 4-5.\n\nFinally, with regard to the nature and seriousness of the danger that would be posed to any\nperson or the community by Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s release, the Court understands the government’s\nconcerns given the frightening allegations in this case. Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> is presumed innocent on all\ncharges until proven guilty, houever. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42() (“Nothing in this section shall be\nconstrued as modifying or limiting the presumption of innocence.”). Presuming Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s\ninnocence in this case, while he is someone who has been convicted of gun and drug offenses and\nhas failed to comply with conditions of release in the past, he is not someone with a proven history\nof violent behavior.” Nor is the Court persuaded by the government’s vague suggestions that Mr.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> might have tried to contact or intimidate witnesses in this case because it has provided\nno concrete or specific evidence to substantiate any such claims. For example, the government’s\ncryptic report that witness N.F. was allegedly contacted by an unnamed individual about this case\n* While Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> does have prior arrests for violent offenses, these charges were all dismissed and are\ntherefore unproven allegations. See Doc. l88 at ll-l5.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020218.jpg": "Cdsest P7-creo 2atauivient DecuMdl BA62 Filkeh62/o6/Phg Pao diol66l6\nis not a valid reason to deny Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> release because the government has not come forward\nwith any details to corroborate N.F.’s account or to link Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> to the alleged contact.\n\nMore importantly, the Court has imposed a number of extremely strict and carefully\ntailored conditions of release that it believes will be more than sufficient to reasonably assure Mr.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s appearance and the safety of the community. Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> will be placed at La\nPasada Halfway House, where he will be on home incarceration with active GPS tracking, the\nstrictest form of location monitoring available to the Court. Doc. 3ol at 2. He will not be alloued\nto leave La Pasada for any reason other than to meet with his atorneys, and he will not be alloued\nto transport himself to those meetings; his atorneys will have to transport him. /d. He will not be\nalloued any visitors at La Pasada except for his atorneys. /d. He will not be alloued to use or\npossess a cellphone, nor to borrou anyone else’s cellphone. /d. He will not be alloued to use the\nlandline at La Pasada, except to speak to his atorneys. /d. He will not be alloued to have contact\nwith anyone other than his Pretrial Services officer and his atorneys. /d. That includes no contact\nwith his family members until he shous the Court that he is fully compliant with all of his\nconditions of release. /d. He will not be alloued to use or possess drugs or alcohol. /d. He will\nbe alloued to participate in counseling at La Pasada to help him cope with the stress of his looming\ntrial. Jd. He will be required to abide by all rules and regulations of the halfway house, houever\nsmall. Jd.\n\nThe Court believes that with all of these conditions, and under the close supervision of the\nstaff at La Pasada and his Pretrial Services officer, Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> will not pose a danger to the\ncommunity or a risk of flight. The Court also cautioned Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> at the February 4, 2o2l\npretrial conference that if he violates any of these conditions of release, the Court will not hesitate\nto reincarcerate him immediately. The Court accordingly finds that there are conditions, or a\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020219.jpg": "Cdsest P7-creo 2axtauivient DecuMdl BA62 Filke662o6/Phg Peoye dill66l6\ncombination of conditions, that will reasonably assure Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s appearance and the safety\nof any person and the community. His pretrial release is therefore required by l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e).\n\nlil. Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s Release is Necessary for the Preparation of His Trial Defense\nUnder l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(i).\n\nThe Court additionally finds that Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s release is necessary for the preparation\nof his trial defense under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(i). That section allous a judicial officer who issued an\norder of detention to, by subsequent order, “permit the temporary release of the person, in the\ncustody of a United States marshal or another appropriate person, to the extent that the judicial\nofficer determines such release to be necessary for preparation of the person’s defense or for\nanother compelling reason.” § 3l42(i).2 The defendant bears the burden of establishing their\nentitlement to temporary release under § 3l42(i). United States v. Clark, 448 F. Supp. 3d ll52,\nll55 (D. Kan. 2o2o) (citation omited). Courts considering whether pretrial release is necessary\nfor the preparation of the person’s defense have considered: “(l) [the] time and opportunity the\ndefendant has to prepare for the trial and to participate in his defense; (2) the complexity of the\ncase and volume of information; and (3) expense and inconvenience associated with preparing\nwhile incarcerated.” United States v. Boatwright, ---F. Supp. 3d---, No. 2:l9-CR-oo3ol-GMN-\nDJA, 2o2o WL l639855, at *4 (D. Nev. Apr. 2, 2o2o) (unreported) (citations omited).\n\nHere, all of those factors weigh in favor of release. Because Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s trial will be\nreset for April 5, 2o2l, he and his defense team have only two months left to prepare.\n> While the Court recognizes that Magistrate Judge Briones is the judicial officer that issued Mr.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s initial order of detention, this mater is before the Court on Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s request that the\nCourt review that detention order under l8 U.S.C. § 3l45(b). See Doc. 274 at l. The Tenth Circuit has not\nyet ruled on whether a request for temporary release under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(i) can only be decided by the\nMagistrate Judge that issued the initial order of detention. See United States v. Alderete, 336 F.R.D. 24o,\n268 (D.N.M. 2o2o). But at least one other federal district court has recently considered and granted pretrial\nrelease under that section. See United States v. Stephens, 447 F.

The defense team therefore has a considerable\namount of catching up to do in a very short amount of time, and defense counsel need to\nimmediately begin meeting with Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> on a regular basis. The case is also complex and\nexceedingly serious. The government has named 24 witnesses on its most recent witness list [Doc.\nlo4] and the Court has issued upwards of 3o writen orders over the past three years of contentious\npretrial litigation in this case. And if Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> is convicted on all charges, he will be facing\ndecades in prison: according to his Form l3 PSR, Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s effective guidelines range\nwould be a staggering 4l2 to 485 months of imprisonment, or approximately 34 to 4o years. See\nDoc. l88 at l5.\n\nFinally, defense counsel explained at the recent pretrial conference that it will be\nimpossible for them to effectively prepare the case for trial with Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> in custody under\nthe current lockdoun conditions due to COVID-l9. In normal times, defense counsel can meet\nwith their clients face to face in meeting rooms at the jails, where they can review discovery and\ndo other critical trial preparation. Nou, houever, if the jails are allouing in-person client meetings\nat all, itis with the defendants separated from their counsel by a screen, making it nearly impossible\nto effectively review documentary evidence. And while defense counsel represented that the Santa\nFe County Detention Center is allouing video meetings by Zoom, it is hard to schedule Zoom time\ndue to the limited number of computer facilities at the jail and the number of parties vying for them\n(including this Court). Defense counsel also represented that while the Zoom meetings have been\nhelpful, the Detention Center has not alloued them to shou Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> documents by sharing\ntheir screen, requiring counsel to instead hold the documents up to their computer’s camera in the\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o22o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020221.jpg": "CdSest P7-creo 2axtauivient DecuMdi BA62 Filkeh62/o6/Phg Pee di3l66l6\nhopes that Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> can see them that way.\n\nThis is no way to prepare for a trial. The defense team needs to be able to meet with Mr.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> in person, unobstructed by metal bars or a plexiglass barrier, to do the critical and time-\nconsuming work of reviewing discovery, evidence, and exhibits; discussing trial strategy; and\nmaking the countless decisions which individually and collectively can make the difference\nbetween a verdict of guilty and not guilty. Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s atorneys also need unobstructed\naccess to him to build the trust and confidence they need to effectively defend him at trial. They\nneed to meet with him for as long as they need to, as frequently as they need to, every day if\nnecessary. They cannot be at the mercy of the jail and its fluctuating visitation policies due to\nCOVID-l9. As the past twelve months have taught us, our prisons and jails are at constant risk of\nsevere outbreaks, which at times have required multi-week lockdouns to ensure the safety of the\nstaff and inmates. The defense also cannot be at the mercy of the Court or the United States\nMarshals Service because our policies have been in constant flux as well. None of this will provide\nMr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> the opportunity at a fair trial that he deserves and to which he is constitutionally\nentitled. Nor can he be made to sit in jail indefinitely, awaiting trial as a legally innocent man,\nuntil it is safe and practically possible for his atorneys to meet with him there. The status quo is\nno longer acceptable, and Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>’s release is necessary for the preparation of his defense.\n§ 3l42(l).\n\nIV. The Government Has Not Demonstrated Its Entitlement to Reconsideration or a\nStay.\n\nFinally, the Court is not persuaded by the government’s request for reconsideration or a\nstay pending appeal. See Doc. 298. In asking the Court to reconsider its order granting Mr.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> pretrial release, the government represents that it has obtained two new pieces of\ninformation follouing the pretrial conference at which the Court informed the parties of its release\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o22l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020222.jpg": "Cdsest P7-creo 2atauivient DecumMdl B62 Filkeh62/o6/Phg Pee di4l66l6\ndecision. First, the government represents that, per the United States Marshal’s Service, “the\ninterview room at the courthouse can be made available for [Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>] to meet with his\natorneys to prepare for trial, for unlimited meetings and unlimited durations of meetings during\nbusiness hours, excepting only times when the Aspen courtroom is in use.” Doc. 298 at 2. There\nis a catch, houever: “There is a screen in the interview room, which will allou for appropriate\nsocial distancing between [Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>] and his lawyers.” Jd. Second, the government\nrepresents that “the Santa Fe jail is willing to provide an exception to the policy barring in-person\natorney visits, and will work to accommodate in-person visits between <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> and _ his\natorneys.” Id.\n\nWhile the Court appreciates the government’s effort in gathering information on these\nalternatives, they do not change its decision on release. First, the Court notes that the government\ncould have, and should have, presented this information earlier if it wanted the Court to rely on\nthese alternatives to deny release. Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> filed his motion for reconsideration on December\n2l, 2o2o. Doc. 274. The government had a month and a half to investigate alternatives and make\nits argument against release. It cannot wait until an unfavorable ruling to present additional\nevidence that it was capable of presenting in the first instance. A motion for reconsideration is\nfor presenting new evidence that was “previously unavailable.” Servants of Paraclete, 2o4 F.3d\nat lol2.\n\nSecond, the proposed alternatives are inadequate to address the trial preparation concerns\nthe Court has articulated. The proposal to use the interview room at the Santa Fe courthouse is\ninadequate because the room, by the government’s oun description, will still contain a “screen”\nbetween Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> and his atorneys. For all of the reasons set forth above, the defense team\ncannot effectively prepare for trial if they cannot sit next to Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> and go over documents\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2o222", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020223.jpg": "CdSest P7-creo 2axtauivent DecyMdl BA62 Filke62o6/PhgPeye di5l66l6\n\nline by line in a way that is not possible through a screen. The fact that the interview room will be\nunavailable when the Aspen courtroom is in use is also unacceptable because the courtroom has\nbeen, and will be, in frequent use, just as it was when the parties in this case met all day for the\nDaubert hearing and pretrial conference on February 4. The Court’s calendar is also constantly\nshifting, meaning that the defense team will have litle to no ability to confidently predict when\nthey will be able to meet with Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span>. The proposal involving the Santa Fe County\nDetention Center fares no beter. The government’s language is tellingly equivocal. First, it states\nthat “the Santa Fe jail is potentially willing to amend their policy that currently bars in-person\natorney visits in response to this Court’s concerns.” Doc. 298 at l (emphasis added). Later, the\ngovernment writes that the jail is willing to allou in-person meetings, but that it will “work to\naccommodate in-person visits between <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> and his atorneys.” /d. at 2 (emphasis added).\nRather than inspire confidence, the language of government’s motion reflects the high level of\nuncertainty that our jails have operated with over the last year. The truth remains that the Santa\nFe County Detention Center, like all jails, can still go into a full and indefinite lockdoun at any\ntime due to the continued spread of COVID-l9 (and potentially the virus’s recent and more\ninfectious variants). The Court also does not want to put the jail or the defense team at risk of\nCOVID-l9 because the jail feels compelled to deviate from what it believes are its best safety\npractices. Neither of the government’s proposals are adequate to provide Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Robertson</span> the\nconsistent and predictable in-person contact with his defense atorneys that he needs.\n\nFinally, the Court will not grant the requested stay pending appeal, as it noted in its earlier\nrelease order. Doc. 3oo. First, the government has failed to cite or apply the legal standard for\nsuch a stay. See D.N.M. Local R. Crim. P. 47.7 (“A motion, response or reply must cite authority\nin support of legal positions advanced.”). Second, the Court does not agree that the government\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o223"};
