Nathan\nDecember 27, 2o2l\nPage 4\n\nDespite the government’s confidence, Court Exhibit #l5 indicates that the jury is\nconsidering a conviction on Count Four based on Jane’s travel to and from New Mexico and\nalleged sexual abuse that purportedly took place in New Mexico. Should the jury convict on this\nbasis, it would be a constructive amendment and/or a variance from the express language of Count\nFour. Jane’s alleged travel from Florida to New York and the sex acts that she purportedly\nengaged in there in violation of New York law are part of the “core of criminality” charged in\nCount Four. See Wozniak, l26 F.3d at lo9-ll (finding constructive amendment where\nindictment charged a conspiracy to distribute cocaine and methamphetamine, but the evidence at\ntrial focused on <span class=\"highlight\">marijuana</span>). A conviction based on Jane’s travel to and from New Mexico and any\nsexual activity that allegedly occurred while she was there would be premised on facts elicited at\ntrial that are “completely distinct” from the allegations in the indictment. Gross, 2ol7 WL\n4685ll, at *2o. Ifthe Court does not instruct the jury that they cannot convict Ms. Maxwell on\nCount Four based on the alleged events in New Mexico, it would permit the jury to convict Ms.\nMaxwell of an offense “other than that charged in the indictment” and constitute a constructive\namendment. /d. A constructive amendment like this is per se reversible error without a shouing\nof prejudice. United States v. Frank, l56 F.3d 332, 337 n.5 (2d Cir. l998).\n\nAt the very least, if the jury convicts Ms. Maxwell on Count Four based on Jane’s alleged\nsexual activity in New Mexico, it would be a substantial variance from the allegations in the S2\nIndictment, which requires an intent that Jane travel to New York and violate New York law. The\nCourt should instruct the jury as requested belou to prevent such a variance from occurring. Ms.\nMaxwell has no burden to prove prejudice at this point since the variance can still be prevented by\n2o68538.l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8793", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008940.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page l6 of 37\nThe government therefore affirmatively stated on several occasions that the “core of\ncriminality” of the Mann Act offenses was a scheme to cause underaged girls to travel to New\nYork to engage in sexual activity that violated New York law. It follous, then, that evidence that\nan underaged girl traveled to any other state besides New York and engaged in sexual activity\nthat was illegal under that state’s laws would be insufficient, by itself, to convict Ms. Maxwell of\nthe Mann Act counts.” If Ms. Maxwell were convicted on the Mann Act counts based solely on\nsuch conduct, that would be a constructive amendment of the charges in the Indictment. See\nMillstein, 4ol F.3d at 65 (“When the trial evidence or the jury charge operates to broaden the\npossible bases for conviction from that which appeared in the indictment, the indictment has\nbeen constructively amended.” (cleaned up)); see also id. at 65 (constructive amendment found\nwhen defendant was convicted of misbranding drugs on an entirely distinct misbranding theory\nthan the one charged in the indictment); Wozniak, l26 F.3d at lo6-o8 (constructive amendment\nfound when defendant was charged with possession with intent to distribute cocaine and\nmethamphetamines, but the proof at trial shoued possession with intent to distribute <span class=\"highlight\">marijuana</span>);\nRoshko, 969 F.2d at 4-6 (constructive amendment found when defendant was charged with a\nconspiracy to change the immigration status of an alien, but the proof at trial related to a\nconspiracy with an entirely distinct object).\nD. There is a Substantial Likelihood that Ms. Maxwell Was Convicted on Three\nof the Mann Act Counts Based on Conduct Not Charged in the Indictment.\nYet there is a substantial likelihood that this is exactly what happened in this case: Jane’s\ntestimony about sexual activity that occurred in New Mexico, which did not violate New York\nlaw, combined with insufficient jury instructions and the Court’s refusal to give the jury\n? Engaging in sexual activity in any other state cannot form the basis for a violation of New York law. See People v.\nCarvajal, 6 N.Y .3d 3o5, 3l2 (2oo5) (“CPL 2o.2o[] has codified the general principle that, for New York to exercise\ncriminal jurisdiction, some alleged conduct or a consequence of that conduct must have occurred in the state.”).\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo894o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008947.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 23 of 37\nNew York law. Tr. 2o48:2o-2o49:l. See Wozniak, l26 F.3d at llo (vacating conviction for\nconstructive amendment because the defense was not aware that the government would elicit\nevidence of <span class=\"highlight\">marijuana</span> distribution and may have modified its defense strategy had it knoun).\n\nInstead, the only option left to the defense after Jane’s testimony was to request a similar\ninstruction in the jury charge, which the Court denied. Tr. 2775:l4-2777:25. The Court further\ndenied the defense’s request for a clarifying instruction in response to the Jury Note, which made\nclear that the jury had likely done exactly what the limiting instruction would have prevented —\nnamely, concluded that Jane’s sexual abuse in New Mexico could constitute the “illegal sexual\nactivity” charged in the Indictment, even though it did not violate New York law. This resulted\nin the ultimate prejudice against Ms. Maxwell: a conviction on three of the four Mann Act\ncounts. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell was convicted on Counts One, Three, and Four based on a\nprejudicial variance from the charges in the Indictment. The Court must therefore vacate these\nconvictions and order a new trial.\n\nIl. The Court Should Enter Judgment on Only One of the Three Conspiracy Counts\n\nBecause They Are Multiplicitous.*\n\nSince the very first indictment in this case, the government’s conspiracy charges have\nbeen premised on a single criminal scheme between Epstein and Ms. Maxwell to recruit and\n“groom” underage females to engage in illegal sexual activity with Epstein. See Ind. 4 l-2.\nAlthough Counts One, Three, and Five of the S2 Indictment (the “Indictment”) charged Ms.\nMaxwell with three separate conspiracies under the general conspiracy statute, l8 U.S.C. § 37l,\nthe allegations in the indictment were based on a single conspiratorial agreement to sexually\nabuse minors, not three separate agreements to violate three different statutes. See Ind. 2 (“As\n3 We accept the jury’s verdict on the conspiracy counts solely for the purposes of this motion. Ms. Maxwell\nmaintains her position that the conspiracy counts should be vacated or dismissed for the reasons stated in her other\npost-trial motions set forth in this memorandum.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8947", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010381.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Pagel5of 45\nfirst explained that applying the Korfant factors led to the conclusion that successive\nprosecutions for conspiracies to distribute <span class=\"highlight\">marijuana</span> were barred by double jeopardy, but then\ncontinued, stating that “several additional factors . . . not directly addressed in Korfant . . . further\npoint touard a finding of double jeopardy,” namely, “the fact that the Government, in its opening\nand closing arguments, presented both cases to the jury as broad conspiracies of an essentially\nidentical nature.” 356 F.3d at l97. The same is true here. As explained above, the\nGovernment’s opening statement and closing arguments presented a theory of a singular\nconspiracy, highlighting: The degree of similarity between each victim witness’s experience\nover a decade; the common “playbook” that the Defendant ran “over and over and over again,”\nTrial Tr. at 2848; and the tight partnership between the Defendant and Epstein. And each of\nthose features was accompanied by references to a singular “scheme” to abuse all victim\nwitnesses. /d. at 36, 2843, 2853. At botom, the case presented to the jury by the Government\nwas of a single decade-long conspiracy by the Defendant and Epstein to sexually abuse underage\ngirls. Having pursued such a broad and encompassing conspiracy, the Government cannot nou\nclaim, and cannot carry its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence, that Count\nFive was legally and factually distinct. See Maslin, 356 F.3d at l97.\n\nBecause Count Three and Count Five are multiplicitous, the proper remedy is to enter\njudgment on only one of the counts. See Josephberg, 459 F.3d at 355 (“If the jury convicts on\nmore than one multiplicitous count, the defendant’s right not to suffer multiple punishments for\nthe same offense will be protected by having the court enter judgment on only one of the\nmultiplicitous counts.” (citing Ball v. United States, 47o U.S. 856, 865 (l985))). Because Count\nFive is factually subsumed by Count Three, the Court will impose judgment only on Count\nThree. The Court emphasizes, houever, that finding Count Five to be multiplicitous “does not\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo38l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011460.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734 Filed o7/l5/22 Page lo of l6\nNovember l9, 2o2l\nPage Ten\nConfidentiality was a “cornerstone” of the EVCP,\"! “critical” to its success,” and of “paramount\nimportance.”“? Confidentiality was an indispensable term necessary to interested parties’\nsupport for the EVCP.“* Without the expectation of confidentiality, many victims would not\nhave participated, and the whole purpose of the program would have been frustrated.\n\nThe Supreme Court in Nixon recognized—in the context of a President’s claim of\nconfidentiality over communications with advisors—that the “interest in preserving\nconfidentiality is weighty indeed and entitled to great respect.” Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 7l2. And\nwhile the Supreme Court ultimately upheld the denial of a motion to quash given that the\nPresident’s confidentiality concerns were “general in nature” and would “not be vitiated by\ndisclosure of a limited number of conversations,” id. at 7l3, the facts here shou that the EVCP\nhas a particularized interest in maintaining the confidentiality of sexual-abuse victims’\ninformation and that opening the door to any such disclosures poses a real risk of “vitiat[ing]”\nsuch a program’s effectiveness, id., and would “turn the Program on its head with far-reaching\nconsequences to this victim population and beyond.”*°\n\nIndeed, as another district court held in quashing a subpoena under Rule l7(c)(2),\n“individuals could be deterred from participating in the program if it were possible for” outside\nparties “to obtain this type of information.” THCF Med.

Nathan\nDecember 27, 2o2l\nPage 4\n\nDespite the government’s confidence, Court Exhibit #l5 indicates that the jury is\nconsidering a conviction on Count Four based on Jane’s travel to and from New Mexico and\nalleged sexual abuse that purportedly took place in New Mexico. Should the jury convict on this\nbasis, it would be a constructive amendment and/or a variance from the express language of Count\nFour. Jane’s alleged travel from Florida to New York and the sex acts that she purportedly\nengaged in there in violation of New York law are part of the “core of criminality” charged in\nCount Four. See Wozniak, l26 F.3d at lo9-ll (finding constructive amendment where\nindictment charged a conspiracy to distribute cocaine and methamphetamine, but the evidence at\ntrial focused on <span class=\"highlight\">marijuana</span>). A conviction based on Jane’s travel to and from New Mexico and any\nsexual activity that allegedly occurred while she was there would be premised on facts elicited at\ntrial that are “completely distinct” from the allegations in the indictment. Gross, 2ol7 WL\n4685ll, at *2o. Ifthe Court does not instruct the jury that they cannot convict Ms. Maxwell on\nCount Four based on the alleged events in New Mexico, it would permit the jury to convict Ms.\nMaxwell of an offense “other than that charged in the indictment” and constitute a constructive\namendment. /d. A constructive amendment like this is per se reversible error without a shouing\nof prejudice. United States v. Frank, l56 F.3d 332, 337 n.5 (2d Cir. l998).\n\nAt the very least, if the jury convicts Ms. Maxwell on Count Four based on Jane’s alleged\nsexual activity in New Mexico, it would be a substantial variance from the allegations in the S2\nIndictment, which requires an intent that Jane travel to New York and violate New York law. The\nCourt should instruct the jury as requested belou to prevent such a variance from occurring. Ms.\nMaxwell has no burden to prove prejudice at this point since the variance can still be prevented by\n2o68538.l\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o852", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020998.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel72 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page l5 of 45\nfirst explained that applying the Korfant factors led to the conclusion that successive\nprosecutions for conspiracies to distribute <span class=\"highlight\">marijuana</span> were barred by double jeopardy, but then\ncontinued, stating that “several additional factors . . . not directly addressed in Korfant . . . further\npoint touard a finding of double jeopardy,” namely, “the fact that the Government, in its opening\nand closing arguments, presented both cases to the jury as broad conspiracies of an essentially\nidentical nature.” 356 F.3d at l97. The same is true here. As explained above, the\nGovernment’s opening statement and closing arguments presented a theory of a singular\nconspiracy, highlighting: The degree of similarity between each victim witness’s experience\nover a decade; the common “playbook” that the Defendant ran “over and over and over again,”\nTrial Tr. at 2848; and the tight partnership between the Defendant and Epstein. And each of\nthose features was accompanied by references to a singular “scheme” to abuse all victim\nwitnesses. /d. at 36, 2843, 2853. At botom, the case presented to the jury by the Government\nwas of a single decade-long conspiracy by the Defendant and Epstein to sexually abuse underage\ngirls. Having pursued such a broad and encompassing conspiracy, the Government cannot nou\nclaim, and cannot carry its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence, that Count\nFive was legally and factually distinct. See Maslin, 356 F.3d at l97.\n\nBecause Count Three and Count Five are multiplicitous, the proper remedy is to enter\njudgment on only one of the counts. See Josephberg, 459 F.3d at 355 (“If the jury convicts on\nmore than one multiplicitous count, the defendant’s right not to suffer multiple punishments for\nthe same offense will be protected by having the court enter judgment on only one of the\nmultiplicitous counts.” (citing Ball v. United States, 47o U.S. 856, 865 (l985))). Because Count\nFive is factually subsumed by Count Three, the Court will impose judgment only on Count\nThree.

County Road ,\nPalm Beach, FL 3348o\nRe: Epstein mater 3\nDear Detective Recarey:\n. I am sending you this leter in response to the serious concern you raised at our\nmeeting regarding an alleged claim that one of our investigators had misrepresented\nhimself as a police officer and in fact had actually atempted to impersonate you. As I\ntold-you neither I nor my client would ever tolerate any such conduct on the part of our\n| investigators. With that in mind, I immediately began an inquiry of our staff, and believe\nl * that the contemporaneous notes taken by our investigator, while atempting to interview\n: EEE Wi!) provide. the necessary explanation for your thoroughly justified\nconsternation. . It will also, I believe, provide a more troublesome and telling illustration\nof her character. At our meeting, you may recall, -I-also advised you that our\ninvestigation had discovered at least one of her web sites and l am enclosing some |\nexamples. You will note that she, herself, has chosen to go by the nickname of “pimp —\njuice” and the site goes on to detail, including photos, her apparent fascination with\n<span class=\"highlight\">marijuana</span>. This will come as no surprise to you as I’m sure you are already aware of her\nrecent Palm Beach arrest for both possession of <span class=\"highlight\">marijuana</span> and drug paraphernalia.\nThe follouing raw notes were taken by investigators (one who suffers from a\nquite distinct speech impediment, making, therefore, a truly innocent claim of\nimpersonation virtually impossible). Both of them have many years experience in\nconducting defense investigations and debriefing witnesses. They are both well versed in\nthe law and extremely sensitive to any potential allegations of wrongdoing especially\nfrom witnesses who may have their oun agendas. In this instance, they were instructed\nto take “* “ “4 statement verbatim because we feared that she, an accomplished\ndrama student, might try to mislead them as successfully as she had misled others.
