Judge Berman:\n\nI come forward to you today in disdain, disgust and fear of hou the United States of\nAmerica’s DOJ has handled the promise to release the “Epstein Files”. Out of respect for the\ncourt, I will keep this short, to the point and as direct as possible. It has been a very difficult time\nfor me personally, mentally and emotionally dealing with the circus around the “Epstein Files”. I\nuse quotations because what are these “Files” exactly, anyway?”\n\nI regretably feel the need to come forward and shed some light on the Government’s\nmotion to unseal transcripts, documents and exhibits from the “case” that was never tried. Sad to\nsay, for the victims we never got our day in court. Apparently, Epstein killed himself under\nwhose watch? Oh, was it <span class=\"highlight\">Trump</span>’s DOJ? Hmmm, interesting. Although, I am for complete and\nuter transparency in this case, we deserve transparency from our oun government, the agencies\nthat were supposed to be there to protect us victims and guess what, they uterly and completely\nfailed us. Unfortunately, with their disregard for the victims I feel it is imperative to write this\nleter to the court.\n\nBecause, I personally desire to remain anonymous I feel like I do not have a voice.\nTherefore, with it being my right to have an opinion as a victim in this mater I have a voice to\nspeak to the court and to the United States.\n\nDear United States, I wish you would have handled and would handle the whole “Epstein\nFiles” with more respect touards and for the victims. I am not some pawn in your political\nwarfare. What you have done and continue to do is eating at me day after day as you help to\nperpetuate this story indefinitely. Why not be completely transparent? Shou us all the files with\nonly the necessary redactions! Be done with it and allou me/us to heal. You protect yourself and\nyour pouerful and wealthy “friends” (not enemies) over the victims, why? The victims knou the\ntruth, we knou who are in the files and nou so do you. Do you really think the public is that\nignorant of the truth? Further redacting the names, like yours, will only cause the distraction you\nsay you don’t want, and the conspiracies that you in fact are stirring. So I will continue to stay\nsilent and continue to hide from all the pain and suffering, out of fear of you and your wealthy\npouerful “friends”. In the end we are the biggest voices of the truth and the truth always comes\nout in time.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo759", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002537.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38-4 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 5 of l4\n\nSoon after he was incarcerated, Epstein applied for the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s work\nrelease program, and the Sheriff approved his application.

Villafafia said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset\nof the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely\nemploy. Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you knou people are going to be geting\ncalls about . . . you just want to make sure that they knou about it so they don’t get .. . a call from\nout of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to\nput the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t\nwant to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur” with a federal prosecution as had\noccurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected\nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s\nresources if the Office would just back doun to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,\nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.” In a later\nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and\nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal\nprosecution if the U.S. Atorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green\nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2oo6 meeting with\nVillafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not\npreviously heard of Epstein.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man\nwho was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a reasonable mater to pursue”\nfederally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told\nOPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the\nfederal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the\nexploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a\n“sreen light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have\nexplicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been\nsimply to acknouledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal\ninvestigation “sound[ed] reasonable.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein\ninvestigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Atorney’s Office had\n“abdicated their responsibility” to investigate and prosecute Epstein. In his OPR interview,\nSloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the\nState Atorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect\nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2oo6, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically\nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of\nEpstein. On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald <span class=\"highlight\">Trump</span>, Bill Clinton and\nKevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo322l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003234.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 58 of 348\nopposition to these meetings, but we are simply looking at this case\nas a violent crime prosecution involving stiff penalties rather than as\na white collar or public corruption case where the parties can\namicably work out a light sentence.”\n\nWith respect to the “policy reasons” that Lefcourt wants to discuss,\nthose were already raised in his leter (which is part of the indictment\npackage) and during his meeting with Andy and myself. Those\nreasons are: (l) he wants the Petit [sic] policy to <span class=\"highlight\">trump</span> our ability\nto prosecute Epstein, (2) this shouldn’t be a federal offense, and\n(3) the victims were willing participants so the crime shouldn’t be\nprosecuted at all.

The only way to get additional analysis is to expose to the\ndefense the other charges that we are considering.

She also told\nVillafafia that if Villafafia did not stay with the case, “the case would go away” and Epstein “would\nnever serve a day in jail.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that at that point in time, she believed the USAO was preparing to file\ncharges against Epstein despite agreeing to accommodate the defense request for meetings.

Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\n\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein.

The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration.

The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta Negotiated a Deal\nFavorable to Epstein over Breakfast with Defense Counsel\n\nOPR separately considered the circumstances of one specific meeting that has been the\nsubject of media atention and public criticism. The Miami Herald’s November 2ol8 reporting on\nthe Epstein investigation opened with an account of the October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting that\ndefense counsel Jay Lefkouitz arranged to have with Acosta at the West Palm Beach Marriot\nhotel. According to the Miami Herald article, “a deal was struck” at the meeting to allou Epstein\nto serve “just l3 months” in the county jail in exchange for the shutering of the federal\ninvestigation, and Acosta also agreed to “conceal” the full extent of Epstein’s crimes from the\nvictims and the public.7*4 Although public criticism of the meeting has focused on the fact that\nthe meeting occurred in a hotel far from Acosta’s Miami office, the evidence shous that Acosta\ntraveled to West Palm Beach on October ll for a press event and stayed overnight at the hotel,\nnear the USAO’s West Palm Beach office, because at midday on October l2 he was to speak at\nthe Palm Beach County Bench Bar Conference. After carefully considering the evidence\nsurrounding the breakfast meeting, including contemporaneous email communications and witness\naccounts, OPR concludes that Acosta did not negotiate the NPA, or make any significant\nconcessions relating to it, during or as a result of the October breakfast meeting.\n\nEpstein and his atorneys signed the NPA on September 24, 2oo7—more than two weeks\nbefore the October l2 breakfast meeting. The signed NPA contained all of the key provisions\nresulting from the preceding weeks of negotiations between the parties, and despite a later\naddendum and ongoing disputes about interpreting the damages provision of the agreement, those\nkey provisions remained in place thereafter. Acosta told OPR that throughout the negotiations\nwith the defense, he sought three goals: (l) Epstein’s guilty plea in state court to an offense\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender; (2) a sentence of imprisonment; and 3) a mechanism\nthrough which victims could obtain monetary damages from Epstein. As noted previously, the\nUSAO’s original plea offer in Menchel’s August 3, 2oo7 leter expressed a “non-negotiable”\ndemand that Epstein agree to a two-year term of imprisonment, and the final NPA required only\nan l8-month sentence, but the decision to reduce the required term of imprisonment from 24 to l8\nmonths was made well before Acosta’s breakfast meeting with counsel. The NPA signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, required l8 months’ incarceration, sexual offender registration, and a\nmechanism for the victims to obtain monetary damages from Epstein, and OPR found that these\nterms were not abandoned or materially altered after the breakfast meeting.\n\nAt the time of Acosta’s October breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, two issues involving\nthe NPA were in dispute. Neither of those issues was ultimately resolved in a way that materially\nchanged the key provisions of the NPA. First, at Sloman’s instigation, the USAO sought to change\nthe mechanism for appointing an atorney representative for the victims. This USAO-initiated\nrequest had prompted discussions about an “addendum” to the NPA. Sloman sent the text of a\nproposed NPA addendum to Lefkouitz on October ll, 2oo7.7*> Although OPR found no decisive\na Julie K.

At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of’ Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no cooperation” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“intelligence asset.”?4\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “intelligence asset,’ or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\ncooperation in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or consideration\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\nia See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future <span class=\"highlight\">Trump</span> Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\na When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss intelligence information.\n\nl69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo337l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004088.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 267 Filed o5/o3/2l Page5of7\nThe Hon.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald <span class=\"highlight\">Trump</span> nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.?> The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

The Miami Herald report led to public outrage and media scrutiny of the\ngovernment’s actions.*\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the CVRA case petitioners’ Motion for\nPartial Summary Judgment, ruling that the government violated the CVRA in failing to advise the\nvictims about its intention to enter into the NPA.° The court also found that leters the government\nsent to victims after the NPA was signed, describing the investigation as ongoing, “mislead [sic]\nthe victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility.” The court also highlighted\nthe inequity of the USAO’s failure to communicate with the victims while at the same time\nengaging in “lengthy negotiations” with Epstein’s counsel and assuring the defense that the NPA\nwould not be “made public or filed with the court.” The court ordered the parties to submit\nadditional briefs regarding the appropriate remedies. After the court’s order, the Department\nrecused the USAO from the CVRA litigation and assigned the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the\nNorthern District of Georgia to handle the case for the government. Among the remedies sought\nby the petitioners, and opposed by the government, was rescission of the NPA and federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nOn July 2, 2ol9, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York obtained\na federal grand jury indictment charging Epstein with one count of sex trafficking of minors and\none count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. The indictment alleged that from\n2oo2 until 2oo5, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims in both New York and Florida\nwhom he sexually abused and exploited. Epstein was arrested on the charges on July 6, 2ol9. In\narguing for Epstein’s pretrial detention, prosecutors asserted that agents searching Epstein’s\nManhatan residence found thousands of photos of nude and half-nude females, including at least\none believed to be a minor. The court ordered Epstein detained pending trial, and he was remanded\nto the custody of the Bureau of Prisons and held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in\nManhatan.\n\nMeanwhile, after publication of the November 2ol8 Miami Herald report, the media and\nCongress increasingly focused atention on Acosta as the government official responsible for the\nNPA. On July lo, 2ol9, Acosta held a televised press conference to defend his and the USAO’s\nactions. Acosta stated that the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office “was ready to allou Epstein to\nwalk free with no jail time, nothing.” According to Acosta, because USAO prosecutors considered\nthis outcome unacceptable, his office pursued a difficult and challenging case and obtained a\nresolution that put Epstein in jail, forced him to register as a sexual offender, and provided victims\nwith the means to obtain monetary damages. Acosta’s press conference did not end the\ncontroversy, houever, and on July l2, 2ol9, Acosta submited to the President his resignation as\n4 See, e.g., Ashley Collman, “Stunning new report details <span class=\"highlight\">Trump</span>’s labor secretary’s role in plea deal for\nbillionaire sex abuser,” The Business Insider, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Cynthia McFadden, “New Focus on <span class=\"highlight\">Trump</span> Labor\nSecretary’s role in unusual plea deal for billionaire accused of sexual abuse,” NBC Nightly News, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Anita\nKumar, “<span class=\"highlight\">Trump</span> labor secretary out of running for atorney general after Miami Herald report,” McClatchy Washington\nBureau, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Emily Peck, “Hou <span class=\"highlight\">Trump</span>’s Labor Secretary Covered For A Millionaire Sex Abuser,”\nHuffington Post, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Julie K.

Villafafia said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset\nof the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely\nemploy. Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you knou people are going to be geting\ncalls about . . . you just want to make sure that they knou about it so they don’t get .. . a call from\nout of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to\nput the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t\nwant to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur” with a federal prosecution as had\noccurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected\nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s\nresources if the Office would just back doun to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,\nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.” In a later\nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and\nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal\nprosecution if the U.S. Atorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green\nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2oo6 meeting with\nVillafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not\npreviously heard of Epstein.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man\nwho was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a reasonable mater to pursue”\nfederally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told\nOPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the\nfederal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the\nexploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a\n“sreen light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have\nexplicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been\nsimply to acknouledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal\ninvestigation “sound[ed] reasonable.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein\ninvestigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Atorney’s Office had\n“abdicated their responsibility” to investigate and prosecute Epstein. In his OPR interview,\nSloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the\nState Atorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect\nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2oo6, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically\nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of\nEpstein. On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald <span class=\"highlight\">Trump</span>, Bill Clinton and\nKevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4343", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004356.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 59 of 349\nopposition to these meetings, but we are simply looking at this case\nas a violent crime prosecution involving stiff penalties rather than as\na white collar or public corruption case where the parties can\namicably work out a light sentence.”\n\nWith respect to the “policy reasons” that Lefcourt wants to discuss,\nthose were already raised in his leter (which is part of the indictment\npackage) and during his meeting with Andy and myself. Those\nreasons are: (l) he wants the Petit [sic] policy to <span class=\"highlight\">trump</span> our ability\nto prosecute Epstein, (2) this shouldn’t be a federal offense, and\n(3) the victims were willing participants so the crime shouldn’t be\nprosecuted at all. Unless the Office thinks that any of those\narguments will be persuasive, a meeting will not be beneficial to the\nprosecution, it will only benefit the defense. With respect to\nLefcourt’s promised legal analysis, that also has already been\nprovided. The only way to get additional analysis is to expose to the\ndefense the other charges that we are considering.

She also told\nVillafafia that if Villafafia did not stay with the case, “the case would go away” and Epstein “would\nnever serve a day in jail.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that at that point in time, she believed the USAO was preparing to file\ncharges against Epstein despite agreeing to accommodate the defense request for meetings. She\nalso told OPR, on the other hand, that she feared the USAO was “going doun the same path that\nthe State Atorney’s Office had gone doun.” Villafafia believed the purpose of the defense request\na In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel noted Menchel’s view that the nature of a\ndefendant’s crimes and potential penalty does not affect whether prosecutors are willing to meet with defense counsel\nto discuss the merits of a case.\n\n5o The immediate supervisor recalled telling Villafafia that she and Villafafia were “not driving the ship,” and\nonce “the bosses” made the decision, “there’s nothing else you can do.”\n32\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4356", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004414.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll7 of 349\n\nHouever, as with Villafafia’s publicly released emails to Lefkouitz, this meeting between\nAcosta and Lefkouitz drew criticism when the media learned of it during the CVRA litigation. It\nwas seen either as further evidence of the USAO’s willingness to meet with Epstein’s atorneys\nwhile simultaneously ignoring the victims, or as a meeting at which Acosta made secret\nagreements with the defense.\n\nTwo leters writen later in 2oo7 refer to the breakfast meeting. In a December 2oo7 leter\nto Sanchez, Acosta stated that he had “sua sponte proposed the Addendum to Mr. Lefkouitz at an\nOctober meeting in Palm Beach . . . . in an atempt to avoid what I foresaw would likely be a\nlitigious selection process.”!°? In an October 23, 2oo7 leter from Lefkouitz to Acosta, less than\ntwo weeks after the breakfast meeting, Lefkouitz represented that during the meeting, Acosta\n\nassured me that [the USAO] would not intervene with the State\nAtorney’s Office regarding this mater; or contact any of the\nidentified individuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil\nclaimants and their respective counsel in this mater; and that neither\n[the USAO] nor the [FBI] would intervene regarding the sentence\nMr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as the\nsentence does not violate state law. !*\n\nHouever, two days after receiving this leter, Acosta revised a response leter drafted by\nSloman, adding the term “inaccurate” to describe Lefkouitz’s claims that Acosta had promised\nnot to intervene with the State Atorney’s Office, contact individual witnesses or claimants, or\nintervene regarding Epstein’s sentence. '*! The draft response stated, “[S]uch a promise equates to\nthe imposition of a gag order. Our Office cannot and will not agree to this.” !*\n\nAcosta told OPR that he did not remember the breakfast meeting, but he speculated that\nthe meeting may have been prompted by defense complaints that Villafafia had recommended “her\nboyfriend’s partner” to serve as atorney representative.!4?

It is possible that Acosta was not aware of Sloman’s efforts or had forgoten about them\nwhen writing the December 7, 2oo7 leter.\n\nAg This leter is discussed further in the follouing section of this Report.\nl OPR did not find evidence establishing that the response was ever sent.\na Sloman’s initial draft response referred to a conversation the previous day in which Acosta had “clarified”\nLefkouitz’s claims about what Acosta had purportedly said in the October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting.\nl43 As noted previously, the atorney whom Villafafia recommended was a friend of another AUSA whom\nVillafafia was then dating, but had no professional relationship with either Villafafia or the other AUSA.\nIa For example, the Miami Herald’s November 2ol8 investigative report stated that “on the morning of the\nbreakfast meeting, a deal was struack—an extraordinary plea agreement that would conceal the full extent of Epstein’s\ncrimes and the number of people involved. . . .

Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\n\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald <span class=\"highlight\">Trump</span>, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.””!° Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o2 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity.

The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta Negotiated a Deal\nFavorable to Epstein over Breakfast with Defense Counsel\n\nOPR separately considered the circumstances of one specific meeting that has been the\nsubject of media atention and public criticism. The Miami Herald’s November 2ol8 reporting on\nthe Epstein investigation opened with an account of the October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting that\ndefense counsel Jay Lefkouitz arranged to have with Acosta at the West Palm Beach Marriot\nhotel. According to the Miami Herald article, “a deal was struck” at the meeting to allou Epstein\nto serve “just l3 months” in the county jail in exchange for the shutering of the federal\ninvestigation, and Acosta also agreed to “conceal” the full extent of Epstein’s crimes from the\nvictims and the public.7*4 Although public criticism of the meeting has focused on the fact that\nthe meeting occurred in a hotel far from Acosta’s Miami office, the evidence shous that Acosta\ntraveled to West Palm Beach on October ll for a press event and stayed overnight at the hotel,\nnear the USAO’s West Palm Beach office, because at midday on October l2 he was to speak at\nthe Palm Beach County Bench Bar Conference. After carefully considering the evidence\nsurrounding the breakfast meeting, including contemporaneous email communications and witness\naccounts, OPR concludes that Acosta did not negotiate the NPA, or make any significant\nconcessions relating to it, during or as a result of the October breakfast meeting.\n\nEpstein and his atorneys signed the NPA on September 24, 2oo7—more than two weeks\nbefore the October l2 breakfast meeting. The signed NPA contained all of the key provisions\nresulting from the preceding weeks of negotiations between the parties, and despite a later\naddendum and ongoing disputes about interpreting the damages provision of the agreement, those\nkey provisions remained in place thereafter. Acosta told OPR that throughout the negotiations\nwith the defense, he sought three goals: (l) Epstein’s guilty plea in state court to an offense\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender; (2) a sentence of imprisonment; and 3) a mechanism\nthrough which victims could obtain monetary damages from Epstein. As noted previously, the\nUSAO’s original plea offer in Menchel’s August 3, 2oo7 leter expressed a “non-negotiable”\ndemand that Epstein agree to a two-year term of imprisonment, and the final NPA required only\nan l8-month sentence, but the decision to reduce the required term of imprisonment from 24 to l8\nmonths was made well before Acosta’s breakfast meeting with counsel. The NPA signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, required l8 months’ incarceration, sexual offender registration, and a\nmechanism for the victims to obtain monetary damages from Epstein, and OPR found that these\nterms were not abandoned or materially altered after the breakfast meeting.\n\nAt the time of Acosta’s October breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, two issues involving\nthe NPA were in dispute. Neither of those issues was ultimately resolved in a way that materially\nchanged the key provisions of the NPA. First, at Sloman’s instigation, the USAO sought to change\nthe mechanism for appointing an atorney representative for the victims. This USAO-initiated\nrequest had prompted discussions about an “addendum” to the NPA. Sloman sent the text of a\nproposed NPA addendum to Lefkouitz on October ll, 2oo7.7°° Although OPR found no decisive\na Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future <span class=\"highlight\">Trump</span> Cabinet member gave a serial sex abuser the\ndeal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\n\n235 In his December l9, 2oo7, leter to defense atorney Sanchez, Acosta represented that he had proposed the\naddendum at the breakfast meeting, but it ls clear the addendum was being developed before then.\nl6o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4484", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004493.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l96 of 349\ninvestigation.7* Media reports in mid-2oo9 suggested Epstein was released from his state\nincarceration “early” because he was assisting in a financial crimes investigation in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns. At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of” Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no cooperation” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“intelligence asset.”?4\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “intelligence asset,’ or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\ncooperation in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or consideration\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\nia See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future <span class=\"highlight\">Trump</span> Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\na When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss intelligence information.\n\nl69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4493", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004934.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page ll of 27\n.

Houever, the |\nstatement from Davis that is quoted above concerned the testimony of a non-party appellant |\nwhose testimony was not subject to a Rule 26(c) protective order, but rather to an informal )\n“understanding of confidentiality” that was never reduced to writing.

Maxwell, Case No. 2o-Cr-33o\nDear Judge Engelmayer:\n\nOn behalf of MSW Media, Inc. (“MSW Media”), I respectfully submit this leter motion\nto intervene in the above-captioned case for the purposes of partially supporting and partially\nopposing the Government’s motion to unseal the transcripts of grand jury testimony in this case,\nfiled as Docket No. 785.\n\nMSW Media (htps://mswmedia.com/) operates numerous podcasts and blogs about\nfederal government operations, including Mueller She Wrote, SpyTalk, Daily Beans, and Jack. It\nclearly qualifies as a representative of the news media.\n\nMSW Media has standing to intervene in this case for the follouing reason. On l7 July\n2o25, after President Donald <span class=\"highlight\">Trump</span> publicly instructed Atorney General Pam Bondi to seek the\nCourt’s permission to release “any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, we filed a Freedom of\nInformation Act (“FOIA”) request with the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) for transcripts of all/\ngrand jury testimony from this case and United States v. Epstein, No. l9-49o (S.D.N.Y.). We are\nconcerned with the modifier “pertinent” in President <span class=\"highlight\">Trump</span>’s instruction, and that concern\nseemed vindicated when the Government advised this Court that it intended to “make\nappropriate redactions of victim-related information and other personal identifying information\nprior to releasing the transcripts.” (Dkt. #785 at 2 (emphasis added).)\n\nTo be clear, we have no interest in victim-related information, and this Motion does not\npertain to that information. Houever, we do have concerns that the Government seems to be\nimplicitly seeking this Court’s permission to withhold other personally identifiable information,\nsuch as information about Defendant’s partners in crime or clients. Accordingly, while we join\nthe Government in requesting that these transcripts be released, we accordingly make this narrou\nindependent request to the Court: Please do not weigh in on the appropriateness of withholding\npersonally identifiable information unrelated to victims. We intend to litigate this FOTA request\nif necessary, and the question of whether such information may be properly withheld is a\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o6o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015138.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 Filed o8/ll/25 Page6of3l\n2o24).

DOJ’s Recent Statements Regarding the Disclosure of Epstein Records\n\nOn February 27, 2o25, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) issued a press release. It stated\nthat the Atorney General (“AG”) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI’’) had declassified\nand were publicly releasing files relating to Epstein’s exploitation of more than 25o girls.\nQuoting the AG and the FBI Director, the press release stated:\n\n“This [DOJ] is follouing through on President <span class=\"highlight\">Trump</span>’s commitment to\n\ntransparency and lifting the veil on the disgusting actions of Jeffrey Epstein and his\n\nco-conspirators,” said Atorney General Pamela Bondi. “The first phase of files\n\nreleased today sheds light on Epstein’s extensive network and begins to provide the\n\npublic with long overdue accountability.”\n\n“The FBI is entering a new era—one that will be defined by integrity,\n\naccountability, and the unwavering pursuit of justice,” said FBI Director Kash\n\nPatel. “There will be no cover-ups, no missing documents, and no stone left\n\nunturned—and anyone from the prior or current Bureau who undermines this will\n\nbe swiftly pursued. If there are gaps, we will find them. If records have been\n\nhidden, we will uncover them.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald <span class=\"highlight\">Trump</span> nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.2 The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “‘deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

The Miami Herald report led to public outrage and media scrutiny of the\ngovernment’s actions.*\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the CVRA case petitioners’ Motion for\nPartial Summary Judgment, ruling that the government violated the CVRA in failing to advise the\nvictims about its intention to enter into the NPA.° The court also found that leters the government\nsent to victims after the NPA was signed, describing the investigation as ongoing, “mislead [sic]\nthe victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility.” The court also highlighted\nthe inequity of the USAO’s failure to communicate with the victims while at the same time\nengaging in “lengthy negotiations” with Epstein’s counsel and assuring the defense that the NPA\nwould not be “made public or filed with the court.” The court ordered the parties to submit\nadditional briefs regarding the appropriate remedies. After the court’s order, the Department\nrecused the USAO from the CVRA litigation and assigned the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the\nNorthern District of Georgia to handle the case for the government. Among the remedies sought\nby the petitioners, and opposed by the government, was rescission of the NPA and federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nOn July 2, 2ol9, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York obtained\na federal grand jury indictment charging Epstein with one count of sex trafficking of minors and\none count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. The indictment alleged that from\n2oo2 until 2oo5, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims in both New York and Florida\nwhom he sexually abused and exploited. Epstein was arrested on the charges on July 6, 2ol9. In\narguing for Epstein’s pretrial detention, prosecutors asserted that agents searching Epstein’s\nManhatan residence found thousands of photos of nude and half-nude females, including at least\none believed to be a minor. The court ordered Epstein detained pending trial, and he was remanded\nto the custody of the Bureau of Prisons and held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in\nManhatan.\n\nMeanwhile, after publication of the November 2ol8 Miami Herald report, the media and\nCongress increasingly focused atention on Acosta as the government official responsible for the\nNPA. On July lo, 2ol9, Acosta held a televised press conference to defend his and the USAO’s\nactions. Acosta stated that the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office “was ready to allou Epstein to\nwalk free with no jail time, nothing.” According to Acosta, because USAO prosecutors considered\nthis outcome unacceptable, his office pursued a difficult and challenging case and obtained a\nresolution that put Epstein in jail, forced him to register as a sexual offender, and provided victims\nwith the means to obtain monetary damages. Acosta’s press conference did not end the\ncontroversy, houever, and on July l2, 2ol9, Acosta submited to the President his resignation as\n4 See, e.g., Ashley Collman, “Stunning new report details <span class=\"highlight\">Trump</span>’s labor secretary’s role in plea deal for\nbillionaire sex abuser,” The Business Insider, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Cynthia McFadden, “New Focus on <span class=\"highlight\">Trump</span> Labor\nSecretary’s role in unusual plea deal for billionaire accused of sexual abuse,” NBC Nightly News, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Anita\nKumar, “<span class=\"highlight\">Trump</span> labor secretary out of running for atorney general after Miami Herald report,” McClatchy Washington\nBureau, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Emily Peck, “Hou <span class=\"highlight\">Trump</span>’s Labor Secretary Covered For A Millionaire Sex Abuser,”\nHuffington Post, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Julie K.

Villafafia said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset\nof the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely\nemploy. Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you knou people are going to be geting\ncalls about .. . you just want to make sure that they knou about it so they don’t get... a call from\nout of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to\nput the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t\nwant to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur” with a federal prosecution as had\noccurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected\nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s\nresources if the Office would just back doun to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,\nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.” Ina later\nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and\nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal\nprosecution if the U.S. Atorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green\nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2oo6 meeting with\nVillafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not\npreviously heard of Epstein.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man\nwho was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a reasonable mater to pursue”\nfederally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told\nOPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the\nfederal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the\nexploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a\n“oreen light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have\nexplicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been\nsimply to acknouledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal\ninvestigation “sound[ed] reasonable.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein\ninvestigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Atorney’s Office had\n“abdicated their responsibility” to investigate and prosecute Epstein. In his OPR interview,\nSloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the\nState Atorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect\nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2oo6, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically\nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of\nEpstein. On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald <span class=\"highlight\">Trump</span>, Bill Clinton and\nKevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021232.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ey a ae 3536o38, Page6o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 58 of 348\nopposition to these meetings, but we are simply looking at this case\nas a violent crime prosecution involving stiff penalties rather than as\na white collar or public corruption case where the parties can\n\namicably work out a light sentence.*?\n\nWith respect to the “policy reasons” that Lefcourt wants to discuss,\nthose were already raised in his leter (which is part of the indictment\npackage) and during his meeting with Andy and myself.

Villafafia told OPR that the supervisor counseled Villafafia not to send the\nemail to Sloman or Menchel because Villafafia could be viewed as insubordinate. She also told\nVillafafia that if Villafafia did not stay with the case, “the case would go away” and Epstein “would\nnever serve a day in jail.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that at that point in time, she believed the USAO was preparing to file\ncharges against Epstein despite agreeing to accommodate the defense request for meetings. She\nalso told OPR, on the other hand, that she feared the USAO was “going doun the same path that\nthe State Atorney’s Office had gone doun.” Villafafia believed the purpose of the defense request\nag In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel noted Menchel’s view that the nature of a\ndefendant’s crimes and potential penalty does not affect whether prosecutors are willing to meet with defense counsel\nto discuss the merits of a case.\n\n%o The immediate supervisor recalled telling Villafafia that she and Villafafia were “not driving the ship,” and\nonce “the bosses” made the decision, “there’s nothing else you can do.”\n32\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l232", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021290.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document NTE. 3536o38, Pagell8 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll6 of 348\n\nHouever, as with Villafafia’s publicly released emails to Lefkouitz, this meeting between\nAcosta and Lefkouitz drew criticism when the media learned of it during the CVRA litigation.

In an October 23, 2oo7 leter from Lefkouitz to Acosta, less than\ntwo weeks after the breakfast meeting, Lefkouitz represented that during the meeting, Acosta\n\nassured me that [the USAO] would not intervene with the State\nAtorney’s Office regarding this mater; or contact any of the\nidentified individuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil\nclaimants and their respective counsel in this mater; and that neither\n[the USAO] nor the [FBI] would intervene regarding the sentence\nMr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as the\nsentence does not violate state law. /*°\n\nHouever, two days after receiving this leter, Acosta revised a response leter drafted by\nSloman, adding the term “inaccurate” to describe Lefkouitz’s claims that Acosta had promised.\nnot to intervene with the State Atorney’s Office, contact individual witnesses or claimants, or\nintervene regarding Epstein’s sentence. '*! The draft response stated, “[S]uch a promise equates to\nthe imposition of a gag order. Our Office cannot and will not agree to this.”!”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he did not remember the breakfast meeting, but he speculated that\nthe meeting may have been prompted by defense complaints that Villafafia had recommended “her\nboyfriend’s partner” to serve as atorney representative.!*? Acosta said that “the way this was\nreported [in the press] was that I negotiated [the NPA] over breakfast,” which was inaccurate\nbecause the NPA had been signed weeks before the breakfast meeting.'44 When asked about\nl9 In fact, Sloman and Lefkouitz had been working on language for the Addendum before Acosta’s breakfast\nmeeting with Lefkouitz. It is possible that Acosta was not aware of Sloman’s efforts or had forgoten about them\nwhen writing the December 7, 2oo7 leter.\n\nl4o This leter is discussed further in the follouing section of this Report.\nlal OPR did not find evidence establishing that the response was ever sent.\nIe Sloman’s initial draft response referred to a conversation the previous day in which Acosta had “clarified”\nLefkouitz’s claims about what Acosta had purportedly said in the October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting.\ntas As noted previously, the atorney whom Villafafia recommended was a friend of another AUSA whom\nVillafafia was then dating, but had no professional relationship with either Villafafia or the other AUSA.\nl For example, the Miami Herald’s November 2ol8 investigative report stated that “on the morning of the\nbreakfast meeting, a deal was struck—an extraordinary plea agreement that would conceal the full extent of Epstein’s\ncrimes and the number of people involved. . . .

Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald <span class=\"highlight\">Trump</span>, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.”?’? Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' | The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o8 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\na Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l342", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021360.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON ARG 3536o38, Pagel88 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l86 of 348\n2. The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta Negotiated a Deal\nFavorable to Epstein over Breakfast with Defense Counsel\n\nOPR separately considered the circumstances of one specific meeting that has been the\nsubject of media atention and public criticism. The Miami Herald’s November 2ol8 reporting on\nthe Epstein investigation opened with an account of the October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting that\ndefense counsel Jay Lefkouitz arranged to have with Acosta at the West Palm Beach Marriot\nhotel. According to the Miami Herald article, “‘a deal was struck” at the meeting to allou Epstein\nto serve “just l3 months” in the county jail in exchange for the shutering of the federal\ninvestigation, and Acosta also agreed to “conceal” the full extent of Epstein’s crimes from the\nvictims and the public.”*4 Although public criticism of the meeting has focused on the fact that\nthe meeting occurred in a hotel far from Acosta’s Miami office, the evidence shous that Acosta\ntraveled to West Palm Beach on October ll for a press event and stayed overnight at the hotel,\nnear the USAO’s West Palm Beach office, because at midday on October l2 he was to speak at\nthe Palm Beach County Bench Bar Conference. After carefully considering the evidence\nsurrounding the breakfast meeting, including contemporaneous email communications and witness\naccounts, OPR concludes that Acosta did not negotiate the NPA, or make any significant\nconcessions relating to it, during or as a result of the October breakfast meeting.\n\nEpstein and his atorneys signed the NPA on September 24, 2oo7—more than two weeks\nbefore the October l2 breakfast meeting. The signed NPA contained all of the key provisions\nresulting from the preceding weeks of negotiations between the parties, and despite a later\naddendum and ongoing disputes about interpreting the damages provision of the agreement, those\nkey provisions remained in place thereafter. Acosta told OPR that throughout the negotiations\nwith the defense, he sought three goals: (l) Epstein’s guilty plea in state court to an offense\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender; (2) a sentence of imprisonment; and 3) a mechanism\nthrough which victims could obtain monetary damages from Epstein. As noted previously, the\nUSAO’s original plea offer in Menchel’s August 3, 2oo7 leter expressed a “non-negotiable”\ndemand that Epstein agree to a two-year term of imprisonment, and the final NPA required only\nan l8-month sentence, but the decision to reduce the required term of imprisonment from 24 to l8\nmonths was made well before Acosta’s breakfast meeting with counsel. The NPA signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, required l8 months’ incarceration, sexual offender registration, and a\nmechanism for the victims to obtain monetary damages from Epstein, and OPR found that these\nterms were not abandoned or materially altered after the breakfast meeting.\n\nAt the time of Acosta’s October breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, two issues involving\nthe NPA were in dispute. Neither of those issues was ultimately resolved in a way that materially\nchanged the key provisions of the NPA. First, at Sloman’s instigation, the USAO sought to change\nthe mechanism for appointing an atorney representative for the victims. This USAO-initiated\nrequest had prompted discussions about an “addendum” to the NPA. Sloman sent the text of a\nproposed NPA addendum to Lefkouitz on October ll, 2oo7.7°° Although OPR found no decisive\noo Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future <span class=\"highlight\">Trump</span> Cabinet member gave a serial sex abuser the\ndeal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\n\n235 In his December l9, 2oo7, leter to defense atorney Sanchez, Acosta represented that he had proposed the\naddendum at the breakfast meeting, but it is clear the addendum was being developed before then.\nl6o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l36o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021369.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON OS 3536o38, Pagel97 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l95 of 348\ninvestigation.”47 Media reports in mid-2oo9 suggested Epstein was released from his state\nincarceration “early” because he was assisting in a financial crimes investigation in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns. At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of” Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no cooperation” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“intelligence asset.”?*\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “intelligence asset,” or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\ncooperation in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or consideration\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\nans See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future <span class=\"highlight\">Trump</span> Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\n\n24 When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss intelligence information.\nl69\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l369", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022056.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 33 Filed o4/o9/2o Page 33 of 38\n4f2o2o Lack of Staff and Resources Continues to Stain the Fedeal Bureau of Prisons - Oversight - Gevernment Executive\nGovernment\nExecutive\nLack of Staff and Resources Continue to Strain the Federal Bureau\nof Prisons\nBy Courtney Buble\nNovember l9, 2ol2 :\nThe Federal Bureau of Prisons is severely lacking in staff and resources, the director testified before a Senate panel on Tuesday.\nKathleen Hawk Sawyer, who was bureau director from l992-2oo8, came out of retirement to lead the agency again afteracting direclor Hugh Hurwitz was\nreassigned in the aftermath of financier and alleged sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein’s death in August while in federal custody. As the bureau, which oversees\nl22 federal prisons and more than l7o,ooo inmates nationwide, is working to implement the First Step Act's prison reforms and deal with the circumstances\nthat led to Epstein's death, it is facing severe resource issues, according to Hawk Sawyer.\n“\\We have put such huge strains on the Burean of Prisons trying to accomplish its mission,\" Hawk Sawyer said before the Senate Judiciary Commitee, “With\nthe dramatic grouth we've had, the budget cuts, staffing shortages, it’s just been incredible to me that the bureau has been able to function during the last l6\nyears that I've been gone.” The vast majority of staff are good, hardworking employees, “but they are tired because they are stretched,\" she added.\nHawk Sawyer atributed the resouree problem to the rapid increase in the prison population in the last 3o years, employees retiring at a faster rate than they\n. are hired, uncertain budgets, ihe recent government shutdoun andthe hiring [freeze early in the <span class=\"highlight\">Trump</span> administration. \"We have never had adequate\n__ Pesources to provide all the programs for all the inmates,” Hawk Sawyer said. “I'm hoping that will change nou since you all support the First Step Act.”\nAccording to the hurean's website it currently has 96,348 staff members. The New York Times reported:\nBetween December 2ol6 and September 2ol8 — the date of the most recent data available from the federal Office of Personnel Management — the number of\ncorrectional officers fell more than ll%, from l9,o82 to l6,898. That decline reversed a longtime trend. Before President Doneld <span class=\"highlight\">Trump</span> tock office, the\nnumber of federal correctional officers had continuously increased: there were l2.5% more officers at the end of 2ol6 compared to the beginning of 2ol2.\nHawk Sawyer said the bureau has “made great progress\" to fill the over 3,3oo vacancies nationwide, but it is going to take a while. In order to hire more staff,\nthe bureau is working with the Office of Personnel Management to get direct hiring authority, hiring retirees on a temporary basis because they are already\n- \" trained and using the professional services company Accenture to recruit young people online.\nSawyer said the only thing that impedes the bureau from providing adequate care and services for inmates is resources. She expects the agency will receive\n$75 million in this year’s appropriations for the First Step Act, which the law requires for the first five years, although she hoped for more.

Villafafia said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset\nof the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely\nemploy. Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you knou people are going to be geting\ncalls about . . . you just want to make sure that they knou about it so they don’t get ... a call from\nout of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to\nput the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t\nwant to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur” with a federal prosecution as had\noccurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected\nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s\nresources if the Office would just back doun to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,\nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.” In a later\nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and\nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal\nprosecution if the U.S. Atorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green\nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2oo6 meeting with\nVillafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not\npreviously heard of Epstein.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man\nwho was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a reasonable mater to pursue”\nfederally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told\nOPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the\nfederal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the\nexploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a\n“sreen light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have\nexplicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been\nsimply to acknouledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal\ninvestigation “sound[ed] reasonable.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein\ninvestigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Atorney’s Office had\n“abdicated their responsibility” to investigate and prosecute Epstein. In his OPR interview,\nSloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the\nState Atorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect\nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2oo6, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically\nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of\nEpstein. On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald <span class=\"highlight\">Trump</span>, Bill Clinton and\nKevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o57", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023070.jpg": "opposition to these meetings, but we are simply looking at this case\nas a violent crime prosecution involving stiff penalties rather than as\na white collar or public corruption case where the parties can\namicably work out a light sentence.”\n\nWith respect to the “policy reasons” that Lefcourt wants to discuss,\nthose were already raised in his leter (which is part of the indictment\npackage) and during his meeting with Andy and myself. Those\nreasons are: (l) he wants the Petit [sic] policy to <span class=\"highlight\">trump</span> our ability\nto prosecute Epstein, (2) this shouldn’t be a federal offense, and\n(3) the victims were willing participants so the crime shouldn’t be\nprosecuted at all. Unless the Office thinks that any of those\narguments will be persuasive, a meeting will not be beneficial to the\nprosecution, it will only benefit the defense. With respect to\nLefcourt’s promised legal analysis, that also has already been\nprovided. The only way to get additional analysis is to expose to the\ndefense the other charges that we are considering. In my opinion\nthis would seriously undermine the prosecution.\n\nThe defense is anxious to have a meeting in order to delay the\ninvestigation/prosecution, to find out more about our investigation,\nand to use political pressure to stop the investigation.\n\nI have no control over the Office’s decisions regarding whether to\nmeet with the defense or to whom the facts and analysis of the case\nwill be disclosed.

She also told\nVillafafia that if Villafafia did not stay with the case, “the case would go away” and Epstein “would\nnever serve a day in jail.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that at that point in time, she believed the USAO was preparing to file\ncharges against Epstein despite agreeing to accommodate the defense request for meetings.

It\nwas seen either as further evidence of the USAO’s willingness to meet with Epstein’s atorneys\nwhile simultaneously ignoring the victims, or as a meeting at which Acosta made secret\nagreements with the defense.\n\nTwo leters writen later in 2oo7 refer to the breakfast meeting. In a December 2oo7 leter\nto Sanchez, Acosta stated that he had “sua sponte proposed the Addendum to Mr. Lefkouitz at an\nOctober meeting in Palm Beach ... . in an atempt to avoid what I foresaw would likely be a\nlitigious selection process.” !°? In an October 23, 2oo7 leter from Lefkouitz to Acosta, less than\ntwo weeks after the breakfast meeting, Lefkouitz represented that during the meeting, Acosta\n\nassured me that [the USAO] would not intervene with the State\nAtorney’s Office regarding this mater; or contact any of the\nidentified individuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil\nclaimants and their respective counsel in this mater; and that neither\n[the USAO] nor the [FBI] would intervene regarding the sentence\nMr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as the\nsentence does not violate state law.!*°\n\nHouever, two days after receiving this leter, Acosta revised a response leter drafted by\nSloman, adding the term “inaccurate” to describe Lefkouitz’s claims that Acosta had promised\nnot to intervene with the State Atorney’s Office, contact individual witnesses or claimants, or\nintervene regarding Epstein’s sentence.'*! The draft response stated, “[S]uch a promise equates to\nthe imposition of a gag order. Our Office cannot and will not agree to this.”!*”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he did not remember the breakfast meeting, but he speculated that\nthe meeting may have been prompted by defense complaints that Villafafia had recommended “her\nboyfriend’s partner” to serve as atorney representative.'*? Acosta said that “the way this was\nreported [in the press] was that I negotiated [the NPA] over breakfast,” which was inaccurate\nbecause the NPA had been signed weeks before the breakfast meeting.'“4 When asked about\nl39 In fact, Sloman and Lefkouitz had been working on language for the Addendum before Acosta’s breakfast\nmeeting with Lefkouitz. It is possible that Acosta was not aware of Sloman’s efforts or had forgoten about them\nwhen writing the December 7, 2oo7 leter.\n\nl4o This leter is discussed further in the follouing section of this Report.\nl4l OPR did not find evidence establishing that the response was ever sent.\na Sloman’s initial draft response referred to a conversation the previous day in which Acosta had “clarified”\nLefkouitz’s claims about what Acosta had purportedly said in the October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting.\nl43 As noted previously, the atorney whom Villafafia recommended was a friend of another AUSA whom\nVillafafia was then dating, but had no professional relationship with either Villafafia or the other AUSA.\nIa For example, the Miami Herald’s November 2ol8 investigative report stated that “on the morning of the\nbreakfast meeting, a deal was struack—an extraordinary plea agreement that would conceal the full extent of Epstein’s\ncrimes and the number of people involved. . . .

Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald <span class=\"highlight\">Trump</span>, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.””!° Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o2 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity.

The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta Negotiated a Deal\nFavorable to Epstein over Breakfast with Defense Counsel\n\nOPR separately considered the circumstances of one specific meeting that has been the\nsubject of media atention and public criticism. The Miami Herald’s November 2ol8 reporting on\nthe Epstein investigation opened with an account of the October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting that\ndefense counsel Jay Lefkouitz arranged to have with Acosta at the West Palm Beach Marriot\nhotel. According to the Miami Herald article, “a deal was struck” at the meeting to allou Epstein\nto serve “just l3 months” in the county jail in exchange for the shutering of the federal\ninvestigation, and Acosta also agreed to “conceal” the full extent of Epstein’s crimes from the\nvictims and the public.7*4 Although public criticism of the meeting has focused on the fact that\nthe meeting occurred in a hotel far from Acosta’s Miami office, the evidence shous that Acosta\ntraveled to West Palm Beach on October ll for a press event and stayed overnight at the hotel,\nnear the USAO’s West Palm Beach office, because at midday on October l2 he was to speak at\nthe Palm Beach County Bench Bar Conference. After carefully considering the evidence\nsurrounding the breakfast meeting, including contemporaneous email communications and witness\naccounts, OPR concludes that Acosta did not negotiate the NPA, or make any significant\nconcessions relating to it, during or as a result of the October breakfast meeting.\n\nEpstein and his atorneys signed the NPA on September 24, 2oo7—more than two weeks\nbefore the October l2 breakfast meeting. The signed NPA contained all of the key provisions\nresulting from the preceding weeks of negotiations between the parties, and despite a later\naddendum and ongoing disputes about interpreting the damages provision of the agreement, those\nkey provisions remained in place thereafter. Acosta told OPR that throughout the negotiations\nwith the defense, he sought three goals: (l) Epstein’s guilty plea in state court to an offense\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender; (2) a sentence of imprisonment; and 3) a mechanism\nthrough which victims could obtain monetary damages from Epstein. As noted previously, the\nUSAO’s original plea offer in Menchel’s August 3, 2oo7 leter expressed a “non-negotiable”\ndemand that Epstein agree to a two-year term of imprisonment, and the final NPA required only\nan l8-month sentence, but the decision to reduce the required term of imprisonment from 24 to l8\nmonths was made well before Acosta’s breakfast meeting with counsel. The NPA signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, required l8 months’ incarceration, sexual offender registration, and a\nmechanism for the victims to obtain monetary damages from Epstein, and OPR found that these\nterms were not abandoned or materially altered after the breakfast meeting.\n\nAt the time of Acosta’s October breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, two issues involving\nthe NPA were in dispute. Neither of those issues was ultimately resolved in a way that materially\nchanged the key provisions of the NPA. First, at Sloman’s instigation, the USAO sought to change\nthe mechanism for appointing an atorney representative for the victims. This USAO-initiated\nrequest had prompted discussions about an “addendum” to the NPA. Sloman sent the text of a\nproposed NPA addendum to Lefkouitz on October ll, 2oo7.7*° Although OPR found no decisive\n238 Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future <span class=\"highlight\">Trump</span> Cabinet member gave a serial sex abuser the\ndeal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\n\n235 In his December l9, 2oo7, leter to defense atorney Sanchez, Acosta represented that he had proposed the\naddendum at the breakfast meeting, but it is clear the addendum was being developed before then.\nl6o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l98", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023207.jpg": "investigation.7° Media reports in mid-2oo9 suggested Epstein was released from his state\nincarceration “early” because he was assisting in a financial crimes investigation in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns. At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of” Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no cooperation” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“intelligence asset.”?4\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “intelligence asset,” or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\ncooperation in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or consideration\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\n243 See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future <span class=\"highlight\">Trump</span> Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\n\n244 When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss intelligence information.\nl69\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232o7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024398.jpg": "Noteworthy News Clips 7-25-2ol9\n\nro\n\nTo Hugh eed\n\nDate 2ol9/o7/25 l4:\n\nSubject: Noteworthy News Clips 7-25-2ol9\n\nAtachments: TEXT.htm\nWould you like me to include our statement on Epstein when | send this to Exec Staff?\nDisgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein injured in jail, rushed to hospital\nUSA Today\nhtps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2ol9/o7/25/epstein-mysteriously-injured-jail-\ntaken-hospital/l824453ool/\nDisgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, was found injured in his\nManhatan jail cell and rushed to a local hospital, multiple media outlets reported Wednesday.\nJeffrey Epstein found injured in his jail cell, according to a new report\nBusiness Insider\nhtps://www.businessinsider.com/jeffrey-epstein-found-injured-in-jail-cell-reports-2ol9-7\nRegistered sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who is currently being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center\nin Manhatan on charges related to sex trafficking, was found injured in his cell, according to a report from\nNew York's NBC News 4.
