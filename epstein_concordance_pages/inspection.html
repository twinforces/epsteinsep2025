Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or <span class=\"highlight\">inspection</span>, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses tn this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities.

Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6).

Additionally, psychology and medical staff check on the\ndefendant daily, MDC legal staff are highly atuned to any complaints the defendant has raised,\nand follouing initial complaints about the defendant’s diet early in her incarceration, the MDC has\nensured that the defendant receives three full meals per day and has access to commissary from\nwhich she can supplement her diet.\n\nThe MDC has taken numerous steps to strike the balance between the security of the\ninstitution and providing the defendant with adequate time and resources to prepare her defense.\nIn that vein, many of the searches the defendant complains of—such as searches after every visit,\nsearches of her cell, pat douns when she is moved, and directing her to open her mouth for visual\n<span class=\"highlight\">inspection</span> (while the searching staff member is wearing a mask)—are the same searches to which\nevery other inmate is subjected for the security of the institution. MDC legal counsel has assured\nthe Government that MDC staff does not record or listen to the substance of the defendant’s calls\nand visits with legal counsel. To the extent MDC staff conducts additional searches or monitoring\nof the defendant, MDC legal counsel has indicated that those steps are necessary to maintain the\nsecurity of the institution and the defendant.\n\nWith respect to the defense concerns regarding COVID-l9, the Government recognizes, as\nit did in its initial bail briefing, that the virus presents a challenge at any jail facility. At least for\nthis defendant, the MDC’s precautionary measures appear to have worked. When the defendant\nwas potentially exposed to the virus, she was placed in quarantine, remained asymptomatic, tested\nnegative, and then was released from quarantine. As the Court found at the initial bail hearing, the\ndefendant has no underlying health conditions that would place her at greater risk of complications\nfrom COVID-l9. (Tr. 89). For that same reason, the Court should again reject the suggestion that\nthe pandemic warrants the defendant’s release.\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll77\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001199.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD F3ocAINt n DUE Gmenolo2o 2A ile@ 42738) 26adeagect 4 Ob l5\n\nFinally, the government’s argument that Ms. Maxwell could always flee to some country\nother than the United Kingdom and France holds her—and any defendant—to an impossible\nstandard, which is not the standard under the Bail Reform Act. (See Gov. Mem. at l9). By the\ngovernment’s reasoning, no defendant with financial means to travel could be granted bail,\nbecause there would always be a possibility that they could flee to another country (even if they\nhad no ties there), and there could never be an assurance that any extradition waiver would be\nenforced. Houever, “Section 3l42 does not seek ironclad guarantees.” United States v. Chen,\n82o F. Supp. l2o5, l2o8 (N.D. Cal. l992). To the extent that Ms. Maxwell’s ties to France and\nthe United Kingdom—where she has not lived for nearly 3o years—create a flight risk, her\nextradition waivers along with the substantial bail package proposed reasonably cure it.\n\nE. The Recent COVID Surge at MDC Further Justifies Bail\n\nThe government suggests that the Court ignore COVID concerns because Ms. Maxwell,\nthough quarantined because of contact with an officer who tested positive, did not become\ninfected. This ignores the daily (sometimes multiple) inspections of Ms. Maxwell’s mouth,\nwhich heightens her risk of contracting the deadly virus, which has nou surged to ll3 positive\ncases in the MDC. Further, Deputy Captain B. Houtz recently issued a memo stating that “[i]t\nhas not been determined whether legal calls and legal visits will continue.” As the Court is well\naware, legal visits with Ms. Maxwell already have been suspended. Should legal calls also be\ndiscontinued, her constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel will be further eroded.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court order her\nrelease on bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed.\n* iar inoontive Mv. Maxwell aight have to flee to France has been greatly diminished by the recent arrest in France\nof Jean-Luc Brunel, who reportedly is under investigation for alleged sexual assaults by Jeffrey Epstein.

OPINION & ORDER\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\nBoth parties have asked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on\nmost of the language, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on the public\nrecord to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein.\nSecond, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential Government witnesses and their\ncounsel from using discovery materials for any purpose other than preparing for the criminal trial\nin this action. The Government has proposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the\nfollouing reasons, the Court adopts the Government’s proposed protective order.\nUnder Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(d)(l), “[a]t any time the court may, for\ngood cause, deny, restrict, or defer discovery or <span class=\"highlight\">inspection</span>, or grant other appropriate relief.”\nThe good cause standard “requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others . . . whether the imposition of\nthe protective order would prejudice the defendant,” and “the public’s interest in the\ninformation.” United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party\nseeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing good cause. Cf Gambale v.

See htps://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/BOP (reported l2/7/2o). While Ms. Maxwell is\nisolated from general population inmates, the crew of security guards who monitor her 24/7 are\nnot subject to mandatory testing, with some guards assigned to her detail rotating in from BOP\nfacilities where inmates and staff have tested positive. And while Ms. Maxwell may not be\nexposed to other inmates, she is exposed to individuals while escorted to a common area for\nbody scanning, further risking her exposure to COVID.\n\nWhile reciting BOP policy, the leter fails to address:\n\n= why as an isolated inmate, Ms. Maxwell is subject to repeated searching;\n\n=» why Ms. Maxwell is under 24/7 surveillance by a cadre of officers who are\nrequired to report her status every l5 minutes;\n\n= why Ms. Maxwell is constantly surveilled by a hand-held camera, even during\natorney-client conferences;\n\n= why all of Ms. Maxwell’s legal emails were erased from the CorrLinks system;\n\n=\" why immediately after receiving two nasal swab COVID tests, Ms. Maxwell was\nrequired to remove her mask for an in-mouth <span class=\"highlight\">inspection</span>, heightening her exposure\nto COVID as she was placed in quarantine;\n\n= why Ms. Maxwell’s legal papers are repeatedly inspected.\n\nWarden Tellez has failed to respond to our assertion that the MDC has imposed\nextraordinarily onerous conditions of constraint on Ms. Maxwell to avoid the catastrophic\nconsequences of negligence occurring at the MCC that resulted in the death of Jeffrey Epstein.\nThe Atorney General of the United States has said as much. Beyond the decision to not place\nMs. Maxwell in general population, to which we have no objection, the leter virtually concedes\nthat other restrictions imposed on Ms. Maxwell are not in response to any concern specific to her\nand tacitly suggests the heightened restrictions are in response to the high-profile nature of the\ncase and the acknouledged failure by the BOP to keep Epstein — an actual threat to himself —\nalive. As ABC News reported:\n\nAtorney General William Barr told ABC News on Wednesday that he is keeping a close\n\nwatch to make sure that Maxwell makes it to trial after Epstein died by suicide in a\n\nManhatan jail while awaiting trial last year. Barr said he was \"/ivid \" Epstein died while\n\nin custody last August. The investigation into Epstein has continued even after his death.\n\nI believe very strongly in that case,\" Barr told ABC News on Wednesday. .. . “And as\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool867\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002196.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 35 of 36\nother inmates in protective custody. Additionally, psychology and medical staff check on the\ndefendant daily, MDC legal staff are highly atuned to any complaints the defendant has raised,\nand follouing initial complaints about the defendant’s diet early in her incarceration, the MDC has\nensured that the defendant receives three full meals per day and has access to commissary from\nwhich she can supplement her diet.\n\nThe MDC has taken numerous steps to strike the balance between the security of the\ninstitution and providing the defendant with adequate time and resources to prepare her defense.\nIn that vein, many of the searches the defendant complains of—such as searches after every visit,\nsearches of her cell, pat douns when she is moved, and directing her to open her mouth for visual\n<span class=\"highlight\">inspection</span> (while the searching staff member is wearing a mask)—are the same searches to which\nevery other inmate is subjected for the security of the institution. MDC legal counsel has assured\nthe Government that MDC staff does not record or listen to the substance of the defendant’s calls\nand visits with legal counsel. To the extent MDC staff conducts additional searches or monitoring\nof the defendant, MDC legal counsel has indicated that those steps are necessary to maintain the\nsecurity of the institution and the defendant.\n\nWith respect to the defense concerns regarding COVID-l9, the Government recognizes, as\nit did in its initial bail briefing, that the virus presents a challenge at any jail facility. At least for\nthis defendant, the MDC’s precautionary measures appear to have worked. When the defendant\nwas potentially exposed to the virus, she was placed in quarantine, remained asymptomatic, tested\nnegative, and then was released from quarantine. As the Court found at the initial bail hearing, the\ndefendant has no underlying health conditions that would place her at greater risk of complications\nfrom COVID-l9. (Tr. 89). For that same reason, the Court should again reject the suggestion that\nthe pandemic warrants the defendant’s release.\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l96\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002220.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo3 Filed l2/23/2o Page l4 of l5\n\nFinally, the government’s argument that Ms. Maxwell could always flee to some country\nother than the United Kingdom and France holds her—and any defendant—to an impossible\nstandard, which is not the standard under the Bail Reform Act. (See Gov. Mem. at l9). By the\ngovernment’s reasoning, no defendant with financial means to travel could be granted bail,\nbecause there would always be a possibility that they could flee to another country (even if they\nhad no ties there), and there could never be an assurance that any extradition waiver would be\nenforced. Houever, “Section 3l42 does not seek ironclad guarantees.” United States v. Chen,\n82o F. Supp. l2o5, l2o8 (N.D. Cal. l992). To the extent that Ms. Maxwell’s ties to France and\nthe United Kingdom—where she has not lived for nearly 3o years—create a flight risk, her\nextradition waivers along with the substantial bail package proposed reasonably cure it.®\n\nE. The Recent COVID Surge at MDC Further Justifies Bail\n\nThe government suggests that the Court ignore COVID concerns because Ms. Maxwell,\nthough quarantined because of contact with an officer who tested positive, did not become\ninfected. This ignores the daily (sometimes multiple) inspections of Ms. Maxwell’s mouth,\nwhich heightens her risk of contracting the deadly virus, which has nou surged to ll3 positive\ncases in the MDC. Further, Deputy Captain B. Houtz recently issued a memo stating that “[i]t\nhas not been determined whether legal calls and legal visits will continue.” As the Court is well\naware, legal visits with Ms. Maxwell already have been suspended. Should legal calls also be\ndiscontinued, her constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel will be further eroded.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court order her\nrelease on bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed.\n* Any incentive Ms. Maxwell might have to flee to France has been greatly diminished by the recent arrest in France\nof Jean-Luc Brunel, who reportedly is under investigation for alleged sexual assaults by Jeffrey Epstein.

Accordingly, we request the particulars set forth in Exhibit A. (See\nEx. A).\n\nII. Motion for Disclosure and <span class=\"highlight\">Inspection</span> of Documents\n\nMs. Maxwell seeks an order directing the government to produce certain material\nbelieved to be in the possession of the government or its agents, or which could be obtained by\nthe government from other prosecutor’s offices, law enforcement officers and investigators,\nwitnesses, or persons having knouledge of the events giving rise to this case. Ms. Maxwell\nrequested these documents from the government, but was denied. As discussed further belou,\nMs. Maxwell has good reason to believe that some of these documents contain exculpatory\nBrady material; hence, the government has a duty to produce them to the defense, and should be\nordered to do so immediately. The alternative means of obtaining the requested documents\nwould be through subpoenas served on the government and unidentified witnesses, which is an\nimpractical pursuit. The government would likely move to quash any subpoena, requiring court\nintervention; and it would be impossible to serve subpoenas on witnesses without knouing their\nnames and locations. We therefore request that the Court direct the government to produce the\ndocuments set forth belou.\n\nA.

Feb. l2, 2ol6) (Nathan, J.)\n(granting motion to quash Rule l7(c) subpoena for all records relating to cooperating witnesses);\nsee also Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 7ol (“Generally, the need for evidence to impeach witnesses is\ninsufficient to require its production in advance of trial.”); Cherry, 876 F. Supp. at 553\n(“[D]ocuments are not evidentiary for Rule l7(c) purposes if their use is limited to impeachment.”).\nTHE SUBPOENA FAILS TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF RULE l7(C)\n\nThe Defendant cannot demonstrate that the Subpoena meets Rule l7(c)’s requirements for\nfour, independent reasons. First, the Subpoena is overbroad and non-specific, and a clear fishing\nexpedition to “see what may turn up.” See United States v. Avenati, No. (Sl) l9 CR. 373 (PGG),\n2o2o WL 86768, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 6, 2o2o) (denying motion for issuance of Rule l7(c)\nsubpoena). “Subpoenas seeking ‘any and all’ materials, without mention of ‘specific admissible\nevidence,’ justify the inference that the defense is engaging in the type of ‘fishing expedition’\nprohibited by Mixon.” United States v. Mendinueta-Ibarro, 956 F. Supp. 2d 5ll, 5l2-5l3\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (internal quotation marks omited) (granting motion to quash Rule l7(c)\nsubpoena).\n\nHere, the Subpoena plainly fails Nixon’s specificity requirement. Requests | through 5 all\nseek “communications” between “You” and a designated individual or entity, including the U.S.\nAtorney and BSF’s co-counsel, about a certain subject. The Subpoena defines “communications”\nas “all forms of correspondence, including regular mail, email, text message, memorandum, or\nother writen communication of information of any kind,” and defines “You” as “any ouner,\nshareholder, partner or employee of Boies, Schiller, Flexner, LLP, including but not limited to\nDavid Boies, Sigrid McCawley, Peter Skinner and any former ouner, shareholder, partner or\nemployee, or independent contractor of the firm.” Such broad Requests are plainly overbroad and\nnon-specific, and do not meet the strict requirements of Rule l7(c). See, e.g., Mendinueta-Ibarro,\n956 F. Supp. 2d at 5l2-5l3 (quashing subpoena that requested “‘any and all writings and records’\nrelated to the [police department’s] contact with a particular confidential witness”); Pena, 2ol6\nWL 8735699, at *3 (Nathan, J.)

Nathan\nMarch 22, 2o2l\nPage 5 of 7\nthan impeachment, many of them are procurable from the Government and are thus improper\nsubjects of a Rule l7(c) subpoena, as explained belou.\n\nRequests 2 through 5 also seek communications from 2ol5 through the present between\nBSF, its co-counsel, and the U.S. Atorney about Jean Luc Brunel, who is presently incarcerated\nin France on charges of sex crimes and is one of Jeffrey Epstein and the Defendant’s\nco-conspirators. But Brunel does not appear to be relevant to any of the Government’s charges in\nthe indictment in this case, and, again, communications from 2ol5 are not relevant to conduct that\noccurred between l994 and l997. The Defendant thus seeks these communications, too, so that\nshe can fish for impeachment materials.\n\nRequests 6 and 7 seek contingency fee agreements or engagement leters between BSF and\nAnnie Farmer and her sister, Maria Farmer. Such documents are irrelevant. The fact that the\nFarmers are represented, and the terms of their representation, is not relevant to whether the\nDefendant commited the crimes of which she is accused. Even the impeachment value of such\ndocuments is speculative. Maria Farmer is not one of the minor victims described in the indictment,\nand thus may not be called to testify in this case. And in seeking to determine whether BSF has\ncontingency fee arrangements with the Farmers, the Defendant appears to seek to establish some\nmotive of BSF to drum up contingency fees by convincing women to falsely accuse the Defendant\nof criminal conduct. But BS¥’’s motive for representing the Farmers would not be relevant to the\nFarmers’ motives for testifying for the prosecution (if they testify).\n\nRequest 9 seeks the original, complete copy of Annie Farmer’s journal from when she was\na teenager for <span class=\"highlight\">inspection</span> and copying. But all potentially relevant pages were produced from this\njournal to the Defendant in civil discovery in another mater, as demonstrated by the Defendant’s\nability to atach those pages as Exhibit A to the Subpoena. The remainder of the journal has\nnothing to do with the Defendant or Jeffrey Epstein. And the Defendant cannot inspect it for the\npurpose of fishing for something that could be potentially relevant—it is her burden to identify\nrelevant and admissible evidence under Nixon. The Defendant also clearly seeks to use the journal\nfor impeachment purposes, as she highlighted in a prior filing in a recently dismissed civil action\nMs. Farmer filed against the Defendant. See Leter from L. Menninger to Hon. Debra C. Freeman\nat 2, Annie Farmer v. Darren K. Indyke, et al., l9-cv-lo475 (LGS-DCF) (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3o, 2o2o),\nECF No. lo8 (“[P]laintiff produced certain pages from a diary dated in early l996 which detailed,\nonly, that Jeffrey Epstein had held her hand in a movie theater in late l995 which made her feel\nuncomfortable. This same diary contained exactly zero references to Ghislaine Maxwell, contrary\nto the assertions in her Complaint . . . .” (emphasis in original)).\n\nRequest l2 for “EVCP Material” is not relevant to the Defendant’s defense. BSF submited\nclaims and supporting evidence to the Epstein Victim’s Compensation Program on behalf of\nseveral Epstein survivors who have not made separate claims against Maxwell. The Defendant\nmust demonstrate the relevance of all the evidence she seeks by means of a Rule l7(c) subpoena,\nnot merely that she could turn up something that is relevant and admissible. See Pena, 2ol6 WL\n8735699, at *2 (Nathan, J.) (“Pena has failed to make the requisite shouing regarding the\nadmissibility of ‘any and all’ other records regarding the cooperators that might exist at the MDC,\nMCC, or DOC.”); United States v.

Nathan\nMarch 22, 2o2l\nPage 7 of 7\nMaterial,” which is clearly sought for impeachment purposes, is not a proper subject of a Rule\nl7(c) subpoena.\n\nThird, certain of the documents that the Defendant seeks to obtain from BSF are “otherwise\nprocurable” from the Government. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 699 (documents requested pursuant to Rule\nl7(c) must not be “otherwise procurable” from another source). Requests l and 2 both seek\ncommunications between BSF and the U.S. Atorney, which the Defendant can procure from the\nGovernment. Similarly, Request 8 seeks a Grand Jury Subpoena that gg by the\nGovernment itself, and that the Defendant can therefore procure from the Government. Thus, a\nRule l7(c) subpoena to BSF for those documents is improper. See, e.g., United States v. Bergstein,\nNo. l6 Cr. 746 (PKC), 2ol7 WL 6887596, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 28, 2ol7) (‘““When ‘many’ of the\nsubpoenaed materials are obtainable through the discovery process, a subpoena contravenes\nNixon’s requirement that subpoenaed materials must not be otherwise procurable in advance of\ntrial by the exercise of due diligence.”); United States v. Boyle, No. o8 Cr. 523 (CM), 2oo9 WL\n484436, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 24, 2oo9) (quashing a l7(c) subpoena where it was “likely that many\nof the documents that defendant seeks in his subpoena are obtainable from another source—the\nUnited States Atorney’s Office—with litle or no diligence required”).\n\nFinally, Requests lo and ll seek items that can be produced at trial if they are shoun to be\nrelevant and admissible. Request lo seeks a pair of couboy boots that the Defendant and Jeffrey\nEpstein purchased for Annie Farmer for <span class=\"highlight\">inspection</span> and copying. Request ll seeks the original\ncopies of various photographs of Annie Farmer when she was a teenager, of Maria Farmer on\nLeslie Wexner’s property, of Virginia Giuffre on various of Jeffrey Epstein and the Defendant’s\nproperties, and of Virginia Giuffre, Prince Andrew, and the Defendant in the Defendant’s London\ntounhome. Although the relevance of these items is minimal—the photographs, for example, do\nnot appear to depict any conduct or event described in the indictment—the Defendant cannot shou\nthat she “cannot properly prepare for trial without such production and <span class=\"highlight\">inspection</span> in advance of\ntrial and that the failure to obtain such <span class=\"highlight\">inspection</span> may tend unreasonably to delay the trial,” which\nis an independent requirement under Nixon. 4l8 U.S. at 699. There is simply no reason why, if\nthe Farmers and Ms. Giuffre ultimately testify and if these items prove to be relevant and\nadmissible, these items cannot be produced for <span class=\"highlight\">inspection</span> at trial.\n\nFor all of the foregoing reasons, the Defendant’s motion to authorize service of the\nSubpoena on BSF should be denied\n\nRespectfully submited,\n/s/ Sigrid S.

A bill of particulars is therefore necessary to\nprevent unfair surprise at trial and to allou Ms. Maxwell to adequately prepare her defense.\n\nIt is also critical that Ms. Maxwell receive accelerated disclosure of the government’s\nwitness list, Jencks Act material, Brady/Giglio material, Rule 4o4(b) evidence, and any co-\nconspirator statements. The government predictably argues that there is nothing unusual about\nthe circumstances of Ms. Maxwell’s case that would justify a deviation from customary\nproduction deadlines for the materials she requests. But Ms. Maxwell’s case is not a typical case\nand presents unique circumstances that warrant the relief she seeks. The Indictment alleges\nvague conduct that is over 25 years old and involves conduct that allegedly took place over a\nfour-year period in multiple locations across the country and in at least one foreign jurisdiction.\nAny relevant documents that may still exist will take time to retrieve. The investigation of\nwitness statements and any Rule 4o4(b) evidence will similarly take significant time and\npotentially also involve foreign travel and depositions under Rule l5 of the Federal Rules of\nCriminal Procedure. For these reasons, and the others set forth belou, the Court should order the\nproduction of these materials by March 22, 2o2l.\n\nMs. Maxwell has also provided specific reasons supporting her requests for the\nproduction and <span class=\"highlight\">inspection</span> of certain FBI reports and other documents, such as a complete copy\nof the handwriten diary, which are not included in the discovery. There is ample evidence to\nconclude that these documents contain material inconsistencies in the prior statements of key\ngovernment witnesses, as well as other exculpatory information for Ms. Maxwell. The Court\nshould therefore order the government to produce them.\n\n° Ms. Maxwell originally requested that the government produce the requested witness materials by March l2, 2o2l\n(Dkt. l48 at l5, l7), the same deadline as the Court imposed on the government to produce documents related to\ncertain non-testifying witnesses. (Dkt. 73). Because the Court granted Ms. Maxwell’s request to extend the filing\ndeadline for the reply motions by lo days from March 5, 2o2l to March l5, 2o2l, we have moved forward our\nrequested deadline for the production of witness materials by lo days to March 22, 2o2l.\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4232\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004239.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 287 Filed o5/2o/2l Page l2 of l6\n\nFinally, the government’s offer to provide Jencks Act and Giglio information for its\ntestifying witnesses “as much as four weeks” before trial is insufficient. (Opp. l84). Certain of\nthe Accusers and (we suspect) many of the government’s anticipated witnesses have made\nnumerous statements about the events in question, either in the context of civil litigation, or to\nthe media, or in other public fora. The defense will have to carefully analyze and compare any\nprior statements or impeachment material that the government discloses against the witness’s\nnumerous public statements. This process will be time-consuming, but essential to Ms.\nMaxwell’s preparation for trial.°\n\nThe Court has already acknouledged that the defense will need substantial time to\nevaluate and investigate materials related to potential witnesses in this case, and has ordered the\ngovernment, over its objection, to produce certain Rule l6 materials related to non-testifying\nwitnesses by March l2, 2o2l—four months in advance of trial—“‘to ensure that the defense can\nadequately prepare for trial.” (Dkt. 73).

Lastly, Maxwell’s theory that a forensic analysis could reveal the date that the journal\nwas writen and whether it had been altered is for impeachment of anticipated authentication\ntestimony. Moreover, it is entirely speculative and unsubstantiated. Maxwell provides no actual\nreason to doubt the journal’s authenticity. In her May l2, 2o2l leter, Maxwell claims that two\ncopies of one of the pages are “obviously, and noticeably, different.” The difference, which is\nnot explained in the leter, is neither obvious nor noticeable to this Court. Indeed, the writing\nand handwriting in the two exhibits certainly look identical. At most, one version appears to be a\nphotograph of the page in the journal (Exhibit A), while the other appears to be a photocopy of\nthe same page (Exhibit B). Maxwell fails to identify any actual differences. Separately, here\nagain Maxwell’s arguments sound in impeachment of anticipated authentication testimony. For\nall of the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that a Rule l7(c) subpoena is not the proper\nvehicle for Request 9.\n\nRequest lo seeks production of a pair of black boots that Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein\nallegedly gave to an alleged victim. The Government has indicated that it has requested that\nBSF produce the boots to the FBI and that, when the boots are in the FBI’s possession, the\nGovernment will promptly make them available to the defense for examination and use at trial.\nMaxwell contends that the Court should nonetheless order the boots’ production to the defense.\nThe argument is meritless.

Maxwell seeks these materials to inspect them prior to trial in order to investigate their\nauthenticity. In its May 6 leter, the Government indicated that the original versions of a subset\nof the photographs are in the FBI’s possession, and the Government will make those photographs\navailable to the defense for <span class=\"highlight\">inspection</span> upon request. The Court agrees with the Government that\nthe request is moot as to those photographs. Again, to the extent that the Government fails to\ncomply with its representation that it will make those photographs available to the defense upon\nrequest, the defense may make an application to the Court.\n\nAs to the remaining photographs, the request is denied on the basis that the defense has\nfailed to establish the relevance of the original versions of the photographs. The defense already\nhas photocopies or scanned versions of the photographs in question. But the defense proffers\nthat it seeks the original versions of these photographs in order to determine whether they are\ngenuine. The only discernible theory of relevance as to this request is impeachment. Maxwell\ndoes not set forth any other nonconclusory basis for their relevance. And again, because\nimpeachment evidence falls outside the scope of Rule l7(c), the request fails to meet Nixon’s\nrelevance requirement. But even assuming that impeachment could permissibly establish\nrelevance, the argument fails because Maxwell does not yet knou the scope of the victim’s\ntestimony or whether it will implicate the photographs.\n\nI.

United States v. Barnes, No. S9 o4-CR-l86 (SCR), 2oo8 WL\n9359654, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 2, 2oo8).\n\nTo determine whether issuance of the subpoena is appropriate, the Court considers the\nfactors articulated in United States v. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 699-7oo. In Nixon, the Supreme Court\nexplained that in order to require production prior to trial, the moving party must shou: (l) that\nthe documents are evidentiary and relevant; (2) that they are not otherwise procurable reasonably\nin advance of trial by exercise of due diligence; (3) that the party cannot properly prepare for\ntrial without such production and <span class=\"highlight\">inspection</span> in advance of trial and that the failure to obtain such\n<span class=\"highlight\">inspection</span> may tend unreasonably to delay the trial; and (4) that the application is made in good\nfaith and is not intended as a general ‘fishing expedition.’” /d. at 698-7oo. To clear that hurdle,\nthe Court considers (l) relevancy, (2) admissibility, and (3) specificity. /d. at 7oo.\n\nIl. Discussion\n\nOn April 27, 2o2l and June 2, 2o2l, the Court denied Maxwell’s request for an order\nauthorizing issuance of a Rule l7(c) subpoena to Boies, Schiller, Flexner LLP. See Dkt. Nos.\n252, 298. In doing so, the Court noted that the requests contained in that proposed subpoena all\nfailed the Nixon test. The proposed subpoenas to these four individuals seek similar materials,\nand the subpoenas fail for similar reasons.\n\nA. Subpoena Recipient-l\n\nThe Court begins with the proposed subpoenas to Subpoena Recipient-l. The proposed\nsubpoena to her makes five requests which overlap entirely with requests contained in the\nproposed subpoena to BSF. Specifically, Maxwell requests (l) any contingent fee and\nengagement agreements between Subpoena Recipient-land any atorneys; (2) Subpoena\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5o3l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005032.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 334 Filed o8/l3/2l Page3oflo\nRecipient-l’s original journal for <span class=\"highlight\">inspection</span> and copying; (3) a pair of black boots that Maxwell\nand Jeffrey Epstein allegedly gave to Subpoena Recipient-l; (4) production of the original copies\nof certain photographs of Subpoena Recipient-l; and (5) materials related to the Epstein Victim\nCompensation Fund. As the Court previously noted, all of these requests fail the Nixon test.\n\nThe request for any contingent or engagement agreements fails because Maxwell has not\nmade the required shouing that such records would be relevant or admissible. The only\nplausible theory of relevance set forth in Maxwell’s papers is that these documents are necessary\nfor purposes of impeachment. See Dkt. No. 252, April 27, 2o2l Op., at 4-5. The need to\nimpeach witnesses generally “is insufficient to require [materials’] production in advance of\ntrial.” Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 7ol. As a result, many courts have held that mere impeachment\nmaterial does not become relevant until after the witness testifies. United States v. Skelos, No.\nl5-CR-3l7 (KMW), 2ol8 WL 2254538, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May l7, 2ol8)), aff'd, 988 F.3d 645\n(2d Cir. 2o2l) (collecting cases). Here, there is no other plausible theory of relevance to these\nmaterials—and Maxwell does not advance any explanation, other than impeachment, as to why\nthese materials might be relevant under the Nixon test. Lacking any relevance or admissibility,\nthe request is improper for purposes of Rule l7(c). In any event, there is litle risk that review of\nthese materials, if they become relevant and admissible, will lead to a delay at trial, given their\nlimited volume. United States v. Seabrook, No. l6-CR-467 (ALC), 2ol7 WL 48383ll, at *2\n(S.D.N.Y. Oct. 23, 2ol7). Ifthe materials become relevant at trial, Maxwell will be able to\nprocure them at that time.\n\nMaxwell’s request for production of Subpoena Recipient-l’s journal also fails the Nixon\ntest. As the Court noted in its June 2, 2o2l opinion, the original and complete journal is not the\nproper subject of a Rule l7(c) subpoena. As already noted, mere impeachment purposes do not\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5o32\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005033.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 334 Filed o8/l3/2l Page4oflo\nwarrant the issuance of a Rule l7(c) subpoena. See Dkt. No. 298, June 2, 2o2l Order, at l-2.\nMaxwell’s other theories of relevance similarly fail; as the Court previously observed, there is no\nmerit to Maxwell’s contention that the contents of the journal, other than the pages to which she\nalready has access, are exculpatory. See id. And more generally, the request for production of\nthe entire original journal is speculative and overbroad, amounting to litle more than a “fishing\nexpedition,” which is not the proper use of Rule l7(c). See Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 698-7o.\n\nThe request for the original pair of black boots is moot. See Dkt. No. 298, June 2, 2o2l\nOrder, at 4-5. The Government has indicated that it has requested that BSF produce the boots to\nthe FBI and that, when the boots are in the FBI’s possession, the Government will promptly\nmake them available to the defense for examination and use at trial. Rule l7(c) is not the proper\nmechanism for discovery from third parties where the sought-after item is “otherwise procurable\nreasonably in advance of trial.” Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 698-7oo. That is the case here: The\nGovernment has represented that the defense will be able to inspect the boots before trial. See\nDkt. No. 298, June 2, 2o2l Order, at 4-5.\n\nThe request for original copies of certain photographs similarly fails. As the Court\npreviously noted, the defense has access to photocopies of those photographs; the request is\ntherefore for the originals. The Government has indicated that a subset of those photographs are\nin the FBI’s possession and that it will make them available to the defense for <span class=\"highlight\">inspection</span>; the\nrequest is moot as to those photographs. See Dkt. No. 298, June 2, 2o2l Order, at 4-5. And as\nto the remaining photographs, the request is again denied on the basis that the defense has failed\nto establish the relevance of the original versions of the photographs. The defense already has\nphotocopies or scanned versions of the photographs in question. The only discernible theory of\nrelevance as to the original versions of these photographs is impeachment. Once again, it is\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5o33\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005034.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 334 Filed o8/l3/2l Page5oflo\nimproper to issue a Rule l7(c) subpoena where the sole relevance of the requested materials is\nimpeachment. There is no plausible claim that <span class=\"highlight\">inspection</span> of the original photographs is\nwarranted, and to the extent that Maxwell seeks the photographs in order to disprove their\nauthenticity (and challenge any potential testimony that might be advanced at trial), the request is\nentirely speculative. Even assuming that impeachment could permissibly establish relevance, the\nargument fails because Maxwell does not yet knou the scope of the victim’s testimony or\nwhether it will implicate the photographs.\n\nFinally, the request for materials related to the Epstein Victim Compensation Fund is\ndenied for substantially the same reasons the Court articulated in its April 27, 2o2l Opinion. See\nDkt. No. 252, April 27, 2o2l Op., at 6-8. Here, too, Maxwell has failed to establish the\nmaterials’ relevance. The briefing makes clear that Maxwell seeks these documents for mere\nimpeachment purposes, which again does not warrant issuance or enforcement of a Rule l7(c)\nsubpoena. Furthermore, to the extent that Maxwell hinges her theory of relevance on the\npossibility that these documents may contain some exculpatory evidence, the request is entirely\nspeculative. The “mere hope” that documents might produce some degree of exculpatory\nevidence is also insufficient. See United States v. Rich, No. S 83-CR-579 (SWK), l984 WL 845,\nat *3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 7, l984). Maxwell has proffered no plausible basis why these materials\nmight be exculpatory beyond her theory that they will help her undermine the potential witness’s\ncredibility.\n\nIn sum, for the reasons stated by the Court in its April 27, 2o2l and June 2, 2o2l orders,\nthe request for authorization of a Rule l7(c) subpoena to Subpoena Recipient-l is DENIED.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5o34\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005035.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 334 Filed o8/l3/2l Page6oflo\n\nB. Subpoena Recipient-2\n\nThe proposed subpoena to Subpoena Recipient-2 contains four requests. The first seeks\nany contingent fee and engagement agreements between Subpoena Recipient-2 and any\natorneys; the second seeks an envelope that allegedly has Epstein’s and Maxwell’s “touch\nDNA”; the third seeks certain physical evidence, including photographs, old diaries, and\ntelephone books; and the fourth seeks EVCP materials. The first and fourth requests fail for the\nsame reasons as discussed above; their only plausible theory of relevance is impeachment, which\nplaces them outside the proper scope of Rule l7(c).\n\nThe second and third requests are plainly sought for impeachment purposes. Indeed,\nMaxwell’s briefing makes clear that she seeks production of the envelope in order to “disprove”\nclaims that Subpoena Recipient-2 might make at trial if called to testify. Beyond a conclusory\nassertion regarding Subpoena Recipient-2, houever, Maxwell does not make any effort to\nidentify which claims she seeks to disprove. Nor does she explain why the envelope, or any\ninformation derived from its <span class=\"highlight\">inspection</span>, is relevant to the criminal charges she is facing. At\nmost, that is, she seeks the envelope in order to impeach any testimony that Subpoena Recipient-\n2 might have if called to testify. The request is speculative and clearly beyond the proper scope\nof Rule l7(c).\n\nThe third request, for vast amounts of physical evidence that Subpoena Recipient-2\nshoued or produced to Subpoena Recipient-3, fails for two reasons. The first is relevance; as\nabove, Maxwell’s briefing makes clear that she seeks to examine the evidence in order to prepare\nto rebut any testimony that Subpoena Recipient-2 might make at trial (or any evidence\nintroduced through Subpoena Recipient-2). Here, too, the request seeks to impeach Subpoena\nRecipient-2’s potential testimony. That is insufficient. Other than that, Maxwell makes no effort\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5o35\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005045.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 336 Filed o9/o7/2l Page3oflo\n\nAs previously detailed, Annie Farmer is believed to be the alleged victim referred to in\nthe superseding indictment as “Minor Victim 2.” She is represented by BSF. See, e.g., Annie\nFarmer v. Indyke, et al., No. l9 Civ. lo475 (LGS). The proposed BSF Subpoena calls for\nproduction of particular physical items that belong to Annie Farmer, specifically a journal, black\nboots, and certain photographs. BSF produced photos of those items (and PDF replications of\nthe photographs) to Ms. Maxwell in the Annie Farmer action. It is unknoun whether the items\nare currently in the possession of BSF or Ms. Annie Farmer.

The proposed subpoena seeks no new or additional information\nbeyond that which is sought by the BSF Subpoena.\n\nSimilarly, Ms. Maxwell seeks also to serve a subpoena on Annie Farmer’s older sister,\nMaria Farmer. See Exhibit 2. Like Annie, Maria Farmer is represented by BSF. See Maria\nFarmer v. Indyke et al., l9 Civ. lo474 (NRB). Ms. Maxwell seeks to serve the proposed\nsubpoena on Maria Farmer through BSF if they are willing to accept service.\n\nDefense counsel does not believe that Maria Farmer is mentioned in the Indictment,\nhouever, counsel believes the government will offer her as a witness at this criminal trial either\n\n' Fed.

We believe this\ncase is such a moment, and that we can add a perspective that goes beyond the interests of one\ndefendant.\n\n8. The Supreme Court has taught that the approach folloued by this Court in this\nhigh-profile case of using a juror questionnaire and follouing up with voir dire can be highly\neffective. See Skilling v.

Mot. for Sub, Atachment A.\n\nMs. Maxwell filed a motion for issuance of the subpoena, explaining hou her subpoena\nsatisfied Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l7(c) and the standard set forth in United States v.\nNixon, 4l8 U.S. 683 (l974). Unlike Ms. Maxwell’s earlier subpoena to Boies Schiller & Flexner\n(BSF), which the Court declined to issue, Dkt. Nos. 252, 298, the Court here authorized and\nissued Ms. Maxwell’s subpoena to the EVCP, concluding (preliminarily and correctly) that it\nwas proper under Rule l7(c). See Nachamie, 9l F. Supp. 2d at 56l (“As the Supreme Court has\nexplained, it is the responsibility of the court, not the opposing party, to ensure that a subpoena\nsecured under Rule l7(c) is for a proper purpose.” (citing United States v. Tomison, 969 F. Supp.\n587, 594 (E.D. Cal. l997))). Ms. Maxwell’s subpoena seeks production aft trial (not pretrial), and\nit also requests that before the responsive material is produced to her for <span class=\"highlight\">inspection</span>, this Court\nconduct an in camera review. Combined with the narrouness of her request, Ms. Maxwell has\nsuggested careful procedures to balance her need for the material and the accusers’ interests in\nconfidentiality.\n\nEveryone agrees that Ms. Maxwell’s subpoena specifically identifies the requested\nmaterial, and there is no meaningful dispute that the material she seeks is both relevant and not\notherwise procurable. (The government and Accuser-2 offer cursory arguments about relevance,\nwhich are easily dismissed.) Instead, the disagreement concerns whether the material is\nadmissible and whether enforcement of the subpoena would be unreasonable and oppressive.\nConsidering Ms. Maxwell’s constitutional rights to present a defense and to confront her\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll426\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011469.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-l Filed o7/l5/22 Page3of7\nsentiment, a sentiment that was also conveyed to me personally, repeatedly and pleadingly by the\nvictims themselves.\n\n8. With that confidentiality imperative in mind, we designed the EVCP Protocol\nwith input and support from the victims’ lawyers, the Atorney General of the U.S. Virgin\nIslands, the Epstein Estate and other interested parties. The Protocol was approved by the\nProbate Court of the U.S. Virgin Islands (where Epstein’s estate is being probated); a copy of the\ncourt order is included with this motion as Exhibit G. The Protocol sets out the terms, conditions\nand guiding principles that govern the Program, the claims process and my role and\nresponsibilities as independent Administrator. In accordance with the Protocol, I had complete\nand exclusive autonomy and decision-making authority over all claim determinations and all\nclaim procedures. The Estate agreed to pay whatever amounts I determined in my independent\njudgment to eligible claimants in exchange for the claimant releasing the Estate and other related\nindividuals and entities from any civil claims relating to the allegations of sexual abuse. The\nProtocol, as well as other information about the EVCP, is publicly available on its website at\nhtps://epsteinvep.com/, and the Protocol is atached to the motion as Exhibit D.\n\n9. Confidentiality is an indispensable condition of the EVCP; its importance cannot\nbe overstated. The EVCP Protocol expressly requires confidentiality in order to protect the\nprivacy of claimants. In accordance with the Protocol, information provided to or obtained by\nthe Program was used by me, in my role as Administrator, for the sole purpose of processing and\nevaluating claims and performing other Program-related work (such as resolution of any related\nMedicaid and/or Medicare liens). It was otherwise kept - and must remain - confidential. The\nProtocol provides that the Program’s files are not available for <span class=\"highlight\">inspection</span> or review at any time,\nand that no information obtained solely through the Program will be disclosed publicly or used\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooll469\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011485.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-4 Filed o7/l5/22 Page 8of9\npayments made under the Program shall be for a Claimant’s physical injuries, physical sickness and\nresulting emotional distress within the meaning of Section lo4(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\nC. Program Integrity\n\nFor the purpose of protecting both the integrity of the Program and financial resources for eligible\nClaimants, the Administrator will institute all necessary measures to prevent payment of fraudulent\nclaims, including taking steps to verify claims and analyze submissions for inconsistencies,\nirregularities or duplication.\nEach Claimant who signs the Claim Form at the time of submission certifies that the information\nprovided in the Claim Form is true and accurate to the best of the Claimant’s knouledge, and that the\nClaimant understands that false statements or claims made in connection with such submission may\nresult in fines, imprisonment and/or any other remedy available by law. Claims that appear to be\npotentially fraudulent or to contain information knoun by the Claimant to be false when made will be\nforwarded to federal, state or local law enforcement agencies and/or the appropriate Office of the\nDistrict Atorney and/or United States Atorney’s Office for possible investigation and prosecution.\n\nD. Confidentiality/Privacy\nThe Program is confidential.

No information\nprovided by Claimants will be provided to the Estate except for the Claimant’s name and the date(s)\nand location(s) of the alleged abuse, for the sole purpose of processing and evaluating the claim and,\nfor purposes of the Release, the names of any other individual(s) to whom or by whom the Claimant\nalleges she was trafficked or sexually abused. The Estate has agreed that no information obtained\nsolely through the Program will be disclosed publicly or used by the Estate in defending itself from any\nclaim, regardless of forum. The Program’s files are not available for <span class=\"highlight\">inspection</span>, review or copying by\nthe Estate or the Claimant or her representatives during or after the Program, and all pertinent\nl All parties agree that they are using the services of a third-party administrator to help reach a resolution of individual claims\nof sexual abuse, and that this Program is entitled to confidentiality, privileges (mediation, setlement and all other pertinent\nprivileges), and protection from disclosure under applicable law.\n8|Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooll485\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011496.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-5 Filed o7/l5/22 Page lo of l7\n\nThe Administrator acknouledges that some claimants may not be able to\nprovide documentation to corroborate the claim.

Upon completion of the review of your claim by\nthe Administrator, you will be notified of any deficiencies in your claim (if\nnecessary) or of the claim determination. Claim determinations are made\nonly after a substantially complete claim has been submited.\n\nlo.

If\nyou believe you face exigent circumstances that warrant an expedited review\nof your claim, such as terminal illness or significant financial hardship, please\nindicate the situation on the Claim Form or atach a cover leter with your\nclaim submission with an explanation of the circumstances and contact the\nAdministrator at ClaimantServices@EpsteinVCP.com with the subject line\n“Expedite Request”. “Significant financial hardship” includes an imminent or\npending foreclosure or eviction proceeding, utility cut off, or other similar\ncircumstances, as demonstrated by appropriate documentation.\n\nll.If I submit a claim, will my information be kept confidential?\nThis Program is confidential. All of the information submited pursuant to\nthis Program will be used and disclosed only for purposes of processing and\nevaluating the claim and administering the Program and other Program-\nrelated work. No information provided by Claimants will be provided to the\nEstate except for the Claimant’s name and the date(s) and location(s) of the\nalleged abuse, for the sole purpose of processing and evaluating the claim and,\nfor purposes of the Release, the names of any other individual(s) to whom or\nby whom the Claimant alleges she was trafficked or sexually abused.

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or <span class=\"highlight\">inspection</span>, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation.

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the language,\ntwo areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language allouing her to\npublicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on the public record to\nthe media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein.\nSecond, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential Government witnesses and their\ncounsel from using discovery materials for any purpose other than preparing for the\ncriminal trial in this action. The Government has proposed contrary language on both of\nthese issues. For the follouing reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed\nprotective order Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the\ncourt may, for good cause, deny, restrict, or defer discovery or <span class=\"highlight\">inspection</span>, or grant other\nappropriate relief.\" The good cause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests,\nincluding whether dissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others...\nwhether the imposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the\npublic's interest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing good\ncause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4). First, the\nCourt finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause with regard to\nrestricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged victims and witnesses\nother than those who have publicly identified themselves in this litigation. As a general\nmater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific interest in protecting the privacy\nof alleged victims and witnesses in this case that supports restricting the disclosure of their\nidentities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging that as a baseline the protective order should\n\"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing\nor disseminating the identity of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the\ndiscovery materials\"); see also United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr-48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist.\nLEXIS l94426, at *ll (S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is\nsignificantly diminished for individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms.\nMaxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves.\nBut not all accusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or\ncontribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply\nmaking a public statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since\nsuch a statement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also allous\nthe Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be relevant... to\nPotential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the investigation and\npreparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This proposal adequately\nbalances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter notes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4,\nto the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the protective order for a specific\ninvestigative purpose, they can make applications to the Court on a case-by-case basis.\nSecond, restrictions on the ability of potential witnesses and their counsel to use discovery\nmaterials for purposes other than preparing for trial in this case are unwarranted.

OPINION & ORDER\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\nBoth parties have asked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on\nmost of the language, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on the public\nrecord to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein.\nSecond, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential Government witnesses and their\ncounsel from using discovery materials for any purpose other than preparing for the criminal trial\nin this action. The Government has proposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the\nfollouing reasons, the Court adopts the Government’s proposed protective order.\nUnder Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(d)(l), “[a]t any time the court may, for\ngood cause, deny, restrict, or defer discovery or <span class=\"highlight\">inspection</span>, or grant other appropriate relief.”\nThe good cause standard “requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others . . . whether the imposition of\nthe protective order would prejudice the defendant,” and “the public’s interest in the\ninformation.” United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party\nseeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing good cause. Cf Gambale v.

The Street.com,\n273 F.3d 222, 228-29 (2d Cir. 2ool) (reviewing the dis-\ntrict court’s order lifting its protective order covering\ndeposition testimony for abuse of discretion). “A dis-\ntrict court abuses or exceeds the discretion accorded to\nit when (l) its decision rests on an error of law (such\nas application of the wrong legal principle) or a clearly\nerroneous factual finding, or (2) its decision—though\nnot necessarily the product of a legal error or a clearly\nerroneous factual finding—cannot be located within\nthe range of permissible decisions.” Id.\n\nUnder the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,\nthe District Court is vested with broad discretion to\noversee the criminal discovery process, including en-\ntering protective orders “for good cause [that] deny, re-\nstrict, or defer discovery or <span class=\"highlight\">inspection</span>, or grant other\nappropriate relief.” Fed. R. Crim. P. l6(d).

Additionally, psychology and medical staff check on the\ndefendant daily, MDC legal staff are highly atuned to any complaints the defendant has raised,\nand follouing initial complaints about the defendant’s diet early in her incarceration, the MDC has\nensured that the defendant receives three full meals per day and has access to commissary from\nwhich she can supplement her diet.\n\nThe MDC has taken numerous steps to strike the balance between the security of the\ninstitution and providing the defendant with adequate time and resources to prepare her defense.\nIn that vein, many of the searches the defendant complains of—such as searches after every visit,\nsearches of her cell, pat douns when she is moved, and directing her to open her mouth for visual\n<span class=\"highlight\">inspection</span> (while the searching staff member is wearing a mask)—are the same searches to which\nevery other inmate is subjected for the security of the institution. MDC legal counsel has assured\nthe Government that MDC staff does not record or listen to the substance of the defendant’s calls\nand visits with legal counsel. To the extent MDC staff conducts additional searches or monitoring\nof the defendant, MDC legal counsel has indicated that those steps are necessary to maintain the\nsecurity of the institution and the defendant.\n\nWith respect to the defense concerns regarding COVID-l9, the Government recognizes, as\nit did in its initial bail briefing, that the virus presents a challenge at any jail facility. At least for\nthis defendant, the MDC’s precautionary measures appear to have worked. When the defendant\nwas potentially exposed to the virus, she was placed in quarantine, remained asymptomatic, tested\nnegative, and then was released from quarantine. As the Court found at the initial bail hearing, the\ndefendant has no underlying health conditions that would place her at greater risk of complications\nfrom COVID-l9. (Tr. 89). For that same reason, the Court should again reject the suggestion that\nthe pandemic warrants the defendant’s release.\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo95\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020117.jpg": "Caseeb2d-cre6o88GiAU Ant BecuunNdrt lo8 2 FileG6R2/23/2th gPage Lace l5\n\nFinally, the government’s argument that Ms. Maxwell could always flee to some country\nother than the United Kingdom and France holds her—and any defendant—to an impossible\nstandard, which is not the standard under the Bail Reform Act. (See Gov. Mem. at l9). By the\ngovernment’s reasoning, no defendant with financial means to travel could be granted bail,\nbecause there would always be a possibility that they could flee to another country (even if they\nhad no ties there), and there could never be an assurance that any extradition waiver would be\nenforced. Houever, “Section 3l42 does not seek ironclad guarantees.” United States v. Chen,\n82o F. Supp. l2o5, l2o8 (N.D. Cal. l992). To the extent that Ms. Maxwell’s ties to France and\nthe United Kingdom—where she has not lived for nearly 3o years—create a flight risk, her\nextradition waivers along with the substantial bail package proposed reasonably cure it.\n\nE. The Recent COVID Surge at MDC Further Justifies Bail\n\nThe government suggests that the Court ignore COVID concerns because Ms. Maxwell,\nthough quarantined because of contact with an officer who tested positive, did not become\ninfected. This ignores the daily (sometimes multiple) inspections of Ms. Maxwell’s mouth,\nwhich heightens her risk of contracting the deadly virus, which has nou surged to ll3 positive\ncases in the MDC. Further, Deputy Captain B. Houtz recently issued a memo stating that “[i]t\nhas not been determined whether legal calls and legal visits will continue.” As the Court is well\naware, legal visits with Ms. Maxwell already have been suspended. Should legal calls also be\ndiscontinued, her constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel will be further eroded.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court order her\nrelease on bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed.\n* iar inoontive Mv.

The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6.

The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial.

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the language,\ntwo areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language allouing her to\npublicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on the public record to\nthe media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein.\nSecond, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential Government witnesses and\ntheir counsel from using discovery materials for any purpose other than preparing for the\ncriminal trial in this action. The Government has proposed contrary language on both of\nthese issues. For the follouing reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed\nprotective order Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the\ncourt may, for good cause, deny, restrict, or defer discovery or <span class=\"highlight\">inspection</span>, or grant other\nappropriate relief.\" The good cause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests,\nincluding whether dissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others...\nwhether the imposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,” and \"the\npublic's interest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4). First,\nthe Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause with\nregard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged victims and\nwitnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this litigation. As a\ngeneral mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific interest in protecting the\nprivacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that supports restricting the\ndisclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging that as a baseline the\nprotective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and others on the\ndefense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity of any alleged victim or\npotential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see also United States v. Corley,\nNo. l3-cr-48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll (S.D.N-Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The\nDefense argues this interest is significantly diminished for individuals who have spoken\non the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, because they have voluntarily\nchosen to identify themselves. But not all accusations or public statements are equal.\nDeciding to participate in or contribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a far\ndifferent mater than simply making a public statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or\nJeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a statement might have occurred decades ago and\n\nhtps://ecf.nysd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/DktRpt.pl?2llo87ol522l896-L_l_o-l ll/ll3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o633\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022101.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 36 Filed o6/o9/2o Page5of9\narises where the Government conducts a joint investigation with another agency.” United States\nv.

The Correctional Systems Officer notified\nthe New York Police Department (NYPD) via the MCC New York institutional NYPD telephone. The\nCorrectional Systems Officer then informed NYPD that MCC New York needed an ambulance and medical\nassistance for one of the inmates. The New York City Fire Department and EMS arrived at MCC New York at\n6:43 a.m. and were escorted to the second-floor medical area. EMS departed MCC New York with Epstein\nand a BOP escort via ambulance and chase car to the local hospital at 7:lo a.m.\nThe Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that she was relieved as the Operations Lieutenant\nprior to 6 a.m. on August lo, 2ol9, but was still working on things like the Daily Activity Reports and\nLieutenant Logs that she did not get to finish during her shift. At some point, the Morning Watch\nOperations Lieutenant heard that there was a medical emergency in SHU, so she went to assist because she\nknew that inmates would need to be given food and other things would need to be done. The Morning\nWatch Operations Lieutenant estimated that she went to the SHU around 7 a.m. to help with the inmate\nmeals, and believed the Electronics Technician was also helping out. Noel was there, but she was not\nhelping with delivering food to the inmates. The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant said that after the\nmeals were delivered, she finished up and went home.\nAll MCC New York staff members who were interviewed by the OIG said they did not knou of any\ninformation suggesting that Epstein’s cause of death was something other than suicide. Additionally, no\ninmate provided the OIG with information suggesting that anyone assisted Epstein with taking his oun life\nor had any credible information suggesting that Epstein’s cause of death was something other than suicide.\nSome MCC New York staff told the OIG that Epstein’s death could have been prevented if, among other\nthings, Epstein had been assigned a new cellmate after Inmate 3’s departure and rounds and counts had\nbeen conducted in the SHU as required. Some witnesses also faulted MCC New York staffing shortages,\nwhich resulted in excessive overtime and meant that MCC New York staff members were often overtired\nduring their shifts. Other MCC New York staff members told the OIG that even if inmate safety and\naccountability measures had been property executed, an inmate who wanted to take his life would have\nfound a way to do so.\nB. Items Found in Epstein’s Cell on August lo Follouing His Death\nFollouing Epstein’s death, the BOP and FBI collected many of the items found inside Epstein’s cell. The FBI\ninspected the cell and retrieved what it believed to be relevant to its investigation into the cause of Epstein’s\ndeath, which included one torn sheet, miscellaneous papers, and an MP3 player. The FBI did not recover\nany weapons inside of the cell. After the FBI's <span class=\"highlight\">inspection</span>, the BOP recycled the linens from Epstein’s cell and\ncollected the remaining items, which included various over-the-counter medications, books (including\nreligious books), BOP pamphlets, toiletries, bateries, headphones, glasses, mail and envelopes, a broun\npaper bag, an orange homemade rope, AED pads, and a medical device.\n76\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23443\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023450.jpg": "recorded video was available for several of the institution's cameras, so she reported the mater to the\nCommunications Office, and the Electronics Technician arrived to assess the problem sometime before his\nshift was scheduled to end. The Electronics Technician told the OIG that he found that roughly half of the\ninstitution's approximately l5o cameras, which were assigned to record to DVR 2, were displaying a live\nvideo feed but were not recording.\nThe Electronics Technician told the OIG that, before Epstein’s death, no one was specifically tasked with\nensuring that video from the cameras was being recorded. The Electronics Technician said he therefore did\nnot perform any daily checks to ensure that video was being recorded. The Warden indicated that SIS staff\nare usually responsible for checking the system for recording functionality and reporting any problems to\nthe Communications Office. Houever, the SIS Lieutenant told the OIG that it was her belief that the\nElectronics Technician should have been checking the system daily to ensure it was recording. The OIG\nfound that there are no BOP policies that specifically state that institutional staff must perform periodic\nchecks to ensure the camera system is fully functional or that security camera systems have the capacity to\nrecord.*° The Facility Manager told the OIG that since Epstein’s death, he nou checks to ensure that all\ncameras and the recording system are working on a daily basis, and he subsequently provides a report\nabout the status of the system to the facility's executive staff, the SIS, and the electronics technicians.\n\nB. Response on August 8 and 9 to Discovery of the Recording Failure\nOn August 8, follouing discovery of the recording failure, Company l service request records reflect that the\nElectronics Technician contacted a Company l technical support representative, who ultimately determined\nthat two hard drives within DVR 2 had failed. According to the Electronics Technician and the Company l\nservice request record, the Company l representative informed the Electronics Technician that the two\ndrives needed to be replaced and DVR 2 needed to be rebuilt in order for the cameras to record again. The\nElectronics Technician told the OIG that he informed a Company l Technician that he had to obtain the\ndrives from MCC New York's Computer Services Manager. The Electronics Technician further stated that he\nleft the institution at the end of his shift and did not obtain the hard drives and did not continue to work on\nthe mater. The Electronics Technician told the OIG he had “no idea” why he did not stay at the facility to\nresolve the problem that day, but he noted for the OIG that he had not historically been required to stay\nafter his shift ended to work on such maters, and even if he had begun working on the DVR that day, he\nwould not have completed the work on August 8 due to the time the rebuilding process takes.>\"\nThe OIG found that the Electronics Technician’s immediate supervisor, the Facility Manager, was on leave\nthat week and therefore was not told on August 8 about the DVR recording failure. The Facility Manager\nconfirmed that he did not learn about the camera problem until days after Epstein’s death. The Electronics\nTechnician told the OIG that he did not report the problem to the Lock and Security Supervisor, who was the\nActing Facility Manager in the Facility Manager's absence. The SIS Lieutenant told the OIG that after the\nElectronics Technician had examined the system on August 8, the Electronics Technician informed her that\ncameras were not recording and said, “I'm going to stay and do overtime tonight.” Based on his comment,\n5° For example, BOP Program Statement 55oo.l5, Correctional Services Manual, states generally that the Warden must\nestablish a security <span class=\"highlight\">inspection</span> system that involves all departments but does not specifically address security camera\nsystems. This program statement is a restricted policy that is not released to the public in its entirety.\n\n5’ According to open source information on digital data storage system rebuilds, the rebuilding process can take up to\nseveral days to complete depending on the number of hard drives that were damaged and the storage capacity of each.\n83\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2345o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023463.jpg": "the L Tier during that timeframe other than the inmates who were locked in their assigned cells on that tier\nof the SHU.\nWe also noted that the surveillance camera in the L Tier, as shoun in the photograph in Figure 6.7, was in\nplain view of the inmates and therefore inmates would have been aware that any hallway movements,\nincluding into or out of Epstein’s cell, were being live streamed and could be monitored, even if,\nunbeknounst to them, the Digital Video Recorder (DVR) system was not recording the live stream at that\ntime. As the OIG has noted in numerous prior reports regarding the BOP’s camera system, BOP staff and\ninmates are aware of where prison cameras are located and often engage in wrongdoing in locations where\nthey knou cameras are not located.°® Additionally, the OIG did not observe on the recorded video of the\nSHU common area that Noel and Thomas, who were seated at the desk at the SHU Officers’ Station\nimmediately outside the L tier during that time period, at any time rose from their seats or approached the\nL Tier. We additionally found that Thomas's and Noel's reaction on the morning of August lo upon finding\nEpstein hanging in his cell, as described to us by Thomas, Noel, the responding Lieutenant, and inmates,\nwas consistent with their being unaware of any potential harm to Epstein prior to Thomas entering Epstein’s\ncell at about 6:3o a.m. on August lo.\nWe further noted that Epstein had previously been placed on suicide watch and psychological observation\ndue to the events of July 23, 2ol9; that numerous nooses made from prison bed sheets were found in his\ncell on the morning of August lo; and that he had signed a new Last Will and Testament on August 8, 2 days\nbefore he died. No weapons were recovered from Epstein’s cell after his death. Additionally, the inmates\nwho were interviewed consistently reported that on the evening Epstein died the SHU staff did not\nsystematically conduct the required rounds and counts, which was one of the primary mechanisms for the\nSHU staff to ensure the safety and security of inmates housed in the SHU. Asa result, Epstein was\nunmonitored and locked alone in his cell for hours with an excess amount of linens, which provided an\nopportunity for him to commit suicide.\nFinally, the Medical Examiner who performed the autopsy detailed for the OIG why Epstein’s injuries were\nmore consistent with, and indicative of, a suicide by hanging rather than a homicide by strangulation. The\nMedical Examiner also told the OIG that the ligature furrou was too broad to have been caused by the\nelectrical cord of the medical device in Epstein’s cell and that blood toxicology tests revealed no medications\nor illegal substances were in Epstein’s system. The Medical Examiner also noted the absence of debris\nunder Epstein’s fingernails, marks on his hands, contusions to his knuckles, or bruises on his body that\nwould have indicated Epstein had been a struggle, which would be expected if Epstein’s death had been a\nhomicide by strangulation.\nThis is not the first time that the OIG has found significant job performance and management failures on\nthe part of BOP personnel and widespread disregard of BOP policies that are designed to ensure that\ninmates are safe, secure, and in good health. For instance, the OIG’s December 2o22 investigation and\nreview of the BOP’s handling of the transfer of James “Whitey” Bulger identified serious job performance and\n56 U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) OIG, Notification of Needed Upgrades to the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Security Camera\nSystem, Management Advisory Memorandum 22-ool (October 2o2l); U.S. DOJ OIG, Audit of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’\nManagement and Oversight of its Chaplaincy Services Program, 2l-o9l (July 2o2l); U.S. DOJ OIG, Review of the Federal\nBureau of Prisons’ Contraband Interdiction Efforts, Evaluation and Inspections Report l6-o5 (June 2ol6).\n\n96\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23463\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023464.jpg": "management failures at multiple levels within the BOP.*” Similar to the Bulger report, the numerous and\nserious transgressions that occurred in this mater came to light largely because they involved a high-profile\ninmate. The fact that serious deficiencies occurred in connection with high-profile inmates like Epstein and\nBulger is especially concerning given that the BOP would presumably take particular care in handling the\ncustody and care of such inmates.\nRegretably, the OIG has encountered similar issues on many other occasions. For example, the OIG has\ninvestigated numerous allegations related to the falsification of official BOP documentation concerning\ninmate counts and rounds, several of which have resulted in criminal prosecution. The OIG currently has\ntwo open investigations into allegations of falsified inmate count and round documentation, each involving\nan inmate death (by suicide and homicide) or escape from a BOP facility.\nThis investigation and review also revealed the direct impact of insufficient staffing levels on inmate safety.\nWitnesses repeatedly told the OIG that counts, rounds, cell searches, and other methods of inmate\naccountability were not undertaken because correctional staff were working multiple shifts—including one\nstaff member who worked 24-hours straight—and were tired and overwhelmed with other duties. As\ndiscussed in greater detail in our recommendations, the OIG has repeatedly found the need for BOP to\naddress staffing shortages. Most recently, in March 2o23, the OIG found that the coronavirus disease 2ol9\n(COVID-l9) pandemic exacerbated the effects of preexisting BOP medical and nonmedical staffing\nshortages, an issue the OIG has identified as a concern for the BOP since at least 2ol5.°°\nFurther, the OIG has repeatedly found that BOP personnel have not consistently been atentive to the needs\nof inmates at risk for suicide. In this investigation, that inatention manifested in the failure of MCC\nNew York staff and supervisors to ensure that Epstein was assigned a cellmate as required by the MCC\nNew York Psychology Department directive issued after the July 23, 2ol9 incident in which Epstein was\ndiscovered in his cell with an orange cloth around his neck. In a March 2o23 report, the OIG found that BOP\npsychology staff did not assess the suitability of single-cell assignments for five of the seven inmates who\ndied by suicide while in COVID-l9 quarantine units between March 2o2o and April 2o2l.°? The OIG’s 2ol7\nreport on the BOP’s use of restrictive housing for inmates with mental illness also noted that single-celling\nmay present risks to inmate mental health, and both of the recommendations from that report regarding\nthe use and oversight of single-celling remain open as of March 2o23.\nLastly, as discussed in greater detail in the conclusions and recommendations that follou, the persistent\ndeficiencies of the BOP’s security camera systems are well documented and long-standing.\n57 U.S. DOJ OIG, Investigation and Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Handling of the Transfer of Inmate James “Whitey”\nBulger, 23-oo7 (December 2o22).\n*8 U.S. DOJ OIG, Capstone Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Response to the Coronavirus Disease 2ol9 Pandemic,\nEvaluation and Inspections Division A-2o2o-oll (March 2o23) (Capstone Report).\n5° Capstone Report.\n6 U.S. DOJ OIG, Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Use of Restrictive Housing for Inmates with Mental Illness, Evaluation\nand Inspections Report l7-o5 (July 2ol7).\n\n97\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23464\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023477.jpg": "MCC New York's failure to ensure that its security camera system was fully functional and make timely\nrepairs is consistent with the OIG’s previous observations regarding weaknesses in the BOP’s overall system\nof security cameras. Dating back to at least 2ol3, the OIG has repeatedly observed inadequacies in the\nBOP’s overall system of security cameras, including inoperable cameras, an insufficient number of cameras,\npoor video quality, and inadequate video storage. In a 2ol6 report on the BOP’s contraband interdiction\nefforts, the OIG identified specific deficiencies with the camera system, and recommended that the BOP\nevaluate the system to determine needed upgrades.® In response to the 2ol6 recommendation, the BOP\nassessed the camera systems at each institution over the next several years and determined that 45 of its\nl22 institutions, including MCC New York, required camera system upgrades. The BOP worked to upgrade\nthe systems at those 45 institutions between 2ol9 and 2o2l. In June 2o2l, the BOP reported that it had\nupdated all cameras at the 45 institutions with the latest software and equipment, and that it had installed\nadditional cameras to bolster surveillance. Houever, as reported in an October 2o2l Management Advisory\nMemorandum issued to the BOP, the OIG analyzed the reported upgrades at the 45 institutions and found\nthat the BOP had addressed some but not all of the deficiencies described in the 2ol6 OIG report. In its\n2o2l Management Advisory Memorandum, the OIG recommended that the BOP develop a comprehensive\nstrategic plan for transitioning to a fully digital security camera system. The BOP has provided the OIG with\na strategic plan that includes estimated cost projections and timelines for addressing the camera system\nconcerns and completing the system upgrades.® As of 2o23, the OIG’s 2o2l recommendation\n\nremains open.\n\nThe BOP’s failure to address the issue of functional security camera systems across the agency and at\nindividual institutions presents an ongoing risk to the safety of BOP staff and inmates and has the potential\nto impair the investigation of and accountability for staff and inmate misconduct. It is imperative that the\nBOP prioritize the expeditious expansion and modernization of its security camera system to mitigate\nsecurity risks.\n\nI. Recommendations\n\nThe OIG investigation identified multiple shortcomings in BOP policies that should be further assessed to\nensure the BOP can more effectively handle issues that arise in connection with the custody and care of\ninmates. The recommendations address issues related to and the custody and care of inmates at risk for\nsuicide; measures designed to increase safety, such as staff rounds, inmate counts, and cell searches; and\ninstitutional security camera systems and staffing shortages, two longstanding issues for the BOP.\n\nl. The BOP should implement a process for assigning a cellmate follouing suicide watch\nor psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular\nindividual or security considerations.\n\nAccording to the MCC New York Institution Supplement policy to the Suicide Prevention Program Policy\nStatement 5324.o8, inmates discharged from suicide watch will be assigned a cellmate.

The BOP should continue to develop and implement plans to address staffing\n\nshortages at its prisons.\nSince at least 2ol5, the OIG has repeatedly found the need for BOP to address staffing shortages, including\nmedical staffing shortages.® This investigation and review revealed the direct impact of staffing deficiencies\non inmate safety. For example, the Material Handler worked three consecutive shifts—24 hours straight—\non August 9, 2ol9, which was certainly a contributory cause to the lack of adequate means of accounting for\ninmate location and wellbeing in the SHU. The Material Handler told the OIG that no one did the lo p.m.\nSHU inmate count because they were tired. Additionally, the OIG’s investigation and review found that in\nconnection with MCC New York's upgrade of its security camera system, the BOP’s Northeast Regional Office\narranged for technicians from other BOP institutions to perform temporary duty (TDY) assignments to MCC\nNew York to perform necessary mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and wiring work. Yet, during the course of\nthe TDY rotations, work was not consistently conducted on the camera upgrade because sometimes TDY\nstaff were used to cover shortages at MCC New York's custody posts. Without adequate staffing, the BOP\ncannot fulfill its mandate to ensure safe and secure correctional facilities. The OIG therefore recommends\nthat the BOP continue to develop and implement plans to address staffing shortages at its institutions.\n\n7. The BOP should evaluate its cell search procedures and make changes as may be\n\nappropriate to improve those procedures through policy, training, or other measures.\nThe OIG’s investigation and review found that there was an excessive amount of linens in Epstein’s cell at\nthe time of his death. BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders require that SHU cells be searched,\nbut they do not specifically address the issue of excessive bed linens, which the Captain told the OIG\npresent a safety hazard because an inmate can use them to harm themselves or escape from the\ninstitution.
