The new victims’ participation in this\ncase is important because it appears that the Government intends to raise a factual defense that\nsomehou it did keep Jane Doe #l and Jane Doe #2 properly informed of what was happening in\nthe criminal prosecution. Of course, if four victims all testify consistently that they were not\nproperly informed by the Government (as we believe they will), that provides a stronger case for\na CVRA violation.\nIn addition, Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4’s participation is relevant to a defense the\nCourt has alloued the Government to raise. The Court has previously ruled that the victims’\nrequest for rescission of the NPA “implicates a fact-sensitive equitable defense which must be\nconsidered in the historical factual context of the entire <span class=\"highlight\">interface</span> between Epstein, the relevant\nprosecutorial authorities and the federal offense victims — including an assessment of the\nallegation of a deliberate conspiracy between Epstein and federal prosecutors to keep the victims\nin the dark on the pendency of negotiations between Epstein and federal authorities until well\nafter the fact and presentation of the non-prosecution agreement to them as a fait accompli.” DE\nl89 at l2 n.6 (emphasis added). Jane Doe #3’s and Jane Doe #4’s participation in this case will\nhelp to shou what the “entire <span class=\"highlight\">interface</span>” was between the Government and the victims and thus\nto respond to the Government’s estoppel arguments as well as other defenses that it appears to be\npreparing to raise. See, e.g., DE 62 (52-page response from the Government to the victim’s\nsummary judgment motion, raising numerous factually-based and other arguments against the\nvictim’s position).\n9\nGIUFFRE oo4296\nCONFIDENTIAL\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3745", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005944.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page 34 of 45\n\nDisclosure Paterns in Child Sexual Abuse l67\npressure for young people by providing opportunities to tell may be needed to\nhelp young people tell more promptly.

MOE: Your Honor, I think at a minimum we propose\n3 some additional follou-up guess for the juror about her role,\n4 whether she interfaces with folks dealing with compliance,\n\niy which is within the scope of what this witness does, whether\n\n6 there would be any issues about hearing testimony about the\n\n7 financial institution where she works.\n\n8 We have not flagged for our witness that there is a\n\n9 juror, of course, who works with the institution, so it's hard\nlo for us to gauge whether they may have overlapped or whether\n\nll they would recognize one another in the courtroom. So I\n\nl2 recognize it would be difficult to probe this issue without\n\nl3 creating an issue, but we think at a minimum a question about\nl4 sort of her role and any issues about being fair or discomfort\nl5 about witnesses who are testifying from the financial\n\nl6 institution might address this issue.\n\nl7 THE COURT: Who will I hear from?\n\nl8 MS. STERNHEIM: You'll hear from me, Judge.\n\nl9 I think it is a litle late. The publicly available\n2o information would have revealed that there are other people who\n2l are in that same institution or have been affiliated with that\n22 institution, some of which were excused, and at least one that\n23 is still here. The government can exercise a challenge if it\n24 wishes. But I think it's unnecessary. And it flags something\n25 inappropriately at this stage of the game. It will highlight\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooll63o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00031050.jpg": "f 2 — eee ee ee ee kn ee ee Re rete Bae Be\n> >Date: 9/ol/o6 PALM BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT Page: L\nTime: l3:38:o6 Incident Report Program: CMS3olL\nCase Number . : l-o3-ool498 SPECIAL NOTES =:\nOccur From Date: lo/o5/o3 o824 Occur To Date : lo/o5/o3 o824\nReport Date .: lo/o5/o3 o845 Day Of Week . : Sunday\nCommon/Location: 358 EL BRILLO wy\nCity... . . 3: PALM BEACH, FL\nLocation Type : RESIDENCE-SINGLE FAMILY\nBeat Assignment: SHIFT 2 Map Reference : lo\nDept Class . . :; BURGLARY RESIDENCE Report Officer : DESMARAIS, WENDY\nCase Status . : EXCEPTIONALLY CLEARED Case Status Dt : lo/l5/o3\nSupervisory Dt.: FRICK, RONALD lo/o5/o3\nEntry Date . . : OREGERO, LAURA lo/o6/o3\nNames? .... i Property? .. :\nVehicles? .. : Offenses? ..:\nNarrative? ..: Related Cases? :\nInterfaces? . :\nKEKACKAKK PROPER T Y¥ INFORMATION # TL RRR HKEKEEKKKKKHREK\nCase number . : l-o3-ool498\nCategory ... : **MISC OR UNFOUNDED PROP **\nDescription .: PISTOL COL6E 7 ae ates\nSerial number : Make ... . . : GLOCK\nModel ....: UCR Prop Type : FIREARMS\nProperty type ; HANDGUN Tngureag? . -. .:\nTnsured by .. : NCIC number. :\n{.
