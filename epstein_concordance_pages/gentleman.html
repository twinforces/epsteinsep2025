They are,\n4 contrary to what many people think, rarely apart. I almost\n\n5 always see them together. Jeffrey and Ghislaine comolement\n\n6 each other really well, and I cannot remember one without the\n\n7 other. On top of being great partners, they are also the best\n8 of friends.\n\n9 A couple for eleven years. Great partners. Rarely\n\nlo apart. Best of friends. Does that sound like a personal\n\nll assistant compartmentalized from Jeffrey Epstein's life? Of\n\nl2 course not.

And, ladies and\n\nl5 gentlemen, when you're with someone for eleven years, you knou\nl6 what they like. Epstein liked underage girls. He liked to\n\nl7 touch underage girls. Maxwell knew it.\n\nl8 Make no mistake. Maxwell was crucial to the whole\n\nl9 scheme. Epstein could not have done this alone. A single\n2o middle-aged man who invites a teenage girl to visit his ranch,\n2l to come to his house, to fly to New York, is creepy. That sets\n22 off alarm bells.

You remember the\n\n2 disturbing warning in that manual. Here it is: Remember that\n3 you see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing, except to answer a\n4 question directed at you. Respect their privacy.\n\n5 You learned that this pouerful warning to employees\n\n6 was effective. Here's Mr. Alessi's testimony about that. He\n\n7 explained that this rule was a kind of warning that he was\n\n8 supposed to be blind, deaf, and dumb, to say nothing of their\n\n9 lives.\n\nlo Ladies and gentlemen, nou that you've sat through this\nll entire trial, you knou exactly why Maxwell told workers in the\nl2 house to see nothing, hear nothing, and say nothing. It's\n\nl3 because she was Epstein's partner in crime. And in that house,\nl4 behind closed doors, Maxwell and Epstein were commiting\n\nl5 horrifying crimes.\n\nl6 That brings us to the second reason. The second\n\nl7 reason that you knou that Maxwell is guilty is that she ran the\nl8 same playbook over and over and over again as she exploited\n\nl9 young girls. The similarities between what happened to Jane\n2o and Annie and Carolyn and Kate are incredibly pouerful evidence\n2l of the defendant's guilt. So I want to talk to you about the\n22 playbook that Maxwell ran again and again and again.\n23 Before we talk about this, remember that you heard\n24 from Dr. Rocchio, an expert psychologist who specializes in\n25 treating victims of sexual abuse for the trauma they suffered\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool44l5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014419.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page l9 of 257 2852\nLCKVMAX2 Summations —- Ms. Moe\n\nl to sexualized massages.

They all had\n\n7 very specific memories about that.\n\n8 Here's Carolyn's testimony about that: You remember\n\n9 that she told you about Maxwell coming into the massage room\n\nlo when Carolyn was naked. Maxwell touched Carolyn's breasts and\nll told her that she had a good body. Jane told you about Maxwell\nl2 touching her breasts too during sexual encounters with Maxwell\nl3 and Epstein during so-called massages.\n\nl4 Maxwell did it to Annie, too.

In other words, if\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool4455", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014456.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 56 of 257 2889\nLCKCmax3 Summation — Ms. Moe\n\nl you find that Epstein commited these crimes and that Maxwell\n\n2 assisted him, she is just as guilty as if she had commited\n\n3 those acts herself. And we talked about the overwhelming\n\n4 evidence that Maxwell aided and abeted these crimes. She was\n5 an essential accomplice, complicit in an extensive scheme to\n\n6 abuse young girls.\n\n7 So let's talk first about Count Two, which is\n\n8 enticement to engage in an illegal sexual activity. This count\n9 is about Jane and hou Maxwell and Epstein enticed her to travel\nlo in interstate commerce, in other words, to go across state\n\nll lines to New York to be abused.\n\nl2 The first element of that crime is that the defendant\nl3 knouingly persuaded, or induced, or enticed, or coerced Jane to\nl4 travel in interstate commerce. In other words, did the\n\nl5 defendant in some way cause Jane to travel across state lines.\nl6 You knou that Maxwell induced Jane to travel because\nl7 Jane told you about traveling with Maxwell to New York. Jane\nl8 flew on commercial flights and also on the private jets. She\nl9 told you about hou Maxwell assisted with her travel\n2o arrangements, and Juan Alessi confirmed this, because he\n2l remembered driving Jane with Maxwell, Epstein, and Jane right\n22 up to the plane. He watched them board together.\n23 Ladies and gentlemen, Jane didn't end up in New York\n24 by accident, it was a direct result of Maxwell's actions,\n25 aiding and abeting Epstein as part of an ongoing patern of\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool4456", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014459.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 59 of 257 2892\nLCKCmax3 Summation — Ms. Moe\n\nl Maxwell intended for Jane to be sexually abused on these trips.\n2 I want to emphasize here that there is no requirement\n3 that abuse in New York actually happened or that the defendant\n4 was the one who commited the abuse. The crime is transporting\n5 Jane with the intent that she will be abused.\n\n6 Ladies and gentlemen, when Maxwell was helping arrange\n7 travel for Jane, when she got on that plane with Jane, Maxwell\n8 knew exactly what she was doing, and she knew exactly what\n\n9 Epstein was going to do to Jane. The crime happened the moment\nlo they crossed state lines. And to be very clear, when Epstein\nll flew Jane to New York and Maxwell aided and abeted him, that's\nl2 enough, too.\n\nl3 The last element is that the defendant knew Jane was\nl4 less than l7 years old. And you knou that the defendant knew\nl5 that Jane was under l7, ladies and gentlemen, she met her at a\nl6 summer camo for kids. She was too young to drive. Maxwell\n\nl7 knew this girl for years, when she was l4 and l5 and l6. She\nl8 would talk to Jane where they would spend time together.\n\nl9 Maxwell absolutely knew that she was under l7.\n2o And through all these elements, when we're talking\nal about the defendant's knouledge and intent, I want you to think\n22 about Kate. She told you about hou the defendant asked her to\n23 deliver tea to Epstein wearing a schoolgirl outfit. That is\n24 striking evidence that Maxwell knew Jeffrey Epstein had a\n25 sexual preference for schoolgirls. And after Kate delivered\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4459", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014460.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 6o of 257 2893\nLCKCmax3 Summation — Ms. Moe\n\nl tea in that schoolgirl outfit and Epstein initiated sexual\n\n2 contact with Kate, later that day, Maxwell asked Kate if she\n\n3 had fun. Maxwell told Kate that she was a good girl.\n\n4 Kate also told you about hou Maxwell complained about\n5 Epstein's need to have sex three times a day, hou Maxwell was\n\n6 constantly looking for someone to give him bloujobs. That\n\n7 makes it crystal clear exactly what Maxwell intended when she\n\n8 was taking Jane on these trips. Jane was there to satisfy\n\n9 Epstein's constant need for sexual gratification. The evidence\nlo proves to you that Maxwell is guilty on Count Four.\n\nll Nou let's talk about Count Six, it's sex trafficking\nl2 an individual under age l8. This count is about Carolyn.\n\nl3 The first element is that the defendant knouingly\n\nl4 recruited, enticed, harbored, transported, provided, or\n\nl5 obtained Carolyn. You heard about hou the defendant called\n\nl6 Carolyn for massage appointments with Epstein. She was\n\nl7 recruiting, enticing, providing, and obtaining Carolyn every\n\nl8 single time she did that.\n\nl9 The second element is that the defendant knew that\n2o Carolyn was under age l8. Ladies and gentlemen, Carolyn was a\nal l4-year-old girl. She came to the house over and over again\n22 and interacted with Maxwell. She talked about her home life,\n23 she told Maxwell she was too young to travel, that her mother\n24 wouldn't let her go on trips. She was a girl who had just\n25 dropped out of middle school. There just can't be any question\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool446o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014470.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 7o of 257 29o3\nLCKVMAX4 Summation — Ms. Moe\n\nl the facts of this case.

They are,\n4 contrary to what many people think, rarely apart. I almost\n\n5 always see them together. Jeffrey and Ghislaine comolement\n\n6 each other really well, and I cannot remember one without the\n\n7 other. On top of being great partners, they are also the best\n8 of friends.\n\n9 A couple for eleven years. Great partners. Rarely\n\nlo apart. Best of friends. Does that sound like a personal\n\nll assistant compartmentalized from Jeffrey Epstein's life? Of\n\nl2 course not. What Maxwell described in this essay is the\n\nl3 relationship that you heard throughout this entire trial.\n\nl4 Close partners who operated together. And, ladies and\n\nl5 gentlemen, when you're with someone for eleven years, you knou\nl6 what they like. Epstein liked underage girls. He liked to\n\nl7 touch underage girls. Maxwell knew it.\n\nl8 Make no mistake. Maxwell was crucial to the whole\n\nl9 scheme. Epstein could not have done this alone. A single\n2o middle-aged man who invites a teenage girl to visit his ranch,\n2l to come to his house, to fly to New York, is creepy. That sets\n22 off alarm bells.

You remember the\n\n2 disturbing warning in that manual. Here it is: Remember that\n3 you see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing, except to answer a\n4 question directed at you. Respect their privacy.\n\n5 You learned that this pouerful warning to employees\n\n6 was effective. Here's Mr. Alessi's testimony about that. He\n\n7 explained that this rule was a kind of warning that he was\n\n8 supposed to be blind, deaf, and dumb, to say nothing of their\n\n9 lives.\n\nlo Ladies and gentlemen, nou that you've sat through this\nll entire trial, you knou exactly why Maxwell told workers in the\nl2 house to see nothing, hear nothing, and say nothing. It's\n\nl3 because she was Epstein's partner in crime. And in that house,\nl4 behind closed doors, Maxwell and Epstein were commiting\n\nl5 horrifying crimes.\n\nl6 That brings us to the second reason. The second\n\nl7 reason that you knou that Maxwell is guilty is that she ran the\nl8 same playbook over and over and over again as she exploited\n\nl9 young girls. The similarities between what happened to Jane\n2o and Annie and Carolyn and Kate are incredibly pouerful evidence\n2l of the defendant's guilt. So I want to talk to you about the\n22 playbook that Maxwell ran again and again and again.\n23 Before we talk about this, remember that you heard\n24 from Dr. Rocchio, an expert psychologist who specializes in\n25 treating victims of sexual abuse for the trauma they suffered\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool7o36", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00017040.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page l9 of 257 2852\nLCKVMAX2 Summations —- Ms. Moe\n\nl to sexualized massages. Again and again throughout this trial,\n2 you heard about hou these girls were asked to perform\n\n3 sexualized massages on Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n4 While we're talking about physical touch, let me just\na pause here and point out that Annie, Carolyn, and Jane all\n\n6 testified that Maxwell touched their breasts. They all had\n\n7 very specific memories about that.\n\n8 Here's Carolyn's testimony about that: You remember\n\n9 that she told you about Maxwell coming into the massage room\n\nlo when Carolyn was naked. Maxwell touched Carolyn's breasts and\nll told her that she had a good body. Jane told you about Maxwell\nl2 touching her breasts too during sexual encounters with Maxwell\nl3 and Epstein during so-called massages.\n\nl4 Maxwell did it to Annie, too. Here's her testimony\n\nl5 about that. Here's what she said about hou that made her feel:\nl6 I was very uncomfortable and fearful and wanted to get\nl7 off the table, that massage table, and wanted it to be over\n\nl8 with.\n\nl9 Ladies and gentlemen, Maxwell touched these girls'\n2o bodies.

And we talked about the overwhelming\n\n4 evidence that Maxwell aided and abeted these crimes. She was\n5 an essential accomplice, complicit in an extensive scheme to\n\n6 abuse young girls.\n\n7 So let's talk first about Count Two, which is\n\n8 enticement to engage in an illegal sexual activity. This count\n9 is about Jane and hou Maxwell and Epstein enticed her to travel\nlo in interstate commerce, in other words, to go across state\n\nll lines to New York to be abused.\n\nl2 The first element of that crime is that the defendant\nl3 knouingly persuaded, or induced, or enticed, or coerced Jane to\nl4 travel in interstate commerce. In other words, did the\n\nl5 defendant in some way cause Jane to travel across state lines.\nl6 You knou that Maxwell induced Jane to travel because\nl7 Jane told you about traveling with Maxwell to New York. Jane\nl8 flew on commercial flights and also on the private jets. She\nl9 told you about hou Maxwell assisted with her travel\n2o arrangements, and Juan Alessi confirmed this, because he\n2l remembered driving Jane with Maxwell, Epstein, and Jane right\n22 up to the plane.

The crime is transporting\n5 Jane with the intent that she will be abused.\n\n6 Ladies and gentlemen, when Maxwell was helping arrange\n7 travel for Jane, when she got on that plane with Jane, Maxwell\n8 knew exactly what she was doing, and she knew exactly what\n\n9 Epstein was going to do to Jane. The crime happened the moment\nlo they crossed state lines. And to be very clear, when Epstein\nll flew Jane to New York and Maxwell aided and abeted him, that's\nl2 enough, too.\n\nl3 The last element is that the defendant knew Jane was\nl4 less than l7 years old. And you knou that the defendant knew\nl5 that Jane was under l7, ladies and gentlemen, she met her at a\nl6 summer camo for kids. She was too young to drive. Maxwell\n\nl7 knew this girl for years, when she was l4 and l5 and l6.

Maxwell told Kate that she was a good girl.\n\n4 Kate also told you about hou Maxwell complained about\n5 Epstein's need to have sex three times a day, hou Maxwell was\n\n6 constantly looking for someone to give him bloujobs. That\n\n7 makes it crystal clear exactly what Maxwell intended when she\n\n8 was taking Jane on these trips. Jane was there to satisfy\n\n9 Epstein's constant need for sexual gratification. The evidence\nlo proves to you that Maxwell is guilty on Count Four.\n\nll Nou let's talk about Count Six, it's sex trafficking\nl2 an individual under age l8. This count is about Carolyn.\n\nl3 The first element is that the defendant knouingly\n\nl4 recruited, enticed, harbored, transported, provided, or\n\nl5 obtained Carolyn. You heard about hou the defendant called\n\nl6 Carolyn for massage appointments with Epstein. She was\n\nl7 recruiting, enticing, providing, and obtaining Carolyn every\n\nl8 single time she did that.\n\nl9 The second element is that the defendant knew that\n2o Carolyn was under age l8. Ladies and gentlemen, Carolyn was a\nal l4-year-old girl. She came to the house over and over again\n22 and interacted with Maxwell. She talked about her home life,\n23 she told Maxwell she was too young to travel, that her mother\n24 wouldn't let her go on trips. She was a girl who had just\n25 dropped out of middle school.

Ladies and gentlemen, which would stand out more in\n\nl6 your mind, hou old you were on Mike Wallace's birthday or hou\nl7 old you were the first time a middle-aged man molested you? It\nl8 is obvious that Jane remembers these core events clearly, and\nl9 that is what maters.\n2o And hypothetically, let's just say the defense was\n2l right. Let's just say that she got the timing of her first\n22 meeting wrong, that it was actually that last summer when she\n23 turned l6 in l996, and you knou that she knew them by the time\n24 she was l6 because you saw the flight records puting her on\n25 those planes with defendant and Epstein going to New York when\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool7l92", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00017193.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page l72 of 257 3oo6\nLCKCmax7 Rebutal - Ms. Comey\n\nl she was l6.

That first day was a scarring memory for Carolyn, and\nll she remembers Maxwell as a fixture in her experiences at the\n\nl2 Palm Beach house, like the stuffing at Thanksgiving, there\n\nl3 every time.\n\nl4 The defense is very focused on the peripheral details\nl5 that got mixed up for Carolyn between her earlier statements\n\nl6 and her trial testimony more than a decade later.

Given hou consistent their\n\n© accounts are with each other and with the other witnesses in\n\n6 this case, that would mean that at least eight people -- Jane,\n7 Kate, Carolyn, Annie, Dave, Shawn, Mat, and Juan Alessi -- all\n8 are part of a massive conspiracy to frame the defendant.

Remember, the defense's theory is that\n\nl6 the incentive to frame Maxwell arose after Epstein died in\n\nl7 2ol9. So this supposed frame job was hatched in 2ol9, meaning\nl8 Carolyn had to get in a time machine, go back to 2oo9 and\n\nl9 sprinkle in a couple references to Maxwell in her deposition.\n2o And then Annie had to borrou that time machine, go back to\n2l 2oo6, and tell the FBI about hou Maxwell touched her breast\n22 during a massage.\n23 Ladies and gentlemen, that's fiction.

Blaming herself, Virginia began to get into\ntrouble Aged ll, she was sent to live with an aunt but repeatedly ran away.\nLiving on the streets, she was beaten up and slept with at least two older men in return for food. ‘Twas a\npaedophile’s dream, she says.\nThree years jater, she was reunited with her family and started a new life with her father who had moved\nto Palm Beach,\nFlorida, where he was maintenance manager at Donald Trump’s country club, Mar-a-Lago.\n|\nVirginia got a part-time job as a changing room assistant -which is where, soon after her l5th birthday, |\nshe met Ghislaine Maxwell, who invited her to work as Epstein’s personal masseuse.\n‘l was wearing my uniform — a white miniskirt and a skin-tight white polo top - when I was approached by |\nGhislaine,’ Virginia says.\nI\n‘| told her | wanted to become a masseuse and she said she worked for a very wealthy <span class=\"highlight\">gentleman</span> who\nwas looking for a travelling masseuse.\nI'd get training and be paid well.'Virginia’s father gave his blessing, believing his daughter was being\nhanded the opportunity to learn a skill and to work for a wealthy and respectable employer. :\nHe drove her to Epstein’s pink mansion on the Palm Beach waterfront — he also ouns a nine-storey home\nin New York, the city’s biggest private residence; a 7,5oo-acre ranch called ‘Zorro’ in New Mexico and\nLitle Saint James, a private 7o- acre atoll in the US Virgin Islands. :\na o3956-l277\nhtp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-l36lo39/Prince-Andrew-girl-l7-sex-offender-frie... 3/l6/Zoll\nCT  DOG=OGR-ooo29o55", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00030293.jpg": "> Case 9:o8-cv-8oll9-KAM Document 3o5-4 Entered on FLSD Docket o9/l7/2oo9 Peaggbof af 2\n| “~\n.

Those males were identified as Janusz Banasiak, Daniel\nEstes, and Mark Zeff. As other members of the police department\ncleared the home, I kept watch over these three males. Once the house\nwas cleared, those males were turned over to Detective Recarey.\nDetective Dicks and I were assigned to assist in the search of the\nmain house, the cabana and the servant's quarters. We started in the\ngarage. All areas of the garage were searched to include four\nvehicles. These vehicles were three black Mercedes Benz cars\nregistered to Jeffrey Epstein. The fourth vehicle was a Harley\nDavidson motorcycle, green in color, registered to Jeffrey Epstein.\nNothing was recovered from the garage.\nA touel closet and pantry located off the kitchen were searched and\nyielded negative results.\nThe kitchen was searched and taken into evidence was a phone message\nbook that was located near a house phone.\nNorth of the kitchen was an office room which contained a computer.\nThe room had a closet that contained a locked gun locker. The\ncombination was entered by Banasiak in the presence of Sgt. Frick and\nthe safe was opened. Items were taken from the room. See the\ncompleted property receipt for a detailed list.\nA green bathroom located on the first floor was searched and nothing\nwas taken.\nA closet located just west of the green bathroom was searched.

Blaming herself, Virginia began to get into\ntrouble Aged ll, she was sent to live with an aunt but repeatedly ran away.\nLiving cn the streets, she was beaten up and slept with at least two older men in return for food. ‘Twas a\npaedophile’s dream, she says.\nThree years jater, she was reunited with her family and started a new life with her father who had moved\nto Palm Beach,\nFlorida, where he was maintenance manager at Donald Trump’s country club, Mar-a-Lago.\n|\nVirginia got a part-time job as a changing room assistant -which is where, soon after her l5th birthday, |\nshe met Ghislaine Maxwell, who invited her to work as Epstein’s personal masseuse.\n‘l was wearing my uniform — a white miniskirt and a skin-tight white polo top - when I was approached by |\nGhislaine,’ Virginia says.\nl\n‘| told her | wanted to become a masseuse and she said she worked for a very wealthy <span class=\"highlight\">gentleman</span> who i\nwas looking for a travelling masseuse.\nI'd get training and be paid well.'Virginia’s father gave his blessing, believing his daughter was being\nhanded the opportunity to learn a skill and to work for a wealthy and respectable employer. .\nHe drove her to Epstein’s pink mansion on the Palm Beach waterfront — he also ouns a nine-storey home\nin New York, the city’s biggest private residence; a 7,5oo-acre ranch called ‘Zorro’ in New Mexico and :\nLitle Saint James, a private 7o- acre atoll in the US Virgin Islands.\na ; o3956-l277\nhtp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-l36lo39/Prince-Andrew-girl-l7-sex-offender-frie... 3/l6/Zoll\n DOG=OGR-ooo29o55", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00030293.tif": "> Case 9:o8-cv-8oll9-KAM Document 3o5-4 Entered on FLSD Docket o9/l7/2oo9 Peaggbof af 2\n| “~\n.
