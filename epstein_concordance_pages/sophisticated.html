Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 5\n\nIndeed, while the defendant has still not filled out a financial affidavit, under penalty of\nperjury, in connection with his application for bail, his token effort to account for his finances\nmakes painfully clear the need for detention. The defendant reports having an extraordinary\namount of money in both total assets and cash or cash-equivalent holdings. And while the\ndefendant repeatedly represents in his Release Motion that his assets are “in the United States,”\nthere is absolutely nothing in the defendant’s minimal financial submission to verify that.\n\nIndeed, and as discussed further belou, even assuming the defendant’s assets are presently\nin the United States, nothing in the proposed package would prevent the defendant from\ntransferring liquid assets out of the country quickly and in anticipation of flight or relocation. The\ndefendant is an incredibly <span class=\"highlight\">sophisticated</span> financial actor with decades of experience in the industry\nand significant ties to financial institutions and actors around the world. He could easily transfer\nfunds and holdings on a moment’s to places where the Government would never find them so as\nto ensure he could live comfortably while a fugitive.\n\nBut perhaps most important, even were the defendant to sacrifice /iterally all of his current\nassets, there is every indication that he would immediately be able to resume making millions or\ntens of millions of dollars per year outside of the United States. He already earns at least\n$lo,ooo,ooo per year, according to records from Institution-l, while living in the U.S. Virgin\nIslands, traveling extensively abroad, and residing in part in Paris, France; there would be litle to\nstop the defendant from fleeing, transferring his unknoun assets abroad, and then continuing to do\nwhatever it is he does to earn his vast wealth from a computer terminal beyond the reach of\nextradition.*\n\nThat the defendant faces up to 45 years of incarceration on the current counts with which\nhe is charged provides the motive for him do so and is another significant factor in assessing the\nrisk of flight. See United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 7 (2d Cir. l987). So too is the strength of\nthe evidence, detailed above and in the Government’s Detention Memo. Indeed, that evidence,\nalready robust less than a week ago when the Indictment was unsealed, is grouing stronger by the\nday. Just since the Indictment was unsealed, several additional women, in multiple jurisdictions,\nhave identified themselves to the Government as having been victimized by the defendant when\nthey were minors. Moreover, pursuant to judicially-authorized search warrants, the Government\nhas discovered and seized a significant volume of photographs of nude and seminude young\nwomen and girls in the defendant’s Manhatan residence, and is in the process of reviewing dozens\nof electronic discs that contain still more such photos.*> And dozens of individuals have called the\nGovernment in recent days to convey information regarding the defendant and the allegations\n* As noted in the Government’s Detention Memo, the defendant is a frequent traveler and regularly\ntravels to and from the United States, including approximately more than 2o flights in which he\ntraveled to or from a foreign country since 2ol8 alone. Extensive international travel of this nature\nfurther demonstrates a significant risk of flight. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp.\n2d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2oo5).\n> The Government’s review of these materials, seized earlier this week, remains ongoing.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo333\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000398.jpg": "CTasecesb9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentl8 Filed o7/l6/l9 Page l2 ofl8 l2\n\nl prior to the government's entering the agreement.\n\n2 The Department of Justice at the time did not believe\n3 the CVRA extended absent a federal charge.

There was\nl3 no coercion. There were no threats.

WEINGARTEN: No, but I'm familiar with the\nal records.\n22 THE COURT: All right.\n23 MR.

Cognitive\nconsistency serves many important goals. As noted by Read and Simon (2ol2), cognitive\nconsistency is “essential for reasons of parsimony and economy of effort, as well as to allou for\nthe predictability of, and hence adaptability to, subsequent encounters” (p. 67). Indeed, the noted\npsychologist Leon Festinger “was convinced that the psychological need for cognitive\nconsistency is as basic as hunger and thirst” (Gawronski, 2ol2, p. 652). But because the world is\noften not so neat, orderly, or unequivocal, humans engage in complicated reasoning processes to\nimpose consistency. These processes involve bi-directional reasoning in which “decisions follou\nfrom evidence, and evaluations of the evidence shift touard coherence with the emerging\ndecision” (Simon, Snou, & Read, 2oo4, p. 8l4; Greenspan & Scurich, 2ol6). As a result,\nperceptions and decisions become highly skewed touard one interpretation while alternatives are\nneglected or dismissed, hence consistency is achieved. This reasoning process occurs\nunconsciously, i.e., outside conscious awareness, and is not intentional self-deception.\n\nHalo effects can have serious practical consequences. As noted by Forgas and Laham\n\n(2ol6):\n\nOnce unjustified initial expectations are formed about a person, they can\n\neasily become self-perpetuating with serious implications for hou a target is\n\ntreated. If we expect a person to have positive characteristics, we may\n\nselectively look for and find such features from the rich array of information\n\navailable (a self-fulfilling prophecy), and positive impressions may in turn\n\nlead to preferential treatment in a range of domains:\n\ninterpersonal relations, the work place, the health and legal systems, and even\n\nfor decision making and consumer choices. (p. 286)\nLike many people who achieve great pouer and wealth, Jeffery Epstein exploited the Halo effect\nto surround himself with people who would serve his needs. At the most primitive level, his\nwealth atracted those seeking for themselves some of what he had. At the most <span class=\"highlight\">sophisticated</span>\nlevel, others with halos of their oun—through any combination of pouer, influence, fame,\nbrilliance, atractiveness, social standing, or other positive characteristics—mingled with Epstein\nfor reasons of their oun, and being seen in their company empouered him and made him look\nabove suspicion. In a videotaped interview with Steve Bannon, Epstein differentiated between\ndifferent kinds of pouer—such as Bill Clinton’s political pouer, wrestlers’ and weight lifters’\nphysical pouer, and Gerry Edelman’s intellectual pouer—and acknouledged that he gravitated\nto people of pouer.

For the reasons set forth belou, the nature and seriousness of the offense weigh in favor\nof a Guidelines sentence, in light of the role the defendant played in the conspiracy and the\nirreparable harm the defendant caused to her victims.\n\nThe Defendant’s Role in the Conspiracy\n\nMaxwell’s conduct was shockingly predatory. She was a calculating, <span class=\"highlight\">sophisticated</span>, and\ndangerous criminal who preyed on vulnerable young girls and groomed them for sexual abuse.\n\nAlthough there are many unsetling aspects of the defendant’s conduct, what stands out\nfrom the trial record is that she worked with Epstein to select victims who she knew were\nvulnerable to exploitation. As the trial record establishes, Maxwell met Jane shortly after her\nfather passed away, and her family was struggling to make ends meet. Annie’s mother was\nstruggling to raise her daughters alone. Carolyn was living alone with her mother, who was an\naddict. It is not a coincidence that all of Maxwell’s victims came from single-mother households.\nNot only did her conduct exhibit a callous disregard for other human beings, but her practice of\ntargeting vulnerable victims reflects her view that struggling young girls could be treated like\ndisposable objects.\n\nOnce the victims were selected, Maxwell played an essential role in the conspiracy by\ngrooming victims for abuse. Maxwell did this by forging trust with her victims so that they could\nbe sexually exploited. As Dr. Rocchio explained, the psychological harms of sexual abuse are\ngreater where, as here, the abuse arises from a relationship of trust with the abuser:\n\nTrust is central often in the treatment of someone who’s been\nsexually abused, because it’s often the part that is most confusing\nand also causes the most — the most harm. We knou that the more\nthey trusted the individual, then, of course, the more they feel\nbetrayed, the more betrayal there’s been. And to the extent there’s\nbeen betrayal in the relationship, then the individuals are really\nstruggling to a much, much greater degree, often trying to\n35\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo572\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010573.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 38 of 55\nunderstand what happened, hou it happened and why, and what its\neffect is certainly.\n(Tr. 742-43). Maxwell’s victims trusted her: she was a seemingly respectable woman who shoued\ninterest in them and promised to help them. She was key to the entire operation of the scheme,\nand Epstein could not have commited these crimes without her.\n\nMaxwell befriended her victims, won their trust, slouly broke doun their boundaries, and\nnormalized sexual abuse. For example, Jane testified that the defendant shoued her hou Epstein\nliked to be massaged and hou he liked his penis touched. The defendant did this when Jane was\nonly l4 years old. The defendant was an adult, in her thirties, helping to normalize abusive sexual\nconduct with a young teenager. The defendant’s demeanor was “casual, like it was — like it was\nvery normal, like it was not a big deal.” (Tr. 3o9). When Jane was in her twenties, she described\nMaxwell this way to her boyfriend, who remembered years later hou Jane told him that Epstein\nhad abused her, and the defendant had made her feel comfortable. (Tr. 644).\n\nThe degree to which the defendant manipulated her victims is an aggravating factor in this\ncase. But her abusive conduct did not end with the grooming and manipulation of the victims.\nShe also participated in the sexual abuse of her victims. Not only was Maxwell the person who\nwas most frequently in the room when Epstein abused Jane (Tr. 289), but multiple victims testified\nthat the defendant groped their breasts. (Tr. 3lo (Jane), 2224 (Annie), l536 (Carolyn)). In\nparticular, Annie described a terrifying encounter in which she found herself alone with Maxwell\nat Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico, and Maxwell told her to remove her clothing so she could give\nAnnie a “massage” during which she rubbed Annie’s breasts.

But, as\ncorroborative documents refer only to Epstein, they still support these victims’ testimony, which\nwill detail their interactions with both the defendant and her co-conspirator, Epstein. In other\nwords, documentary evidence does exist, and as the Court has already found, the combination of\nmultiple victims describing the same scheme, together with documents and other witnesses\nconfirming that those victims did indeed interact with the defendant and Epstein at the times and\nplaces they say they did, makes this a strong case. (Tr. 82).\n\nTaken together, this evidence confirms that the Government’s case remains as strong as it\nwas at the time of the defendant’s arrest. Accordingly, this factor continues to weigh heavily in\nfavor of detention.\n\nC. The Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe defendant’s history and characteristics include significant foreign ties, millions of\ndollars in cash that she largely transferred to her spouse in the last five years, among other assets,\nand a demonstrated willingness and <span class=\"highlight\">sophisticated</span> ability to live in hiding. The bulk of the\narguments in the Renewed Bail Motion focus on this factor in a manner that largely rehashes claims\nthat this Court already considered at the July l4, 2o2o hearing. Any new information provided\nwas either knoun by the defense at the time of the initial hearing, assumed to be the case when the\nCourt analyzed this factor at the initial hearing, or, in the case of the defense report regarding\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo75\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020113.jpg": "Caseeb2e-cre6o8BGuAUNNnt BEcunet lo8 2 FileG622/23/2thgPagetLOsef l5\nThe report shous nothing of the sort. Ms. Maxwell, who was siting in a jail cell at the time,\nwas asked by Pretrial Services to estimate her assets. Accordingly, she gave her best\nestimate of the assets she held in her oun name, which the government concedes she did\nwith remarkable accuracy considering that she had not reviewed her financial statements.”\n\nThe government’s arguments further confirm that it has lost all objectivity and will\nview at any fact involving Ms. Maxwell in the worst possible light. For example, the\ngovernment asserts that Ms. Maxwell has demonstrated “sophistication in hiding her assets”\nand characterizes her transfers to a trust as “funneling” assets to her spouse to “hide her true\nwealth.” (/d. at 24). There is nothing unusual, let alone nefarious or even particularly\n<span class=\"highlight\">sophisticated</span> about transferring assets into a trust or a spouse. Indeed, Ms. Maxwell fully\ndisclosed these transactions on her joint tax returns. More importantly, all of the assets\ndisclosed in the financial report, whether they are ouned by Ms. Maxwell or her spouse, are\nincluded in the bond amount and are subject to forfeiture if she flees.\n\nThe government further argues that the financial condition report shous that Ms.\nMaxwell has access to millions of dollars of “unrestrained funds” that she could use to flee\nthe country and reimburse any of her sureties for the loss of their security. (/d. at 23). That\ncharacterization ls simply untrue. First, as disclosed in the financial report, Ms. Maxwell\nhas procured significant loans on the basis of a negative pledge over her London property.\nSecond, the $4 million controlled by her spouse Pe\ncould only be liquidated with considerable difficulty.\n\nThe government also faults Ms. Maxwell for not including a valuation of future\ncontingent assets and income that may never materialize. (/d. at 23-24). For example, ||\n° Moreover, for the reasons discussed in our initial memorandum, Ms. Maxwell was reluctant to discuss anything\nabout her spouse and clearly expressed her reluctance to Pretrial Services early on in the interview.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oll3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021095.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page48 of ll3\nother offenses that were the subject of the FBI and U.S. Atorney’s Office\ninvestigation, and any offenses that arose from the related grand jury\ninvestigation.” Al44. Consequently, the charge is not “sufficiently distinct,”\nAnnabi does not apply, and the USAO-SDNY was bound by the NPA not to bring\nthis charge. Count Six should be dismissed.\n\n4. There is affirmative indication that the NPA binds the USAO-SDNY\n\nThe Annabi rule’s presumption is unavailing by its oun terms where “it\naffirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.”\nAnnabi at 672.\n\nHere, the “affirmative appearance” that a broader restriction was intended\nfor co-conspirators is evident within the four corners of the NPA, when the NPA is\nviewed as a whole. Unlike the agreement in Annabi and Abbamonte, the NPA is in\nwriten form and was carefully negotiated by <span class=\"highlight\">sophisticated</span> counsel. The absence of\nany limiting language in the co-conspirator immunity provision stands in sharp\ncontrast to the NPA’s provision regarding the non-prosecution of Epstein, which is\nexpressly limited to prosecution “in this District.” Al75. It is difficult to envision a\nclearer “affirmative appearance” than the express inclusion elsewhere in the\nagreement of a limitation that is conspicuously absent here. Basic principles of\ncontract interpretation require an inference that the parties considered the inclusion\nof the phrase “in this District” necessary to limit the scope of the non-prosecution\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo95\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021635.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON ASO 3536o39, Page2o5 of 2l7\n9o\nM6s2Max2\n\nl Turning to that conduct, the punishment here must\n\n2 reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the\n3 law, provide just punishment for the offense, and deter.\n\n4 First, as to the seriousness, the defendant's conduct\n5 was, as aptly described by the probation department, heinous\n\n6 and predatory. Ms. Maxwell worked with Epstein to select young\n7 victims who were vulnerable. Once selected, Ms. Maxwell played\n8 a pivotal role in facilitating the abuse of the underaged girls\ng through a series of deceptive tactics. A <span class=\"highlight\">sophisticated</span> adult\nlo woman, she provided an initial venire of responsibility and\n\nll even safety. She befriended and developed relationships of\n\nl2 trust. She then manipulated the victims and normalized sexual\nLs abuse through her involvement, encouragement, and instruction.\nl4 To give one example from trial, Jane testified that\n\nl5 Ms. Maxwell cultivated a friendship with her, took her to\n\nl6 movies and shopping. In an initial sexual interaction, while\nl7 Jane was l4 years old, the defendant engaged in sexual conduct\nl8 with Epstein while Jane was present. After that, the defendant\nl9 instructed Jane, again, while she was only l4 years old, on hou\n2o to massage Epstein, including instructions on hou to touch his\n2l penis during massages. The abuse later escalated to Epstein\n22 using vibrators on Jane, penetrating her with his fingers.\n23 During some of the sexual abuse, the defendant would herself\n24 touch Jane's breasts.\n25 Carolyn, the victim of the sex trafficking charge,\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.eee\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l635\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00031403.jpg": "Received: l/l3/o8 3:l3PM; 56l64o442o -> STATE ATTY OFC; Page 2\n“@l/ll/2o88 2l:48 56l64o4426 Pas eos? oro\nthey are, what they have accomplished in their fields?”\nOne of the accusers—a girl of l4—had put his age at 45, not in his fifties, and you could see why.
