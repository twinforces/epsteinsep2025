[ think not.....\"- Rupert, Scotland, 27/2/2oll o7:3l-------~---what on earth has being\n: English got to do with it? Epstein is American so was the girl. And we all knou hou morally corrupt the rest of the Maxwell\n: family were/are. Prince Andrew is not the epitome of being English. What you are talking about is related to a small minoirly of\n: individuals who just happen to be English. If they behave badly, then if says something about them, their chosen lifestyle, or\nthe circles they move around in. What it dees NOT, is have any bearing on the rest of the nation! So please, fet's not get into\n: provocative Scotish vs English baitle - history is what it is - the PAST. And | certainly won't be accountable for what someone\n| else did long before | was born or simply beacause | am also English. | am proud te be English, that is what | am.
