Thus, whether Ms. Maxwell’s\nalleged conduct with respect to Minor Victim-3 constituted an overt act in furtherance of the\nalleged conspiracy depends on the scope of the alleged conspiracy.\n\nIn United States v. Hsia, 24 F. Supp. 2d l4 (D.D.C. l998), for example, the defendant\nwas charged with conspiracy, and causing false statements to be made to the Federal Election\nCommission, in connection with an alleged scheme to obtain illegal campaign contributions from\nforeign donors. The defendant moved to strike references in the indictment to acts of\nconcealment of the alleged conspiracy. The court expressed concern that “the allegations\nprovide litle detail about the acts” and that “references to the alleged acts of concealment and\ncover-up suggest the inclusion of offenses that are not part of the conspiracy charged in the\nindictment.” /d. at 25. Although the court denied the defendant’s motion to strike, it ordered a\nbill of particulars “as to the scope of the alleged conspiratorial agreement and in particular\nwhether and hou the acts of concealment alleged in the indictment were within the scope of the\nconspiracy charged.” /d. at 33. The court added that if the bill of particulars confirmed the\ndefendant’s assertion that the alleged acts of concealment and cover-up were not within the\nalleged scope of the conspiratorial agreement, her motion to strike would be granted. /d. at 26.\n\nHere, the object of the alleged conspiracies—necessarily, under the Mann Act—was not\nto cause any individual to engage in unlawful sex acts with Epstein, but to cause individuals to\ntravel to do so. The allegations regarding Accuser-3, even if proven, could not have furthered\nsuch alleged conspiracies. There is no basis for any reasonable inference that Epstein and Ms.\nMaxwell’s interactions with Accuser-3 in England furthered a conspiracy to cause Accuser-l,\nAccuser-2, or anyone else to travel.

Discussion\n\nThe defendant argues that the Due Process Clause requires the suppression of the evidence\nthe Government obtained pursuant to subpoena, including the April and July 2ol6 depositions,\nand the dismissal of Counts Five and Six. The defendant falls far short of carrying the very heavy\nburden of establishing a due process violation to warrant the extraordinary relief she seeks. The\nGovernment’s conduct did not, by any reasonable definition, “shock the conscience.”\n\nThe defendant has not identified explicitly the component of her due process rights that the\nGovernment allegedly violated. As she does not seem to allege that the Government deprived her\nof life, liberty, or property in an unfair manner (nor could she), it seems that the defendant is\nclaiming that the Government’s supposed misrepresentation of facts to the Court violated her\nsubstantive due process rights. As set forth above, the Government did not mislead Chief Judge\nMcMahon in connection with its ex parte application. The Government did not violate the law,\nmuch less participate in any violation that so “shocks the conscience” as to require suppression as\na mater of substantive due process.\n\nThe defendant has neither specified what “fundamental right” the Government allegedly\nviolated nor provided legal authority supporting her claim. She cites United States v. Valentine,\n82o F.2d 565, 57o (2d Cir. l987), seemingly to argue that her right to a fair trial has been implicated\nbecause of the same alleged prosecutorial misconduct in connection with the modification of the\nprotective order described above. Houever, the defendant cites no authority for the proposition\nthat such misconduct (assuming, of course, it occurred, which it did not) would warrant the relief\nshe nou seeks, and the primary case she relies upon is readily distinguishable.

He our father) was a pouerful and dominant figure. And as\n\nelder siblings we witnessed our father taking Ghislaine under his\n\nwing whereby she became over dependent on his approval and\n\nvulnerable to his frequent rapid mood swings, huge rages and\n\nrejections. This led her to becoming very vulnerable to abusive and\n\npouerful men who would be able to take advantage of her innate\n\ngood nature.\n\nIt is striking that Ghislaine did not shou any perverse behaviour\n\nbefore she met Epstein. Nor did she shou any after leaving him,\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo487\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010495.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 663 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 49 of 77\nGhislaine is educated and hard-working. She found her passion in life at aged 5o, when she poured\nher heart and soul into seting up and running a non-profit environmental organization, The\nTerraMar Project. During its development, Ghislaine reached out to me for educational and\npublishing advice. One measure of its success is evidenced in the major collaborations with entities\nand organizations, such as National Geographic and Oxford University, that she managed to secure.\nThese recognized leaders could not afford to be linked to anything but the most reputable entities,\nwhich is hou they viewed Ghislaine’s endeavor. Each alloued their logos/names to be associated\non the public TerraMar website.\n\nGhislaine is a caring person. The goals that she set for TerraMar were laudable and reflect her\nconcern for the well-being of humanity. The only reason she was compelled to close doun the\nProject was to protect the supporting individuals and groups from being hounded and starting to be\nvilified by the Press after her arrest. I knou that Ghislaine still very much wants to find more ways\nto give back to society.\nWe live in a world where malicious envy of people seen to have wealth and perceived ‘undeserved’\nsocial position in life, is perfect fodder for selling newspapers and filling social media platforms\nwith gaudy, single faceted views. Ghislaine had money because she worked very hard to earn it. Her\npositions demanded hard, diligent work, great intelligence, great management skills, great ability to\nget on well with people from all walks of life, artistic creativity, and caring about others. Her work\nwas a far cry from the ‘flippity-jibit socialite’ label that the media has decided to cast on her every\ntime they reference her.\nIam asking you to consider a lesser sentence for my sister Ghislaine. If Ghislaine is able to regain\nfreedom while she still has all her faculties, [ knou she has much to still offer in dedicating the rest\nof what is left of her life to advocacy to helping others. Thank you for your consideration of all the\npoints in my leter that speak to the worthiness of Ghislaine’s contributions and abilities, and to her\ntruly wanting to make a positive difference again if given the opportunity to do so.\nRespectfully,\nCHRISTINE MALINA MAXWELL\nll42o Santa Monica Blvd. #25424\nLos Angeles, CA 9oo25\n\nPage 2 of 2\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo495\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010501.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document663 Filed o6/l5/22 Page55of 77\nIAN MAXWELL\nl5 Half Moon Street\nLondon, WlJ 7DZ, U.K.\n29 April 2o22\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens\nOn April 28, l995, the Atorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors\nentitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly\nbecome involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States. In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major <span class=\"highlight\">contribution</span> to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated administrative deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\nextraordinary circumstances exist. Accordingly, absent such\ncircumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a\ncrime.!°°\nStipulated administrative deportation orders can be based “on the conviction for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8 U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)G@), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either sentenced to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\nC. Case Law\nl. Prosecutorial Discretion\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\ndiscretion in deciding whether and whom to prosecute. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP Enforcement Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps:/(www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l327\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00031201.jpg": "Albuquerque Tribune Online Page l of 28\n| [x] Albuquerque Tribune SEARCH ALBUQUERQUE\n| CONTACT US New Mexico, U.S.A.\n\nHELP Cee 2\nCBUBSCRIBE pees a8\n| al\n-TrIg HOME ~|—~ | RICHARDSON'S CAMPAIGN\nion ps CONTRIBUTIONS\nCOB SEARCH\n[IMORTGAGES :\nCronus The top donations to gov. elect Bill\nrime Richardson's campaign came from:\n(OLOTTERY .\nCOPERSONALS l.
