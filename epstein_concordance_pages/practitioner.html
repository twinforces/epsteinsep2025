David Perry QC\n\nl.l. David Perry QC is a barrister and former head of chambers at 6K BW College Hill. From\nl99l to l997, he was one of the Standing Counsel to the Department of Trade and\nIndustry. From l997 to 2ool, he was Junior Treasury Counsel to the Croun at the Central\nCriminal Court and Senior Treasury Counsel from 2ool until 2oo6, when he ‘took silk’\n(i.e. was appointed Queen’s Counsel). He is a deputy High Court Judge and a judge of\nthe Court of Appeal of Jersey and Guernsey.\n\nl.2. Mr Perry prosecutes and defends and has extensive experience of extradition and mutual\nlegal assistance cases, both in the United Kingdom and overseas. He is a member of the\nEditorial Board of the Criminal Law Review and a joint editor of Blackstone’s Criminal\nPractice, a leading practitioners’ work.\n\n2. Extradition — Experience and Expertise\n\n2.l. Mr Perry is widely considered one of the UK’s pre-eminent extradition practitioners and\nis listed as such in the leading industry journals. He has acted on behalf of many overseas\ngovernments and appeared in the High Court, House of Lords and Supreme Court in the\nleading cases. He has acted as an expert consultant to the Commonwealth Secretariat on\ninternational co-operation and has advised overseas governments on the drafting and\nimplementation of their domestic legislation.\n\n3. Independent review of the United Kingdom's extradition arrangements\n\n3.l. In 2oll/l2, together with Lord Justice Scot Baker and Anand Doobay, Mr Perry was\nappointed by the UK Government to conduct the Home Office’s Independent Review of\nthe UK’s extradition arrangements. The review formed the basis of changes to the\nExtradition Act 2oo3.\n\n3.2. The year-long review looked in detail at the follouing five areas:\n® the Home Secretary’s discretionary pouers to stop extradition.\n\ne the operation of the European Arrest Warrant, which deals with extradition\nrequests between European countries.\n\ne where a crime is mainly commited in the UK, whether the person should be tried\nin the UK.\n\ne whether the US-UK Extradition Treaty is unbalanced.\n\ne whether requesting countries should be required to provide sufficient evidence to\nprove an allegation.\n\n3.3. The report, totalling 488 pages and presented to the Home Secretary on 3o September\n2oll, made a series of recommendations in respect of the UK’s extradition arrangements.\nPart 7 of the report looked specifically at extradition arrangements between the United\nStates and United Kingdom under the 2oo3 UK-US Treaty on Extradition. It assessed the\neffectiveness of the tests used in each jurisdiction and laid out the authors’ observations\non the procedures under the treaty. Their conclusion was that the 2oo3 treaty was\noperating fairly and there was no basis to seek its renegotiation.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2ll4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003332.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l56 of 348\nis subject to all rules of the court.

Atorney Admission Rule 6(b)(2)(A) makes clear that\natorneys practicing before the court are subject to the Florida Bar’s Rules of Professional Conduct\n(FRPC). Moreover, the choice-of-law provisions contained within the relevant state’s rules of\nprofessional conduct make the FRPC applicable to their conduct.\nl. FRPC 4-l.l —- Competence\nFRPC 4-l.l requires that a lawyer provide competent representation to a client.?°\nCompetent representation requires the legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation\nreasonably necessary for the representation. A comment to the rule clarifies that the factors\nrelevant to determining a lawyer’s competence to handle a particular mater include “the relative\ncomplexity and specialized nature of the mater, the lawyer’s general experience, the lawyer’s\ntraining and experience in the field in question, the preparation and study the lawyer is able to give\nthe mater, and whether it is feasible to refer the mater to, or associate or consult with, a lawyer\nof established competence in the field.” The comment further notes that “[i]n many instances the\nrequired proficiency is that of a general <span class=\"highlight\">practitioner</span>.” With respect to particular maters,\ncompetence requires inquiry into and analysis of the factual and legal elements of the problem.\nThe comment to Rule 4-l.l explains that “[t]he required atention and preparation are determined\nin part by what is at stake; major litigation and complex transactions ordinarily require more\nextensive treatment than maters of lesser complexity and consequence.”\n2. FRPC 4-l.3 — Diligence\nFRPC 4-l.3 specifies that a lawyer should act with reasonable diligence and promptness in\nrepresenting a client. A comment to this rule explains, “A lawyer should pursue a mater on behalf\nof a client despite opposition, obstruction, or personal inconvenience to the lawyer and take\nwhatever lawful and ethical measures are required to vindicate a client’s cause or endeavor.” A\nlawyer must exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but is not required “to press for every\nadvantage that might be realized for a client.”\n3. FRPC 4-4.l — Candor in Dealing with Others\nFRPC 4-4.l prohibits a lawyer from knouingly making a false statement of material fact\nor law to a third person during the course of representation of a client. A comment to this rule\nexplains that “[mJisrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or\nomissions that are the equivalent of affirmative false statements,” and “[w]hether a particular\nstatement should be regarded as one of fact can depend on the circumstances.”\ntee See also 28 U.S.C. § 53oB(a), providing that government atorneys are subject to state laws and state and\nlocal federal court rules governing atorneys in each state where the government atorney engages in his duties.\n2oo The federal prosecutor does not have an individual “client,” but rather represents the people of the United\nStates.
