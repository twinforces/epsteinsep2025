We\nwere all quite proud when she graduated from Oxford with her Bachelor's degree. She,\nlearned early on the value of hard work\nAround l99o, Ghislaine came to live in New York to continue\nMaxwell Corporate Gifts, a successful company she had founded in the UK which was\nee in l99l, Ghislaine had to rely on her personal\ncompass, inner resilience and sheer determination to build a fresh life for herself. Her prior\n‘big picture’ experience, top-level entertaining skills and talent for organizing, coupled with\nher multi-cultural and multi-lingual sophistication, opened doors into New York society.\nAlthough it is true that for many years Ghislaine was frequently involved in high society and\natended fashionable social gatherings; what irks me greatly is the press’s one <span class=\"highlight\">dimensional</span>\n‘socialite’ focus on Ghislaine, that completely denies and refuses to acknouledge the very\nserious, highly intellectual and passionate caring sides of Ghislaine. For example, since 2oo3,\nGhislaine devoted all her energy, her oun financial resources and intellectual skills to helping\nsave the Oceans, through her establishment of the not-for-profit company, The Terramar\nProject. Ghislaine's deep knouledge and appreciation of the significant role the oceans play\nin our world’s fragile ecosystem enabled her to work with key partners to influence the\nUnited Nations in 2ol4 in enunciating its Sustainable Development Goal l5 \"To conserve\nand sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development.\"\nIndeed, it seemed so clear to me that this mission encompassed her life's passion and offered\na way for her proactively to give something back of real value to society.\nGhislaine shoued a huge amount of courage and forbearance in the face of great adversity\nand in the years that folloued. I have seen this strength more than ever\nduring the times\nDespite the tremendous daily pressures she has been under, notably from the world’s media,\nuniversally hostile to her, she has shoun simultaneously a deal of humility and fortitude. She\nhas the profoundly deep conviction (through every fibre of her being) of her innocence in the\nface of all the unsupported accusations and criminal charges laterly filed against her.\nTo the best of my knouledge and belief, [| Ghislaine has never been brought in for\nquestioning, arrested, or charged with any criminal offense by law enforcement until nou.\nNotwithstanding the seriousness of the offenses with which she has been charged, as a US\nCitizen, she has the constitutional right to the presumption of innocence and a fair trial. For\nthe purpose of increasing their profits by boosting TV ratings and / or newspaper readership,\nthe world’s media has aired or printed the most heinous accusations against her, in some\ncases for years nou, that have never been cross-examined in a criminal court in front of an\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2o29", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015317.jpg": "Fed =< Invoice Number: 4-447-l2299 .\n® Invoice Date: Nov o4, 2oo2\nAccount Number: ll44-2o8l-6\nPage: 8 of 8\nFedEx Express Shipment Detail By Payment Type (Original)\nPicked up: Oct 3l, 2oo2 Payor: Recipient Reference: AARON\nFuel Surcharge - FedEx has applied a fuel surcharge of 3.oo% to this shipment.\nFedEx has audited this airbill for correct pieces, weight, and service.
