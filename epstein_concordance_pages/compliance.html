Jeffrey Epstein, Criminal No. l9-49o\nDear Judge Berman:\n\nWe write to outline the grounds entitling Jeffrey Epstein to pretrial release, proposing a\nstringent set of conditions that will effectively guarantee his appearance and abate any\nconceivable danger he’s claimed to present.\n\nIn essence, the government seeks to remand a self-made New York native and lifelong\nAmerican resident based on dated allegations for which he was already convicted and punished —\nconduct the relitigation of which is barred by a prior federal nonprosecution agreement (the\n“NPA”). The government makes this drastic demand even though Mr. Epstein has never once\natempted to flee the United States — despite a Florida federal judge’s stated belief that he could\nvoid the NPA in appropriate circumstances, possibly threatening new charges there, and\nnotwithstanding legally erroneous government assertions in ancillary litigation that Mr. Epstein\nwas subject to potential prosecution in other federal judicial districts, including this one\nspecifically. Indeed, Mr. Epstein feared the toxic political climate might tempt the government to\ntry and end-run the NPA -— yet continually returned home from travel abroad, fully prepared to\nvindicate his rights under the agreement and otherwise mount a full-throated defense. Finally,\nthe government takes its extreme position in the teeth of Mr. Epstein’s perfect <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with\nonerous sex offender registration requirements — pinpointing his exact nightly whereabouts —\nacross multiple jurisdictions over a lo-year period.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo274", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000276.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6 - Filed o7/ll/l9 Page 3 of l6\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, his principal residence, Florida, and New York. Mr. Epstein has\nscrupulously fulfilled his obligations in every jurisdiction in which he was required to register\nthroughout the lo-year hiatus between his release and present arrest. All of his travel has been\nmeticulously reported to the registration authorities so that they have been aware of his precise\nlocation every single day for the past lo years. Beter still, the pending charges date back l4-l7\nyears, from 2oo2 to 2oo5. Yet, tellingly, they allege no recurrence of the conduct underlying the\nNPA and Florida state conviction at any time in the ensuing decade and a half (2oo5-2ol9).\nTogether, these unique factors are pouerful indicia that Mr. Epstein is no longer a danger to\nanyone and will faithfully obey all conditions of release if ordered.\n\nIn sum, Mr. Epstein has substantial grounds to challenge the allegations charged by the\ngovernment in its indictment, and he has every intention of doing so in a lawful, professional,\nand principled manner. He intends to fight the current charges on their merits and, more, to\ncontest their legality given the inextricable intertwining of the current investigation and his NPA\nwhich promised him immunity and a global setlement for offenses including those brought\nunder l8 U.S.C. § l59l. Any perception that Mr. Epstein poses any conceivable danger or flight\nrisk may be readily dispelled by a slate of highly restrictive conditions, which amply suffice to\nsecure his release:\n\nl. Home detention in Mr. Epstein’s Manhatan residence, with permission to leave only for\nmedical appointments as approved by Pretrial Services, including (at the Court’s\ndiscretion) the installation of surveillance cameras at the front and rear entrances to\nensure <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span>.\n\n2. Electronic monitoring with a Global Positioning System.”\n\n3. An agreement not to seek or obtain any new passport during the pendency of this mater.?\n> “A radio frequency (‘RF’) bracelet is the more conventional ‘ankle bracelet’ that has been used\nover time. GPS monitoring is a more recent phenomenon that is distinct from RF monitoring.\nWhile both units are placed on the ankle, the former tracks an offender’s movements in real time,\nwhile the later is contingent upon proximity to a base unit connected to a landline at an\noffender’s home. Statistically, GPS monitoring is more effective than RF monitoring at\npreventing recidivism.” United States v. Paulino, 335 F. Supp. 3d 6oo, 6l7 n.5 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8)\n(citations omited).\n\n3 Mr. Epstein has only one active passport permiting current travel — not three, as the\ngovernment fancies.

Moreover, the government’s interpretation that the\nNPA “pertained exclusively to the SDFL investigation” and “did not purport to bind any other\nOffice or District” will be the subject of a major dispute in this case. This is especially so\nbecause Mr. Epstein’s alleged conduct at his Palm Beach residence features prominently in the\nconspiracy count (Count l, 94 l4-l9, § 22.a, d, f) and is incorporated by reference in the\nsubstantive charge (Count 2, ¥ 23).\n\nBeyond that, Mr. Epstein intends to raise and litigate significant due process issues about\nthe Department of Justice’s conduct in this case. Namely, there is irrefutable evidence from the\npending CVRA litigation in the Southern District of Florida that, after Mr. Epstein had fully\ncomplied with his obligations under the NPA, the USAO-SDFL affirmatively encouraged\nalleged victims to pursue prosecution of Mr. Epstein in other districts, in violation of the DOJ’s\ncommitment to a “global” resolution. See Exhibit 2, at 8-l2. The United States Atorney for the\nSouthern District of Florida, along with supervisory and line prosecutors from the USAO-SDFL,\ncorresponded on multiple occasions with, and personally conferred with, alleged victims and\ntheir lawyers to entertain discussions about the alleged victims’ desire to have Mr. Epstein\nprosecuted on federal charges. See id. at 9. Further, the Southern District of New York is likely\nrelying upon physical evidence seized in connection with the prior investigation, see Gov’t Bail\nLeter at 6 (discussing “corroborating evidence,” including “contemporaneous notes, messages . .\n., and call records”). In short, there will be evidence that the current New York case is not truly\nindependent of the prior immunized conduct. The evidence will shou that Mr. Epstein’s\nreasonable expectation that the NPA would “resolve globally [Mr. Epstein’s] state and federal\ncriminal liability” in exchange for Mr. Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with the duties and obligations in\nthe NPA — which he fully performed — has been unconstitutionally undermined by the\ngovernment’s efforts to minimize the potential consequences of a CVRA conferral violation (one\nthat neither the government nor defense believes occurred but that was found to have occurred in\nthe CVRA litigation which is pending a decision on remedies) by returning an inextricably\nintertwined second federal prosecution just as the District Court in Florida is receiving\nsubmissions on remedy.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo28l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000284.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6 Filed o7/ll/l9 Page ll of l6\n\nOther than his 2oo8 guilty plea predicated on conduct substantially overlapping the same\nconduct charged here, Mr. Epstein has no criminal history. Congress specifically listed these\nfactors as considerations for the Court, and their absence therefore should weigh in favor of Mr.\nEpstein’s pretrial release. Mr. Epstein comes from a stable and humble family background. All\nof his remaining family members, his brother, niece, and nephew, reside in the United States.\nThrough his business and the five residences he maintains in the United States, Mr. Epstein\nemploys people, many of whom have been with him for more than a decade, and feels personally\nresponsible for their livelihoods. Mr. Epstein is admitedly wealthy with all of his financial\nresources (other than his Paris residence) in the United States (including the U.S. Virgin Islands)\nand will provide the Court with more specific information regarding his assets in a sealed\nsupplemental disclosure prior to the upcoming bail hearing if the Court grants leave to file such a\nsealed supplement. Mr. Epstein has, to this point, not provided a complete financial disclosure\non advice of counsel, motivated by a desire to ensure the accuracy of the information provided to\nthe Court. During the years since his release from incarceration in connection with his Florida\nguilty plea, Mr. Epstein has been a law-abiding citizen without a single allegation of criminal\nmisconduct during that period and has focused his efforts on business and philanthropy. At the\nCourt’s request, Mr. Epstein will provide a sealed list of his philanthropic donations.\n\nCrucially, the government has failed to proffer any evidence that Mr. Epstein has ever\nindicated an intent to flee from this investigation or any other criminal mater, which several\ncourts have observed is a critical factor in evaluating whether pretrial release is appropriate. See\nHanson, 6l3 F. Supp. 2d at 9o (“In this case, . . . there is no strong circumstantial evidence\nindicating that Mrs. Hanson intends to flee the United States”); United States v. Vortis, 785 F.2d\n327 (D.C. Cir.l986) (serious intent to flee is an important factor); United States v. Cole, 7l5 F.\nSupp. 677, 679 (E.D. Pa.l988) (defendant told undercover agents he would flee if arrested). In\nfact, Mr. Epstein has displayed long-term, consistent <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with Court orders and other\nlegal requirements. Asa result of his 2oo8 guilty plea and corresponding sex-offender\ndesignation, Mr. Epstein is required to (l) register for life as a sex offender; (2) regularly verify\nhis address with Virgin Islands, Florida, and New York authorities; (3) annually update his\nregistry photograph; and (4) provide registration authorities with detailed itineraries for all travel\n(both domestic and international) in which he engages. Mr. Epstein has strictly complied with\nthese requirements, without exception, for approximately ten years.\n\nThe Court inquired about the relationship of the New York State registration\nclassification and the requirements of the Bail Reform Act. And while it is true that the New\nYork Appellate Division held that Mr. Epstein was appropriately classified as a level-three sex\noffender, this inquiry was entirely backward-looking and based on the allegations contained in a\nFlorida probable cause affidavit describing conduct ending in 2oo5 that were neither admited-to\nnor within the scope of Mr. Epstein’s guilty plea. See People v. Epstein, 89 A.D. 3d 57o, 57l\n(N.Y. App. Div. 2oll). While Mr. Epstein has made no subsequent atempt to challenge the\ncontinuing nature of his designation, his law-abiding behavior for the ensuing decade plus\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo284", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000285.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6 Filed o7/ll/l9 Page l2 of l6\nsignificantly undercuts any suggestion of current dangerousness based on any regulatory\nclassification. Moreover, as discussed above, Mr. Epstein’s strict <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with the various\nmonitoring requirements associated with his sex-offender registration actually decrease any\ndanger that he might otherwise pose. It is also worth noting that Mr. Epstein is classified as a\ntier-one sex offender, the louest classification available, in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where he\nmaintains his primary residence. The defense respectfully suggests that Mr. Epstein’s Virgin\nIslands designation is more consistent with the circumstances of the actual offenses for which he\nwas convicted, and certainly more consistent with the predictive factor of whether there is a\ndanger of recidivism which the defense contends there is not.\n\nMr. Epstein’s financial means and past international travel do not extinguish this Court’s\ncongressional mandate to order pretrial release in every case where reasonable conditions can\nassure the appearance of the defendant as required.’ Indeed, numerous courts have rejected\ngovernment requests for detention, and instead ordered pretrial release, in cases where the\ncharged defendant was either a non-citizen (unlike Mr. Epstein) or a naturalized citizen with\nsubstantial if not weightier contacts with foreign jurisdictions, including the follouing decisions:\n\ne United States v. Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (reversing district court order of\ndetention of defendants, who were natives of Indonesia, and ordering release despite\ndefendants’ “strong motive to flee” because of serious charges and “strong” evidence of\nguilt, despite finding that defendants faced “lengthy term of incarceration” if convicted,\ndespite finding defendants possessed “ample means to finance flight,” despite finding that\ndefendants “maintained strong family ties to their native countries as well as personal and\nprofessional ties to various locations in Europe and the Middle East,” and despite finding\nthat defendants “could, with relatively litle disruption, continue to operate their highly\nlucrative business from any number of overseas locations”);\n\ne United States v. Hansen, lo8 F.

It does not, of course, suggest that wealthy defendants\nshould bear a special disadvantage. The facts supporting the Court’s ruling of pretrial detention\nin Zarrab are easily distinguishable. The present case does not have national security\nimplications, Mr. Epstein is a United States citizen (and does not possess any dual citizenship),\nthe only foreign country in which Mr. Epstein maintains a residence (France) has an extradition\ntreaty with the United States, Mr. Epstein’s assets are almost all located in the United States\n(with the exception of his Paris residence), and Mr. Epstein has provided only truthful\ninformation to Pretrial Services.\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo285", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000295.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6-l Filed o7/ll/l9 Page6ofl5\nCase 9:o8-cv-8o736-KAM Document 36l-62 a on FLSD Docket o2/lo/2ol6 Page 6 of\nsentenced not later than October 26, 2oo7.

In addition, the defendant proposes that she retain an additional half a million\ndollars in liquid assets in an unrestrained account, as well as any future income.” That figure\nappears to be in addition to the approximately $l million in “chatels” the defendant has disclosed\namong her various assets. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. In short, the defendant’s proposal would leave\nher with ample resources to fund her flight from prosecution.\n\nFurther still, the defendant’s Motion provides only cursory details of the monitorship\nprogram she proposes, and it offers no legal precedent to explain what, if any, authority this Court\nhas to establish and oversee such a monitorship. Aside from defense counsel’s assertions, the\nMotion offers nothing that would enable the Court to meaningfully consider the details of such a\nmonitorship. Among other things, it is unclear from the defendant’s Motion whether such a\nprogram would require the defendant’s voluntary <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with the monitorship, or whether the\nfunds would be placed in a bank account that the defendant could not access. Given that the\ndefendant’s Motion suggests that atorney’s fees could be disbursed without approval, it appears\nthat the defendant’s proposal would provide her latitude to engage in financial transactions, subject\nonly to a review that would require her voluntary <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span>.\n\nFinally, although the defendant does not provide any detail about the amount of money she\nwould pay the monitor, presumably the monitor would not undertake this responsibility for free.\nAs a result, the tension between the monitor’s obligation to review the defendant’s finances and\nthe monitor’s employment relationship with the defendant creates a conflict of interest. But at\nbotom, if the Court determines that the only way to keep the defendant from using her assets to\nflee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too great a flight risk to release.\n\nIn sum, in light of this Court’s determination that the defendant “has not been fully candid\nabout her financial situation,” the Court should reject the defendant’s vague proposal. (Dec. Op.\nat 2). Nothing in the defendant’s Motion should alter the Court’s determination that the defendant\nposes a significant risk of flight, and that she has the resources and skills to flee prosecution. The\nCourt should reject the proposed bail conditions.\n\n3. The Defendant’s Pending Pretrial Motions Have Not Diminished the Strength\nof the Government’s Case\n\nFinally, the defendant also argues that the “numerous substantive pretrial motions nou\nbefore the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government’s case.” (Mot. at 7).\nBut the defendant cannot merely point to the sheer volume of briefing she has filed to suggest that\nthe strength of the Government’s case has diminished. To the contrary, as the Government has set\nforth in detail in its memorandum in opposition, the defendant’s pretrial motions are entirely\nwithout merit. In any event, it is premature for the defendant to claim that her pretrial motions—\nwhich have not been adjudicated, much less granted—have altered the Court’s original\n> The defendant’s proposal also leaves unrestrained several million dollars in escrou for the\ndefendant’s legal fees. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9 (listing approximately $7.6 million in retainer fees);\nsee also Mot. at 6. If the defendant fled the country, her counsel would presumably be required to\nreturn those funds to the defendant, who would no longer need defense counsel in this case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool25o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001342.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 4o-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page25 of 25\nCERTIFICATE OF <span class=\"highlight\">COMPLIANCE</span>\nPursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 32(g), the undersigned counsel\n\nhereby certifies that this opposition complies with the type-volume limitation of\nthe Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.

Ironically, it is the MDC staff who leaked to the press that Ms. Maxwell had\nbeen vaccinated.\n\nFurther, in her desire to interact and be helpful with other inmates, Ms. Maxwell\ncompleted two programs to assist other inmates- (l) to qualify as a teacher aide and offered to\nhelp update MDC learning curriculum and (2) to qualify as companion for suicide watch. Her\nde facto solitary confinement prevents her from utilizing that training to assist others.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s segregation and surveillance go way beyond the concerns posited by the\nMDC. It is not only other inmates who may harm Ms. Maxwell, but also the very guards tasked\nto her security detail who have already done harm to her: failing to provide adequate food or feed\nher at all in a 2o-hour period, damaging her discovery hard drive, seizing her confidential legal\ndocuments, erasing her CorrLinks emails, physically abusing her. The list goes on and on. In an\neffort to advocate in <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with BOP procedure, she has filed hundreds of BP-8s, BP-9s\nand BP-los only to receive a response that is less than helpful, or in the absence of any response\nwas told the form was either lost or never filed, Each and every day of her detention, she is\nguarded by at least three officers who watch and record, by writing and via a handheld camera,\nher every move: when she eats, shouers, cleans her clothes, brushes her teeth, etc. As the guards\nfeverishly write while observing Ms. Maxwell during videoconferencing with counsel, it appears\nthat they go beyond their routine continual l5-minute reporting.\n\nFurther, her non-legal phone calls are monitored in real time. It was the staff who\nconfronted Ms. Maxwell about the death of someone whom she was close to within hours on her\nlearning about it, information derived from her phone calls. Ms. Maxwell does not discuss\npersonal maters with MDC guards and did not provide information concerning the passing of\nsomeone quite dear to her. It was psychological services who confronted her regarding that\ninformation, which could only have been obtained through telephone surveillance. We invite the\nCourt and government to review the calls which contradict the unsupported allegation that Ms.\nMaxwell is a flight risk and support her family strong ties. Her monitored communication with\nfamily and friends evidences her strong ties in the United States, her strong desire to return to her\nfamily in the United States, and her intention to establish her innocence at her trial in the United\nStates.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool439", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001464.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 73, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page24 of 24\nCERTIFICATE OF <span class=\"highlight\">COMPLIANCE</span>\nPursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 32(g), the undersigned counsel\n\nhereby certifies that this opposition complies with the type-volume limitation of\nthe Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.

Ghislaine Maxwell, Case No. 2o Cr. 33o (AJN), Local Criminal Rule 23.l\nDear Judge Nathan,\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we write to request that the Court enter an\norder prohibiting the Government, its agents and counsel for witnesses from making extrajudicial\nstatements concerning this case. Although Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent, the Government,\nits agents, witnesses and their lawyers have made, and continue to make, statements prejudicial\nto a fair trial. The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees an accused the\nright to an impartial jury. This fundamental guarantee is part of a criminal defendant’s basic right\nto a fair trial, which requires that a defendant must be judged by a jury of her peers based on\nevidence presented at trial, not in the media. The Court, to safeguard the due process rights of the\naccused, has “an affirmative constitutional duty to minimize the effects of prejudicial pretrial\npublicity.” Gannet Co. v. DePasquale, 443 U.S. 368, 378 (l979). This District has given effect\nto this Sixth Amendment right through Local Criminal Rule 23.l. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell\nrequests that the Court exercise its express pouer under Local Criminal Rule 23.l(h) and enter\nan Order requiring <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with that rule to prevent further unwarranted and prejudicial\npretrial publicity by the Government, its agents, and lawyers for alleged witnesses.\nLegal Standard\nMore than fifty years ago, warning of the danger of pretrial publicity to fair trials, the\nSupreme Court directed trial judges to take “such steps by rule and regulation that will protect\ntheir processes from prejudicial outside interferences. Neither prosecutors, counsel for defense,\nthe accused, witnesses, court staff nor enforcement officers coming under the jurisdiction of the\ncourt should be permited to frustrate its function.” Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U.S. 333, 363\n(l966) (emphasis added).\nDOJ-OGR-ooool635", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001642.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 28 Filed o7/23/2o Pade ANT ’ |\nDOCUMENT\nELECTRONICALLY FILED\nDOC #: : =\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DATE FILED:7/23/2o2o\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

Accordingly, it denies the Defendant’s motion without prejudice. But the Court\nwarns counsel and agents for the parties and counsel for potential witnesses that going forward it\nwill not hesitate to take appropriate action in the face of violations of any relevant rules.

Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 2\n\nIn particular, the Defense Leter seeks this Court’s authorization to use materials relating\nto applications the Government made seeking the modification of certain protective orders in other\njudicial proceedings. By way of background, the Government sought such modifications to permit\n<span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with criminal grand jury subpoenas (the “Subpoenas”). Those Subpoenas were issued\nto a certain recipient (the “Recipient”) after the Government opened a grand jury investigation into\nJeffrey Epstein and his possible co-conspirators. For obvious reasons and in keeping with its\nstandard practice, the Government did not notify the defendant or her counsel that it had issued\nthe Subpoenas. In response to receiving the Subpoenas, the Recipient advised the Government\nthat it believed that certain existing protective orders precluded full <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span>. Accordingly, in\nor about February 2ol9, the Government applied ex parte and under seal to each relevant court to\nrequest modification of the respective protective orders to permit <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with the Subpoenas.\nIn or about April 2ol9, one court (“Court-l’’) granted the Government’s application, and permited\nthat the Government share its order—and only that order, which itself prohibited further\ndissemination—to the Recipient.* Subsequently, the second court (“Court-2”) denied the\nGovernment’s application. Because the relevant grand jury investigation remains ongoing, both\nCourt-l and Court-2 have ordered that the filings regarding the Subpoenas remain under seal,\nexcept that both have expressly permited the Government to produce those filings to the defendant\nas part of its discovery obligations in this criminal case. The Defense Leter nou seeks to use\nthose discovery materials in the Civil Cases.\n\nAt base, the defendant’s application fundamentally misapprehends the nature and process\nof criminal proceedings, and it further reflects an inappropriate effort to blur the lines between the\ncriminal discovery process and civil litigation. To be clear: the purpose of criminal discovery is\nto enable the defendant to defend herself in the criminal action, not to provide her with a trove of\nmaterials she can mine to her advantage in civil discovery. Her motion is nothing more than an\neffort to evade the directives of the protective order entered by this Court just three weeks ago. It\nshould be denied for multiple reasons.\n\nFirst, and as the defendant concedes, the protective order in this case expressly provides\nthat any and all discovery material produced to the defendant by the Government, regardless of\ndesignation, “[s]hall be used by the Defendant or her Defense Counsel so/ely for purposes of the\ndefense of this criminal action, and not for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the\ndefense of this action.” Protective Order J l(a), lo(a), l4(a) (emphasis added) (Dkt. 36). Indeed,\nthe defendant included that same provision, word-for-word, in her oun proposed protective order.\nThis was not a provision about which the defendant and the Government disagreed. See\nDefendant’s Proposed Protective Order 4 l(a) (Dkt. 29-l). Yet less than a month later, the\ndefendant is asking the Court to sanction her effort to utilize materials produced by the\n? In the Defense Leter, the defendant argues that the Government “must have given a copy of the\nsealed order” to the Recipient, which defense counsel suggests is inconsistent with the\nGovernment’s statement that it rarely provides discovery material to third parties. The defendant’s\nsuggestion is patently incorrect. The relevant order was signed in April 2ol9 and was issued for\nthe purpose of being provided to the Recipient. Indeed the order contained an explicit provision\nthat it could be transmited to the Recipient. Accordingly, the order was conveyed to the Recipient\nwell over a year before it became “discovery” in this criminal case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool733", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001736.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 46 Filed o8/2l/2o Page5of5\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 5\nrequested—the defendant can make such arguments, and the Government can and will vigorously\noppose them, at the appropriate stage in this case.\n\nFinally, to the extent the defendant contends that the relief requested is somehou necessary\nto her ability to bring issues to the atention of other courts, the Defense Leter completely fails to\nexplain what legal argument she wishes to make in her Civil Cases based on the discovery\nmaterials she has identified or what relevance those materials have to the litigation of the Civil\nCases. The fact that the Government issued grand jury subpoenas and obtained court authorization\nfor <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with one of those subpoenas has no conceivable relevance to disputed issues in the\nCivil Cases. To the extent the defendant argues that the requested relief is necessary to ensure that\ncourts adjudicating the Civil Cases are aware of the existence of the documents at issue, the\ndefendant identifies no specific reason why these materials are relevant to the issues pending in\nthose cases, other than to falsely accuse the Recipient and the Government of some sort of\nmalfeasance.°\n\nIn sum, the defendant’s arguments in favor of her application offer no explanation of the\nrelevant legal theory the materials would support, not to mention a compelling reason for this Court\nto permit an end-run around the protective order and permit the use of criminal discovery to litigate\na civil case.

The requested redactions and\nsealing would thus be necessary to ensure <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with those sealing orders and is justified\nbased upon them.” Cf Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol Stops Northwest, 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l8 n.9 (l979)\n(“Since the l7th century, grand jury proceedings have been closed to the public; and records of\nsuch proceedings have been kept from the public eye. The rule of grand jury secrecy ... is an\nintegral part of our criminal justice system.”).\n\nAssuming without agreeing that these materials constitute “judicial documents” within the\nmeaning of First Amendment right-of-access jurisprudence, such a determination would not be\ndispositive. The First Amendment presumptive right of access applies to civil and criminal\nproceedings and “protects the public against the government’s arbitrary interference with access\nto important information.” N.Y. Civil Liberties Union v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth. (“NYCTA”), 684\nF.3d 286, 298 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (internal quotation marks omited). The Circuit has applied two\ndifferent approaches when deciding whether the First Amendment right applies to particular\nmaterial. The “experience-and-logic” approach asks “both whether the documents have\nhistorically been open to the press and general public and whether public access plays a significant\npositive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l2o (2d Cir. 2oo6) (internal quotation marks omited). The second\napproach—employed when analyzing judicial documents related to judicial proceedings covered\nby the First Amendment right—asks whether the documents at issue “‘are derived from or are a\nnecessary corollary of the capacity to atend the relevant proceedings.” /d. (internal quotation\nmarks and alteration omited).\n\nEven when it applies, the First Amendment right creates only a presumptive right of access,\nand the “presumption is rebutable upon demonstration that suppression ‘is essential to preserve\nhigher values and is narrouly tailored to serve that interest.’” Hartford Courant Co. v. Pellegrino,\n38o F.3d 83, 96 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (quoting Press-Enterprise Co. v.

Ghislaine Maxwell\n2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nAs counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell, we write in response to the leter from Sophia\nPapapetru and John Wallace, MDC staff atorneys. (See Dkt. 88.) The leter fails to address a\nnumber of concerns raised in our October 29\" leter to Warden Heriberto Tellez and raised with\nthe Court. The MDC’s leter also contains inaccuracies and omissions and raises more questions\nthan it atempts to answer. Rather than paraphrase our leter, we are providing it for the Court’s\nconsideration. (See Exhibit A.) We renew our request that Warden Tellez respond directly to\nthe Court and counsel and explain why Ms. Maxwell must be detained under such harsh and\nrestrictive conditions.\n\nUsing the term “[iJn her current assignment,” the leter atempts to present a picture of\n<span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with total disregard of the deficiencies of Ms. Maxwell’s treatment up to this point.\nWhile her meals may currently be in accordance with BOP policy, until September they were\nnot. While her weight may currently be fairly consistent, she had lost over l5 pounds, and she is\nsustaining hair loss. It took approximately six weeks follouing arrival to the MDC for Ms.\nMaxwell to be permited personal calls on par with other inmates; previously she was given two\ncalls per month unless authorized by the warden. While generally permited to be out of her\nisolation cell and confined to the day room from 7:oo am to 8:oo pm with one hour of recreation\ntime, general population inmates are permited to be out of their cells until 9:3o pm and given\nmore extensive recreation time. While flashlight checks may be performed during regular\nrounds, Ms. Maxwell is subject to such checks every l5 minutes. Further, because Ms. Maxwell\nis kept in isolation, she in not permited to participate in activities accorded inmates in general\npopulation, such as programming (educational, leisure and wellness), movies, religious services,\njob assignment.\n\nTouting that Ms. Maxwell is not in contact with “a number of inmates who have tested\npositive for COVID-l9,” the MDC’s leter totally ignores that she was in contact with a member\nof her revolving security team who tested positive, necessitating that Ms. Maxwell be\nquarantined for l4 days. This further diminished her ability to prepare her defense and resulted in\ncancelled legal visits.

ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2546", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002587.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l5 of 38\nId. Thus, the NPA limits the benefit to Epstein to immunity “in this District.”\n\nNext, the NPA sets forth l3 provisions labeled “Terms of the Agreement.” These include\nthe details of Epstein’s guilty plea and proposed sentence in the Florida state court, as well as\nEpstein’s agreement to waive his right to contest jurisdiction, liability, and damages up to an\nagreed-upon amount in certain civil actions brought by identified victims. NPA at 3-5.\n\nIn the paragraph follouing the “Terms of the Agreement,” the NPA provides that\n“Epstein understands that the United States Atorney has no authority to require the State\nAtorney’s Office to abide by” the NPA. NPA at 5. This section further provides that Epstein\nretains the obligation to obtain the State Atorney’s Office’s <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with the NPA’s\nprocedures, “which <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> will be necessary to satisfy the United States’ interest,” and to\nconvince the Florida state court to accept the proposed sentence. NPA at 5. The section contains\nno similar provision regarding <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> by other USAOs outside the SDFL.\n\nThe NPA then lays out the provision at issue in this motion:\n\nIn consideration of Epstein’s agreement to plead guilty and to provide\n\ncompensation in the manner described above, if Epstein successfully fulfills all of\n\nthe terms and conditions of this agreement, the United States also agrees that it\n\nwill not institute any criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of\n\nEpstein, including but not limited to Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, Lesley Groff, or\n\nNadia Marcinkova.\n\nNPA at 5 (emphasis added). Unlike the provision that Epstein will not be prosecuted “in this\nDistrict” (id. at 2), the sentence regarding co-conspirators contains no provision limiting co-\nconspirators’ immunity to the SDFL. Unlike the agreement that Epstein will not be prosecuted\nfor “offenses that have been the subject of the joint investigation” and “offenses that arose from\nthe Federal Grand Jury investigation” (id. at 2), the sentence regarding co-conspirators contains\nno limitation on the scope of conduct for which “potential co-conspirators of Epstein” cannot be\n\nlo\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2587", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002592.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 2o of 38\n\nA. Ms. Maxwell Has Standing to Enforce the NPA.\n\nThe Second Circuit has long recognized that plea agreements may include promises of\nleniency for third parties. See, e.g., United States v. Clements, 992 F.2d 4l7, 4l9 (2d Cir. l993)\n(“it is nou clearly established in the Second Circuit that the government may impose conditions\nwhich relate to the conduct or treatment of others”); United States v. Marquez, 9o9 F.2d 738, 742\n(2d Cir. l99o) (“Since a defendant’s plea is not rendered involuntary because he enters it to save\nhimself many years in prison, it is difficult to see why the law should not permit the defendant to\nnegotiate a plea that confers a similar benefit on others.”), cert. denied, 498 U.S. lo84 (l99l).\nYet the government has taken the position that such promises are effectively unenforceable by\nany third party who is not specifically identified by name.\n\nFundamental principles of contract law contradict the government’s position, regardless\nof whether the Court applies the law of New York or that of Florida, where the NPA was\nnegotiated and performed. Both states’ laws permit enforcement of a contract by a third-party\nbeneficiary where the parties to the contract intended to confer a benefit on the third party.\nSubaru Distribs. Corp. v. Subaru of Am., Inc., 425 F.3d ll9, l24 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (applying New\nYork law); Bochese v. Toun of Ponce Inlet, 4o5 F.3d 964, 982 (llth Cir. 2oo5) (applying Florida\nlaw). Moreover, “[a]n intention to benefit a third-party may be gleaned from the contract as a\nwhole and the party need not be named specifically as a beneficiary.” Chen St. v. Street Beat\nSportswear, Inc., 226 F. Supp. 2d 355, 362 (E.D.N.Y. 2oo2) (emphasis added) (holding that\ngarment workers had standing as third-party beneficiaries to enforce wage <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> agreement\nbetween Department of Labor and clothing manufacturer that contracted with their employer);\nFlorida Pouer & Light Co. v.

The NPA’s Prohibition on Prosecution of Potential Co-Conspirators Is Not\n\nLimited to the SDFL.\n\nThe NPA stands in contrast to the standard non-prosecution agreement used in this\nDistrict and other jurisdictions, which typically is explicitly limited to prohibit only prosecutions\nby the USAO for the district in which the plea is entered. The standard agreement in this District\ncontains the follouing language: “It is further understood that this Agreement does not bind any\nfederal, state, or local prosecuting authority other than this Office.” See, e.g., Perez v. United\nStates, Nos. l4 Civ. 846, o4 Cr. 937-l, 2ol5 WL 34l3596 , at *8 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol5). No such\nlanguage is included in the NPA. Moreover, unlike the standard agreement, the NPA refers\nseparately to “the United States” in some places and to the USAO-SDFL in others, in ways that\nmake clear that any reference to “the United States” was intended to refer to the government as a\nwhole, not merely the USAO-SDFL.\n\nl. The NPA is binding on the USAO in this District.\n\nThe government’s contention that the NPA does not bind the USAO in this District\ncannot be squared with the clear language of the co-conspirator immunity provision. On its face,\nthat provision does not limit the preclusive effect of the NPA as to potential co-conspirators to\nprosecutions in the SDFL. Indeed, consistent with Epstein’s desire to obtain the broadest\nimmunity possible, the NPA expressly provides that, in exchange for Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with\nthe terms and conditions therein, “the United States also agrees that it will not institute any\ncriminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” with no express geographic\nlimitation. NPA at 5 (emphasis added). In contrast, the clauses regarding the non-prosecution of\nEpstein expressly defer “prosecution in this District’ and provide that no prosecution for the\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2595", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002606.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 34 of 38\nambiguities are construed, as they must be, against the government as drafter. In the alternative,\nhouever, the NPA and the circumstances of its execution merit discovery and an evidentiary\nhearing regarding the parties’ intent.\n\nTo the extent that extrinsic materials do not make the parties’ intent clear, the Court is\nobligated to make a finding as to the parties’ “reasonable understanding,” with ambiguities\nresolved in Ms. Maxwell’s favor. See Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x at 27o (emphasis and citation\nomited). Courts in this circuit have routinely recognized the need for evidentiary hearings\nwhere the existence or scope of a plea agreement or non-prosecution agreement is in genuine\ndispute. See, e.g., id. at 27o (noting testimony from defendant’s atorney); United States v.\nAleman, 286 F.3d 86, 9l (2d Cir. 2oo2) (remanding where “the district court failed to make a\nrecord that allous us to determine the existence, scope and effect of an immunity agreement”);\nAnnabi, 77l F.2d at 67l (noting that district court heard testimony from two prosecutors,\ndefendant, and defendant’s counsel as of the time the plea agreement was reached); United States\nv. Papa, 533 F.2d 8l5, 82o (2d Cir. l975) (describing “two evidentiary hearings”); United States\nv. Satar, No. o2 Cr. 395 (JGK), 2oo3 WL 225lo398, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 5, 2oo3) (noting\nconclusion that “an evidentiary hearing was warranted . . . to determine whether an agreement\nexisted, what its terms were, and whether there was <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with those terms”).\n\nMs. Maxwell’s request for an evidentiary hearing, and for discovery, is at least as strong\nas that in Feldman. There, the district court denied discovery to a defendant who claimed that\nthe government had served a writ of execution in violation of oral representations made in\nconnection with the defendant’s plea agreement, holding that the agreement’s merger provision\nbarred the consideration of any oral agreements or representations. The Second Circuit reversed,\nconcluding that “while the district court’s analysis might have been compelling with respect to a\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-oooo26o6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002617.jpg": "Case l:lo- Case S8O-K5Eo386cihenPEGINFaheiA? dh Fills GR4ORE DSAagel Of Hage 6 of l5\nsentenced not later than October 26, 2oo7.

In addition, the defendant proposes that she retain an additional half a million\ndollars in liquid assets in an unrestrained account, as well as any future income.” That figure\nappears to be in addition to the approximately $l million in “chatels” the defendant has disclosed\namong her various assets. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. In short, the defendant’s proposal would leave\nher with ample resources to fund her flight from prosecution.\n\nFurther still, the defendant’s Motion provides only cursory details of the monitorship\nprogram she proposes, and it offers no legal precedent to explain what, if any, authority this Court\nhas to establish and oversee such a monitorship. Aside from defense counsel’s assertions, the\nMotion offers nothing that would enable the Court to meaningfully consider the details of such a\nmonitorship. Among other things, it is unclear from the defendant’s Motion whether such a\nprogram would require the defendant’s voluntary <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with the monitorship, or whether the\nfunds would be placed in a bank account that the defendant could not access. Given that the\ndefendant’s Motion suggests that atorney’s fees could be disbursed without approval, it appears\nthat the defendant’s proposal would provide her latitude to engage in financial transactions, subject\nonly to a review that would require her voluntary <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span>.\n\nFinally, although the defendant does not provide any detail about the amount of money she\nwould pay the monitor, presumably the monitor would not undertake this responsibility for free.\nAs a result, the tension between the monitor’s obligation to review the defendant’s finances and\nthe monitor’s employment relationship with the defendant creates a conflict of interest. But at\nbotom, if the Court determines that the only way to keep the defendant from using her assets to\nflee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too great a flight risk to release.\n\nIn sum, in light of this Court’s determination that the defendant “has not been fully candid\nabout her financial situation,” the Court should reject the defendant’s vague proposal. (Dec. Op.\nat 2). Nothing in the defendant’s Motion should alter the Court’s determination that the defendant\nposes a significant risk of flight, and that she has the resources and skills to flee prosecution. The\nCourt should reject the proposed bail conditions.\n\n3. The Defendant’s Pending Pretrial Motions Have Not Diminished the Strength\nof the Government’s Case\n\nFinally, the defendant also argues that the “numerous substantive pretrial motions nou\nbefore the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government’s case.” (Mot. at 7).\nBut the defendant cannot merely point to the sheer volume of briefing she has filed to suggest that\nthe strength of the Government’s case has diminished. To the contrary, as the Government has set\nforth in detail in its memorandum in opposition, the defendant’s pretrial motions are entirely\nwithout merit. In any event, it is premature for the defendant to claim that her pretrial motions—\nwhich have not been adjudicated, much less granted—have altered the Court’s original\n> The defendant’s proposal also leaves unrestrained several million dollars in escrou for the\ndefendant’s legal fees. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9 (listing approximately $7.6 million in retainer fees);\nsee also Mot. at 6. If the defendant fled the country, her counsel would presumably be required to\nreturn those funds to the defendant, who would no longer need defense counsel in this case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2755", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003021.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 87 of 239\nmotions, the suppression motions overlap in fact and argument, and accordingly, the Government\nresponds to both motions in this section.\n\nAs set forth herein, the defendant’s suppression motions challenging a judicially approved\ngrand jury subpoena should be denied without a hearing for multiple reasons. As an initial mater,\nthe defendant’s claim that the Government “circumvented” Martindell fails because the\nGovernment issued a valid grand jury subpoena, sought judicial authorization to permit\n<span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with the subpoena, and obtained materials from Boies Schiller that otherwise would\nhave been covered by the relevant protective order only after receiving such authorization. In any\nevent, even if the Government’s motion did not satisfy Martindell, Martindell provides no basis\nto suppress evidence, and the defendant cites no authority in support of that request. Second, the\ndefendant’s claim that the subpoena was a warrantless search in violation of the Fourth\nAmendment fails because she has not established standing to challenge a judicially approved grand\njury subpoena issued to a third party, and because the subpoena was entirely lawful. Even if she\nhad standing, her claim still fails because suppression would be improper under the good faith\nexception and the inevitable discovery doctrine. Third, the defendant’s claim that the subpoena\nviolated her Fifth Amendment rights fails because, among other things, such a violation requires\ncoercion and state action. Fourth, the defendant’s claim that the Government violated the Due\nProcess Clause is meritless, as the Government’s conduct was not, by any reasonable definition,\noutrageous or conscience shocking. And finally, the defendant’s request for a hearing should be\ndenied because she has proffered no admissible evidence to support her accusations of Government\nmisconduct; instead, she relies entirely on an anonymously sourced article that, as detailed herein,\nshe cites to describe certain events that simply did not occur.\n\nAccordingly, the defendant’s suppression motions should be denied.\n\n6o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o2l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003028.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 94 of 239\nrequested the same relating to Jane Doe 43 v. Epstein, et al., l7 Civ. o6l6 (JGK) (SN). Because\nof the ongoing and covert nature of the grand jury investigation, and consistent with its standard\npractice under such circumstances, the Government did not notify the defendant or her counsel\nthat it had issued the subpoenas.\n\nIn response to receiving the subpoenas, Boies Schiller began producing materials not\ncovered by the protective orders in the relevant civil cases. Houever, Boies Schiller also had\nadvised the Government that although it would not otherwise contest <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with the\nsubpoenas, it believed that the protective orders precluded full <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span>.» (Exs. 8 & 9).\nAccordingly, the Government applied ex parte and under seal to each relevant court (Judge Sweet\nand Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn, respectively) to request that each court modify the respective\nprotective orders to permit <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with the subpoenas. (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. C).\n\nFollouing a request by Judge Sweet for briefing supporting the Government’s initial\napplication, see Def. Mot. 3, Ex. D at 4, 2o; Ex. G at 6, the Government submited ex parte and\nsealed leters in support of its applications to each court on or about February 28, 2ol9. (Exs. 8 &\n9). The Government wrote, “Where, as here, a grand jury subpoena has validly issued, and the\nrecipient of the subpoena is not contesting <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span>—but rather seeking authorization to comply\nwith the subpoena—a court should grant such permission through limited modification of an\napplicable protective order, absent countervailing interests not present in this case.” (/d. at 2). The\nGovernment submited that the court was “best guided” by Chemical Bank v. Affiliated FM Ins.\nCo., l54 F.R.D. 9l, 93 (S.D.N.Y. l994), in which the court rejected an application for a party in\ncivil litigation to be held in contempt for complying with a grand jury subpoena by producing\n3 Significantly, and as detailed herein, Boies Schiller did not produce to the Government any\nmaterials subject to the protective orders until, as further described belou, it received an order\ngranting it the ability to do so in one of the civil cases.\n\n67\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o28", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003030.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 96 of 239\nMartindell was applicable.

She stated that were the Government’s application disclosed\nto the parties, “Maxwell would protest” and argue that the Government lacked standing as it was\nnot a party to the protective order. (/d. at 8).

(/d. at l3).\n\nChief Judge McMahon stated that the protective order did not contain a provision allouing\na party to the order to disclose materials requested by law enforcement without permission of the\ncourt, noting her understanding that “it may have been negotiated out.” (/d. at l4-l5). The court\ninquired whether the Government’s position was that “reliance on the nondisclosure of\nconfidential materials to law enforcement in connection with a grand jury subpoena that has been\nduly authorized would be unreasonable.” (/d. at l4). The Government responded in the\naffirmative, stating that the Government believed a provision precluding <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with a law\nenforcement request would be void for public policy. (Ud. at l5). The Government further cited\nChemical Bank in support of the proposition that it would be unreasonable to rely on a protective\norder provision that barred the disclosure of information to law enforcement. (/d. at l5-l6).\n\nIn response to questions about the breadth of the subpoena, the Government explained that\nit was “essentially unable to significantly narrou the request for information ... . We have either\nlitle or no additional information than the Court does in terms of what materials there are [and]\nwho was deposed.” (/d. at l7). In response to Chief Judge McMahon’s question about the privacy\ninterests implicated by the protective order, (id. at l6-l7), the Government also noted that it was\ndissimilar to an ordinary third-party intervenor in that it would be “extremely restricted” in its use\n\n69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o3o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003037.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo3 of 239\ncommited perjury.” According to two anonymous sources, “a second meeting occurred.”\nHouever, the Article cites another anonymous source as “insist[ing] [a second meeting] never\nhappened.”\n\nB. The Defendant’s Suppression Motion Should Be Denied\n\nMaxwell seeks suppression of the evidence the Government obtained via a judicially\nauthorized subpoena to Boies Schiller under Martindell, the Fourth Amendment, Fifth\nAmendment, the Due Process clause, and the Court’s inherent authority. Houever, Maxwell’s\nmotion turns on erroneous facts, runs afoul of controlling law, and should be denied.\n\nl. Martindell Provides No Basis to Grant the Relief the Defendant Seeks\n\nMaxwell argues that the Government “circumvented” the Second Circuit’s decision in\nMartindell and “violated Maxwell’s rights,” which requires suppression of the evidence the\nGovernment obtained from the subpoena. (Def. Mot. ll at ll-l2). Even assuming that to be\ntrue—which, of course, as detailed above and herein, it is not—there is no basis in law to suppress\nevidence as a result of a Martindell violation, and Maxwell cites none in support of her claim.\nSeting that fatal flaw aside, houever, her claim is wrong on both the facts and the law. The\nGovernment issued a valid grand jury subpoena for the materials, applied for judicial authorization\nto modify the protective order to permit <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with the subpoena, and a district court judge,\nwho evaluated the Government’s application under Martindell, properly exercised her discretion\nin modifying the protective order. Only after receiving that court order did the Government obtain\nany protected materials from Boies Schiller. Maxwell’s motion should be denied.\n\na. Applicable Law\n\n“{T]here is no question that a Rule 26(c) protective order is subject to modification,” and\n\na decision to modify such an order is “commited to the sound discretion of the trial court.” Jn re\n76\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o37", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003040.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo6 of 239\nsupervision of a judge, the longstanding principle that ‘the public . . . has a right to every man’s\nevidence,’ except for those persons protected by a constitutional, common-law, or statutory\nprivilege is particularly applicable to grand jury proceedings.” (internal citations omited)).\n\nb. Discussion\n\nThe Government did not, in any way, atempt to circumvent Martindell. To the contrary,\nthe Government presented Martindell squarely to the relevant courts, first arguing that its test was\nnot applicable, and then, in the alternative, that the requested relief should be granted even if the\ncourts applied the Martindell standard. It cannot possibly be the case that the Government was\natempting to “circumvent” a case that it cited ll times in its argument to both relevant courts.\n(See (Exs. 8 & 9). Instead, the Government issued a subpoena to Boies Schiller in connection with\nits investigation and made an application to two judges to modify Rule 26(c) protective orders that\nprecluded full <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with those subpoenas. While the Government argued that the court\nneed not employ the Martindell balancing test for several reasons, it also made arguments under\nMartindell in the alternative. Ultimately, both Chief Judge McMahon and Judge Netburn found\nthat Martindell applied and analyzed the Government’s application under that framework.\n\nAs Chief Judge McMahon found, even under the Martindell approach, testimony provided\npursuant to a protective order can be divulged to a grand jury if the government establishes “some\nextraordinary circumstance or compelling need.” Martindell, 594 F.2d at 296. After concluding\nthat reliance on the protective order was unreasonable,*° Chief Judge McMahon found that the\n“Government [ ] persuasively demonstrated extraordinary circumstances,” citing “significant\n6 See, e.g., Int’! Equity Invs., Inc. v. Opportunity Equity Partners Ltd., No. o5 Civ. 2745 (JGK)\n(RLE), 2olo WL 7793l4, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 2, 2olo) (finding that the parties’ reliance on a\ncivil protective order “was not unreasonable given the nature of the litigation,” but “not so\noverwhelming as to warrant the indefinite application of Martindell’s strong presumption against\nmodification because the order’s broad scope and express language, and the minimal level of court\ninquiry outweigh the Parties’ reliance.”).\n\n79\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o4o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003041.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo7 of 239\npublic interest” which resulted in the Government convening a grand jury to investigate a serious\ncrime. (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. G at 22-23). The Court also noted that because the investigation was not\npublicly knoun, “the ordinary exercise of grand jury pouer [i.e., to subpoena witnesses to testify\nand to produce documents] . . . would implicate and invite the very risk of disclosure—and the\npossibility of alerting potential criminal targets that they are under investigation, causing them to\ndestroy evidence, flee from prosecution, or otherwise seriously jeopardize the Investigation—that\ncaused the Government to proceed via subpoena [to Boies Schiller] and its related Application.”\n(id. at 23-24). The Court further noted that the “Government’s interest is bolstered” as the request\nwas made by a grand jury that had issued a “subpoena for the production of documents as part of\nan ongoing investigation.” (/d. at 25). In support of her argument, the defendant cites Palmieri\nwhere the Second Circuit, applying Martindell, reversed the district court’s decision granting the\nstate Atorney General’s motion to intervene to modify sealing orders. (Def. Mot. ll at l4).\nMaxwell’s reliance on Palmieri is of no avail. There, the Second Circuit held that the district court\nerred by not expressly finding that the state had shoun improvidence, extraordinary circumstances,\nor compelling need before modifying the sealing orders in a civil case. Palmieri, 779 F.2d at 862,\n866. By contrast, here Chief Judge McMahon made this explicit finding.\n\nJudge Netburn, on the other hand, rejected the Government’s arguments for exceptional\ncircumstances and compelling need as “unpersuasive” under the Martindell standard. (Def. Mot.\n3, Ex. H at 6). Maxwell argues that Judge Netburn was “exactly right” in her analysis of whether\nexceptional circumstances existed, but ignores the fact that Chief Judge McMahon made contrary\nfindings on this point. That two neutral judicial officers were presented with the facts, analyzed\nthe law, and reached varying conclusions based on different findings shous that there are\nguardrails in place to ensure <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with Martindell. In other words, the Government in no\n\n8o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o4l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003043.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo9 of 239\nDe Maxwell’s Fourth Amendment Claim Fails\n\nMaxwell’s Fourth Amendment motion is premised on a wholly unsupported expansion of\nthe law. Because Maxwell lacked a privacy interest in the files of a third party law firm who\nrepresented her adversary in civil litigation, and because the subpoena was entirely lawful, she\ncannot make out a Fourth Amendment violation. Moreover, even if Maxwell had standing to assert\nthis claim, it would nonetheless fail because the Government relied in good faith on a judicial order\npermiting <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with its subpoena.\n\na.

ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l9o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003208.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 32 of 348\nfor the Department’s Criminal Division, a position in which he served as Chief of Staff to Assistant\nAtorney General Alice Fisher.

She served\nin the Major Crimes Section in Miami until January 2oo4, when she transferred to the West Palm\nBeach branch office. Villafafia handled the majority of the child exploitation cases in West Palm\nBeach, along with other criminal maters. In 2oo6, she was designated as the USAO’s first\ncoordinator for Project Safe Childhood, a new Department initiative focusing on child sexual\nexploitation and abuse.”\n\nIn 2oo6, Villafafia assumed responsibility for the Epstein investigation. As the line AUSA,\nVillafafia handled all aspects of the investigation. Villafafia determined the lines of inquiry to\npursue, identified the witnesses to be interviewed, conducted legal research to support possible\ncharges, and sought guidance from others at the USAO and in the Department. Villafafia, along\nwith the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim Specialist, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.\nShe handled court proceedings related to the investigation. She drafted a prosecution\nmemorandum, indictment, and related documents, and revised those documents in response to\ncomments from those in her supervisory chain of command. Villafafia participated in meetings\nbetween members of the USAO and counsel for Epstein, and prepared briefing materials for\nmanagement in preparation for those meetings and in response to issues raised during those\nmeetings. Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve\nthe federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafafia was the primary USAO\nrepresentative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her\nsupervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO. Thereafter,\nVillafafia monitored Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with the NPA and addressed issues relating to his\nconduct. After two victims pursued a federal civil lawsuit seeking enforcement of their rights\nunder the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l (“the CVRA litigation” or “the\nCVRA case”), in July 2oo8, Villafafia served as co-counsel to the lead atorney representing the\nUSAO until February 2ol9, when the USAO was recused from handling the litigation.?

Led by the U.S. Atorneys’ Offices\nand CEOS, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state, and local resources to locate, apprehend, and prosecute\nindividuals who exploit children via the internet, as well as to identify and rescue victims.\n\n3 After the district court issued its February 2l, 2ol9 opinion finding misconduct on the part of the government,\nthe Department re-assigned the CVRA case to the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR- oooo32o8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003223.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 47 of 348\n\nOn July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia alerted Sloman, who informed Acosta, that the State Atorney’s\nOffice had charged and arrested Epstein.” On that same day, the FBI in West Palm Beach formally\nopened the case, assigning the case agent and, later, a co-case agent, to investigate it. Villafafia\ntold Sloman that the FBI agents “are geting copies of all of the evidence and we are going to\nreview everything at [the] FBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her target date for filing federal\ncharges against Epstein was August 25, 2oo6. Acosta emailed Sloman, asking whether it was\n“appropriate to approach [State Atorney Krischer] and give him a heads up re where we might\ngo?” Sloman replied, “No for fear that it will be leaked straight to Epstein.””°\n\nAlthough Lourie learned of the case at this point from Sloman, and eventually took a more\nactive role in supervising the investigation, Villafafia continued to update Acosta and Sloman\ndirectly on the progress of the case.*° Villafafia’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach had\nlitle involvement in supervising the Epstein investigation, and at times, Villafafia directed her\nemails to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie without copying her immediate supervisor. In the\nimmediate supervisor’s view, houever, “Miami” purposefully assumed all the “authority” for the\ncase, which the immediate supervisor regarded as “highly unusual.”*!\n\nBy late August 2oo6, Villafafia and the FBI had identified several additional victims and\nobtained “some flight manifests, telephone messages, and cell phone records that shou the\ncommunication and travel in interstate commerce” by Epstein and his associates. Villafafia\nreported to her supervisors that the State Atorney’s Office would not provide transcripts from the\nstate grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convince him to\nrelinquish the evidence to the FBI.” Villafafia also told her supervisors that she expected “a\nnumber of fights” over her document demands, and that some parties were refusing to comply\n“after having contact with Epstein or his atorneys.”\n\nVillafafia’s reference to anticipated “fights” and lack of <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> led Sloman to ask\nwhether she was referring to the victims. Villafafia responded that the problems did not involve\nvictims, but rather a former employee of Epstein and some business entities that had objected to\ndocument demands as overly burdensome. Villafafia explained to Sloman and Lourie that some\nvictims were “scared and/or embarrassed,” and some had been intimidated by the defense, but\n“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.” Villafafia\na8 On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafafia had not yet briefed about the case, noting that\nOperation Leap Year was “a highly sensitive case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”\n\n28 During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was\nlikely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some\ntype of relationship between somebody in the [State Atorney’s Office] and the defense team.”\n“o After Villafafia sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her mmediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman,\nand Acosta on August 23, 2oo6, Lourie emailed Sloman: “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the\ncase?” Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care. If Alex says something then I'll tell her to just run it\nthrough you guys.”\n3l OPR understood “Miami” to be a reference to the senior managers who were located in the Miami office,\nthat is, Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel.

The subjects, including Acosta, were generally able to explain to OPR both\nthe larger goals and the case-related factors they likely considered during the process of\nconceptualizing, negotiating, and finalizing this resolution. Houever, the contemporaneous emails\nand other records do not reflect all of the conversations among the decision makers, and their\ndeliberative and decision-making process is therefore not entirely clear. In particular, Menchel\nand Acosta had offices located near each other and likely spoke in person about the case, but\nneither had a clear memory of their conversations. Therefore, OPR could not determine all of the\nfacts surrounding the development of the two-year state plea resolution or the NPA.\n\nIn the follouing account, OPR discusses the initial key decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through state, rather than federal, charges, and sets forth many of the numerous\ncommunications that reflect the negotiations between the parties that led to the final NPA. OPR\nquestioned each of the subjects about hou the decision was reached to pursue a state resolution,\nand OPR includes belou the subjects’ explanations. The subjects’ memories of particular\nconversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus\nemerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the\nwillingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the\ncase that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail\nat trial and through appeal. In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority\nto prosecute a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based\non this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve\nthe mater through a state plea. In any event, Acosta acknouledged to OPR that, at a minimum,\nhe approved of the concept of a state-based resolution after being made aware of the allegations\nand the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum.\nFurthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.\n\nA. June — July 2oo7: The USAO Proposes a State Plea Resolution, which the\n\nDefense Rejects\n\nA few days after the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafafia, advising her that\nEpstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July ll, 2oo7, and hoped\n“to be able to reach a state-based resolution shortly thereafter.”>° In a July 3, 2oo7 email, Villafafia\ntold Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea\ndiscussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a resolution of the federal investigation that could\n» State laws require that a person convicted of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allou\nlaw enforcement and the public to knou the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and,\nin some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities. The Florida Sexual Offender/Predator Registry\nis administered by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act\nof 2oo6 established a comprehensive, national sex offender registration system called the Sex Offender Registration\nand Notification Act (SORNA), to close potential gaps and loopholes that existed under prior laws and to strengthen\nthe nationwide network of sex offender registrations.\n\n56 In this email, Sanchez also requested a two-week extension of time for <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with the USAO’s demands\nfor records, which included a demand for the computer equipment that had been taken from Epstein’s residence before\nthe October 2oo5 state search warrant and that Villafafia had been requesting from the defense since late 2oo6.\n36\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3238", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003266.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 9o of 348\nnoted that the revised charges involved l9 victims, so the defense proposal for a l5-month sentence\namounted to less than one month per victim. Villafafia requested that “whatever the U.S. Atorney\ndecides to do,” the agreement with Epstein should “follou . .. a version of my writen non-\nprosecution agreement” in order to “avoid any state shenanigans and . . . keep the defense on a\nstrict timeline.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia circulated to Acosta and Sloman a revised NPA that called for a\n2o-month jail sentence to be folloued by lo months of home confinement. This redrafted NPA\ncontained a provision that specified, “With credit for gain time, Epstein shall serve at least\nl7 months in a state correctional institution.”'°* Acosta reviewed the revised NPA and amended\nit to include a statement clarifying that it was Epstein’s obligation “to undertake discussions with\nthe State of Florida to ensure <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with these procedures.” Villafafia sent her version of the\nrevised NPA to Lefcourt that afternoon and forwarded Acosta’s proposed change to him the\nfollouing day, after she learned of it.\n\nOn September ll, 2oo7, the court contacted Villafafia to inquire whether the USAO would\nbe prepared to proceed with the litigation concerning the computers the follouing day. At\nSloman’s direction, Villafafia asked the court to delay the hearing, and the court rescheduled it for\nthe follouing week. At the same time, anticipating that plea negotiations would fail, Villafafia\ncirculated a revised indictment to her co-counsel and Oosterban, seeking their feedback before\nsending it “through the chain of command.” Villafafia also sent Oosterban the revised NPA and\ntold him she was “still shooting for 9/25” to bring charges, assuming the defense declined the\nUSAO’s offer. Oosterban responded, “The counter-offering is unfortunate, but I suppose it’s\nunderstandable.”!\n\nThat afternoon, Lourie asked Villafafia, “What is our latest offer?” Villafafia responded,\n“Plead to the three specified [state] charges, a 3o-month sentence, split 2o in jail and lo in\n‘community control,’ and agree that the girls are victims for purposes of damages. We also put in\ndeadlines for a plea and sentencing date.”\n\nB. September l2, 2oo7: The USAO and Defense Counsel Meet with the State\n\nAtorney\n\nAlthough the USAO and defense counsel had been discussing resolving the federal\ninvestigation with a plea to state charges, there is no evidence that the USAO involved the State\nAtorney’s Office in those discussions until September l2, 2oo7. On that day, Lourie, Villafafia,\nand another USAO supervisor who would be replacing Lourie as manager of the USAO’s West\nPalm Beach office, and Epstein atorneys Lefkouitz, Lefcourt, and Goldberger met with State\nAtorney Barry Krischer and Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek. Other than Villafajia,\nfew of the participants had any memory of the meeting or the results of it. The available evidence\nindicates that the USAO made additional concessions during the meeting.\nlos Through “gain time,” Florida inmates can earn a reduction in their sentence for good behavior.\n\nlo5 Oosterban told OPR that he did not recall having read the NPA at this juncture and “had no involvement\nwith it.”\n64\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3266", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003288.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll2 of 348\nit had identified as victims.'°!

The USAO had no objection to Epstein self-reporting\nto begin serving his sentence by January 4, 2oo8.\n\nImmunity: The USAO would not initiate criminal charges against “any potential\nco-conspirator of Epstein,” including four named personal assistants.\n\nOther: Epstein was obligated to undertake discussions with the State Atorney’s\nOffice to ensure <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with this agreement.\n\nEpstein waived his right to appeal.\n\nEpstein agreed that he would not be afforded any benefits with respect to\ngain time or other rights, opportunities, and benefits not available to any\nother inmate.\n\nThe federal investigation would be suspended and all pending legal process\nheld in abeyance unless and until Epstein violated any term of the\nagreement. Evidence “requested by or directly related to” the pending legal\nprocess, “including certain computer equipment,” would be kept inviolate\nuntil all the NPA terms had been satisfied.\n\nBreach: The USAO would be required to notify Epstein of any alleged breach of the\nagreement within 9o days of the expiration of the term of home\nconfinement, and would be required to initiate prosecution within 6o days\nthereafter.\n\nDisclosure: The parties “anticipate[d]” that the agreement would not be made part of\nany public record, and if the USAO received a Freedom of Information Act\nrequest or compulsory process commanding disclosure of the agreement, it\nwould provide notice to Epstein before making any disclosure. !*\n\nThat evening, Lefkouitz emailed Lourie to express concern about the notification he\nunderstood would be given to Chief Reiter, stating, “I am very concerned about leaks unduly\nprejudicing Jeffrey [Epstein] in the media.”!°?

The parties anticipated that\nthe USAO would send Epstein’s atorneys a list of victims when Epstein fulfilled his obligation under the NPA to\nenter his state guilty pleas.\n\nl32 The final NPA is atached as Exhibit 3 to this Report.\nl33 On October 3, 2oo7, the Miami FBI media officer notified the USAO that the New York Post had reported\nthat federal authorities were not going to pursue federal charges against Epstein. According to the Post, Epstein would\nplead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes, “in a deal that will send him to prison for about l8 months,” folloued\nby “a shorter period of house confinement,” and, according to “sources,” federal authorities had “agreed to drop their\n86\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3288", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003316.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4o of 348\nuntil after Epstein completed his sentence, but that Krischer would oppose such a petition “if it is\nin the agreement.”!”? On November l6, 2oo7, the case agents met with Belohlavek and asked if\nthe State Atorney’s Office would oppose a request that Epstein be granted work release.\nBelohlavek was noncommital, and when the agents asked that she include language in the state’s\nplea agreement prohibiting Epstein from participating in work release, she responded that she\nwould have to discuss the issue with the State Atorney.'®° Krischer later told OPR that work\nrelease was “within the control of the Sheriffs Office, not my office.” The state’s plea agreement\nwith Epstein did not address the issue of work release.\n\nThe day after Epstein entered his June 3o, 2oo8 plea, Villafafia and her immediate\nsupervisor met with a Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office official to discuss work release. According to\nVillafafia, the official told them, “Epstein would be eligible for work release and will be placed on\nwork release,” a statement that contradicted the information the case agents had been given by a\njail supervisor the previous November, as well as statements made by defense atorney Jack\nGoldberger to Villafafia just days before the plea was entered, when he “specifically told\n[Villafafia] that [Epstein] would nor get work release.” Villafafia alerted the Sheriff's Office\nofficial that although Epstein told the court during his plea proceeding that he had worked “every\nday” for a “couple of years” at the “Florida Science Foundation,” that entity did not even exist\nuntil November 2oo7.'®! Moreover, the address Epstein provided to the court for the “Florida\nScience Foundation” was the office of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia and her\nsupervisor asked that the Sheriffs Office notify the USAO if Epstein applied for work release.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he was aware Villafafia was trying to ensure that Epstein did not get\nwork release, and he would not have contradicted her efforts. Acosta explained that the USAO\nexpected Epstein would be “treated just like everyone else,” but that, as shoun by “our subsequent\ncommunications with the [S]tate [A]torney’s [O]ffice,” having Epstein on work release “was not\nwhat our office envisioned.”\n\nIn August 2oo8, Villafafia spoke with defense atorney Black about ensuring Epstein’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with the NPA, and raised the issue of work release. Villafafia later reported to Acosta\nand Sloman that Black assured her he had “reminded the team that . . . l8 months IN JAIL is a\nmaterial term of the agreement.”\n\nThe USAO never received notice of Epstein’s work release application. On October lo,\n2oo8, less than three-and-a-half months after Epstein entered his guilty plea, the Palm Beach\nSheriff's Office placed him into the work release program, permiting him to leave the Stockade\nl7? According to Sloman, Krischer explained that even without registration Epstein would be “treated” as a “sex\noffender” and that “just like any other sex offender, he can petition the court for work release.”\nl8D In the November l6, 2oo7 email, on which she copied Acosta, Villafafia also indicated that she was\n“reviewing all of the statutes” to determine whether there was any impediment to a state judge granting Epstein work\nrelease. In a subsequent email, the FBI case agents informed Villafafia that they had also spoken with a “jail\nsupervisor,” who advised them that although Epstein, as a sexual offender, would not qualify for work release, the\njudge could nevertheless order him placed on work release if he was sentenced to a year or less of incarceration.\n\nl8l During the plea hearing, Epstein told the court he was “President” of the Florida Science Foundation, it had\nbeen in existence for l5 years, and he worked there “every day.” Plea Hearing Transcript at 27-29.\nll4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33l6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003320.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l44 of 348\ncooperation.'° When Villafafia spoke with atorneys in the Eastern District of New York,\nhouever, an AUSA there told Villafafia that “[t]hey had never heard of” Epstein, and he had not\ncooperated with the Bear Stearns case.'*’ During her OPR interview, Villafafia told OPR that to\nher knouledge, the rumor of Epstein’s cooperation was “completely false.”\n\nVillafafia and the USAO continued to monitor Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with the terms of the\nNPA. In August 2oo9, Villafafia alerted her supervisors that Epstein was in apparent violation of\nhis home detention—he had been spoted walking on the beach, and when stopped by the police,\nhe claimed that he was walking “to work” at an office nearly eight miles from his home. Villafafia\npassed this information along to the Palm Beach County probation office.'** By leter dated\nSeptember l, 2oo9, Black wrote to Sloman seeking the USAO’s agreement to transfer supervision\nof the community control phase of Epstein’s sentence to the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Epstein\nmaintained his “primary residence.” In response, Villafafia notified Black that the USAO opposed\nsuch a request and would view it as a violation of the NPA. Three months later, Sloman met with\nDershouitz and, among other issues, informed him that the USAO opposed early termination of\nEpstein’s community control supervision and would object to a request to transfer Epstein’s\nsupervision to the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nAfter serving his year on home detention in Florida, Epstein completed his sentence on\nJuly 2l, 2olo.\nl86 See “Out of Prison,” New York Post, July 23, 2oo9.\nl87 The New York AUSA had emailed Villafafia, “We’re the prosecutors in [the Bear Stearns case] .... We\nsaw the belou article from the New York Post and wanted to ask you about this defendant, Epstein, who we had never\nheard of until this morning. We’ve since learned that he is prety unsavory.” Villafafia reported to Sloman and other\nsupervisors that she “just got off the phone with the prosecutors from the Bear Stearns case in [the Eastern District of]\nNew York. They had seen the NY Post article that claimed that Epstein got such a lou sentence because he was\ncooperating with the feds on the Bear Stearns prosecution. They had never heard of him.” In a second email, she\nconfirmed, “There has been absolutely no cooperation here or in New York, from what they told me.”\nl88 Black later wrote a leter to Villafafia claiming that Epstein had “specific authorization to walk to work,” the\ndistance between his home and office was “less than three miles,” and when the mater was “fully investigated,”\nEpstein was found to be in “total <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span>” with the requirements of his sentence.\n\nll8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo332o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003347.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l7l of 348\nand guaranteed sexual offender registration by Epstein . . . were\namong the factors [that led to the NPA].7\"\n\nDuring her OPR interview, Villafafia similarly described the victims’ general reluctance to\ngo forward with a trial:\n\n[W]hen we would meet with victims, we would ask them hou they\nwanted the case to be resolved.

A number of the victims raised concerns about having to\n\ntestify and/or their parents finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.\n\nAdditionally, for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\n\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall, many of the\n\nvictims were troubled about the existence of the investigation. They displayed\n\nfeelings of embarrassment and humiliation and were reluctant to talk to\n\ninvestigators. Some victims who were identified through the investigation refused\n\neven to speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and geting to\n\nthe truth were always at the forefront of our handling of the investigation.\n\nIn addition, during the CVRA litigation, an atorney representing several victims filed a pleading to protect\nthe anonymity of his clients by preventing disclosure of their identities to the CVRA petitioners. See Response to\nCourt Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial <span class=\"highlight\">Compliance</span> (July 24, 2ol5). It is noteworthy that in\n2o2o, when OPR atempted to contact victims, through their counsel, for interviews or responses to writen questions\nregarding contacts with the USAO, OPR was informed that most of the victims were still deeply concerned about\nremaining anonymous. One victim described to OPR hou she became distraught when, during the USAO’s\ninvestigation, the FBI left a business card at her parents’ home and, as a result, her parents learned that she was a\nvictim of Epstein. At the time, the victim was a teenager; was “nervous, scared, and ashamed”; and did not want her\nparents to knou about the case.\n\nl45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3347", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003378.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o2 of 348\nsearch warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase,\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.*°? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “‘we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment.

Additionally,\nthe second, third, and fourth rights refer to “victim notification, and access to, public proceedings\ninvolving release, plea, sentencing or parole—none of which commence prior to the filing of a\ncomplaint.”\n\nB. 2oo5 Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance\n\nIn May 2oo5, the Department updated its Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and\nWitness Assistance (2oo5 Guidelines) to include the CVRA.”® The 2oo5 Guidelines specifically\ncited the CVRA requirement that agencies “engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution\nof crime shall make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded” their\nCVRA rights, which in 2oo5 encompassed the initial eight CVRA rights.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines provided detail regarding implementation of the Department’s CVRA\nduties and divided criminal cases into an “investigation stage,” a “prosecution stage,” and a\n“corrections stage.” The individuals responsible for notifying crime victims of their CVRA rights\nvaried depending on the stage of the proceedings.\n\nDuring the “investigation stage” of cases in which the FBI was the investigating agency,\nthe Special Agent in Charge was responsible for identifying the victims “[a]t the earliest\nopportunity after the detection of a crime” and notifying them of their rights under the CVRA and\nservices available under the VRRA and other federal statutes.\n\n[D]uring the investigative stage, [the Department] mandates\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act, 42 U.S.C\n\n§ lo6o7, which requires federal officials to, among other things,\n\nidentify victims, protect victims, arrange for victims to receive\n\nreasonable protection from suspected offenders, and provide\nThe Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4 (Dec. l7, 2olo) (““OLC\nAvailability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo)”) and available at htps://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olce/\nopinions/2olo/l2/3 l/availability-crime-victims-rights.pdf. “That [2oo5] informal guidance did not foreclose the\npossibility that other definitions would also be reasonable.” OLC Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo) at l.\n269 The 2oo5 Guidelines are set forth in relevant part in Chapter Three, Part Two, Section II of this Report.

The CVRA Litigation Proceedings and Current Status\n\nWhile the CVRA litigation was pending in the Southern District of Florida, numerous\nfederal civil suits against Epstein, brought in the same district, were transferred to the same judge\nas “related cases,” as a mater of judicial economy pursuant to the Local Rules. As the parties\nagreed on setlements in those civil cases, they were dismissed.*** Several of the victims who had\nsetled their civil cases filed a pleading in the CVRA litigation asking the court to “maintain their\nanonymity” and not “further disseminate[]” their identities to the CVRA petitioners.**°\n\nIn the CVRA case, the petitioners claimed that the government violated their CVRA rights\nto confer by (l) negotiating and signing the NPA without victim input; (2) sending leters to the\nvictims claiming that the mater was “under investigation” after the NPA was already signed; and\n(3) not properly informing the victims that the state plea would also resolve the federal\ninvestigation. In addition, the petitioners alleged that the government violated their CVRA right\nto be treated with fairness by concealing the NPA negotiation and also violated their CVRA right\nto reasonable notice by concealing that the state court proceeding impacted the enforcement of the\nNPA and resolved the federal investigation.\n\nDuring the litigation, the USAO argued that (l) the victims had no right to notice or\nconferral about the NPA because the CVRA rights did not apply pre-charge; (2) the government’s\n383 l57 Cong. Rec. $7359-o2 (2oll) (Kyl leter and Department response).\na8e Epstein also resolved some county court civil cases during this time period as well. In addition, numerous\nother cases were resolved outside of formal litigation. For example, one atorney told OPR that he resolved l6 victim\ncases, but did not file all cases with the court. Court data indicate that the atorney filed only 3 of the l6 cases he said\nhe resolved.\n\n385 Doe, Response to Court Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial <span class=\"highlight\">Compliance</span> at l (July 24,\n2ol5).\n242\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3444", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003463.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 287 of 348\nrequire victim approval of the prosecutors’ plans, but it allous victims the opportunity to express\ntheir views and to be heard before a final decision is made. The lack of consultation in this case\ndenied the victims that opportunity.*°\nI. LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS BY THE FBI WERE NOT FALSE STATEMENTS\n\nBUT RISKED MISLEADING VICTIMS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia and the FBI separately\ncommunicated with numerous victims and victims’ atorneys, both in person and through leters.\nApart from three victims who likely were informed in October or November 2oo7 about a\nresolution ending the federal investigation, victims were not informed about the NPA or even more\ngenerally that the USAO had agreed to end its federal criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled\nguilty to state charges until after Epstein entered his guilty plea in June 2oo8. Despite the\ngovernment’s agreement on September 24, 2oo7, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8, leters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.” In its February 2l,\n2ol9 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those leters “misl[ed] the victims to\nbelieve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for\nthe Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about\nwhich it had already bound itself not to prosecute.” 4\n\nIn the discussions throughout this section, OPR examines the government’s course of\nconduct with victims after the NPA was signed. As set forth in the previous subsection, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia acted with the intent to\nsilence victims. Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s\ninteractions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s inconsistent messages concerning\nthe federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.\n\nIn this section, OPR examines and discusses leters sent to victims by the FBI that were the\nsubject of the district court’s findings. OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia\nwas aware of the content of the leters until the USAO received them from the FBI for production\nfor the CVRA litigation. OPR determined that the January lo, 2oo8 and May 3o, 2oo8 leters that\nthe district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October l2, 2oo7 leter OPR located\nduring its investigation, were “standard form leter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim Specialist. As\nnoted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the FBI agents continued\nto conduct their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such a\n4o8 Villafafia told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was\nsigned and “ask[ing] them hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” FBI interview reports indicate that Villafafia\nwas present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations. See 2oo5\nGuidelines, Art. IV, § B.2.c (l) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying\nonly nonsensitive data and public information). Houever, Villafafia did not meet with all of the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation, including the CVRA litigation petitioners, and the government conceded during the CVRA\nlitigation that it entered into the NPA without conferring with the petitioners.

Martindell, 594 F.2d at\n294 (Martindell decided in l979). The proper procedure for modifying a civil Protective Order at\nthe government’s request, in other words, is the one that affords due process. U.S. CONST.\namend. V.\n\nThat no case has addressed the remedy for a Martindell violation is evidence only of (l)\nthe government’s prior <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with Martindell (which should, of course, be expected), or\n(2) a criminal defendant having not raised the issue before. In this case, houever, (l) the\ngovernment violated Martindell, and (2) Maxwell seeks suppression as a sanction.\n\nSuppression is the proper remedy for at least two reasons. First, at its heart, Martindell is\ngrounded in due process principles, and the government’s conduct here violated Maxwell’s right\nto due process. See U.S. CONST. amend. V. The essence of due process is notice and an\nopportunity to be heard. Martindell guaranteed Maxwell notice and an opportunity to be heard,\n594 F.2d at 294, as did the Protective Order, Mot. 3, Ex. A, §] l4. But Maxwell had no idea that\nthe Giuffre Protective Order had been modified behind her back until she was indicted and the\ngovernment disclosed the 9o,ooo pages of material it obtained from Boies Schiller.? The\ngovernment’s due process violation warrants suppression. F.g., Raheem v. Kelly, 257 F.3d l22,\nl35 (2d Cir. 2ool) (suppression for due process violation).\n\nSecond, because the government violated Martindell not only by denying Maxwell notice\nand an opportunity to be heard, but also by affirmatively misleading Chief Judge McMahon,\n\n* To this day, Judge Preska—who is presiding over the Giuffre action since Judge Sweet’s\npassing and is addressing the Protective Order on a daily basis as the parties brief what material should be\nunsealed—apparently does not knou the Protective Order was modified.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3788", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003859.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l8 Filed o4/l9/2l Page7of8\nThe Hon.

Aguilar, No. CR o7-ooo3o (SBA), 2oo8 WL 3l82o29, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Aug.\n4, 2oo8). Maxwell argues that the materials are relevant because they may reveal monetary\nincentives to testify in a particular way. That argument demonstrates that the documents are\nbeing sought for impeachment. As stated above, the mere fact that certain documents might be\nimpeachment evidence does not render them “relevant” for purposes of Rule l7(c); if at all, those\ndocuments would become relevant only after a witness testifies. See Skelos, 2ol8 WL 2254538,\nat *2. Maxwell’s argument that the documents are relevant because their impeachment value is\nexculpatory does not get around this general bar. These materials only become relevant if or\nwhen those witnesses testify. She presents no other nonconclusory basis as to why they are\nexculpatory. Indeed, Maxwell concedes that the primary purpose of these documents will be for\npurposes of cross-examination, leaving litle doubt as to the purported claim of relevance. And\nto the extent Maxwell posits that statements made as part of the EVCP process may be\nexculpatory in themselves, the argument is speculative because she provides no basis for why\nthat expectation might be reasonable. The “mere hope” that the documents may contain some\nexculpatory evidence is insufficient to justify enforcement of a Rule l7(c) subpoena (or, as here,\nissuance of such a subpoena in the face of objections). See United States v. Rich, No. S 83-CR-\n579 (SWK), l984 WL 845, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 7, l984). Maxwell’s reliance on cases\ninvolving the Government’s obligations under Brady and Giglio to produce impeachment\nevidence prior to trial are thus inapposite to the current context.

The Government’s Subpoena-Related Request\n\nThe Government seeks a preemptive, blanket ruling that it be entitled notice of all future\nsubpoenas, an opportunity to challenge them, and production of any information obtained\ntherefrom. This request is denied. Assuming Maxwell seeks the issuance of a future subpoena\nfor which there is no basis to proceed ex parte, the Government will be provided notice and the\nCourt would likely consider the Government’s briefing regardless of standing as part of its duty\nto ensure that the subpoena meets the requirements of Nixon.

Ironically, it is the MDC staff who leaked to the press that Ms. Maxwell had\nbeen vaccinated.\n\nFurther, in her desire to interact and be helpful with other inmates, Ms. Maxwell\ncompleted two programs to assist other inmates- (l) to qualify as a teacher aide and offered to\nhelp update MDC learning curriculum and (2) to qualify as companion for suicide watch. Her\nde facto solitary confinement prevents her from utilizing that training to assist others.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s segregation and surveillance go way beyond the concerns posited by the\nMDC. It is not only other inmates who may harm Ms. Maxwell, but also the very guards tasked\nto her security detail who have already done harm to her: failing to provide adequate food or feed\nher at all in a 2o-hour period, damaging her discovery hard drive, seizing her confidential legal\ndocuments, erasing her CorrLinks emails, physically abusing her. The list goes on and on. In an\neffort to advocate in <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with BOP procedure, she has filed hundreds of BP-8s, BP-9s\nand BP-los only to receive a response that is less than helpful, or in the absence of any response\nwas told the form was either lost or never filed, Each and every day of her detention, she is\nguarded by at least three officers who watch and record, by writing and via a handheld camera,\nher every move: when she eats, shouers, cleans her clothes, brushes her teeth, etc. As the guards\nfeverishly write while observing Ms. Maxwell during videoconferencing with counsel, it appears\nthat they go beyond their routine continual l5-minute reporting.\n\nFurther, her non-legal phone calls are monitored in real time. It was the staff who\nconfronted Ms. Maxwell about the death of someone whom she was close to within hours on her\nlearning about it, information derived from her phone calls. Ms. Maxwell does not discuss\npersonal maters with MDC guards and did not provide information concerning the passing of\nsomeone quite dear to her. It was psychological services who confronted her regarding that\ninformation, which could only have been obtained through telephone surveillance. We invite the\nCourt and government to review the calls which contradict the unsupported allegation that Ms.\nMaxwell is a flight risk and support her family strong ties. Her monitored communication with\nfamily and friends evidences her strong ties in the United States, her strong desire to return to her\nfamily in the United States, and her intention to establish her innocence at her trial in the United\nStates.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4lo8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004312.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l5 of 349\nthat the victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the\nDepartment.\n\nVI. ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43l2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004330.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 33 of 349\nfor the Department’s Criminal Division, a position in which he served as Chief of Staff to Assistant\nAtorney General Alice Fisher.

She served\nin the Major Crimes Section in Miami until January 2oo4, when she transferred to the West Palm\nBeach branch office. Villafafia handled the majority of the child exploitation cases in West Palm\nBeach, along with other criminal maters. In 2oo6, she was designated as the USAO’s first\ncoordinator for Project Safe Childhood, a new Department initiative focusing on child sexual\nexploitation and abuse.”\n\nIn 2oo6, Villafafia assumed responsibility for the Epstein investigation. As the line AUSA,\nVillafafia handled all aspects of the investigation. Villafafia determined the lines of inquiry to\npursue, identified the witnesses to be interviewed, conducted legal research to support possible\ncharges, and sought guidance from others at the USAO and in the Department. Villafafia, along\nwith the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim Specialist, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.\nShe handled court proceedings related to the investigation. She drafted a prosecution\nmemorandum, indictment, and related documents, and revised those documents in response to\ncomments from those in her supervisory chain of command. Villafafia participated in meetings\nbetween members of the USAO and counsel for Epstein, and prepared briefing materials for\nmanagement in preparation for those meetings and in response to issues raised during those\nmeetings. Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve\nthe federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafafia was the primary USAO\nrepresentative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her\nsupervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO. Thereafter,\nVillafafia monitored Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with the NPA and addressed issues relating to his\nconduct. After two victims pursued a federal civil lawsuit seeking enforcement of their rights\nunder the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l (“the CVRA litigation” or “the\nCVRA case”), in July 2oo8, Villafafia served as co-counsel to the lead atorney representing the\nUSAO until February 2ol9, when the USAO was recused from handling the litigation.?

Led by the U.S. Atorneys’ Offices\nand CEOS, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state, and local resources to locate, apprehend, and prosecute\nindividuals who exploit children via the internet, as well as to identify and rescue victims.\n\n3 After the district court issued its February 2l, 2ol9 opinion finding misconduct on the part of the government,\nthe Department re-assigned the CVRA case to the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo433o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004345.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 48 of 349\n\nOn July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia alerted Sloman, who informed Acosta, that the State Atorney’s\nOffice had charged and arrested Epstein.7® On that same day, the FBI in West Palm Beach formally\nopened the case, assigning the case agent and, later, a co-case agent, to investigate it. Villafafia\ntold Sloman that the FBI agents “are geting copies of all of the evidence and we are going to\nreview everything at [the] FBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her target date for filing federal\ncharges against Epstein was August 25, 2oo6. Acosta emailed Sloman, asking whether it was\n“appropriate to approach [State Atorney Krischer] and give him a heads up re where we might\ngo?” Sloman replied, “No for fear that it will be leaked straight to Epstein.””°\n\nAlthough Lourie learned of the case at this point from Sloman, and eventually took a more\nactive role in supervising the investigation, Villafafia continued to update Acosta and Sloman\ndirectly on the progress of the case.*° Villafafia’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach had\nlitle involvement in supervising the Epstein investigation, and at times, Villafafia directed her\nemails to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie without copying her immediate supervisor. In the\nimmediate supervisor’s view, houever, “Miami” purposefully assumed all the “authority” for the\ncase, which the immediate supervisor regarded as “highly unusual.”*!\n\nBy late August 2oo6, Villafafia and the FBI had identified several additional victims and\nobtained “some flight manifests, telephone messages, and cell phone records that shou the\ncommunication and travel in interstate commerce” by Epstein and his associates. Villafafia\nreported to her supervisors that the State Atorney’s Office would not provide transcripts from the\nstate grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convince him to\nrelinquish the evidence to the FBI.” Villafafia also told her supervisors that she expected “a\nnumber of fights” over her document demands, and that some parties were refusing to comply\n“after having contact with Epstein or his atorneys.”\n\nVillafafia’s reference to anticipated “fights” and lack of <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> led Sloman to ask\nwhether she was referring to the victims. Villafafia responded that the problems did not involve\nvictims, but rather a former employee of Epstein and some business entities that had objected to\ndocument demands as overly burdensome. Villafafia explained to Sloman and Lourie that some\nvictims were “scared and/or embarrassed,” and some had been intimidated by the defense, but\n“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.” Villafafia\na8 On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafafia had not yet briefed about the case, noting that\nOperation Leap Year was “a highly sensitive case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”\n\n28 During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was\nlikely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some\ntype of relationship between somebody in the [State Atorney’s Office] and the defense team.”\n“o After Villafafia sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her mmediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman,\nand Acosta on August 23, 2oo6, Lourie emailed Sloman: “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the\ncase?” Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care. If Alex says something then I'll tell her to just run it\nthrough you guys.”\n3l OPR understood “Miami” to be a reference to the senior managers who were located in the Miami office,\nthat is, Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel. Records shou, and Villafafia told OPR, that she believed Epstein’s atorneys\n“made a conscious decision to skip” her immediate supervisor and directed their communications to the supervisory\nchain above the immediate supervisor—Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta.\n\n2l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4345", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004360.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 63 of 349\ndamages.°>> During a two-month period, the subject atorneys were involved to varying degrees in\nconverting the broad outline into specific terms, resulting in the NPA signed by Epstein on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. The subjects, including Acosta, were generally able to explain to OPR both\nthe larger goals and the case-related factors they likely considered during the process of\nconceptualizing, negotiating, and finalizing this resolution. Houever, the contemporaneous emails\nand other records do not reflect all of the conversations among the decision makers, and their\ndeliberative and decision-making process is therefore not entirely clear. In particular, Menchel\nand Acosta had offices located near each other and likely spoke in person about the case, but\nneither had a clear memory of their conversations. Therefore, OPR could not determine all of the\nfacts surrounding the development of the two-year state plea resolution or the NPA.\n\nIn the follouing account, OPR discusses the initial key decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through state, rather than federal, charges, and sets forth many of the numerous\ncommunications that reflect the negotiations between the parties that led to the final NPA. OPR\nquestioned each of the subjects about hou the decision was reached to pursue a state resolution,\nand OPR includes belou the subjects’ explanations. The subjects’ memories of particular\nconversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus\nemerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the\nwillingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the\ncase that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail\nat trial and through appeal. In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority\nto prosecute a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based\non this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve\nthe mater through a state plea. In any event, Acosta acknouledged to OPR that, at a minimum,\nhe approved of the concept of a state-based resolution after being made aware of the allegations\nand the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum.\nFurthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.\n\nA. June — July 2oo7: The USAO Proposes a State Plea Resolution, which the\n\nDefense Rejects\n\nA few days after the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafafia, advising her that\nEpstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July ll, 2oo7, and hoped\n“to be able to reach a state-based resolution shortly thereafter.”** In a July 3, 2oo7 email, Villafafia\ntold Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea\ndiscussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a resolution of the federal investigation that could\n» State laws require that a person convicted of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allou\nlaw enforcement and the public to knou the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and,\nin some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities. The Florida Sexual Offender/Predator Registry\nis administered by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act\nof 2oo6 established a comprehensive, national sex offender registration system called the Sex Offender Registration\nand Notification Act (SORNA), to close potential gaps and loopholes that existed under prior laws and to strengthen\nthe nationwide network of sex offender registrations.\n\n56 In this email, Sanchez also requested a two-week extension of time for <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with the USAO’s demands\nfor records, which included a demand for the computer equipment that had been taken from Epstein’s residence before\nthe October 2oo5 state search warrant and that Villafafia had been requesting from the defense since late 2oo6.\n36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo436o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004388.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 9l of 349\nnoted that the revised charges involved l9 victims, so the defense proposal for a l5-month sentence\namounted to less than one month per victim. Villafafia requested that “whatever the U.S. Atorney\ndecides to do,” the agreement with Epstein should “follou . .. a version of my writen non-\nprosecution agreement” in order to “avoid any state shenanigans and . . . keep the defense on a\nstrict timeline.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia circulated to Acosta and Sloman a revised NPA that called for a\n2o-month jail sentence to be folloued by lo months of home confinement. This redrafted NPA\ncontained a provision that specified, “With credit for gain time, Epstein shall serve at least\nl7 months in a state correctional institution.”'°* Acosta reviewed the revised NPA and amended\nit to include a statement clarifying that it was Epstein’s obligation “to undertake discussions with\nthe State of Florida to ensure <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with these procedures.” Villafafia sent her version of the\nrevised NPA to Lefcourt that afternoon and forwarded Acosta’s proposed change to him the\nfollouing day, after she learned of it.\n\nOn September ll, 2oo7, the court contacted Villafafia to inquire whether the USAO would\nbe prepared to proceed with the litigation concerning the computers the follouing day. At\nSloman’s direction, Villafafia asked the court to delay the hearing, and the court rescheduled it for\nthe follouing week. At the same time, anticipating that plea negotiations would fail, Villafafia\ncirculated a revised indictment to her co-counsel and Oosterban, seeking their feedback before\nsending it “through the chain of command.” Villafafia also sent Oosterban the revised NPA and\ntold him she was “still shooting for 9/25” to bring charges, assuming the defense declined the\nUSAO’s offer. Oosterban responded, “The counter-offering is unfortunate, but I suppose it’s\nunderstandable.”!\n\nThat afternoon, Lourie asked Villafafia, “What is our latest offer?” Villafafia responded,\n“Plead to the three specified [state] charges, a 3o-month sentence, split 2o in jail and lo in\n‘community control,’ and agree that the girls are victims for purposes of damages. We also put in\ndeadlines for a plea and sentencing date.”\n\nB. September l2, 2oo7: The USAO and Defense Counsel Meet with the State\n\nAtorney\n\nAlthough the USAO and defense counsel had been discussing resolving the federal\ninvestigation with a plea to state charges, there is no evidence that the USAO involved the State\nAtorney’s Office in those discussions until September l2, 2oo7. On that day, Lourie, Villafafia,\nand another USAO supervisor who would be replacing Lourie as manager of the USAO’s West\nPalm Beach office, and Epstein atorneys Lefkouitz, Lefcourt, and Goldberger met with State\nAtorney Barry Krischer and Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek. Other than Villafafia,\nfew of the participants had any memory of the meeting or the results of it. The available evidence\nindicates that the USAO made additional concessions during the meeting.\nlos Through “gain time,” Florida inmates can earn a reduction in their sentence for good behavior.\n\nlo5 Oosterban told OPR that he did not recall having read the NPA at this juncture and “had no involvement\nwith it.”\n64\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4388", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004410.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll3 of 349\nit had identified as victims.'°! The USAO, with the good faith approval of\nEpstein’s counsel, would select an atorney representative for the victims,\nwhom Epstein would pay.\n\nTiming: Epstein would make his best efforts to enter his guilty plea and be sentenced\nby October 26, 2oo7. The USAO had no objection to Epstein self-reporting\nto begin serving his sentence by January 4, 2oo8.\n\nImmunity: The USAO would not initiate criminal charges against “any potential\nco-conspirator of Epstein,” including four named personal assistants.\n\nOther: Epstein was obligated to undertake discussions with the State Atorney’s\nOffice to ensure <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with this agreement.\n\nEpstein waived his right to appeal.\n\nEpstein agreed that he would not be afforded any benefits with respect to\ngain time or other rights, opportunities, and benefits not available to any\nother inmate.\n\nThe federal investigation would be suspended and all pending legal process\nheld in abeyance unless and until Epstein violated any term of the\nagreement. Evidence “requested by or directly related to” the pending legal\nprocess, “including certain computer equipment,” would be kept inviolate\nuntil all the NPA terms had been satisfied.\n\nBreach: The USAO would be required to notify Epstein of any alleged breach of the\nagreement within 9o days of the expiration of the term of home\nconfinement, and would be required to initiate prosecution within 6o days\nthereafter.\n\nDisclosure: The parties “anticipate[d]” that the agreement would not be made part of\nany public record, and if the USAO received a Freedom of Information Act\nrequest or compulsory process commanding disclosure of the agreement, it\nwould provide notice to Epstein before making any disclosure. !*\n\nThat evening, Lefkouitz emailed Lourie to express concern about the notification he\nunderstood would be given to Chief Reiter, stating, “I am very concerned about leaks unduly\nprejudicing Jeffrey [Epstein] in the media.”!°? He added, “I have enjoyed working with you on\nHe The USAO had not informed the defense of the victims’ identities at this point. The parties anticipated that\nthe USAO would send Epstein’s atorneys a list of victims when Epstein fulfilled his obligation under the NPA to\nenter his state guilty pleas.\n\nl32 The final NPA is atached as Exhibit 3 to this Report.\nl33 On October 3, 2oo7, the Miami FBI media officer notified the USAO that the New York Post had reported\nthat federal authorities were not going to pursue federal charges against Epstein. According to the Post, Epstein would\nplead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes, “in a deal that will send him to prison for about l8 months,” folloued\nby “a shorter period of house confinement,” and, according to “sources,” federal authorities had “agreed to drop their\n86\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44lo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004438.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l4l of 349\nuntil after Epstein completed his sentence, but that Krischer would oppose such a petition “if it is\nin the agreement.”!”? On November l6, 2oo7, the case agents met with Belohlavek and asked if\nthe State Atorney’s Office would oppose a request that Epstein be granted work release.\nBelohlavek was noncommital, and when the agents asked that she include language in the state’s\nplea agreement prohibiting Epstein from participating in work release, she responded that she\nwould have to discuss the issue with the State Atorney.'®° Krischer later told OPR that work\nrelease was “within the control of the Sheriffs Office, not my office.” The state’s plea agreement\nwith Epstein did not address the issue of work release.\n\nThe day after Epstein entered his June 3o, 2oo8 plea, Villafafia and her immediate\nsupervisor met with a Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office official to discuss work release. According to\nVillafafia, the official told them, “Epstein would be eligible for work release and will be placed on\nwork release,” a statement that contradicted the information the case agents had been given by a\njail supervisor the previous November, as well as statements made by defense atorney Jack\nGoldberger to Villafafia just days before the plea was entered, when he “specifically told\n[Villafafia] that [Epstein] would not get work release.” Villafafia alerted the Sheriff’s Office\nofficial that although Epstein told the court during his plea proceeding that he had worked “every\nday” for a “couple of years” at the “Florida Science Foundation,” that entity did not even exist\nuntil November 2oo7.'*! Moreover, the address Epstein provided to the court for the “Florida\nScience Foundation” was the office of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia and her\nsupervisor asked that the Sheriffs Office notify the USAO if Epstein applied for work release.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he was aware Villafafia was trying to ensure that Epstein did not get\nwork release, and he would not have contradicted her efforts. Acosta explained that the USAO\nexpected Epstein would be “treated just like everyone else,” but that, as shoun by “our subsequent\ncommunications with the [S]tate [A]torney’s [O]ffice,” having Epstein on work release “was not\nwhat our office envisioned.”\n\nIn August 2oo8, Villafafia spoke with defense atorney Black about ensuring Epstein’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with the NPA, and raised the issue of work release. Villafafia later reported to Acosta\nand Sloman that Black assured her he had “reminded the team that .. . l8 months IN JAIL is a\nmaterial term of the agreement.”\n\nThe USAO never received notice of Epstein’s work release application. On October lo,\n2oo8, less than three-and-a-half months after Epstein entered his guilty plea, the Palm Beach\nSheriff's Office placed him into the work release program, permiting him to leave the Stockade\nl7? According to Sloman, Krischer explained that even without registration Epstein would be “treated” as a “sex\noffender” and that “just like any other sex offender, he can petition the court for work release.”\nl8D In the November l6, 2oo7 email, on which she copied Acosta, Villafafia also indicated that she was\n“reviewing all of the statutes” to determine whether there was any impediment to a state judge granting Epstein work\nrelease. In a subsequent email, the FBI case agents informed Villafafia that they had also spoken with a “jail\nsupervisor,” who advised them that although Epstein, as a sexual offender, would not qualify for work release, the\njudge could nevertheless order him placed on work release if he was sentenced to a year or less of incarceration.\n\nl8l During the plea hearing, Epstein told the court he was “President” of the Florida Science Foundation, it had\nbeen in existence for l5 years, and he worked there “every day.” Plea Hearing Transcript at 27-29.\nll4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4438", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004442.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l45 of 349\ncooperation.'° When Villafafia spoke with atorneys in the Eastern District of New York,\nhouever, an AUSA there told Villafafia that “[t]hey had never heard of” Epstein, and he had not\ncooperated with the Bear Stearns case.'8’ During her OPR interview, Villafafia told OPR that to\nher knouledge, the rumor of Epstein’s cooperation was “completely false.”\n\nVillafafia and the USAO continued to monitor Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with the terms of the\nNPA. In August 2oo9, Villafafia alerted her supervisors that Epstein was in apparent violation of\nhis home detention—he had been spoted walking on the beach, and when stopped by the police,\nhe claimed that he was walking “to work” at an office nearly eight miles from his home. Villafafia\npassed this information along to the Palm Beach County probation office.'®* By leter dated\nSeptember l, 2oo9, Black wrote to Sloman seeking the USAO’s agreement to transfer supervision\nof the community control phase of Epstein’s sentence to the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Epstein\nmaintained his “primary residence.” In response, Villafafia notified Black that the USAO opposed\nsuch a request and would view it as a violation of the NPA. Three months later, Sloman met with\nDershouitz and, among other issues, informed him that the USAO opposed early termination of\nEpstein’s community control supervision and would object to a request to transfer Epstein’s\nsupervision to the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nAfter serving his year on home detention in Florida, Epstein completed his sentence on\nJuly 2l, 2olo.\nl86 See “Out of Prison,” New York Post, July 23, 2oo9.\nl87 The New York AUSA had emailed Villafafia, “We’re the prosecutors in [the Bear Stearns case].... We\nsaw the belou article from the New York Post and wanted to ask you about this defendant, Epstein, who we had never\nheard of until this morning. We’ve since learned that he is prety unsavory.” Villafafia reported to Sloman and other\nsupervisors that she “just got off the phone with the prosecutors from the Bear Stearns case in [the Eastern District of]\nNew York. They had seen the NY Post article that claimed that Epstein got such a lou sentence because he was\ncooperating with the feds on the Bear Stearns prosecution. They had never heard of him.” In a second email, she\nconfirmed, “There has been absolutely no cooperation here or in New York, from what they told me.”\nl88 Black later wrote a leter to Villafafia claiming that Epstein had “specific authorization to walk to work,” the\ndistance between his home and office was “less than three miles,” and when the mater was “fully investigated,”\nEpstein was found to be in “total <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span>” with the requirements of his sentence.\n\nll8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4442", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004469.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l72 of 349\nand guaranteed sexual offender registration by Epstein . . . were\namong the factors [that led to the NPA].7!°\n\nDuring her OPR interview, Villafafia similarly described the victims’ general reluctance to\ngo forward with a trial:\n\n[W]hen we would meet with victims, we would ask them hou they\nwanted the case to be resolved.

Lourie also told OPR that he generally recalled concerns within the USAO about\nthe charges and a potential trial:\n\n[M]y vague recollection is that I and others had concerns that there\n\nwas a substantial chance we would not prevail at both trial and on\n\nappeal after a conviction, resulting in no jail time, no criminal\n2l5 Doe v.

A number of the victims raised concerns about having to\n\ntestify and/or their parents finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.\n\nAdditionally, for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\n\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall, many of the\n\nvictims were troubled about the existence of the investigation. They displayed\n\nfeelings of embarrassment and humiliation and were reluctant to talk to\n\ninvestigators. Some victims who were identified through the investigation refused\n\neven to speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and geting to\n\nthe truth were always at the forefront of our handling of the investigation.\n\nIn addition, during the CVRA litigation, an atorney representing several victims filed a pleading to protect\nthe anonymity of his clients by preventing disclosure of their identities to the CVRA petitioners. See Response to\nCourt Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial <span class=\"highlight\">Compliance</span> (July 24, 2ol5). It is noteworthy that in\n2o2o, when OPR atempted to contact victims, through their counsel, for interviews or responses to writen questions\nregarding contacts with the USAO, OPR was informed that most of the victims were still deeply concerned about\nremaining anonymous. One victim described to OPR hou she became distraught when, during the USAO’s\ninvestigation, the FBI left a business card at her parents’ home and, as a result, her parents learned that she was a\nvictim of Epstein. At the time, the victim was a teenager; was “nervous, scared, and ashamed”; and did not want her\nparents to knou about the case.\n\nl45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4469", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004500.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o3 of 349\nsearch warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.**? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7.

For\nexample, the first right grants a victim protection from “the accused,” not a suspect. Additionally,\nthe second, third, and fourth rights refer to “victim notification, and access to, public proceedings\ninvolving release, plea, sentencing or parole—none of which commence prior to the filing of a\ncomplaint.”\n\nB. 2oo5 Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance\n\nIn May 2oo5, the Department updated its Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and\nWitness Assistance (2oo5 Guidelines) to include the CVRA.”® The 2oo5 Guidelines specifically\ncited the CVRA requirement that agencies “engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution\nof crime shall make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded” their\nCVRA rights, which in 2oo5 encompassed the initial eight CVRA rights.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines provided detail regarding implementation of the Department’s CVRA\nduties and divided criminal cases into an “investigation stage,” a “prosecution stage,” and a\n“corrections stage.” The individuals responsible for notifying crime victims of their CVRA rights\nvaried depending on the stage of the proceedings.\n\nDuring the “investigation stage” of cases in which the FBI was the investigating agency,\nthe Special Agent in Charge was responsible for identifying the victims “[a]t the earliest\nopportunity after the detection of a crime” and notifying them of their rights under the CVRA and\nservices available under the VRRA and other federal statutes.\n\n[D]uring the investigative stage, [the Department] mandates\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act, 42 U.S.C\n\n§ lo6o7, which requires federal officials to, among other things,\n\nidentify victims, protect victims, arrange for victims to receive\n\nreasonable protection from suspected offenders, and provide\nThe Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4 (Dec. l7, 2olo) (““OLC\nAvailability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo)”) and available at htps://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/ole/\nopinions/2olo/l2/3 l/availability-crime-victims-rights.pdf. “That [2oo5] informal guidance did not foreclose the\npossibility that other definitions would also be reasonable.” OLC Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo) at l.\n269 The 2oo5 Guidelines are set forth in relevant part in Chapter Three, Part Two, Section II of this Report.

The CVRA Litigation Proceedings and Current Status\n\nWhile the CVRA litigation was pending in the Southern District of Florida, numerous\nfederal civil suits against Epstein, brought in the same district, were transferred to the same judge\nas “related cases,” as a mater of judicial economy pursuant to the Local Rules. As the parties\nagreed on setlements in those civil cases, they were dismissed.*** Several of the victims who had\nsetled their civil cases filed a pleading in the CVRA litigation asking the court to “maintain their\nanonymity” and not “further disseminate[]” their identities to the CVRA petitioners.*®°\n\nIn the CVRA case, the petitioners claimed that the government violated their CVRA nights\nto confer by (l) negotiating and signing the NPA without victim input; (2) sending leters to the\nvictims claiming that the mater was “under investigation” after the NPA was already signed; and\n(3) not properly informing the victims that the state plea would also resolve the federal\ninvestigation. In addition, the petitioners alleged that the government violated their CVRA night\nto be treated with fairness by concealing the NPA negotiation and also violated their CVRA right\nto reasonable notice by concealing that the state court proceeding impacted the enforcement of the\nNPA and resolved the federal investigation.\n\nDuring the litigation, the USAO argued that (l) the victims had no right to notice or\nconferral about the NPA because the CVRA rights did not apply pre-charge; (2) the government’s\naB3 l57 Cong. Rec. 87359-o2 (2oll) (Kyl leter and Department response).\na8 Epstein also resolved some county court civil cases during this time period as well. In addition, numerous\nother cases were resolved outside of formal litigation. For example, one atorney told OPR that he resolved l6 victim\ncases, but did not file all cases with the court. Court data indicate that the atorney filed only 3 of the l6 cases he said\nhe resolved.\nae Doe, Response to Court Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial <span class=\"highlight\">Compliance</span> at l (July 24,\n2ol5).\n\n242\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4566", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004585.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 288 of 349\nrequire victim approval of the prosecutors’ plans, but it allous victims the opportunity to express\ntheir views and to be heard before a final decision is made. The lack of consultation in this case\ndenied the victims that opportunity.*°\nI. LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS BY THE FBI WERE NOT FALSE STATEMENTS\n\nBUT RISKED MISLEADING VICTIMS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia and the FBI separately\ncommunicated with numerous victims and victims’ atorneys, both in person and through leters.\nApart from three victims who likely were informed in October or November 2oo7 about a\nresolution ending the federal investigation, victims were not informed about the NPA or even more\ngenerally that the USAO had agreed to end its federal criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled\nguilty to state charges until after Epstein entered his guilty plea in June 2oo8. Despite the\ngovernment’s agreement on September 24, 2oo7, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8, leters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.” In its February 2l,\n2ol9 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those leters “misl[ed] the victims to\nbelieve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for\nthe Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about\nwhich it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*°”\n\nIn the discussions throughout this section, OPR examines the government’s course of\nconduct with victims after the NPA was signed. As set forth in the previous subsection, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia acted with the intent to\nsilence victims. Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s\ninteractions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s inconsistent messages concerning\nthe federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.\n\nIn this section, OPR examines and discusses leters sent to victims by the FBI that were the\nsubject of the district court’s findings. OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia\nwas aware of the content of the leters until the USAO received them from the FBI for production\nfor the CVRA litigation. OPR determined that the January lo, 2oo8 and May 3o, 2oo8 leters that\nthe district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October l2, 2oo7 leter OPR located\nduring its investigation, were “standard form leter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim Specialist. As\nnoted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the FBI agents continued\nto conduct their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such a\n4o8 Villafaia told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was\nsigned and “ask[ing] them hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” FBI interview reports indicate that Villafafia\nwas present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations. See 2oo5\nGuidelines, Art. IV, § B.2.c (l) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying\nonly nonsensitive data and public information). Houever, Villafafia did not meet with all of the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation, including the CVRA litigation petitioners, and the government conceded during the CVRA\nlitigation that it entered into the NPA without conferring with the petitioners.

Nixon, 4l8 U.S. 683, 699-7oo (l974), to justify these additional subpoenas.\n\nAs with her First Motion, she makes this motion ex parte for the “strong policy reasons in\nfavor of an ex parte” process and because she is providing detail regarding her investigative and\ntrial strategy to demonstrate <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with the specificity, relevance, and admissibility\nrequirements of a Fed.

Request\n\nMs. Maxwell filed various pretrial motions which are currently pending before the Court.\nMs. Maxwell anticipates that one or more of her pending motions will require the presentation of\nevidence, that certain evidence central to the accusations in this mater will need to be examined\nin advance of trial as part of the investigation of her defense, and that the requested evidence is\nadmissible at trial. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell seeks production of these materials in advance of\ntrial. She makes this motion ex parte for the “strong policy reasons in favor of an ex parte”\nprocess and because she is providing detail regarding her investigative and trial strategy to\ndemonstrate <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with the specificity, relevance, and admissibility requirements of a Rule\nl7(c) subpoena. United States v. Reyes, l62 F.R.D. 468, 47o (S.D.N.Y. l995).\n\nIt is well-established that the Court may order that the materials should be produced to\ncounsel’s office, rather than to the courtroom itself. See, e.g., United States v. DNRB, Inc., No.\n4:l5-cr-o362, 2ol7 WL 28o625l, at *3 (W.D. Mo. June 27, 2ol7) (directing production to\nrequesting party); United States v. Jewell, Crim. No. 4:o7-cr-oolo3, 2oo8 WL 387l736, at *3\n(E.D. Ark. Aug. l5, 2oo8) (directing third-party to produce nonprivileged responsive material to\ndefendant’s counsel). Once delivered to counsel's office, the materials are not automatically\nrequired to be shared with the government. Whether they are required to be shared is determined\nby other applicable rules, e.g., Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(b).\n\nAs with her First Motion, she makes this motion ex parte for the “strong policy reasons in\nfavor of an ex parte” process and because she is providing detail regarding her investigative and\ntrial strategy to demonstrate <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with the specificity, relevance, and admissibility\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5o5l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005056.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 336-l Filed o9/o7/2l Page 4 of 6o\nAO 89B (o7/l6) Subpoena to Produce Documents, Information, or Objects in a Criminal Case (Page 3)\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure l7 (c), (d), (e), and (g) (Effective l2/l/o8)\n(c) Producing Documents and Objects.\n(l) In General.

Preclusion of the Purported Statements is the Only Appropriate Remedy\n\nFed. R. Crim.

In exercising its discretion, the district court must weigh several factors, including the\nreasons for the government’s delay in affording the required discovery, the extent of prejudice, if\nany, the defendant has suffered because of the delay, and the feasibility of curing such prejudice\nby granting a continuance. United States v. Wicker, 848 F.2d lo59, lo6o (loth Cir. l988).\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision in Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U.S. 4oo (l988) is instructive.\nTaylor involved the exclusion of a witness of whom the defense had knoun but failed to\ndisclose. The defendant challenged the trial court's exclusion of the witness as a sanction for the\ndiscovery violation, alleging that it violated his right to present witnesses under the Sixth\nAmendment’s compulsory process clause. In determining whether a preclusion sanction is\nappropriate, the Court mandated that a trial court exercise its discretion by balancing a\ndefendant’s fundamental right “to offer the testimony of witnesses in his favor” against\ncountervailing public interests. /d. at 4l4. These interests include “[t]he integrity of the adversary\nprocess, which depends both on the presentation of reliable evidence and the rejection of\nunreliable evidence, the interest in the fair and efficient administration of justice, and the\npotential prejudice to the truth-determining function of the trial process.” Jd. at 4l4-l5.

Usually in a lou-key, nonforcible fashion, possibly by\npresenting the activity as a game or something that is ‘special’ and fun.\nThis always entails misrepresentation of moral standards, either verbally\nor implicitly... . Perhaps rewards or bribes will be offered.”\n\nSalter (l995) “The establishment (and eventual betrayal) of affection and trust occupies\na central role in the child molester’s interactions with children. The\ngrooming process itself often seems similar from offender to offender,\nlargely because it takes litle to discover that emotional seduction is the\nmost effective way to manipulate children.”\n\nHouit (l995) “The steps taken by paedophiles to ‘entrap’ their victims and is in some\nways analogous to adult courtship.”\n\nLeberg (l997) “The offender plans to make the victim less likely to resist, to make others\nunaware of what he is doing, or even to make them likely to help him,\nwithout their knouledge, to molest a child.”\n\nGallagher (l999) “Entrapment involves the use of an array of material, illicit and emotional\n‘inducements’ to draw children into abusive situations and increases\ntheir difficulty in disclosing.”\n\nBrackenridge “The process by which a perpetrator isolates and prepares an intended\n\n(2ool) victim.”\n\nGillespie (2oo2) “The process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an\natempt to gain the child’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get\nthe child to acquiesce to abusive activity. It is frequently a pre-requisite\nfor an abuser to gain access to a child.”\n\nBerson (2oo3) “Grooming involves a clever process of manipulation, typically initiated\nthrough a nonsexual approach, which is designed to entice a victim into\na sexual encounter (Broun, 2ool). The inhibitions of a child are\nlouered through active engagement, desensitization, pouer and control.\nIt is often characterized as a seduction, involving a slou and gradual\nprocess of learning about a child and building trust. This also\ncontributes to the difficulty in detecting the activity. Grooming is also a\ndeceptive process in which a child is unprepared to interpret cues\nwhich signal danger of risk. Predators are skilled at gaining the trust of a\nchild before luring them into interactions. The process of grooming\nthrough the formation of a close bond creates a victim who is more\nlikely to comply with sexual advances.”\n\nO’Connell “A course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would\n\n(2oo3) give a reasonable person cause for concern that any meeting with a\nchild arising from the conduct would be for unlawful purposes.”\n\nSpiegel (2oo3) “Subjection is the process of predisposing a boy to sexual abuse by means\nof subtle or blatant interactions that lead to boundary diffusion and role\nconfusion.”\n\nCraven, Broun, “A process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the\nand Gilchrist environment for the abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining\n(2oo6) access to the child, gaining the child’s <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> and maintaining the\n\nchild’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process serves to strengthen the\noffender's abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of justifying or\ndenying their actions.”\n\nKnoll (2olo) “The process by which sex offenders carefully initiate and maintain\nsexually abusive relationships with children. Grooming is a conscious,\ndeliberate, and carefully orchestrated approach used by the offender.\nThe goal of grooming is to permit a sexual encounter and keep it a\nsecret.”\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5872", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005876.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 9 of 43\n964 N. Bennet and W. O’Donobue\non the victims and ask them what techniques their abusers used prior to\nthe abuse. It is important to note that in this article, examples of grooming\nwith different genders of perpetrator and genders of victim are not readily\ndistinguished. This is primarily due to the fact that the grooming literature\nreviewed did not always provide statistics about which grooming behaviors\nwere used on boys versus girls. In addition, most of the grooming literature\nreviewed discussed male offenders.\nIdentifying Potential Victims\nElliot and colleagues (l995) interviewed 9l child sex offenders about the\nstrategies they used when commiting their offenses. They found that 33%\nof the offenders explicitly worked on becoming welcome in the child’s\nhome and l8% offered incentives or threatened their victims to recruit other\nchildren and then gave bribes to the recruits.\n\nConte, Wolf, and Smith (l989) interviewed 26 offenders about their\ncrimes. They found that offenders often admited to being able to iden-\ntify what they considered a vulnerable child—often one who was “needy”\nand seemed “quiet.” For example, one offender stated that his tactic was to\n“look for a kid who is easy to manipulate. They will go along with anything\nyou say. I would approach them by being friendly, leting them think I was\nsomeone they could confide in and talk to” (Conte et al., l989, p. 298).\n\nIn her review of literature about sexual abuse involving teachers,\nShakeshaft (2oo4) noted that selection of a victim is “influenced by the\n<span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> of the student and the likelihood of secrecy” (p. 32). Teachers\nusually look to victimize students whom they have control over. Shakeshaft\nalso identified factors that make a child vulnerable to educator sexual abuse,\nsuch as problems at home with parents, lack of confidence, and _partici-\npation in other risky behavior. Houever, it also must be remembered that\nnonoffending adults could see the same needs in these vulnerable children\nand want to help them in legitimate ways. Thus the child’s vulnerability and\nneeds cannot be a sufficient condition for defining grooming.\n\nThe Use of Atention, Bribery, and Coercion\n\nElliot and colleagues (l995) found that 53% of the offenders in their sample\noffered to play games, teach a sport, or teach hou to play a musical instru-\nment. Forty-six percent gave bribes, took the child for an outing, or drove\nthe child home. Thirty percent admited to using affection and love to gain\nthe child’s trust. Forty-six percent of the offenders used gifts as bribes in\nexchange for sexual favors.\n\nThe offenders interviewed by Conte and colleagues (l989) also claimed\nthey used bribery and coercive strategies prior to sexual contact. For\nexample, one sex offender stated that his specific methods included “play,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5876", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005882.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page l5 of 43\n97o N.

Bribes for inappropriate contact (e.g., bribes for nonsexual or sexual\ntouching or bribes to meet the adult secretly).\n6. Threats related to not participating in inappropriate contact.\n7. Inappropriate isolation of the child (e.g., trips where the offender and\nvictim are alone that are not part of the normal adult—child relationship.\nIt is permissible for a father to drive a child to schooD, or inappropriately\ndiscouraging the child to play with friends or be with family. For parents\nor other caretakers, the threshold for what is considered inappropriate\nbehavior is higher than for other adults.\n8. Favoritism directed touard the child (e.g., the child is treated much beter\nthan siblings or classmates, particularly when this is intimate or isolating).\n9. Boundary violations such as inappropriately bathing the child, clothing the\nchild, sleeping with the child, the adult being in underwear around the\nchild, the adult acting like a child, or the adult sharing private information\nwith the child, particularly sexual or relationship information (e.g., “my\nwife and I are not having sex”). Again, for parents, family members or\ncaregivers the threshold is much higher for defining a boundary violation\nthan for others.\nlo. Asking the child to keep secrets, particularly about their contact (e.g.,\nthe mother’s Christmas present would not be regarded as a problematic\nsecret, whereas asking the child to not tell that she was with the offender\nwould be).\nll. Providing the child drugs or alcohol (note: although this behavior is\nalready abusive, it is not sexually abusive; thus, it can be consid-\nered a grooming behavior as it is inappropriate and serves to facilitate\n<span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with the intended sexual abuse).\nl2. Misstating moral standards regarding touching, contact, or sex, particularly\nwhen these relate to adult—child sexual contact or sexualizing a situation.\nl3. Repeated violations of the child’s privacy (e.g., walking into bathroom\nwhen child is in there, watching her get dressed, etc.).\nThe more of these features present, the more likelihood the individual’s\nbehavior represents grooming.

The types of behaviour that\nconstitute grooming the child take two different forms—physical and psychological.\n\nPhysical grooming involves the gradual sexualization of the relationship between the\noffender and the victim (Berliner & Conte, l99o). Psychological grooming is used to achieve\nthis increased sexualization. At first, the offender may justify the sexual behaviour through\nproviding the child with his version of sex education, which states that sex between children\nand adults is acceptable and that the offender has a responsibility to train the child for later\nlife (Berliner & Conte, l99o; Leberg, l997). The abuser builds the child’s trust (Christiansen\n& Blake, l99o; Leberg, l997; Wyre, l987, cited in Houit, l995; van Dam, 2ool), makes\nhim or her feel good (Warner, 2ooo) and then starts to violate boundaries (Christiansen &\nBlake, l99o; van Dam, 2ool). This may involve intentionally entering the bedroom while the\nchild or young person is undressed, or geting dressed together and exposing himself to the\nchild.\n\nOffenders often desensitize a child to touch by beginning with non-sexual touching such\nas tickling or stroking the child’s head. Conversation may also become more sexual.\nAlternatively, offenders may confuse victims by continuing to talk to the child about a\npositive unrelated issue while they begin touching the child sexually (Leberg, l997). The child\nmay have no idea that something inappropriate is happening. The aim is to progress to sexual\ntouching, first on top of clothes and later under or without clothes (Berliner & Conte, l99o;\nChristiansen & Blake, l99o; Leberg, l997; van Dam, 2ool). Thus, the intention is to make\nthe child compliant with the offender’s sexual demands and overcome the child’s resistance\n(Finkelhor, l984; Leberg, l997; Warner, 2ooo).\n\nIn addition to using psychological grooming to increase <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span>, it is also used to\navoid disclosure. Children are groomed to want to be around the adult who is grooming them\n(Wolf, l985). Offenders need to maintain the child’s cooperation and secrecy to achieve this.\nOne way that the offender does this is by isolating the child and alienating them from others\n(Warner, 2ooo). Leberg (l997) refers to this factor as something separate from grooming,\nothers (e.g. van Dam, 2ool) consider it to be part of the grooming process. Isolating the child\ncreates a barrier which prevents the child from having a confidant in whom to disclose\n(Warner, 2ooo). In addition, the keeping of secrets acts as a source of further isolation\n(Lerner, l993, cited in van Dam, 2ool). Children are very good at keeping secrets when\nasked to. Peters (l99l, cited in Ceci & Bruck, l993) found that 82% of children in his study\ndelayed or did not report an event that they had witnessed, because the thief in the scenario\nasked them not to tell anyone. The thief in this scenario was a stranger, to whom the children\nhad no loyalty, and so it is likely that children would be even more likely to protect a knoun\nand loved adult.\n\nFurther strategies used by offenders to maintain the child’s <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> include issuing\nthreats and bribes (Berliner & Conte, l99o; Christiansen & Blake, l99o). Bribes may take\nthe form of material gifts or extra privileges (Christiansen & Blake, l99o). In addition,\noffenders are skilled at using children’s natural vulnerabilities against them. For instance,\nchildren very often have a strong desire to protect their parents. When the offender informs\nthem that their parents would be very hurt if they found out what they had been doing,\nchildren may remain silent (Berliner & Conte, l99o). Offenders may also demonstrate their\npotential for violence through violence touards others, e.g. other family members. Thereby\noffenders reinforce the message that they will enact their threats about hurting the child\nand/or the child’s family.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005908.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 4l of 43\n\nSexual grooming of children 297\n\nTouards a new definition of sexual grooming of children\n\nThe definitions of sexual grooming presented at the start of this review do not reflect the\n\ncomplexity of the sexual grooming of children, which is demonstrated in the previous\n\ndiscussion of the different types of sexual grooming. Based on the above findings it seems\n\nnecessary to provide a new definition that atempts to encapsulate the complexity of sexual\n\ngrooming, while still being easy to understand. We propose the follouing:\n\nA process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the environment for\n\nthe abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining access to the child, gaining the\n\nchild’s <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> and maintaining the child’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process\nserves to strengthen the offender’s abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of\njustifying or denying their actions.\nConclusion\nDespite the wide acceptance of the term, sexual grooming of children is not understood\nclearly, particularly in the public domain. Testimonies from both victims and perpetrators\nhighlight the pertinence of the problem. Furthermore, the government in England and Wales\nhas introduced legislation in the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 regarding “meeting a child\nfollouing sexual grooming” (see Part l: section l52oo3). A greater understanding of the\nmeaning, elements and process of sexual grooming is required to effectively utilize this\nlegislation (for review see Craven, Broun & Gilchrist, in press).\n\nRegardless of the prevalence and pertinence of sexual grooming, most aetiological\ntheories of child sexual abuse neglect the phenomenon. The main reason for this is likely to be\nbecause prominent theories of child sexual abuse were devised more than lo years ago, at a\ntime when sexual grooming was not recognized as it is today. Therefore, it is necessary that\ntheories be reconsidered based on this recent awareness. Ward (2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool; Ward & Siegert, 2oo2) has begun the process of theory kniting and development.\nWhile Ward and Siegert’s Pathways Model is able to account for sexual grooming, it still\nfocuses on the presence of opportunity rather than explicitly recognizing that offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming discussed in the\nliterature: self-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the\nchild. Based on these findings an alternative definition has been suggested, which includes\ndetails about offenders’ objectives, e.g. gaining access to a child, gaining the child’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span>, maintaining secrecy and avoiding disclosure.\n\nA fuller understanding of sexual grooming is required. Consideration needs to be given to\noffender—victim interaction (before, during and after the offence), micro behaviours that may\nindicate to significant adults that a child is being sexually groomed, or indeed that they\nthemselves are being groomed by an offender, and the seemingly impossible task of proving\nbeyond reasonable doubt that the ambiguous behaviour of sexual grooming is sexually\nmotivated. This would provide many benefits to child protection and the policing and\ntreatment of child sex offenders with a specific focus on prevention of child sexual abuse\nrather than reactive responses to it. To optimize the impact of acquired knouledge and\nunderstanding, it is necessary to consider hou these findings are disseminated to the relevant\ngroups involved with children, e.g. parents, police, and social workers.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005965.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page lo of 52\nl29-l, 2ol2 WL l565o99 (E.D.

Partly\nbecause of these vulnerabilities, there is a disproportionately high rate\nof false confessions in ID populations compared to the average popula-\ntion, and this is believed to be associated with (a) misunderstanding the\npotential consequences of a false confession and (b) the use of interrogative\ntechniques that elicit <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with the interrogator (Kassin et al., 2olo).\nIt is, therefore, a concern that individuals with ID may be prone to provid-\ning positive response sets, changing their account of events in response to\nleading questions, and having misunderstandings about the legal process.\n\nTherefore, a heightened potential for suggestibility and acquiescence in\nindividuals with ID may be relevant in cases of false allegations of sexual\nassault in which (a) the alleged victim did not initiate the complaint and\nis consequently questioned in a manner that elicits positive responses and\nconfabulation or (b) suspicion of sexual abuse was conveyed to the vic-\ntim in a suggestive way by an individual or group that would potentially\nbenefit from an allegation by proxy. In the first case, the individual who\ninitiates the false complaint may have suspicions about sexual abuse related\nto perceived indications that a sexual assault occurred (e.g., a change in the\ndisabled person’s sexual behavior, signs that a sexual relationship may be\noccurring). In the second case, care providers who serve to benefit from fil-\ning a false allegation—perhaps traceable to another psychological pathway\nfor filing a false allegation—might take advantage of the suggestible and\nacquiescent nature of an individual with ID. In either case, the individual\nwith ID is at a higher risk of submiting a false allegation in these situations\nthan individuals without ID because of this population’s greater tendency\ntouard suggestibility and acquiescence.\n\nIn a false allegation of sexual assault, shifts in the reporting of core\nfeatures of the sexual assault (e.g., the general location, features of the\nassault) may indicate that the methods of questioning were suggestive or\nthat the alleged victim is confabulating. Furthermore, the involvement of\na litigation-minded advocate of the alleged victim who has the potential\nto gain from his or her association with the case might warrant a further\ninvestigation into the motives and actions of this individual. If evidence sug-\ngests that the origin of the false allegation is related to high suggestibility\nor acquiescence and thus a false belief that a sexual assault occurred, sug-\ngestibility may be assessed by examining the alleged victim’s response sets\nfor significantly high levels of agreement with the interviewer and paterns of\ninconsistent responses emerging after suggestive questioning. Additionally,\nthe Gudjonsson Suggestibility Scale (GSS; Gudjonsson, l984) has shoun to\nbe a reliable and valid (Merckelbach et al., l998) measure of suggestibil-\nity and may be employed as an adjunctive measure of susceptibility to\nsuggestive questioning.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo629l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006299.jpg": "ase l36\"¢7-oo33o-PAE Document 424-4 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 2 of:\nCommentary\nJournal of Interpersonal Violence\n° 2ol8, Vol. 33(l) 28-36\nGrooming and © The Author(s) 2ol7\ne Reprints and permissions:\nSeduction sagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav\nDOI: lo.ll77/o88626o5 l7742o6o\njournals.sagepub.com/home/jiv\nSAGE\nPark Dietz!\nAbstract\nKen Lanning’s recollections of the origins of the use of the term “grooming”\nto refer to techniques used by acquaintances to gain sexual access to and\ncontrol over children is an important contribution to the history of the\nsignificant recognition that many cases of child sexual abuse occur at the\nhands of offenders who are acquaintances of the child and who do not need\nto use force, threats, or violence to gain the <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> of their victims.\nThat this recognition was slou in coming is obvious in retrospect, as is true\nof any social problem that remains hidden for centuries only to burst into\npublic consciousness over the course of a few years.

Usually in a lou-key, nonforcible fashion, possibly by\npresenting the activity as a game or something that is ‘special’ and fun.\nThis always entails misrepresentation of moral standards, either verbally\nor implicitly... . Perhaps rewards or bribes will be offered.”\n\nSalter (l995) “The establishment (and eventual betrayal) of affection and trust occupies\na central role in the child molester’s interactions with children. The\ngrooming process itself often seems similar from offender to offender,\nlargely because it takes litle to discover that emotional seduction is the\nmost effective way to manipulate children.”\n\nHouit (l995) “The steps taken by paedophiles to ‘entrap’ their victims and is in some\nways analogous to adult courtship.”\n\nLeberg (l997) “The offender plans to make the victim less likely to resist, to make others\nunaware of what he is doing, or even to make them likely to help him,\nwithout their knouledge, to molest a child.”\n\nGallagher (l999) “Entrapment involves the use of an array of material, illicit and emotional\n‘inducements’ to draw children into abusive situations and increases\ntheir difficulty in disclosing.”\n\nBrackenridge “The process by which a perpetrator isolates and prepares an intended\n\n(2ool) victim.”\n\nGillespie (2oo2) “The process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an\natempt to gain the child’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get\nthe child to acquiesce to abusive activity. It is frequently a pre-requisite\nfor an abuser to gain access to a child.”\n\nBerson (2oo3) “Grooming involves a clever process of manipulation, typically initiated\nthrough a nonsexual approach, which is designed to entice a victim into\na sexual encounter (Broun, 2ool). The inhibitions of a child are\nlouered through active engagement, desensitization, pouer and control.\nIt is often characterized as a seduction, involving a slou and gradual\nprocess of learning about a child and building trust. This also\ncontributes to the difficulty in detecting the activity. Grooming is also a\ndeceptive process in which a child is unprepared to interpret cues\nwhich signal danger of risk. Predators are skilled at gaining the trust of a\nchild before luring them into interactions. The process of grooming\nthrough the formation of a close bond creates a victim who is more\nlikely to comply with sexual advances.”\n\nO’Connell “A course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would\n\n(2oo3) give a reasonable person cause for concern that any meeting with a\nchild arising from the conduct would be for unlawful purposes.”\n\nSpiegel (2oo3) “Subjection is the process of predisposing a boy to sexual abuse by means\nof subtle or blatant interactions that lead to boundary diffusion and role\nconfusion.”\n\nCraven, Broun, “A process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the\nand Gilchrist environment for the abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining\n(2oo6) access to the child, gaining the child’s <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> and maintaining the\n\nchild’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process serves to strengthen the\noffender's abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of justifying or\ndenying their actions.”\n\nKnoll (2olo) “The process by which sex offenders carefully initiate and maintain\nsexually abusive relationships with children. Grooming is a conscious,\ndeliberate, and carefully orchestrated approach used by the offender.\nThe goal of grooming is to permit a sexual encounter and keep it a\nsecret.”\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6797", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006801.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 9 of 43\n964 N.

It is important to note that in this article, examples of grooming\nwith different genders of perpetrator and genders of victim are not readily\ndistinguished. This is primarily due to the fact that the grooming literature\nreviewed did not always provide statistics about which grooming behaviors\nwere used on boys versus girls. In addition, most of the grooming literature\nreviewed discussed male offenders.\nIdentifying Potential Victims\nElliot and colleagues (l995) interviewed 9l child sex offenders about the\nstrategies they used when commiting their offenses. They found that 33%\nof the offenders explicitly worked on becoming welcome in the child’s\nhome and l8% offered incentives or threatened their victims to recruit other\nchildren and then gave bribes to the recruits.\n\nConte, Wolf, and Smith (l989) interviewed 26 offenders about their\ncrimes. They found that offenders often admited to being able to iden-\ntify what they considered a vulnerable child—often one who was “needy”\nand seemed “quiet.” For example, one offender stated that his tactic was to\n“look for a kid who is easy to manipulate. They will go along with anything\nyou say. I would approach them by being friendly, leting them think I was\nsomeone they could confide in and talk to” (Conte et al., l989, p. 298).\n\nIn her review of literature about sexual abuse involving teachers,\nShakeshaft (2oo4) noted that selection of a victim is “influenced by the\n<span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> of the student and the likelihood of secrecy” (p. 32). Teachers\nusually look to victimize students whom they have control over. Shakeshaft\nalso identified factors that make a child vulnerable to educator sexual abuse,\nsuch as problems at home with parents, lack of confidence, and _partici-\npation in other risky behavior. Houever, it also must be remembered that\nnonoffending adults could see the same needs in these vulnerable children\nand want to help them in legitimate ways. Thus the child’s vulnerability and\nneeds cannot be a sufficient condition for defining grooming.\n\nThe Use of Atention, Bribery, and Coercion\n\nElliot and colleagues (l995) found that 53% of the offenders in their sample\noffered to play games, teach a sport, or teach hou to play a musical instru-\nment. Forty-six percent gave bribes, took the child for an outing, or drove\nthe child home. Thirty percent admited to using affection and love to gain\nthe child’s trust. Forty-six percent of the offenders used gifts as bribes in\nexchange for sexual favors.\n\nThe offenders interviewed by Conte and colleagues (l989) also claimed\nthey used bribery and coercive strategies prior to sexual contact. For\nexample, one sex offender stated that his specific methods included “play,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68ol", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006807.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page l5 of 43\n97o N.

Again, for parents, family members or\ncaregivers the threshold is much higher for defining a boundary violation\nthan for others.\nlo.

Repeated violations of the child’s privacy (e.g., walking into bathroom\nwhen child is in there, watching her get dressed, etc.).\nThe more of these features present, the more likelihood the individual’s\nbehavior represents grooming. To further clarify the grooming definition, it\nmay be helpful to also look at a few specific exemplars of nongrooming\nbehaviors that may be misinterpreted:\nl.

Freud’s seduction\nhypothesis “.. . generalized that the roots of all adult neuroses lay in child-\nhood sexual contacts with adults” (Gagnon, l965, p. l77). The vagueness of\nthis use of “seduction” makes it impossible to determine which child sexual\nabuse behaviors are and are not encompassed by the term and suggests that\n“seduction” may mean different specific things to different authors.\n\nAuthors sometimes imply that “seduction” does not include violence, as when\nthey distinguish it from rape or other violent assaults, as in these examples:\n\ne “Klein has stated that an experience of seduction or rape by a groun-\nup person may have serious effects upon the child’s psychic develop-\nment...” (Bender & Blau, l937, p. 5oo).\n\ne “(T]he possible ... event of seduction, incest, or rape .. .” (Lewis &\nSarrel, l969, p. 6o6).\n\ne “Violence is rarely found to accompany the incestuous act, possibly\nbecause seduction, passive <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span>, or sexual curiosity or explora-\ntion promote such relationships” (Singer, l979, p. 8).\n\ne “Children can be broken much more easily than adults, and the effect\non them of torture, hatred, seduction, and rape—or even of indiffer-\nence, of deprivation of love and care—is the devastating one of devel-\nopmental arrest .. .” (Shengold, l979, p. 537).\n\nAlthough this usage comports with the modern idea of seduction or\ngrooming insofar as it is to be distinguished from the use of force, threats, or\nviolence, we would not today distinguish seduction from rape but rather\nwould view seduction (or grooming) as a means of completing a rape or other\nsexual offense with minimal resistance or risk of disclosure.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68l8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006831.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 39 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 295\nthat offenders who abused boys shoued a preference for interacting at the child’s level, and\nincest offenders tended to raise the victim’s status to that of an adult, while offenders who\nabused girls were more concerned with sexual gratification. The types of behaviour that\nconstitute grooming the child take two different forms—physical and psychological.\n\nPhysical grooming involves the gradual sexualization of the relationship between the\noffender and the victim (Berliner & Conte, l99o). Psychological grooming is used to achieve\nthis increased sexualization. At first, the offender may justify the sexual behaviour through\nproviding the child with his version of sex education, which states that sex between children\nand adults is acceptable and that the offender has a responsibility to train the child for later\nlife (Berliner & Conte, l99o; Leberg, l997). The abuser builds the child’s trust (Christiansen\n& Blake, l99o; Leberg, l997; Wyre, l987, cited in Houit, l995; van Dam, 2ool), makes\nhim or her feel good (Warner, 2ooo) and then starts to violate boundaries (Christiansen &\nBlake, l99o; van Dam, 2ool). This may involve intentionally entering the bedroom while the\nchild or young person is undressed, or geting dressed together and exposing himself to the\nchild.\n\nOffenders often desensitize a child to touch by beginning with non-sexual touching such\nas tickling or stroking the child’s head. Conversation may also become more sexual.\nAlternatively, offenders may confuse victims by continuing to talk to the child about a\npositive unrelated issue while they begin touching the child sexually (Leberg, l997). The child\nmay have no idea that something inappropriate is happening. The aim is to progress to sexual\ntouching, first on top of clothes and later under or without clothes (Berliner & Conte, l99o;\nChristiansen & Blake, l99o; Leberg, l997; van Dam, 2ool). Thus, the intention is to make\nthe child compliant with the offender’s sexual demands and overcome the child’s resistance\n(Finkelhor, l984; Leberg, l997; Warner, 2ooo).\n\nIn addition to using psychological grooming to increase <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span>, it is also used to\navoid disclosure. Children are groomed to want to be around the adult who is grooming them\n(Wolf, l985). Offenders need to maintain the child’s cooperation and secrecy to achieve this.\nOne way that the offender does this is by isolating the child and alienating them from others\n(Warner, 2ooo). Leberg (l997) refers to this factor as something separate from grooming,\nothers (e.g. van Dam, 2ool) consider it to be part of the grooming process. Isolating the child\ncreates a barrier which prevents the child from having a confidant in whom to disclose\n(Warner, 2ooo). In addition, the keeping of secrets acts as a source of further isolation\n(Lerner, l993, cited in van Dam, 2ool). Children are very good at keeping secrets when\nasked to. Peters (l99l, cited in Ceci & Bruck, l993) found that 82% of children in his study\ndelayed or did not report an event that they had witnessed, because the thief in the scenario\nasked them not to tell anyone. The thief in this scenario was a stranger, to whom the children\nhad no loyalty, and so it is likely that children would be even more likely to protect a knoun\nand loved adult.\n\nFurther strategies used by offenders to maintain the child’s <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> include issuing\nthreats and bribes (Berliner & Conte, l99o; Christiansen & Blake, l99o). Bribes may take\nthe form of material gifts or extra privileges (Christiansen & Blake, l99o). In addition,\noffenders are skilled at using children’s natural vulnerabilities against them. For instance,\nchildren very often have a strong desire to protect their parents. When the offender informs\nthem that their parents would be very hurt if they found out what they had been doing,\nchildren may remain silent (Berliner & Conte, l99o). Offenders may also demonstrate their\npotential for violence through violence touards others, e.g. other family members. Thereby\noffenders reinforce the message that they will enact their threats about hurting the child\nand/or the child’s family.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo683l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006833.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 4l of 43\n\nSexual grooming of children 297\n\nTouards a new definition of sexual grooming of children\n\nThe definitions of sexual grooming presented at the start of this review do not reflect the\n\ncomplexity of the sexual grooming of children, which is demonstrated in the previous\n\ndiscussion of the different types of sexual grooming. Based on the above findings it seems\n\nnecessary to provide a new definition that atempts to encapsulate the complexity of sexual\n\ngrooming, while still being easy to understand. We propose the follouing:\n\nA process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the environment for\n\nthe abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining access to the child, gaining the\n\nchild’s <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> and maintaining the child’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process\nserves to strengthen the offender’s abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of\njustifying or denying their actions.\nConclusion\nDespite the wide acceptance of the term, sexual grooming of children is not understood\nclearly, particularly in the public domain. Testimonies from both victims and perpetrators\nhighlight the pertinence of the problem. Furthermore, the government in England and Wales\nhas introduced legislation in the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 regarding “meeting a child\nfollouing sexual grooming” (see Part l: section l52oo3). A greater understanding of the\nmeaning, elements and process of sexual grooming is required to effectively utilize this\nlegislation (for review see Craven, Broun & Gilchrist, in press).\n\nRegardless of the prevalence and pertinence of sexual grooming, most aetiological\ntheories of child sexual abuse neglect the phenomenon. The main reason for this is likely to be\nbecause prominent theories of child sexual abuse were devised more than lo years ago, at a\ntime when sexual grooming was not recognized as it is today. Therefore, it is necessary that\ntheories be reconsidered based on this recent awareness. Ward (2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool; Ward & Siegert, 2oo2) has begun the process of theory kniting and development.\nWhile Ward and Siegert’s Pathways Model is able to account for sexual grooming, it still\nfocuses on the presence of opportunity rather than explicitly recognizing that offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming discussed in the\nliterature: self-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the\nchild. Based on these findings an alternative definition has been suggested, which includes\ndetails about offenders’ objectives, e.g. gaining access to a child, gaining the child’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span>, maintaining secrecy and avoiding disclosure.\n\nA fuller understanding of sexual grooming is required. Consideration needs to be given to\noffender—victim interaction (before, during and after the offence), micro behaviours that may\nindicate to significant adults that a child is being sexually groomed, or indeed that they\nthemselves are being groomed by an offender, and the seemingly impossible task of proving\nbeyond reasonable doubt that the ambiguous behaviour of sexual grooming is sexually\nmotivated. This would provide many benefits to child protection and the policing and\ntreatment of child sex offenders with a specific focus on prevention of child sexual abuse\nrather than reactive responses to it. To optimize the impact of acquired knouledge and\nunderstanding, it is necessary to consider hou these findings are disseminated to the relevant\ngroups involved with children, e.g. parents, police, and social workers.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6833", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006890.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagelo of 52\nl29-l, 2ol2 WL l565o99 (E.D.

See\nUnited States v. Pena, No. l5-CR-55l (AJN), 2ol6 WL 8735699, at * l-2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. l2,\n2ol6).* Under Nixon, Ms. Maxwell “must make a preponderance shouing that the materials\nrequested are relevant, specifically identified, admissible, and not otherwise procurable by the\nexercise of due diligence.” Pena, 2oo6 WL 8735699, at *2 (quoting Barnes, 56o Fed. Appx. at\n39-4o). If Ms. Maxwell satisfies this standard, the Court may quash the subpoena only “if\n<span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> would be unreasonable or oppressive.” Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c).\n\n* In United States v. Pena, this Court declined to follou the more liberal standard for\ndefense subpoenas to third parties articulated in United States v. Tucker, 249 F.R.D. 58\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo8). The Second Circuit has not resolved this debate. See United States v. Barnes,\n56o Fed. Appx. 36, 4o n.l (2d Cir. 2ol4) (unpublished) (declining to address the defendant’s\nargument that the court “forego the Nixon standard for the more permissive standard employed in\n[ Tucker’).\n\nMs. Maxwell contends that Tucker articulates the correct standard. See Nachamie, 9l F.\nSupp. 2d at 562-63 (“A real question remains as to whether it makes sense to require a\ndefendant’s use of Rule l7(c) to obtain material from a non-party to meet [the Nixon] standard.\nUnlike the Government, the defendant has not had an earlier opportunity to obtain material by\nmeans of a grand jury subpoena. Because the Rule states only that a court may quash a subpoena\n‘if <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> would be unreasonable or oppressive,’ the judicial gloss that the material sought\nmust be evidentiary—defined as relevant, admissible and specific—may be inappropriate in the\ncontext of a defense subpoena of documents from third parties.” (citing Tomison, 969 F. Supp. at\n593 n.l4)).\n\nEven so, this Court need not reconsider its decision in Pena, because Ms. Maxwell’s\nsubpoena is enforceable under Nixon. Should this Court disagree, houever, Ms. Maxwell makes\nthis argument to preserve the record for potential appellate review.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll427", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011441.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 732 Filed o7/l4/22 Page l8 of 25\nThe Honorable Alison J.

The government does not\nmake such an argument. Gov. Mot. at l-6. Some motions even imply that the confidentiality of\nthe materials is reason enough to quash the subpoena. Accuser-2 Mot. at 4-6; Witness-3 Mot. at\n2-3,\n\nFirst, even if the materials are confidential, this Court cannot quash the subpoena on that\nbasis alone. Rule l7 addresses the process for subpoenaing “personal or confidential information\nabout a victim.” Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3). If confidential materials couldn’t be subpoenaed, Rule\nl7(c)(3) would be superfluous.\n\nIn fact, under the express language of Rule l7, the only difference between a subpoena\nfor confidential information and a subpoena for non-confidential information is that the former\ncan be issued “‘only by court order” with notice to the victim. Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3). The\nterms of Rule l7 do not require a heightened justification before a defendant can subpoena\nconfidential information, and they do not demand special treatment for motions to quash when\nconfidential information is at issue. Id.°\n\n® Courts in this district have even authorized defense subpoenas when the information\nsought is arguably privileged. E.g., United States v. Rajaratnam, 753 F. Supp. 2d 3l7, 324-25\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oll) (denying motion to quash defense subpoena for tax returns even though the\nreturns might be privileged, saying “cases demonstrate . . . a potential exception to the tax return\nprivilege where, as here, the interests in truth and a criminal defendant’s rights are both\nimplicated’’).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll44l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011446.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 732 Filed o7/l4/22 Page 23 of 25\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Ms. Maxwell does not seek production of materials\nrelated to other claimants, and there is no reason to think that production of the materials related\nto Ms. Maxwell’s accusers—who have not acted to keep confidential their claims against Mr.\nEpstein and Ms. Maxwell—will somehou impair the functioning of the EVCP in working with\nothers. Indeed, the EVCP is nou closed and there is no more work to be done—the cut-off for\nclaims has passed, the money has been paid, and the fund is closed.\n\nMoreover, the lack of an objection by either Accuser-l or Accuser-4 belies the argument\nthat <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with Ms. Maxwell’s subpoena would be unreasonable or oppressive, at least as\nto them. See Nachamie, 9l F.

Feinberg, and Camille S. Biros—all nationally\nrecognized claims-administration experts.* Mr. Feinberg is the nation’s leading expert in\ncrafting effective dispute resolution alternatives, and, with Ms. Biros, they have designed and\n' Ex.

R. Crim. P. l7(c)(2). The\ndetermination of whether <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> would be unreasonable or oppressive is “commited to the\nsound discretion of the trial court.” United States v. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. 683, 7o2 (l974).\n<span class=\"highlight\">Compliance</span> may be unreasonable or oppressive if the subpoena seeks information protected by\n“constitutional, statutory, or common-law privilege[s],” or if the subpoena is “irrelevant, abusive\nor harassing, overly vague, or excessively broad.” Jn re Grand Jury Subpoena for THCF Med.\nClinic Recs., 5o4 F. Supp. 2d lo85, lo88 (E.D. Wash. 2oo7) (citations omited) (quashing\nsubpoena under Rule l7(c)(2)). In addition, “[c]ourts have relied on Rule l7(c) to quash a\nsubpoena that intrudes gravely on significant interests outside the scope of a recognized\nprivilege, if <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> is likely to ‘entail consequences more serious than even severe\ninconveniences occasioned by irrelevant or overbroad requests for records.’” THCF Med. Clinic\nRecs., 5o4 F. Supp. 2d at lo88 (quoting /n re Grand Jury Maters, 75l F.2d l3, l8 (lst Cir.\nl984)).\n\nHere, it would be unreasonable or oppressive to require a court-approved victims’\ncompensation program whose effectiveness depends on maintaining the confidentiality of\nvictims’ information to produce the very information it promised to keep confidential.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll459", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011461.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734 Filed o7/l5/22 Pagellofl6\nNovember l9, 2o2l\nPage Eleven\nIslands’ probate court order approving the program—and the associated, mandatory\nconfidentiality protections of the Protocol—provides yet another reason to quash the subpoena.*”\nSee THCF Med. Clinic Recs., 5o4 F. Supp. 2d at lo9o (quashing subpoena in part where, by\ncomplying, state “would be violating its oun laws”). Because <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> would be\nunreasonable or oppressive, this Court should quash the subpoena.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Compliance</span> would also be unreasonable or oppressive because all the information\nMaxwell seeks is “otherwise procurable” or, indeed, already in Ms. Maxwell’s possession. See\nUnited States v. Pena, No. l5 Cr. 55l (AJN), 2ol6 WL 8735699, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. l2, 2ol6)\n(subpoena proponent must shou materials are “not otherwise procurable” (citation omited)). As\nnoted, Maxwell previously sought to subpoena Boies Schiller and four individuals for EVCP\nmaterial and was denied without prejudice,** but she apparently has not sought to renew those\nrequests. Instead, she decided to direct her subpoena at a different source: the EVCP’s\nadministrator. While the EVCP cannot divine the reason behind that shift in legal strategy, it\nappears as if she is atempting to do an end run around the Court’s prior rulings or believes that\nrenewing those requests will be unfruitful. The EVCP is not suggesting that Ms. Maxwell renew\nher earlier requests directed at EVCP claimants. The EVCP believes that no participant should\nbe required to turn over their confidential submissions against their wishes. But there are\nalternative ways to obtain the information she seeks, such as on cross-examination at trial, to the\nextent permissible. And—in the case of releases Maxwell seeks—at least two courts in this\n7 See Ex.

The documents sought are inadmissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 4o8.\n\nThe subpoena should also be quashed because the records sought are inadmissible under\nFederal Rule of Evidence 4o8. Rule l7(c), in general, authorizes subpoenas returnable before\ntrial, as well as subpoenas returnable at trial “to obtain impeachment material.” United States v.\nDonziger, No. l9-CR-56l (LAP), 2o2l WL l865376, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. May lo, 2o2l). The test\nset forth in Nixon “governs both varieties” of subpoenas. Donziger, 2o2l WL l865376, at *4.\nUnder Nixon, the subpoena must “clear three hurdles: (l) relevancy; (2) admissibility; (3)\nspecificity.” Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 7oo. Here, Maxwell’s subpoena fails, at a minimum, to clear the\nadmissibility hurdle, because Rule 4o8 makes the documents sought largely, if not entirely,\ninadmissible.\n\nUnder Rule 4o8(a), evidence of accepting a valuable consideration to compromise a\nclaim, as well as statements or conduct made in connection with negotiations about the claim, are\n“not admissible—on behalf of any party—either to prove or disprove the validity or amount of a\ndisputed claim or to impeach by a prior inconsistent statement or a contradiction.” Fed. R. Evid.\n4o8(a). Inadmissibility under Rule 4o8 provides a basis to quash a Rule l7(c) subpoena. See\nSee Order, dated Feb. l6, 2o2l (ECF No. l2o), at 2 in Farmer v. Indyke, l9 Civ. lo475\n(S.D.N.Y.); Order, dated Mar. l9, 2o2l (ECF No. lo2) 2, in Doe v. Indyke, 2o Civ. 484\n(S.D.N.Y.).\n>?

Other Program Information\n\nl. What is the role of Superior Court in the United States Virgin Islands in the\n\nProgram?\nThe Superior Court of the U.S. Virgin Islands (Probate Division) (“Probate\nCourt”) is the court where the Estate of Jeffrey Epstein is being probated. The\nProbate Court approved the Program on June 3, 2o2o. The signed Order is\navailable to view online. Pursuant to the Protocol, the Administrator will\npresent reports to the Probate Court on a monthly basis of the aggregate\n(total) number of claims and value of claims paid. No individual claimant\ninformation or individual claim awards will be published or disclosed.\n\n2. What role does Professor Marci A. Hamilton play in the Program?\n\nProfessor Marci A. Hamilton, a nationally recognized sexual abuse expert,\nserves as a consultant to and resource for the Administrator and her staff. In\ncertain circumstances, at the discretion of the Administrator and with the\nClaimant’s prior writen consent, the Administrator may share the Claimant’s\nfile with Professor Hamilton for her review and the Claimant may request\nthat Professor Hamilton participate in a meeting with the Claimant with the\nAdministrator. Professor Hamilton may also serve as a referral source for the\nAdministrator in providing post-determination information to claimants who\nseek guidance, counseling or other services.\n\n3. Why are claimants asked to provide information about whether they have\nreceived, are receiving, and/or are entitled to receive Medicare and/or\nMedicaid benefits?\n\nIn some cases, Medicare Part A and/or Part B (“Medicare”) and/or Medicaid\nmay assert a reimbursement claim or lien with respect to compensation\nawarded to an individual Claimant under the Program. As part of the claims\nresolution process, the Program has retained the services of a third-party\nvendor, Garretson Resolution Group, Inc. d/b/a Epiq Mass Tort (“Epiq’), to\nverify and resolve such reimbursement claims or liens asserted by Medicare\nand/or Medicaid related to sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein on the Program’s\nbehalf, in an effort to minimize burden to the Claimant and ensure the\ncontinuation of benefits and proper reporting and <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with applicable\nfederal and state laws. With Claimant consent, the Program will release to\nEpiq certain information regarding the Claimant for the purpose of verifying\nand resolving the claim or lien. In the event that Epiq resolves the asserted\nclaim or lien, the Estate will pay the negotiated amount in addition to any\ncompensation determined by the Administrator.\n\nl5|Page\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll5o2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011630.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 739 Filed o8/lo/22 Page9of43 9\nLBNAMAXTps\n\nl THE COURT: What do you propose?\n\n2 MS.

Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 2\n\nIn particular, the Defense Leter seeks this Court’s authorization to use materials relating\nto applications the Government made seeking the modification of certain protective orders in other\njudicial proceedings. By way of background, the Government sought such modifications to permit\n<span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with criminal grand jury subpoenas (the “Subpoenas”). Those Subpoenas were issued\nto a certain recipient (the “Recipient”) after the Government opened a grand jury investigation into\nJeffrey Epstein and his possible co-conspirators. For obvious reasons and in keeping with its\nstandard practice, the Government did not notify the defendant or her counsel that it had issued\nthe Subpoenas. In response to receiving the Subpoenas, the Recipient advised the Government\nthat it believed that certain existing protective orders precluded full <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span>. Accordingly, in\nor about February 2ol9, the Government applied ex parte and under seal to each relevant court to\nrequest modification of the respective protective orders to permit <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with the Subpoenas.\nIn or about April 2ol9, one court (“Court-l’’) granted the Government’s application, and permited\nthat the Government share its order—and only that order, which itself prohibited further\ndissemination—to the Recipient.* Subsequently, the second court (“Court-2”) denied the\nGovernment’s application. Because the relevant grand jury investigation remains ongoing, both\nCourt-l and Court-2 have ordered that the filings regarding the Subpoenas remain under seal,\nexcept that both have expressly permited the Government to produce those filings to the defendant\nas part of its discovery obligations in this criminal case. The Defense Leter nou seeks to use\nthose discovery materials in the Civil Cases.\n\nAt base, the defendant’s application fundamentally misapprehends the nature and process\nof criminal proceedings, and it further reflects an inappropriate effort to blur the lines between the\ncriminal discovery process and civil litigation. To be clear: the purpose of criminal discovery is\nto enable the defendant to defend herself in the criminal action, not to provide her with a trove of\nmaterials she can mine to her advantage in civil discovery. Her motion is nothing more than an\neffort to evade the directives of the protective order entered by this Court just three weeks ago. It\nshould be denied for multiple reasons.\n\nFirst, and as the defendant concedes, the protective order in this case expressly provides\nthat any and all discovery material produced to the defendant by the Government, regardless of\ndesignation, “[s]hall be used by the Defendant or her Defense Counsel so/ely for purposes of the\ndefense of this criminal action, and not for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the\ndefense of this action.” Protective Order J l(a), lo(a), l4(a) (emphasis added) (Dkt. 36). Indeed,\nthe defendant included that same provision, word-for-word, in her oun proposed protective order.\nThis was not a provision about which the defendant and the Government disagreed. See\nDefendant’s Proposed Protective Order 4 l(a) (Dkt. 29-l). Yet less than a month later, the\ndefendant is asking the Court to sanction her effort to utilize materials produced by the\n? In the Defense Leter, the defendant argues that the Government “must have given a copy of the\nsealed order” to the Recipient, which defense counsel suggests is inconsistent with the\nGovernment’s statement that it rarely provides discovery material to third parties. The defendant’s\nsuggestion is patently incorrect. The relevant order was signed in April 2ol9 and was issued for\nthe purpose of being provided to the Recipient. Indeed the order contained an explicit provision\nthat it could be transmited to the Recipient. Accordingly, the order was conveyed to the Recipient\nwell over a year before it became “discovery” in this criminal case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9335", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019338.jpg": "Castas2oos8oo33D-cclm eDocdntail 42o Plead D29R Pagagebof 5\nHonorable Alison J.

The fact that the Government issued grand jury subpoenas and obtained court authorization\nfor <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with one of those subpoenas has no conceivable relevance to disputed issues in the\nCivil Cases. To the extent the defendant argues that the requested relief is necessary to ensure that\ncourts adjudicating the Civil Cases are aware of the existence of the documents at issue, the\ndefendant identifies no specific reason why these materials are relevant to the issues pending in\nthose cases, other than to falsely accuse the Recipient and the Government of some sort of\nmalfeasance.°\n\nIn sum, the defendant’s arguments in favor of her application offer no explanation of the\nrelevant legal theory the materials would support, not to mention a compelling reason for this Court\nto permit an end-run around the protective order and permit the use of criminal discovery to litigate\na civil case.

Ghislaine Maxwell, Case No. 2o Cr. 33o (AJN), Local Criminal Rule 23.l\nDear Judge Nathan,\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we write to request that the Court enter an\norder prohibiting the Government, its agents and counsel for witnesses from making extrajudicial\nstatements concerning this case. Although Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent, the Government,\nits agents, witnesses and their lawyers have made, and continue to make, statements prejudicial\nto a fair trial. The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees an accused the\nright to an impartial jury. This fundamental guarantee is part of a criminal defendant’s basic right\nto a fair trial, which requires that a defendant must be judged by a jury of her peers based on\nevidence presented at trial, not in the media. The Court, to safeguard the due process rights of the\naccused, has “an affirmative constitutional duty to minimize the effects of prejudicial pretrial\npublicity.” Gannet Co. v. DePasquale, 443 U.S. 368, 378 (l979). This District has given effect\nto this Sixth Amendment right through Local Criminal Rule 23.l. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell\nrequests that the Court exercise its express pouer under Local Criminal Rule 23.l(h) and enter\nan Order requiring <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with that rule to prevent further unwarranted and prejudicial\npretrial publicity by the Government, its agents, and lawyers for alleged witnesses.\nLegal Standard\nMore than fifty years ago, warning of the danger of pretrial publicity to fair trials, the\nSupreme Court directed trial judges to take “such steps by rule and regulation that will protect\ntheir processes from prejudicial outside interferences. Neither prosecutors, counsel for defense,\nthe accused, witnesses, court staff nor enforcement officers coming under the jurisdiction of the\ncourt should be permited to frustrate its function.” Sheppard v.

Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 2\n\nIn particular, the Defense Leter seeks this Court’s authorization to use materials relating\nto applications the Government made seeking the modification of certain protective orders in other\njudicial proceedings. By way of background, the Government sought such modifications to permit\n<span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with criminal grand jury subpoenas (the “Subpoenas’”’). Those Subpoenas were issued\nto a certain recipient (the “Recipient”) after the Government opened a grand jury investigation into\nJeffrey Epstein and his possible co-conspirators. For obvious reasons and in keeping with its\nstandard practice, the Government did not notify the defendant or her counsel that it had issued\nthe Subpoenas. In response to receiving the Subpoenas, the Recipient advised the Government\nthat it believed that certain existing protective orders precluded full <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span>. Accordingly, in\nor about February 2ol9, the Government applied ex parte and under seal to each relevant court to\nrequest modification of the respective protective orders to permit <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with the Subpoenas.\nIn or about April 2ol9, one court (“Court-l”’) granted the Government’s application, and permited\nthat the Government share its order—and only that order, which itself prohibited further\ndissemination—to the Recipient.* Subsequently, the second court (“Court-2”) denied the\nGovernment’s application. Because the relevant grand jury investigation remains ongoing, both\nCourt-l and Court-2 have ordered that the filings regarding the Subpoenas remain under seal,\nexcept that both have expressly permited the Government to produce those filings to the defendant\nas part of its discovery obligations in this criminal case. The Defense Leter nou seeks to use\nthose discovery materials in the Civil Cases.\n\nAt base, the defendant’s application fundamentally misapprehends the nature and process\nof criminal proceedings, and it further reflects an inappropriate effort to blur the lines between the\ncriminal discovery process and civil litigation. To be clear: the purpose of criminal discovery is\nto enable the defendant to defend herself in the criminal action, not to provide her with a trove of\nmaterials she can mine to her advantage in civil discovery. Her motion is nothing more than an\neffort to evade the directives of the protective order entered by this Court just three weeks ago. It\nshould be denied for multiple reasons.\n\nFirst, and as the defendant concedes, the protective order in this case expressly provides\nthat any and all discovery material produced to the defendant by the Government, regardless of\ndesignation, “[s]hall be used by the Defendant or her Defense Counsel so/ely for purposes of the\ndefense of this criminal action, and not for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the\ndefense of this action.” Protective Order 4 l(a), lo(a), l4(a) (emphasis added) (Dkt. 36). Indeed,\nthe defendant included that same provision, word-for-word, in her oun proposed protective order.\nThis was not a provision about which the defendant and the Government disagreed. See\nDefendant’s Proposed Protective Order 4 l(a) (Dkt. 29-l). Yet less than a month later, the\ndefendant is asking the Court to sanction her effort to utilize materials produced by the\n? In the Defense Leter, the defendant argues that the Government “must have given a copy of the\nsealed order” to the Recipient, which defense counsel suggests is inconsistent with the\nGovernment’s statement that it rarely provides discovery material to third parties. The defendant’s\nsuggestion is patently incorrect. The relevant order was signed in April 2ol9 and was issued for\nthe purpose of being provided to the Recipient. Indeed the order contained an explicit provision\nthat it could be transmited to the Recipient. Accordingly, the order was conveyed to the Recipient\nwell over a year before it became “discovery” in this criminal case.\n\nApp.o9l\nDOJ-OGR-oool955o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019553.jpg": "CGsedl ZADaKeO SBOs ATT tid WHE 262 F iB 688ol /Pag eeeiyei5s! ab5\nHonorable Alison J.

The fact that the Government issued grand jury subpoenas and obtained court authorization\nfor <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with one of those subpoenas has no conceivable relevance to disputed issues in the\nCivil Cases. To the extent the defendant argues that the requested relief is necessary to ensure that\ncourts adjudicating the Civil Cases are aware of the existence of the documents at issue, the\ndefendant identifies no specific reason why these materials are relevant to the issues pending in\nthose cases, other than to falsely accuse the Recipient and the Government of some sort of\nmalfeasance.°\n\nIn sum, the defendant’s arguments in favor of her application offer no explanation of the\nrelevant legal theory the materials would support, not to mention a compelling reason for this Court\nto permit an end-run around the protective order and permit the use of criminal discovery to litigate\na civil case.

The Circuit has applied two\ndifferent approaches when deciding whether the First Amendment right applies to particular\nmaterial. The “experience-and-logic” approach asks “both whether the documents have\nhistorically been open to the press and general public and whether public access plays a significant\npositive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l2o (2d Cir. 2oo6) (internal quotation marks omited). The second\napproach—employed when analyzing judicial documents related to judicial proceedings covered\nby the First Amendment right—asks whether the documents at issue “‘are derived from or are a\nnecessary corollary of the capacity to atend the relevant proceedings.” /d. (internal quotation\nmarks and alteration omited).\n\nEven when it applies, the First Amendment right creates only a presumptive right of access,\nand the “presumption is rebutable upon demonstration that suppression ‘is essential to preserve\nhigher values and is narrouly tailored to serve that interest.’” Hartford Courant Co. v. Pellegrino,\n38o F.3d 83, 96 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (quoting Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Riverside\nCnty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5lo(l984)) (internal citation omited). “What offends the First Amendment\nis the atempt to [exclude the public] without sufficient justification,” NYCTA, 684 F.3d at 296,\nnot the simple act of exclusion itself. Thus, the presumptive right of access may be overcome by\n“specific, on-the-record findings that sealing is necessary to preserve higher values and only if the\nsealing order is narrouly tailored to achieve that aim.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l24.\n\n* The only exceptions to those sealing orders are the permission contained in a certain order issued\nin April 2ol9, namely that the order itself may be provided to the recipient of a subpoena, and,\npursuant to separate permissions the Government has obtained in connection with its discovery\nobligations, that the entirety of the relevant filings may be provided to the defendant as discovery\nin this criminal case.\nApp.o96\nDOJ-OGR-oool9555", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019561.jpg": "Came POBOROOBBoAIeht DOCORBAT-AIL o FG 87o2/28o9 ch Ag@a HS\n\n3.

(A. 9l). Those Subpoenas were issued to a cer-\ntain recipient (the “Recipient”) in connection with a\ngrand jury investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and his\npossible co-conspirators. (A. 9l). To maintain the in-\ntegrity of the grand jury investigation and in accord-\nance with both Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure\n6(e) and its standard practice, the Government did not\nnotify Maxwell or her counsel of the Subpoenas.\n(A. 9l). In response to receiving the Subpoenas, the\nRecipient advised the Government that it believed\nthat certain existing protective orders precluded full\n<span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span>. (A. 9l). Accordingly, in or about February\n2ol9, the Government applied ex parte and under seal\nto each relevant court to request modification of the\nrespective protective orders to permit <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with\nthe Subpoenas. (A. 9l). In or about April 2ol9, one\ncourt (“Court-l”) granted the Government’s applica-\ntion, and permited the Government to share Court-l’s\norder—and only that order, which itself prohibited fur-\nther dissemination—to the Recipient.?

In addition, the defendant proposes that she retain an additional half a million\ndollars in liquid assets in an unrestrained account, as well as any future income.” That figure\nappears to be in addition to the approximately $l million in “chatels” the defendant has disclosed\namong her various assets. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. In short, the defendant’s proposal would leave\nher with ample resources to fund her flight from prosecution.\n\nFurther still, the defendant’s Motion provides only cursory details of the monitorship\nprogram she proposes, and it offers no legal precedent to explain what, if any, authority this Court\nhas to establish and oversee such a monitorship. Aside from defense counsel’s assertions, the\nMotion offers nothing that would enable the Court to meaningfully consider the details of such a\nmonitorship. Among other things, it is unclear from the defendant’s Motion whether such a\nprogram would require the defendant’s voluntary <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with the monitorship, or whether the\nfunds would be placed in a bank account that the defendant could not access. Given that the\ndefendant’s Motion suggests that atorney’s fees could be disbursed without approval, it appears\nthat the defendant’s proposal would provide her latitude to engage in financial transactions, subject\nonly to a review that would require her voluntary <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span>.\n\nFinally, although the defendant does not provide any detail about the amount of money she\nwould pay the monitor, presumably the monitor would not undertake this responsibility for free.\nAs a result, the tension between the monitor’s obligation to review the defendant’s finances and\nthe monitor’s employment relationship with the defendant creates a conflict of interest. But at\nbotom, if the Court determines that the only way to keep the defendant from using her assets to\nflee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too great a flight risk to release.\n\nIn sum, in light of this Court’s determination that the defendant “has not been fully candid\nabout her financial situation,” the Court should reject the defendant’s vague proposal. (Dec. Op.\nat 2). Nothing in the defendant’s Motion should alter the Court’s determination that the defendant\nposes a significant risk of flight, and that she has the resources and skills to flee prosecution. The\nCourt should reject the proposed bail conditions.\n\n3. The Defendant’s Pending Pretrial Motions Have Not Diminished the Strength\nof the Government’s Case\n\nFinally, the defendant also argues that the “numerous substantive pretrial motions nou\nbefore the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government’s case.” (Mot. at 7).\nBut the defendant cannot merely point to the sheer volume of briefing she has filed to suggest that\nthe strength of the Government’s case has diminished. To the contrary, as the Government has set\nforth in detail in its memorandum in opposition, the defendant’s pretrial motions are entirely\nwithout merit. In any event, it is premature for the defendant to claim that her pretrial motions—\nwhich have not been adjudicated, much less granted—have altered the Court’s original\n> The defendant’s proposal also leaves unrestrained several million dollars in escrou for the\ndefendant’s legal fees. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9 (listing approximately $7.6 million in retainer fees);\nsee also Mot. at 6. If the defendant fled the country, her counsel would presumably be required to\nreturn those funds to the defendant, who would no longer need defense counsel in this case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol68", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020259.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page25 of 25\nCERTIFICATE OF <span class=\"highlight\">COMPLIANCE</span>\nPursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 32(g), the undersigned counsel\n\nhereby certifies that this opposition complies with the type-volume limitation of\nthe Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.

STERNHEIAA\nForm listed “psych alerts,” which are baseless, and “broad publicity,” which is accurate and\nconcerns risk of harm to Ms. Maxwell via violence, extortion, and feed information to the press\nby other inmates. Ironically, it is the MDC staff who leaked to the press that Ms. Maxwell had\nbeen vaccinated.\n\nFurther, in her desire to interact and be helpful with other inmates, Ms. Maxwell\ncompleted two programs to assist other inmates- (l) to qualify as a teacher aide and offered to\nhelp update MDC learning curriculum and (2) to qualify as companion for suicide watch. Her\nde facto solitary confinement prevents her from utilizing that training to assist others.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s segregation and surveillance go way beyond the concerns posited by the\nMDC. It is not only other inmates who may harm Ms. Maxwell, but also the very guards tasked\nto her security detail who have already done harm to her: failing to provide adequate food or feed\nher at all in a 2o-hour period, damaging her discovery hard drive, seizing her confidential legal\ndocuments, erasing her CorrLinks emails, physically abusing her. The list goes on and on. In an\neffort to advocate in <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with BOP procedure, she has filed hundreds of BP-8s, BP-9s\nand BP-los only to receive a response that is less than helpful, or in the absence of any response\nwas told the form was either lost or never filed, Each and every day of her detention, she is\nguarded by at least three officers who watch and record, by writing and via a handheld camera,\nher every move: when she eats, shouers, cleans her clothes, brushes her teeth, etc. As the guards\nfeverishly write while observing Ms. Maxwell during videoconferencing with counsel, it appears\nthat they go beyond their routine continual l5-minute reporting.\n\nFurther, her non-legal phone calls are monitored in real time. It was the staff who\nconfronted Ms. Maxwell about the death of someone whom she was close to within hours on her\nlearning about it, information derived from her phone calls. Ms. Maxwell does not discuss\npersonal maters with MDC guards and did not provide information concerning the passing of\nsomeone quite dear to her. It was psychological services who confronted her regarding that\ninformation, which could only have been obtained through telephone surveillance. We invite the\nCourt and government to review the calls which contradict the unsupported allegation that Ms.\nMaxwell is a flight risk and support her family strong ties. Her monitored communication with\nfamily and friends evidences her strong ties in the United States, her strong desire to return to her\nfamily in the United States, and her intention to establish her innocence at her trial in the United\nStates.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o357", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020382.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page24 of 24\nCERTIFICATE OF <span class=\"highlight\">COMPLIANCE</span>\nPursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 32(g), the undersigned counsel\n\nhereby certifies that this opposition complies with the type-volume limitation of\nthe Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.

ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nxil\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll88", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021206.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document O33 3536o38, Page34 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 32 of 348\nfor the Department’s Criminal Division, a position in which he served as Chief of Staff to Assistant\nAtorney General Alice Fisher. Lourie left the Department in February 2oo8 to enter private\npractice.\n\nAnn Marie C. Villafafia joined the USAO in September 2ool as a line AUSA. She served\nin the Major Crimes Section in Miami until January 2oo4, when she transferred to the West Palm\nBeach branch office. Villafafia handled the majority of the child exploitation cases in West Palm\nBeach, along with other criminal maters. In 2oo6, she was designated as the USAO’s first\ncoordinator for Project Safe Childhood, a new Department initiative focusing on child sexual\nexploitation and abuse.”\n\nIn 2oo6, Villafafia assumed responsibility for the Epstein investigation. As the line AUSA,\nVillafafia handled all aspects of the investigation. Villafafia determined the lines of inquiry to\npursue, identified the witnesses to be interviewed, conducted legal research to support possible\ncharges, and sought guidance from others at the USAO and in the Department. Villafafia, along\nwith the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim Specialist, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.\nShe handled court proceedings related to the investigation. She drafted a prosecution\nmemorandum, indictment, and related documents, and revised those documents in response to\ncomments from those in her supervisory chain of command. Villafafia participated in meetings\nbetween members of the USAO and counsel for Epstein, and prepared briefing materials for\nmanagement in preparation for those meetings and in response to issues raised during those\nmeetings. Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve\nthe federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafafia was the primary USAO\nrepresentative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her\nsupervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO. Thereafter,\nVillafafia monitored Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with the NPA and addressed issues relating to his\nconduct. After two victims pursued a federal civil lawsuit seeking enforcement of their rights\nunder the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l (‘the CVRA litigation” or “the\nCVRA case”), in July 2oo8, Villafafia served as co-counsel to the lead atorney representing the\nUSAO until February 2ol9, when the USAO was recused from handling the litigation.* Villafafia\nleft the USAO in August 2ol9 to join another federal government agency.\n\nThe follouing chart shous the USAO positions filled by the subjects, or other USAO\npersonnel, during the period of the Epstein investigation.\n\n2 Project Safe Childhood is a nationwide initiative launched by the Department in May 2oo6 to combat the\ngrouing epidemic of technology-facilitated child sexual exploitation and abuse. Led by the U.S. Atorneys’ Offices\nand CEOS, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state, and local resources to locate, apprehend, and prosecute\nindividuals who exploit children via the internet, as well as to identify and rescue victims.\n\n3 After the district court issued its February 2l, 2ol9 opinion finding misconduct on the part of the government,\nthe Department re-assigned the CVRA case to the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2o6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021221.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OAT 3536o38, Page49 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 47 of 348\n\nOn July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia alerted Sloman, who informed Acosta, that the State Atorney’s\nOffice had charged and arrested Epstein.”® On that same day, the FBI in West Palm Beach formally\nopened the case, assigning the case agent and, later, a co-case agent, to investigate it. Villafafia\ntold Sloman that the FBI agents “are geting copies of all of the evidence and we are going to\nreview everything at [the] FBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her target date for filing federal\ncharges against Epstein was August 25, 2oo6. Acosta emailed Sloman, asking whether it was\n“appropriate to approach [State Atorney Krischer] and give him a heads up re where we might\ngo?” Sloman replied, “No for fear that it will be leaked straight to Epstein.””\n\nAlthough Lourie learned of the case at this point from Sloman, and eventually took a more\nactive role in supervising the investigation, Villafafia continued to update Acosta and Sloman\ndirectly on the progress of the case.*° Villafafia’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach had\nlitle involvement in supervising the Epstein investigation, and at times, Villafafia directed her\nemails to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie without copying her immediate supervisor. In the\nimmediate supervisor’s view, houever, “Miami” purposefully assumed all the “authority” for the\ncase, which the immediate supervisor regarded as “highly unusual.’”>?\n\nBy late August 2oo6, Villafafia and the FBI had identified several additional victims and\nobtained “some flight manifests, telephone messages, and cell phone records that shou the\ncommunication and travel in interstate commerce” by Epstein and his associates. Villafafia\nreported to her supervisors that the State Atorney’s Office would not provide transcripts from the\nstate grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convince him to\nrelinquish the evidence to the FBI.” Villafafia also told her supervisors that she expected “a\nnumber of fights” over her document demands, and that some parties were refusing to comply\n“after having contact with Epstein or his atorneys.”\n\nVillafafia’s reference to anticipated “fights” and lack of <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> led Sloman to ask\nwhether she was referring to the victims. Villafafia responded that the problems did not involve\nvictims, but rather a former employee of Epstein and some business entities that had objected to\ndocument demands as overly burdensome. Villafafia explained to Sloman and Lourie that some\nvictims were “scared and/or embarrassed,” and some had been intimidated by the defense, but\n“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.” Villafafia\na8 On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafafia had not yet briefed about the case, noting that\nOperation Leap Year was “a highly sensitive case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”\n\n29 During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was\nlikely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some\ntype of relationship between somebody in the [State Atorney’s Office] and the defense team.”\nag After Villafafia sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her immediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman,\nand Acosta on August 23, 2oo6, Lourie emailed Sloman: “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the\ncase?” Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care. If Alex says something then I'll tell her to just run it\nthrough you guys.”\n3l OPR understood “Miami” to be a reference to the senior managers who were located in the Miami office,\nthat is, Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel. Records shou, and Villafafia told OPR, that she believed Epstein’s atorneys\n“made a conscious decision to skip” her immediate supervisor and directed their communications to the supervisory\nchain above the immediate supervisor—Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta.\n\n2l\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l22l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021236.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 6D 3536o38, Page64 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 62 of 348\n\ndamages.°°? During a two-month period, the subject atorneys were involved to varying degrees in\nconverting the broad outline into specific terms, resulting in the NPA signed by Epstein on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. The subjects, including Acosta, were generally able to explain to OPR both\nthe larger goals and the case-related factors they likely considered during the process of\nconceptualizing, negotiating, and finalizing this resolution. Houever, the contemporaneous emails\nand other records do not reflect all of the conversations among the decision makers, and their\ndeliberative and decision-making process is therefore not entirely clear. In particular, Menchel\nand Acosta had offices located near each other and likely spoke in person about the case, but\nneither had a clear memory of their conversations. Therefore, OPR could not determine all of the\nfacts surrounding the development of the two-year state plea resolution or the NPA.\n\nIn the follouing account, OPR discusses the initial key decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through state, rather than federal, charges, and sets forth many of the numerous\ncommunications that reflect the negotiations between the parties that led to the final NPA. OPR\nquestioned each of the subjects about hou the decision was reached to pursue a state resolution,\nand OPR includes belou the subjects’ explanations. The subjects’ memories of particular\nconversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus\nemerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the\nwillingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the\ncase that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail\nat trial and through appeal. In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority\nto prosecute a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based\non this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve\nthe mater through a state plea. In any event, Acosta acknouledged to OPR that, at a minimum,\nhe approved of the concept of a state-based resolution after being made aware of the allegations\nand the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum.\nFurthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.\n\nA, June — July 2oo7: The USAO Proposes a State Plea Resolution, which the\n\nDefense Rejects\n\nA few days after the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafafia, advising her that\nEpstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July ll, 2oo7, and hoped\n“to be able to reach a state-based resolution shortly thereafter.”°° In a July 3, 2oo7 email, Villafafia\ntold Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea\ndiscussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a resolution of the federal investigation that could\n32 State laws require that a person convicted of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allou\nlaw enforcement and the public to knou the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and,\nin some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities. The Florida Sexual Offender/Predator Registry\nis administered by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act\nof 2oo6 established a comprehensive, national sex offender registration system called the Sex Offender Registration\nand Notification Act (SORNA), to close potential gaps and loopholes that existed under prior laws and to strengthen\nthe nationwide network of sex offender registrations.\n\n58 In this email, Sanchez also requested a two-week extension of time for <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with the USAO’s demands\nfor records, which included a demand for the computer equipment that had been taken from Epstein’s residence before\nthe October 2oo5 state search warrant and that Villafafia had been requesting from the defense since late 2oo6.\n36\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l236", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021264.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document Eoo 3536o38, Page92 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 9o of 348\nnoted that the revised charges involved l9 victims, so the defense proposal for a l5-month sentence\namounted to less than one month per victim. Villafafia requested that “whatever the U.S. Atorney\ndecides to do,” the agreement with Epstein should “follou ... a version of my writen non-\nprosecution agreement” in order to “avoid any state shenanigans and .. . keep the defense on a\nstrict timeline.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia circulated to Acosta and Sloman a revised NPA that called for a\n2o-month jail sentence to be folloued by lo months of home confinement. This redrafted NPA\ncontained a provision that specified, “With credit for gain time, Epstein shall serve at least\nl7 months in a state correctional institution.”'°* Acosta reviewed the revised NPA and amended\nit to include a statement clarifying that it was Epstein’s obligation “to undertake discussions with\nthe State of Florida to ensure <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with these procedures.” Villafafia sent her version of the\nrevised NPA to Lefcourt that afternoon and forwarded Acosta’s proposed change to him the\nfollouing day, after she learned of it.\n\nOn September ll, 2oo7, the court contacted Villafafia to inquire whether the USAO would\nbe prepared to proceed with the litigation concerning the computers the follouing day. At\nSloman’s direction, Villafafia asked the court to delay the hearing, and the court rescheduled it for\nthe follouing week. At the same time, anticipating that plea negotiations would fail, Villafafia\ncirculated a revised indictment to her co-counsel and Oosterban, seeking their feedback before\nsending it “through the chain of command.” Villafafia also sent Oosterban the revised NPA and\ntold him she was “still shooting for 9/25” to bring charges, assuming the defense declined the\nUSAO’s offer. Oosterban responded, “The counter-offering is unfortunate, but I suppose it’s\nunderstandable.” !°°\n\nThat afternoon, Lourie asked Villafafia, “What is our latest offer?” Villafafia responded,\n“Plead to the three specified [state] charges, a 3o-month sentence, split 2o in jail and lo in\n‘community control,’ and agree that the girls are victims for purposes of damages. We also put in\ndeadlines for a plea and sentencing date.”\n\nB. September l2, 2oo7: The USAO and Defense Counsel Meet with the State\n\nAtorney\n\nAlthough the USAO and defense counsel had been discussing resolving the federal\ninvestigation with a plea to state charges, there is no evidence that the USAO involved the State\nAtorney’s Office in those discussions until September l2, 2oo7. On that day, Lourie, Villafafia,\nand another USAO supervisor who would be replacing Lourie as manager of the USAO’s West\nPalm Beach office, and Epstein atorneys Lefkouitz, Lefcourt, and Goldberger met with State\nAtorney Barry Krischer and Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek. Other than Villafafia,\nfew of the participants had any memory of the meeting or the results of it.

According to\nVillafafia, the official told them, “Epstein would be eligible for work release and will be placed on\nwork release,” a statement that contradicted the information the case agents had been given by a\njail supervisor the previous November, as well as statements made by defense atorney Jack\nGoldberger to Villafafia just days before the plea was entered, when he “specifically told\n[Villafafia] that [Epstein] would not get work release.” Villafafia alerted the Sheriff’s Office\nofficial that although Epstein told the court during his plea proceeding that he had worked “every\nday” for a “couple of years” at the “Florida Science Foundation,” that entity did not even exist\nuntil November 2oo7.8! Moreover, the address Epstein provided to the court for the “Florida\nScience Foundation” was the office of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia and her\nsupervisor asked that the Sheriff’s Office notify the USAO if Epstein applied for work release.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he was aware Villafafia was trying to ensure that Epstein did not get\nwork release, and he would not have contradicted her efforts. Acosta explained that the USAO\nexpected Epstein would be “treated just like everyone else,” but that, as shoun by “our subsequent\ncommunications with the [S]tate [A]torney’s [O]ffice,” having Epstein on work release “was not\nwhat our office envisioned.”\n\nIn August 2oo8, Villafafia spoke with defense atorney Black about ensuring Epstein’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with the NPA, and raised the issue of work release.

In a subsequent email, the FBI case agents informed Villafafia that they had also spoken with a ‘jail\nsupervisor,” who advised them that although Epstein, as a sexual offender, would not qualify for work release, the\njudge could nevertheless order him placed on work release if he was sentenced to a year or less of incarceration.\n\ntl During the plea hearing, Epstein told the court he was “President” of the Florida Science Foundation, it had\nbeen in existence for l5 years, and he worked there “every day.” Plea Hearing Transcript at 27-29.\n\nll4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3l4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021318.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l44 3536o38, Pagel46 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l44 of 348\n\ncooperation.'®° When Villafafia spoke with atorneys in the Eastern District of New York,\nhouever, an AUSA there told Villafafia that “[t]hey had never heard of” Epstein, and he had not\ncooperated with the Bear Stearns case.'8’ During her OPR interview, Villafafia told OPR that to\nher knouledge, the rumor of Epstein’s cooperation was “completely false.”\n\nVillafafia and the USAO continued to monitor Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with the terms of the\nNPA. In August 2oo9, Villafafia alerted her supervisors that Epstein was in apparent violation of\nhis home detention—he had been spoted walking on the beach, and when stopped by the police,\nhe claimed that he was walking “to work” at an office nearly eight miles from his home.

A number of the victims raised concerns about having to\n\ntestify and/or their parents finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.\n\nAdditionally, for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\n\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall, many of the\n\nvictims were troubled about the existence of the investigation. They displayed\n\nfeelings of embarrassment and humiliation and were reluctant to talk to\n\ninvestigators. Some victims who were identified through the investigation refused\n\neven to speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and geting to\n\nthe truth were always at the forefront of our handling of the investigation.\n\nIn addition, during the CVRA litigation, an atorney representing several victims filed a pleading to protect\nthe anonymity of his clients by preventing disclosure of their identities to the CVRA petitioners. See Response to\nCourt Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial <span class=\"highlight\">Compliance</span> (July 24, 2ol5). It is noteworthy that in\n2o2o, when OPR atempted to contact victims, through their counsel, for interviews or responses to writen questions\nregarding contacts with the USAO, OPR was informed that most of the victims were still deeply concerned about\nremaining anonymous. One victim described to OPR hou she became distraught when, during the USAO’s\ninvestigation, the FBI left a business card at her parents’ home and, as a result, her parents learned that she was a\nvictim of Epstein. At the time, the victim was a teenager; was “nervous, scared, and ashamed”; and did not want her\nparents to knou about the case.\n\nl45\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l345", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021376.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3o9 3536o38, Page2o4 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o2 of 348\nsearch warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed.

The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.” Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was... [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment.

On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment.

Despite the\ngovernment’s agreement on September 24, 2oo7, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\n\nMay 2oo8, leters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.” In its February 2l,\n\n2ol9 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those leters “misl[ed] the victims to\n\nbelieve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for\n\nthe Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about\nwhich it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*?\n\nIn the discussions throughout this section, OPR examines the government’s course of\nconduct with victims after the NPA was signed. As set forth in the previous subsection, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia acted with the intent to\nsilence victims. Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s\ninteractions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s inconsistent messages concerning\nthe federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.\n\nIn this section, OPR examines and discusses leters sent to victims by the FBI that were the\nsubject of the district court’s findings. OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia\nwas aware of the content of the leters until the USAO received them from the FBI for production\nfor the CVRA litigation. OPR determined that the January lo, 2oo8 and May 3o, 2oo8 leters that\nthe district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October l2, 2oo7 leter OPR located\nduring its investigation, were “standard form leter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim Specialist. As\nnoted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the FBI agents continued\nto conduct their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such a\no8 Villatfafia told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was\nsigned and “ask[ing] them hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” FBI interview reports indicate that Villafafia\nwas present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations. See 2oo5\nGuidelines, Art. IV, 4 B.2.c (l) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying\nonly nonsensitive data and public information). Houever, Villafafia did not meet with all of the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation, including the CVRA litigation petitioners, and the government conceded during the CVRA\nlitigation that it entered into the NPA without conferring with the petitioners.

As the line AUSA,\nVillafafia handled all aspects of the investigation. Villafafia determined the lines of inquiry to\npursue, identified the witnesses to be interviewed, conducted legal research to support possible\ncharges, and sought guidance from others at the USAO and in the Department. Villafafia, along\nwith the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim Specialist, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.\nShe handled court proceedings related to the investigation. She drafted a prosecution\nmemorandum, indictment, and related documents, and revised those documents in response to\ncomments from those in her supervisory chain of command. Villafafia participated in meetings\nbetween members of the USAO and counsel for Epstein, and prepared briefing materials for\nmanagement in preparation for those meetings and in response to issues raised during those\nmeetings. Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve\nthe federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafafia was the primary USAO\nrepresentative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her\nsupervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO. Thereafter,\nVillafafia monitored Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with the NPA and addressed issues relating to his\nconduct.

Villafafia\ntold Sloman that the FBI agents “are geting copies of all of the evidence and we are going to\nreview everything at [the] FBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her target date for filing federal\ncharges against Epstein was August 25, 2oo6. Acosta emailed Sloman, asking whether it was\n“appropriate to approach [State Atorney Krischer] and give him a heads up re where we might\ngo?” Sloman replied, “No for fear that it will be leaked straight to Epstein.””°\n\nAlthough Lourie learned of the case at this point from Sloman, and eventually took a more\nactive role in supervising the investigation, Villafafia continued to update Acosta and Sloman\ndirectly on the progress of the case.*° Villafafia’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach had\nlitle involvement in supervising the Epstein investigation, and at times, Villafafia directed her\nemails to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie without copying her immediate supervisor.

Villafafia\nreported to her supervisors that the State Atorney’s Office would not provide transcripts from the\nstate grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convince him to\nrelinquish the evidence to the FBI.” Villafafia also told her supervisors that she expected “a\nnumber of fights” over her document demands, and that some parties were refusing to comply\n“after having contact with Epstein or his atorneys.”\n\nVillafafia’s reference to anticipated “fights” and lack of <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> led Sloman to ask\nwhether she was referring to the victims. Villafafia responded that the problems did not involve\nvictims, but rather a former employee of Epstein and some business entities that had objected to\ndocument demands as overly burdensome. Villafafia explained to Sloman and Lourie that some\nvictims were “scared and/or embarrassed,” and some had been intimidated by the defense, but\n“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.” Villafafia\n28 On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafafia had not yet briefed about the case, noting that\nOperation Leap Year was “a highly sensitive case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”\n\n72 During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was\nlikely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some\ntype of relationship between somebody in the [State Atorney’s Office] and the defense team.”\nao After Villafafia sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her immediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman,\nand Acosta on August 23, 2oo6, Lourie emailed Sloman: “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the\ncase?” Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care. If Alex says something then I’ll tell her to just run it\nthrough you guys.”\n3l OPR understood “Miami” to be a reference to the senior managers who were located in the Miami office,\nthat is, Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel. Records shou, and Villafafia told OPR, that she believed Epstein’s atorneys\n“made a conscious decision to skip” her immediate supervisor and directed their communications to the supervisory\nchain above the immediate supervisor—Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta.\n\n2l\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o59", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023074.jpg": "damages.°>> During a two-month period, the subject atorneys were involved to varying degrees in\nconverting the broad outline into specific terms, resulting in the NPA signed by Epstein on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. The subjects, including Acosta, were generally able to explain to OPR both\nthe larger goals and the case-related factors they likely considered during the process of\nconceptualizing, negotiating, and finalizing this resolution. Houever, the contemporaneous emails\nand other records do not reflect all of the conversations among the decision makers, and their\ndeliberative and decision-making process is therefore not entirely clear. In particular, Menchel\nand Acosta had offices located near each other and likely spoke in person about the case, but\nneither had a clear memory of their conversations. Therefore, OPR could not determine all of the\nfacts surrounding the development of the two-year state plea resolution or the NPA.\n\nIn the follouing account, OPR discusses the initial key decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through state, rather than federal, charges, and sets forth many of the numerous\ncommunications that reflect the negotiations between the parties that led to the final NPA. OPR\nquestioned each of the subjects about hou the decision was reached to pursue a state resolution,\nand OPR includes belou the subjects’ explanations. The subjects’ memories of particular\nconversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus\nemerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the\nwillingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the\ncase that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail\nat trial and through appeal. In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority\nto prosecute a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based\non this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve\nthe mater through a state plea. In any event, Acosta acknouledged to OPR that, at a minimum,\nhe approved of the concept of a state-based resolution after being made aware of the allegations\nand the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum.\nFurthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.\n\nA. June — July 2oo7: The USAO Proposes a State Plea Resolution, which the\n\nDefense Rejects\n\nA few days after the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafafia, advising her that\nEpstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July ll, 2oo7, and hoped\n“to be able to reach a state-based resolution shortly thereafter.”°° In a July 3, 2oo7 email, Villafafia\ntold Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea\ndiscussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a resolution of the federal investigation that could\nae State laws require that a person convicted of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allou\nlaw enforcement and the public to knou the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and,\nin some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities. The Florida Sexual Offender/Predator Registry\nis administered by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act\nof 2oo6 established a comprehensive, national sex offender registration system called the Sex Offender Registration\nand Notification Act (SORNA), to close potential gaps and loopholes that existed under prior laws and to strengthen\nthe nationwide network of sex offender registrations.\n\n56 In this email, Sanchez also requested a two-week extension of time for <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with the USAO’s demands\nfor records, which included a demand for the computer equipment that had been taken from Epstein’s residence before\nthe October 2oo5 state search warrant and that Villafafia had been requesting from the defense since late 2oo6.\n36\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o74", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023102.jpg": "noted that the revised charges involved l9 victims, so the defense proposal for a l5-month sentence\namounted to less than one month per victim. Villafafia requested that “whatever the U.S. Atorney\ndecides to do,” the agreement with Epstein should “follou ...a version of my writen non-\nprosecution agreement” in order to “avoid any state shenanigans and . . . keep the defense on a\nstrict timeline.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia circulated to Acosta and Sloman a revised NPA that called for a\n2o-month jail sentence to be folloued by lo months of home confinement. This redrafted NPA\ncontained a provision that specified, “With credit for gain time, Epstein shall serve at least\nl7 months in a state correctional institution.”'°* Acosta reviewed the revised NPA and amended\nit to include a statement clarifying that it was Epstein’s obligation “to undertake discussions with\nthe State of Florida to ensure <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with these procedures.” Villafafia sent her version of the\nrevised NPA to Lefcourt that afternoon and forwarded Acosta’s proposed change to him the\nfollouing day, after she learned of it.\n\nOn September ll, 2oo7, the court contacted Villafafia to inquire whether the USAO would\nbe prepared to proceed with the litigation concerning the computers the follouing day. At\nSloman’s direction, Villafafia asked the court to delay the hearing, and the court rescheduled it for\nthe follouing week. At the same time, anticipating that plea negotiations would fail, Villafafia\ncirculated a revised indictment to her co-counsel and Oosterban, seeking their feedback before\nsending it “through the chain of command.” Villafafia also sent Oosterban the revised NPA and\ntold him she was “still shooting for 9/25” to bring charges, assuming the defense declined the\nUSAO’s offer. Oosterban responded, “The counter-offering is unfortunate, but I suppose it’s\nunderstandable.” !\n\nThat afternoon, Lourie asked Villafafia, “What is our latest offer?” Villafafia responded,\n“Plead to the three specified [state] charges, a 3o-month sentence, split 2o in jail and lo in\n‘community control,’ and agree that the girls are victims for purposes of damages. We also put in\ndeadlines for a plea and sentencing date.”\n\nB. September l2, 2oo7: The USAO and Defense Counsel Meet with the State\n\nAtorney\n\nAlthough the USAO and defense counsel had been discussing resolving the federal\ninvestigation with a plea to state charges, there is no evidence that the USAO involved the State\nAtorney’s Office in those discussions until September l2, 2oo7. On that day, Lourie, Villafafia,\nand another USAO supervisor who would be replacing Lourie as manager of the USAO’s West\nPalm Beach office, and Epstein atorneys Lefkouitz, Lefcourt, and Goldberger met with State\nAtorney Barry Krischer and Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek. Other than Villafafia,\nfew of the participants had any memory of the meeting or the results of it. The available evidence\nindicates that the USAO made additional concessions during the meeting.\n\nlo8 Through “gain time,” Florida inmates can earn a reduction in their sentence for good behavior.\nlo5 Oosterban told OPR that he did not recall having read the NPA at this juncture and “had no involvement\nwith it.”\n64\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23lo2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023124.jpg": "it had identified as victims.'?!

The USAO had no objection to Epstein self-reporting\nto begin serving his sentence by January 4, 2oo8.\n\nImmunity: The USAO would not initiate criminal charges against “any potential\nco-conspirator of Epstein,” including four named personal assistants.\n\nOther: Epstein was obligated to undertake discussions with the State Atorney’s\nOffice to ensure <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with this agreement.\n\nEpstein waived his right to appeal.\n\nEpstein agreed that he would not be afforded any benefits with respect to\ngain time or other rights, opportunities, and benefits not available to any\nother inmate.\n\nThe federal investigation would be suspended and all pending legal process\nheld in abeyance unless and until Epstein violated any term of the\nagreement.

He added, “I have enjoyed working with you on\nHe The USAO had not informed the defense of the victims’ identities at this point. The parties anticipated that\nthe USAO would send Epstein’s atorneys a list of victims when Epstein fulfilled his obligation under the NPA to\nenter his state guilty pleas.\n\nl32 The final NPA is atached as Exhibit 3 to this Report.\nl33 On October 3, 2oo7, the Miami FBI media officer notified the USAO that the New York Post had reported\nthat federal authorities were not going to pursue federal charges against Epstein. According to the Post, Epstein would\nplead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes, “in a deal that will send him to prison for about l8 months,” folloued\nby “a shorter period of house confinement,” and, according to “sources,” federal authorities had “agreed to drop their\n86\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l24", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023152.jpg": "until after Epstein completed his sentence, but that Krischer would oppose such a petition “if it is\nin the agreement.”!”? On November l6, 2oo7, the case agents met with Belohlavek and asked if\nthe State Atorney’s Office would oppose a request that Epstein be granted work release.\nBelohlavek was noncommital, and when the agents asked that she include language in the state’s\nplea agreement prohibiting Epstein from participating in work release, she responded that she\nwould have to discuss the issue with the State Atorney.'®° Krischer later told OPR that work\nrelease was “within the control of the Sheriff's Office, not my office.” The state’s plea agreement\nwith Epstein did not address the issue of work release.\n\nThe day after Epstein entered his June 3o, 2oo8 plea, Villafafia and her immediate\nsupervisor met with a Palm Beach Sheriff's Office official to discuss work release. According to\nVillafafia, the official told them, “Epstein would be eligible for work release and will be placed on\nwork release,” a statement that contradicted the information the case agents had been given by a\njail supervisor the previous November, as well as statements made by defense atorney Jack\nGoldberger to Villafafia just days before the plea was entered, when he “specifically told\n[Villafafia] that [Epstein] would not get work release.” Villafafia alerted the Sheriff's Office\nofficial that although Epstein told the court during his plea proceeding that he had worked “every\nday” for a “couple of years” at the “Florida Science Foundation,” that entity did not even exist\nuntil November 2oo7.'®! Moreover, the address Epstein provided to the court for the “Florida\nScience Foundation” was the office of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia and her\nsupervisor asked that the Sheriffs Office notify the USAO if Epstein applied for work release.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he was aware Villafafia was trying to ensure that Epstein did not get\nwork release, and he would not have contradicted her efforts. Acosta explained that the USAO\nexpected Epstein would be “treated just like everyone else,” but that, as shoun by “our subsequent\ncommunications with the [S]tate [A]torney’s [O]ffice,” having Epstein on work release “was not\nwhat our office envisioned.”\n\nIn August 2oo8, Villafafia spoke with defense atorney Black about ensuring Epstein’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with the NPA, and raised the issue of work release. Villafafia later reported to Acosta\nand Sloman that Black assured her he had “reminded the team that . . . l8 months IN JAIL is a\nmaterial term of the agreement.”\n\nThe USAO never received notice of Epstein’s work release application. On October lo,\n2oo8, less than three-and-a-half months after Epstein entered his guilty plea, the Palm Beach\nSheriff's Office placed him into the work release program, permiting him to leave the Stockade\nl7? According to Sloman, Krischer explained that even without registration Epstein would be “treated” as a “sex\noffender” and that “just like any other sex offender, he can petition the court for work release.”\n\nl8o In the November l6, 2oo7 email, on which she copied Acosta, Villafafia also indicated that she was\n“reviewing all of the statutes” to determine whether there was any impediment to a state judge granting Epstein work\nrelease. In a subsequent email, the FBI case agents informed Villafafia that they had also spoken with a “jail\nsupervisor,” who advised them that although Epstein, as a sexual offender, would not qualify for work release, the\njudge could nevertheless order him placed on work release if he was sentenced to a year or less of incarceration.\n\nl8l During the plea hearing, Epstein told the court he was “President” of the Florida Science Foundation, it had\nbeen in existence for l5 years, and he worked there “every day.” Plea Hearing Transcript at 27-29.\n\nll4\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l52", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023156.jpg": "cooperation.'°© When Villafafia spoke with atorneys in the Eastern District of New York,\nhouever, an AUSA there told Villafafia that “[t]hey had never heard of” Epstein, and he had not\ncooperated with the Bear Stearns case.'8’ During her OPR interview, Villafafia told OPR that to\nher knouledge, the rumor of Epstein’s cooperation was “completely false.”\n\nVillafafia and the USAO continued to monitor Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with the terms of the\nNPA. In August 2oo9, Villafafia alerted her supervisors that Epstein was in apparent violation of\nhis home detention—he had been spoted walking on the beach, and when stopped by the police,\nhe claimed that he was walking “to work” at an office nearly eight miles from his home.

A number of the victims raised concerns about having to\n\ntestify and/or their parents finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.\n\nAdditionally, for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\n\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall, many of the\n\nvictims were troubled about the existence of the investigation. They displayed\n\nfeelings of embarrassment and humiliation and were reluctant to talk to\n\ninvestigators.

Additionally,\nthe second, third, and fourth rights refer to “victim notification, and access to, public proceedings\ninvolving release, plea, sentencing or parole—none of which commence prior to the filing of a\ncomplaint.”\n\nB. 2oo5 Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance\n\nIn May 2oo5, the Department updated its Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and\nWitness Assistance (2oo5 Guidelines) to include the CVRA.” The 2oo5 Guidelines specifically\ncited the CVRA requirement that agencies “engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution\nof crime shall make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded” their\nCVRA rights, which in 2oo5 encompassed the initial eight CVRA rights.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines provided detail regarding implementation of the Department’s CVRA\nduties and divided criminal cases into an “investigation stage,” a “prosecution stage,” and a\n“corrections stage.” The individuals responsible for notifying crime victims of their CVRA rights\nvaried depending on the stage of the proceedings.\n\nDuring the “investigation stage” of cases in which the FBI was the investigating agency,\nthe Special Agent in Charge was responsible for identifying the victims “[a]t the earliest\nopportunity after the detection of a crime” and notifying them of their rights under the CVRA and\nservices available under the VRRA and other federal statutes.\n\n[D]uring the investigative stage, [the Department] mandates\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act, 42 U.S.C\n\n§ lo6o7, which requires federal officials to, among other things,\n\nidentify victims, protect victims, arrange for victims to receive\n\nreasonable protection from suspected offenders, and provide\nThe Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4 (Dec. l7, 2olo) (““OLC\nAvailability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo)”) and available at htps://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/ole/\nopinions/2olo/l2/3 l/availability-crime-victims-rights.pdf. “That [2oo5] informal guidance did not foreclose the\npossibility that other definitions would also be reasonable.” OLC Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo) at l.\n269 The 2oo5 Guidelines are set forth in relevant part in Chapter Three, Part Two, Section II of this Report.

The CVRA Litigation Proceedings and Current Status\n\nWhile the CVRA litigation was pending in the Southern District of Florida, numerous\nfederal civil suits against Epstein, brought in the same district, were transferred to the same judge\nas “related cases,” as a mater of judicial economy pursuant to the Local Rules. As the parties\nagreed on setlements in those civil cases, they were dismissed.*** Several of the victims who had\nsetled their civil cases filed a pleading in the CVRA litigation asking the court to “maintain their\nanonymity” and not “further disseminate[]” their identities to the CVRA petitioners.**°\n\nIn the CVRA case, the petitioners claimed that the government violated their CVRA rights\nto confer by (l) negotiating and signing the NPA without victim input; (2) sending leters to the\nvictims claiming that the mater was “under investigation” after the NPA was already signed; and\n(3) not properly informing the victims that the state plea would also resolve the federal\ninvestigation. In addition, the petitioners alleged that the government violated their CVRA right\nto be treated with fairness by concealing the NPA negotiation and also violated their CVRA right\nto reasonable notice by concealing that the state court proceeding impacted the enforcement of the\nNPA and resolved the federal investigation.\n\nDuring the litigation, the USAO argued that (l) the victims had no right to notice or\nconferral about the NPA because the CVRA rights did not apply pre-charge; (2) the government’s\n383 l57 Cong. Rec. $7359-o2 (2oll) (Kyl leter and Department response).\n\n384 Epstein also resolved some county court civil cases during this time period as well. In addition, numerous\nother cases were resolved outside of formal litigation. For example, one atorney told OPR that he resolved l6 victim\ncases, but did not file all cases with the court. Court data indicate that the atorney filed only 3 of the l6 cases he said\nhe resolved.\n\n385 Doe, Response to Court Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial <span class=\"highlight\">Compliance</span> at l (July 24,\n2ol5).\n\n242\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2328o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023299.jpg": "require victim approval of the prosecutors’ plans, but it allous victims the opportunity to express\ntheir views and to be heard before a final decision is made. The lack of consultation in this case\ndenied the victims that opportunity.*°\n\nWW. LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS BY THE FBI WERE NOT FALSE STATEMENTS\n\nBUT RISKED MISLEADING VICTIMS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia and the FBI separately\ncommunicated with numerous victims and victims’ atorneys, both in person and through leters.\nApart from three victims who likely were informed in October or November 2oo7 about a\nresolution ending the federal investigation, victims were not informed about the NPA or even more\ngenerally that the USAO had agreed to end its federal criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled\nguilty to state charges until after Epstein entered his guilty plea in June 2oo8. Despite the\ngovernment’s agreement on September 24, 2oo7, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8, leters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.” In its February 2l,\n2ol9 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those leters “misl[ed] the victims to\nbelieve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for\nthe Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about\nwhich it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*?\n\nIn the discussions throughout this section, OPR examines the government’s course of\nconduct with victims after the NPA was signed. As set forth in the previous subsection, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia acted with the intent to\nsilence victims. Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s\ninteractions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s inconsistent messages concerning\nthe federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.\n\nIn this section, OPR examines and discusses leters sent to victims by the FBI that were the\nsubject of the district court’s findings. OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia\nwas aware of the content of the leters until the USAO received them from the FBI for production\nfor the CVRA litigation. OPR determined that the January lo, 2oo8 and May 3o, 2oo8 leters that\nthe district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October l2, 2oo7 leter OPR located\nduring its investigation, were “standard form leter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim Specialist. As\nnoted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the FBI agents continued\nto conduct their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such a\n4o8 Villafafia told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was\nsigned and “ask[ing] them hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” FBI interview reports indicate that Villafafia\nwas present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations. See 2oo5\nGuidelines, Art. IV, § B.2.c (l) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying\nonly nonsensitive data and public information). Houever, Villafafia did not meet with all of the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation, including the CVRA litigation petitioners, and the government conceded during the CVRA\nlitigation that it entered into the NPA without conferring with the petitioners.

Epstein’s Arrest and Detention on July 6\nOn July 2, 2ol9, a grand jury of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York returned a two-\ncount indictment that charged Epstein with commiting sex trafficking and a sex trafficking conspiracy, in\nviolation of l8 U.S.C. 88 37l, l59l(a), (b)(2), and 2, based on allegations that he sexually exploited and\nabused dozens of minor girls, some as young as l4 years old, at his homes in New York and Florida. The\nindictment alleged that from at least 2oo2 through 2oo5, Epstein enticed and recruited girls, many of whom\nhe knew were underage, to visit his homes and perform sex acts in exchange for paying each girl hundreds\nof dollars in cash. The indictment further alleged that Epstein, working with employees and associates,\ncreated a vast network of underage victims to sexually exploit in New York and Florida by paying some\nvictims hundreds of dollars in cash each to recruit other minor girls to be similarly abused by Epstein. In\naddition to the two criminal charges, the indictment also contained forfeiture allegations, which sought to\nforfeit to the United States any property that was either used to commit or was a proceed of the charged\nsex trafficking offense, including Epstein’s New York residence.\nOn Saturday, July 6, 2ol9, Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey upon his return to the\nUnited States from France. He was transported to the Metropolitan Correctional Center located in\nNew York, New York (MCC New York), where he was initially placed in the general inmate population. MCC\nNew York is a federal administrative detention facility operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). The\nBOP temporarily closed MCC New York in October 2o2l due to substandard conditions that are unrelated to\nthis investigation. When it was operational, MCC New York housed primarily pretrial detainees who had not\nyet been convicted of any offense, but whom the court had determined under applicable law should remain\nin custody pending trial either because they represent a danger to the community, a substantial flight risk,\nor both. Due to the significant media atention surrounding his arrest and his notoriety among other MCC\nNew York inmates, the follouing day Epstein was moved to MCC New York's Special Housing Unit (SHU), a\nhousing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate\npopulation and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours per day, to ensure their oun safety as\nwell as the safety of staff and other inmates. On Monday, July 8, 2ol9, Epstein appeared in federal court\nand pleaded not guilty to the charges. The court ordered that Epstein remain in custody pending a\ndetention hearing scheduled for July l5, 2ol9.\nAt the detention hearing, Epstein sought to be placed in home detention at his New York residence with\nelectronic monitoring and other conditions. The prosecutors sought to have Epstein detained at MCC\nNew York pending trial. The court reviewed the parties’ filings and heard argument on the mater of pre-\ntrial release on July l5, 2ol9. On July l8, 2ol9, the court ordered that Epstein be detained pending trial. In\nits ruling, the court noted that because Epstein had been indicted for a violation of the federal sex trafficking\nstatute that involved minor victims, there was a presumption in favor of detention under federal law. The\ncourt found that the United States had shoun by clear and convincing evidence that Epstein threatened the\nsafety of another person and of the community based on testimony from two victims, the allegations of\nrepeated sexual abuse of minors, and the lewd photographs of young-looking women or girls that were\nfound during an authorized search of Epstein’s New York residence in July 2ol9. The court also relied on the\nrecommendation of U.S. Pretrial Services, the seriousness of the offenses with which Epstein had been\ncharged, evidence reflecting Epstein’s harassment and intimidation of and tampering with witnesses\ninvolved in a prior Florida state criminal investigation, and Epstein’s lack of <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with his legal\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23388", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023389.jpg": "obligations as a registered sex offender. The court found that the United States had also shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that Epstein was a flight risk based on the severity of the criminal charges\nand severity of the potential punishment; the strength of the evidence against Epstein; and Epstein’s\ncriminal history, sex offender registration, vast wealth and substantial liquid assets, multiple residences, a\nforeign residence, limited family ties in the United States, private plane(s), extensive overseas travel, and\npossession of a foreign passport bearing Epstein’s photograph but not his name. Finally, the court found\nthat Epstein’s pretrial release proposal was inadequate because, among other things, it did not contain\nsworn, accurate, or comprehensive financial statements; it required excessive court involvement in routine\naspects of the proposed home confinement; the proposed consent to extradition was unenforceable; and\nthe proposed appointment of a trustee to monitor Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">compliance</span> with release conditions was\nunacceptably vague and problematic due to the potential conflict of interest presented by monitoring the\nconduct of a person who paid the trustee's salary, and allegations that Epstein engaged in unlawful acts with\nhis employees during the sex trafficking conspiracy. Epstein appealed the court’s order on July 22, 2ol9.\nThis appeal remained pending at the time of Epstein’s death.\nIl. MCC New York's Special Housing Unit\nEpstein was initially assigned to MCC New York's general inmate population, but on July 7, 2ol9, at\napproximately 7:2o p.m., he was moved to the SHU pending reclassification due to the significant increase in\nmedia coverage and awareness of his notoriety among other MCC New York inmate residents. The SHU is a\nhousing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate\npopulation and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day, to ensure their oun safety as well\nas the safety of staff and other inmates. Inmates in the SHU are either on administrative detention or\ndisciplinary segregation status. Administrative segregation status is a non-punitive designation that\nremoves an inmate from the general population when it is necessary to do so to ensure the safety, security,\nand orderly operation of the correctional facility or to protect the public. The MCC New York employee who\nwas the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant on August 9, 2ol9, told the Office of the Inspector\nGeneral (OIG) that most inmates housed in the SHU are “locked doun” in their cells for most of the day.\nOther witnesses told the OIG that SHU inmates are locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day.\nThe Warden of MCC New York during Epstein’s period of detention at that facility, along with Associate\nWarden l and the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant, explained that this was one of the reasons\nthat conducting rounds in the SHU was so important. Unlike inmates in general population housing, SHU\ninmates could not physically approach a staff member; therefore, the staff member had to go to each\ninmate's cell.\nWitnesses told the OIG that Epstein’s daily routine in the SHU was to meet with his atorneys in the atorney\nconference room all day until approximately 8 p.m.2 MCC New York atorney logs confirmed that Epstein\nhad daily visits with atorneys from several different law practices throughout the period of his detention at\nMCC New York. This is consistent with the information available in SENTRY, a BOP database that contains\ninformation relating to the care, classification, subsistence, protection, discipline, and programs of federal\ninmates, which indicates that Epstein had one to two atorney visits on all but l day he was detained at MCC\nNew York. BOP emails reflect that other atorneys expressed frustration to a Supervisory Staff Atorney with\nthe BOP’s Consolidated Legal Center for New York because atorneys had to wait hours or were unable to\n2 As discussed in Chapter l, BOP policy provides that SHU inmates may be escorted from their cells by MCC New York\nstaff for visits, including legal visits, court appearances, medical and psychological atention, shouers, and recreation.\n\n22\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23389", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023399.jpg": "Senior Officer Specialist l told the OIG that after Epstein came off of suicide watch, Epstein asked if he could\nbe paired up with Inmate l again.

The Psychology Department's Post-July 23 Determination that Epstein Needed\nto Have an Appropriate Cellmate\nFollouing the events of July 23, the MCC New York Psychology Department determined that Epstein needed\nto be housed with an appropriate cellmate. To ensure Epstein’s cellmate requirement was disseminated to\nMCC New York staff, on July 3o, 2ol9, at l2:3o p.m., the Staff Psychologist sent an email to over 7o MCC\nNew York staff members which read, “Inmate Epstein #763l8-o54 is being taken off Psych Observation and\nneeds to be housed with an appropriate cellmate.” A review of the email recipients shoued that the email\nwas sent to, among others, the Warden, Associate Warden 2, the Captain, the SHU Lieutenant, the SIS\nLieutenant, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant, the Morning\nWatch Operations Lieutenant, the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant, and CO l. The Staff Psychologist also\ncompleted a “Post-Watch Report,” which stated that the “SHU L[ieutenant] informed inmate Epstein needs\nto be housed with an appropriate cellmate.”\nThe Warden told the OIG that the Chief Psychologist had advised him that Epstein was not suicidal and was\nready to return to the SHU.

MCC New York\nstaff knew that Epstein did not have a cellmate but did not take steps to ensure that he was\nassigned a new cellmate.\n\no MCC New York Staff Failed to Undertake Required Measures Designed to Ensure that Epstein\nand Other Inmates Were Accounted for and Safe. BOP policy requires Special Housing Unit\n(SHU) staff to observe all inmates, conduct rounds, conduct inmate counts, search inmate cells,\nand ensure adequate supervision of the SHU. BOP staff in the SHU in the hours before Epstein’s\ndeath failed to carry out these responsibilities. Specifically, only one SHU cell search was\ndocumented on August 9, and it was not of Epstein’s cell. BOP records did not indicate when\nEpstein’s cell was last searched.

Houever, the offense of sexual batery is on the list, as well as the\ncharge of lewd and lascivious behavior, so there is no assurance that, in the future, a Florida i\nprosecutor or court will not take the position that, where the aggravated assault is combined with i\nwhat some states have labeled a “sexually motivated intent” registration is required. i\ni\nMoreover, as you indicated at our meeting, there is no guarantee that the Florida\nlegislature will not expand the category of persons subject to Megan’s law, and expressly make }\npersons convicted of aggravated assault subject to the law, especially where the felony the actor '\nhad the intent to commit is a sexual offense, and the victim is a minor. The trend today is {\ntouards expansion, not contraction, of these kinds of statutes, and as you noted, Florida will be\nno exception. See, ¢.g., “Sex Offenders; No More Escaping Registration,” 36 McGeorge L. Rev j\n822 2oo5 (Over the last twenty years expanded registration requirements, enhanced penalties for\nfailure to register, and public notification provisions have enlarged the scope of sex offender\nregistration laws); see news articles of just this past week infra describing many of thc |\nproscriptions being adopted around the nation. And, the ex post facto clause stands as no i\nsignificant bar. See Smith v, Doe, 538 U.S. 84 (2oo3) (upholding Alaska Sex Offender |\nRegistration Act against a challenge that its application to persons whose offenses were\ncommited prior to its enactment would violate the ex post facto clause), If this trend continues,\nas it likely will, the client will almost certainly be subject to sex offender registration.\nEven if the client is not and will never be subject to registration requirements under l\nFlorida’s laws, a plea to aggravated assault under the circumstances of this case could subject {\nhim to Megan's Law requirements in other jurisdictions. Thus, if the client pleads guilty to the j\nproposed aggravated assault charge, there is a grave risk that under existing state and Virgin |\nIslands law — quite apart from future expansion or expansive construction of those laws — ho will\nbe subject to sex offender registration requirements and/or criminal exposure for failure to\nregister. There is an even graver risk still that there will be future expansion of the statutes or\nexpansive construction of them that will mean he is covered or arguably so.

LEFcouRT, P.C.\n: Ms. Lanna Belohlavek\nJune 5, 2oo6\nPage 4\n\nFS.A. §§ 943.o435, 784.o2l. Houever, the offense of sexual batery is on the list, as well as the\ncharge of lewd and lascivious behavior, so there is no assurance that, in the future, a Florida\nprosecutor or court will not take the position that, where the aggravated assault is combined with |\nwhat some states have labeled a “sexually motivated intent” registration is required. |\n\nMoreover, as you indicated at our meeting, there is no guarantee that the Florida\nlegislature will not expand the category of persons subject to Megan’s law, and expressly make\npersons convicted of aggravated assault subject to the law, especially where the felony the actor\nhad the intent to commit is a sexual offense, and the victim is a minor. The trend today is\ntouards expansion, not contraction, of these kinds of statutes, and as you noted, Florida will be\nno exception. See, e.g., “Sex Offenders; No More Escaping Registration,” 36 McGeorge L. Rev\n822 2oo5 (Over the last twenty years expanded registration requirements, enhanced penalties for\nfailure to register, and public notification provisions have enlarged the scope of sex offender\nregistration laws); see news articles of just this past week infra describing many of the\nproscriptions being adopted around the nation. And, the ex post facto clause stands as no\nsignificant bar. See Smith v. Doe, 538 U.S. 84 (2oo3) (upholding Alaska Sex Offender\nRegistration Act against a challenge that its application to persons whose offenses were\ncommited prior to its enactment would violate the ex post facto clause). If this trend continues,\nas it likely will, the client will almost certainly be subject to sex offender registration.\n\nEven if the client is not and will never be subject to registration requirements under\nFlorida’s laws, a plea to aggravated assault under the circumstances of this case could subject\nhim to Megan’s Law requirements in other jurisdictions. Thus, if the client pleads guilty to the\nproposed aggravated assault charge, there is a grave risk that under existing state and Virgin\nIslands law — quite apart from future expansion or expansive construction of those laws — he will\nbe subject to sex offender registration requirements and/or criminal exposure for failure to\nregister. There is an even graver risk still that there will be future expansion of the statutes or |\nexpansive construction of them that will mean he is covered or arguably so. See, e.g., Cherry\nHill Sex Offender Ordinance Upheld, Courier Post, June l, 2oo6, at\nhtp://www.courierpostonline.com/apps/pbces.dll/article?
