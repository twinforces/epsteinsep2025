MAXWELL’S MOTION FOR A STAY\n\nA. Applicable Legal Standards\n\nAlthough staying a civil action pending the completion of a criminal prosecution against\na named defendant has been characterized as an “extraordinary remedy,” Louis Vuiton Malletier\nS\\A. v. LY USA, Inc., 676 F.3d 83, 98 (2d Cir. 2ol2), “courts will not hesitate to grant a stay\n‘when the interests of justice seem to require’ it,” Sec. & Exch. Comm’n v. LaGuardia,\n435 F. Supp. 3d 6l6, 62l (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o) (citing Jn re Worldcom, Inc. Securities Litigation,\nNo. o2cv3288 (DLC), 2oo2 WL 3l7295ol, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 5, 2oo2)) (granting a stay where\nthere was overlap of issues in the civil and criminal cases and explaining that overlap of issues is\na particularly significant factor); see also Trustees of Plumbers & Pipefiters Nat. Pension\nFund v. Transworld Mech., Inc., 886 F. Supp. ll34 (S.D.N.Y. l995) (same); Volmar Distributors,\nInc. v. New York Post Co., l52 F.R.D. 36, 42 (S.D.N.Y. l993) (staying civil discovery pending\ncompletion of the criminal case against the defendant); Sec. & Exch. Comm’n v. Shkreli,\nNo. l5-CV-7l75 (KAM) (RML), 2ol6 WL ll22o29, at *7 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 2, 2ol6) (same).\n\nUltimately, the decision as to whether to issue such a stay rests in the discretion of the\ndistrict court, Louis Vuiton Malletier, 676 F.3d at 99, and each case requires a particularized\ninquiry, see id., at 98. In determining whether a civil action should be stayed in the face of a\nparallel criminal proceeding, courts in this District have generally been guided by six factors:\n(l) the extent to which the issues in the criminal case overlap with those presented in the civil\ncase; (2) the status of the criminal case, including whether the defendant has been indicted;\n(3) the private interests of the plaintiff in proceeding expeditiously weighed against the prejudice\nto the plaintiff caused by the delay; (4) the private interests of and burden on the defendant;\n(5) the interests of the court(s); and (6) the public interest. See id.; see also, e.g., Trustees of\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oool9449\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019450.jpg": "Case C22@-Go- O84 DGtuDER ODocamdiGA, FACE DEl ade Haye’ of l3\nPlumbers and Pipefiters Nat. Pension Fund, 886 F. Supp. at ll39. The party seeking the stay\n“bears the burden of establishing its need,” Louis Vuiton Malletier, 676 F.3d at 97 (internal\nquotation marks and citation omited), and this burden may be met where, on balance, the\nrelevant factors suggest that proceeding with the civil action will likely result in undue prejudice\nto the defendant, see id. (noting that “absent a shouing of undue prejudice . . . there is no reason\nwhy [a] plaintiff should be delayed in its efforts to diligently proceed to sustain its claim”\n(internal quotation marks, alteration, and citation omited)).\n\nB. The Relevant Factors Weigh in Favor of Granting a Stay of This Action.\n\nIn this instance, as discussed belou, the relevant factors support Maxell’s application for\na stay.\n\nl. Overlap Between the Civil and Criminal Cases\n\n“The strongest case for granting a stay is where a party under criminal indictment is\nrequired to defend a civil proceeding involving the same mater.” Volmar Distributors, l52\nF.R.D. at 39 (emphasis added) (citations omited); accord In re Worldcom, 2oo2 WL 3l7295ol,\nat *5. Denying a stay where there is significant factual overlap between the civil and criminal\ncases may “undermine a defendant’s Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination . . .\nexpand the rights of criminal discovery beyond the limits of Rule l6(b) of the Federal Rules of\nCriminal Procedure, expose the basis of the defense to the prosecution in advance of trial, or\notherwise prejudice the case.” Volmar Distributors, l52 F.R.D. at 39 (citations omited); see also\nJohnson v. New York City Police Dep’t, No. olcv657o (RCC) (JCF), 2oo3 WL 2l664882, at *2\n(S.D.N.Y. July l6, 2oo3).\n\nAs a threshold mater, this Court finds that, in this instance, there is significant factual\noverlap between this civil case and the pending criminal case. For example, as Maxwell points\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oool945o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019452.jpg": "Case C2@-Ao-oo484-DGHUDER ODoce md, FICE DLl ade Bayeds of l3\n\nHere, Maxwell was indicted by a grand jury on June 29, 2o2o; she has been detained\npending her criminal trial; and her trial date has been set. (8/l9/2o Menninger Ltr., at 2.) Should\ndiscovery in the civil action proceed, Maxwell would be forced to decide whether to defend\nherself by making pretrial disclosures and giving deposition testimony (which could be used\nagainst her in the criminal case) or to invoke her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-\nincrimination (which would protect her in the criminal case, but which could well result in an\nadverse inference being drawn against her in the civil case). (See id., at 4; see also Louis Vuiton\nMalletier, 676 F.3d at 97-98 (discussing the burdens to the Fifth Amendment privilege that may\nbe posed by parallel proceedings).) This legitimate concern, made more real and immediate by\nthe active posture of criminal case, militates in favor of a stay.\n\n3. The Interests of the Plaintiff\n\nPlaintiff asserts that staying this proceeding would harm her interests because, as she is\nsuffering “ongoing damaging effects” from the alleged abuse, and she should not have to wait\nany longer to hold Defendants accountable. (8/27/2o Glassman Ltr., at 4.) While, as a general\nmater, plaintiffs have a strong interest in the expeditious resolution of their civil claims, see\nVolmar Distributors, l52 F.R.D. at 4o, Plaintiff here has not advanced any particularized reason\nwhy a delay would cause her prejudice, such as a likely loss of physical evidence or witness\ntestimony during the period of a stay. (See 8/l9/2o Menninger Ltr., at l (noting that “there is\nlitle chance that any evidence will be lost in the interim given the age of the accusations in this\ncase”); see also id., at 4.)\n\nAdditionally, although this Court is not suggesting that Plaintiff has any obligation to\nagree to a stay so as to pursue her claims through the Compensation Program (and, in fact,\nrecognizes that she does not), this Court does note that a stay would not entirely hinder Plaintiff\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oool9452\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022593.tif": "Page 2ol\nl in a pub in Dublin.\n?
