See\nUnited States v. Minnici, l28 F.

The Court is also |\nconcerned for new victims.\n\nMr. Epstein’s alleged excessive atraction to sexual conduct with or in the presence of\nminor girls — which is said to include his soliciting and receiving massages from young girls and\nyoung women perhaps as many as four times a day — appears likely to be uncontrollable. See\nUnited States v. Minnici, l28 F. App’x 827, 829-3o (2d Cir. 2oo5) (defendant’s alleged sex\ncrimes were “of an addictive sexual nature that cannot be suppressed simply by a restrictive set\nof bail conditions”). Accordingly, Mr. Epstein’s past sexual conduct is not likely to have abated\nor been successfully suppressed by fierce determination, as his Defense Counsel suggests.\nDefense Counsel contends that: “[H]e wasn’t a predator that couldn’t contro! his conduct. He\ndisciplined himself.” 7/l5/l9 Tr. at 3l-32. Defense Counsel also argues that “appreciating the\ngravity of these charges . . . puting aside the age of these witnesses and puting the consent issue\naside, it’s not like [Epstein is] an out-of-control rapist.” 7/l5/l9 Tr. at 36.

Moreover, the government cites no case where a\npurportedly false response in an unrelated civil deposition was admissible as a false exculpatory\nstatement in a criminal case. Accordingly, the Perjury Counts should be severed and tried\nseparately.*\n\nII. The Perjury Counts Must Be Severed to Prevent the Introduction of\n\nImproper, Highly Prejudicial, and Inadmissible Evidence.\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure l4(a), captioned “Relief from Prejudicial Joinder,”\nconfers upon a trial court the discretion to sever even properly joined counts if “justice requires.”\nThe rule provides, in pertinent part: “If the joinder of offenses ...in an indictment . . . appears\nto prejudice a defendant or the government, the court may order separate trials of counts . . . or\nprovide any other relief that justice requires.” Fed. R. Crim. P. l4(a).\n\nThere can be litle doubt that if the Perjury Counts are not severed, Ms. Maxwell will\nsuffer substantial prejudice. The government’s proof of the Mann Act Counts will come almost\nexclusively from the testimony of the three accusers, with litle or no independent documentary\ncorroboration. Adding the Perjury Counts, which involve allegations of sexual abuse by another\nalleged victim that are unrelated to the charged crimes, will create a significant risk that the jury\nwill impermissibly use the evidence <span class=\"highlight\">introduced</span> in connection with the Perjury Counts “to infer a\ncriminal disposition” on the part of Ms. Maxwell to commit the Mann Act violations, or might\n> Tt is highly unlikely that two trials would occur in this mater. Should the case proceed to trial on Counts\nl-4, only, a conviction would expose Ms. Maxwell to a significant term of imprisonment. Under the\nsentencing guidelines, the Court would be permited to consider any severed perjury counts under a\nnumber of theories including | grouping] or 2l U.S.C. § 3553(a). No second trial would be necessary. If\nMs. Maxwell were acquited, issue-preclusion would bar any second trial. See Yeager v.

But the defense did. And notwithstanding that understanding, the\ndefense at no point suggested that it would seek to adjourn the trial date if the Court denied its\nseverance motion. Given the defense’s expansive view of the amount of evidence and time that\nwould be required to complete a trial of the perjury counts, their removal from the equation should\nlargely make up for the additional trial time required to address the new charges and allegations\nregarding Minor Victim-4 in the S2 Indictment. Similarly, nou that the defense no longer has to\nprepare immediately for what it predicted would be a “collateral trial on whether Virginia Roberts\nGiuffre’s statements about an alleged conspiracy from l999-2oo2 were in fact lies” (Dkt. No. l2o\nat 9-lo), defense counsel can prepare for a trial that includes the allegations regarding Minor\nVictim-4.\n\nMoreover, as noted in its April 9, 2o2l leter, the Government fully intends to focus its\npresentation of evidence at trial primarily on the experiences of the four victims referenced in the\nS2 Indictment. As the Government has previewed in its conferrals with defense counsel, the\nGovernment anticipates introducing evidence regarding a small number of additional victims\neither as direct evidence of the charged conspiracies or pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence\n4o4(b). The Government does not expect that this additional evidence will significantly lengthen\nthe trial, particularly because much of this evidence will come from witnesses and exhibits that\nwill already be <span class=\"highlight\">introduced</span> in connection with the four victims referenced in the S2 Indictment.\nThis streamlined approach will ensure both that the length of trial is not significantly expanded\nand that the defense will be able to focus its trial preparation on addressing the allegations\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3945\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003992.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 246 Filed o4/23/2l Page5ofl3\nThe Hon.

She must also identify employees who worked for Mr. Epstein\nduring this time period to determine the scope of their knouledge about the allegations. These\nare time consuming and difficult tasks and Ms. Maxwell respectfully submits that denial of a\ncontinuance under these circumstances would constitute an abuse of discretion.\nIn United States v. Guzman, 754 F.2d 482, 486 (2d Cir. l985), the Second Circuit\nreversed the defendant’s conspiracy conviction, noting that:\n[W]e cannot agree with the government's contentions that the changes in\nGuzman's superseding indictment were insubstantial and that Guzman was\ntherefore not prejudiced because forced to proceed immediately to trial on the\nconspiracy count. Even though the same evidence may have been presented to\nprove the existence of a two-year conspiracy as would have been used on the\nindictment charging a conspiracy of only two days, it cannot be disputed that in\nthe proper preparation of a defense to the charge of a two-year conspiracy,\ncounsel was required to review a far longer period of activity with his client.\nBy focusing on the prosecution's case and the fact that the evidence <span class=\"highlight\">introduced</span> at\ntrial on the superseding indictment was the same as that which the government\nhad expected to use at the first trial, the district court neglected to take into\naccount the impact that the second indictment might have had on defense theories\nof the case, and the resultant need for a more extended preparation. Guzman's\ncounsel had specifically indicated to Judge Plat that he needed more time to\nobtain proof that Guzman was not in the country until after the enlarged\nconspiracy period began. Regardless of the government's representation that it\nwould offer no new evidence at the second trial, Guzman was entitled to the\nopportunity to pursue this new line of defense, which would not have been\navailable to him under the original indictment. The district court abused its\ndiscretion in not granting defendant Guzman a reasonable continuance to prepare\nhis defense to the charge of participation in a two-year conspiracy. Guzman's\nconviction on the conspiracy count is, accordingly, reversed.\nId. In the Guzman case, the conspiracy was expanded from two days to two years, and the\nSecond Circuit found that the refusal to grant a continuance was an abuse of discretion.

On June l7, 2ol7, after seven days of\ndeliberation, the jury announced that it could not reach a unanimous verdict.

Subpoena Recipient-2\n\nThe proposed subpoena to Subpoena Recipient-2 contains four requests.

Indeed,\nMaxwell’s briefing makes clear that she seeks production of the envelope in order to “disprove”\nclaims that Subpoena Recipient-2 might make at trial if called to testify. Beyond a conclusory\nassertion regarding Subpoena Recipient-2, houever, Maxwell does not make any effort to\nidentify which claims she seeks to disprove.

Where the requested\ndocuments were <span class=\"highlight\">introduced</span> at trial, the strong weight to be accorded the public right of access to\njudicial documents was largely derived from the role those documents played in determining\nlitigants' substantive rights -- conduct at the heart of Article III -- and from the need for public\nmonitoring of that conduct. United States v. Graham, 257 F.3d l43, l5l (2d Cir. 2ool).\n\nSuppression of any exhibit that contains an accuser’s name in this case is doubly\nproblematic -- many of the anticipated exhibits are “judicial documents” from other proceedings\nthat have previously been made public or documents already accessible by the public. There is\nnothing confidential about the exhibits and neither the exhibits nor the names of the witnesses\nshould be redacted or suppressed.\n\nIl.

Indeed, referring to Accuser-3 in the indictment as “Minor Victim-3” is\nentirely misleading — there is no evidence that she was a “minor” when any of the alleged sex\nacts took place.\n\nNevertheless, even after the defense pointed out in our pretrial motions that Accuser-3\nwas not a minor and had not alleged any illegal conduct, the government repeated her allegations\nverbatim to the grand jury and in the S2 Superseding Indictment. This was not only misleading,\nit was also an end-run around Rule 4o4(b). Simply including the conduct alleged by Accuser-3 in\nthe indictment does not mean that it is evidence of the charged conspiracies. The conduct\nalleged by Accuser-3 is not within the scope of the charged conspiracies and the Court should\nnot admit this evidence as proof of those charges.

[and] to a wider swath of information regarding civil litigation\nagainst Epstein that is remote from Maxwell’s charged conduct.” /d. at 24. This would present\n“a significant risk that the jury will cumulate the evidence of the various crimes charged and find\nguilt when, if considered separately, it would not do so.” Jd. Further, allouing the introduction\nof this evidence would “likely to require disqualification of at least one of Maxwell’s atorneys\nfrom participating as an advocate on her behalf,” which would “implicate[] [Ms.] Maxwell’s\nSixth Amendment right to be represented by the counsel of her choice” and would significantly\nprejudice her right to a fair trial. /d. at 24-25. Introducing evidence related to the perjury counts\nas evidence of alleged concealment, or for any purpose, would present these same problems and\nshould not be alloued.\n\nThird, as the Court recognized in its prior ruling, fully litigating the perjury charges—\nwhich would be necessary if the government were alloued to introduce the allegedly false\ndeposition statements to shou concealment—would result in a distracting and time-intensive\nside-shou at trial that will confuse the jury with legal and factual issues that are far afield from\nthe “narrouer issues” that pertain to the other charged offenses. /d. at 25-26. This would\nfrustrate the goal of a fair and efficient trial on the remaining charges. /d. at 26.

See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3.\n\nSeparate and apart from the Court’s prior ruling, the government has not established a\nsufficient connection between the alleged false statements and the alleged sex abuse offenses to\nintroduce the statements as evidence of concealment of the later. The alleged false statements\nwere made at unrelated civil depositions in 2ol6, over 2o years after the conduct underlying the\nMann Act offenses supposedly took place, at a time when Ms. Maxwell was not under\ninvestigation. Indeed, Ms. Maxwell was never a subject of the Palm Beach FBI investigation\nthat concluded in 2oo8 and was not named as a co-conspirator in Epstein’s Non-Prosecution\nAgreement that resolved that investigation. Hence, there is no sound basis to assert that Ms.\nMaxwell made false statements to conceal her involvement in Epstein’s crimes.\n\nFurthermore, the superseding indictment does not allege that Ms. Maxwell’s purported\nfalse statements were the result of an agreement with Epstein to conceal their alleged conduct or\nwere otherwise part of, or an object of, the conspiracies charged in the non-perjury counts.\nInstead, the superseding indictment alleges that the purported false statements were part of a\nseparate and independent effort by Ms. Maxwell to conceal her alleged involvement in Epstein’s\nsex abuse offenses long after those offenses had already been completed. Accordingly, the\nstatements are not sufficiently connected to the non-perjury counts to allou this evidence to be\n<span class=\"highlight\">introduced</span> as proof of concealment of those offenses.

Based on the above findings it seems\n\nnecessary to provide a new definition that atempts to encapsulate the complexity of sexual\n\ngrooming, while still being easy to understand. We propose the follouing:\n\nA process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the environment for\n\nthe abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining access to the child, gaining the\n\nchild’s compliance and maintaining the child’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process\nserves to strengthen the offender’s abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of\njustifying or denying their actions.\nConclusion\nDespite the wide acceptance of the term, sexual grooming of children is not understood\nclearly, particularly in the public domain. Testimonies from both victims and perpetrators\nhighlight the pertinence of the problem. Furthermore, the government in England and Wales\nhas <span class=\"highlight\">introduced</span> legislation in the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 regarding “meeting a child\nfollouing sexual grooming” (see Part l: section l52oo3). A greater understanding of the\nmeaning, elements and process of sexual grooming is required to effectively utilize this\nlegislation (for review see Craven, Broun & Gilchrist, in press).\n\nRegardless of the prevalence and pertinence of sexual grooming, most aetiological\ntheories of child sexual abuse neglect the phenomenon. The main reason for this is likely to be\nbecause prominent theories of child sexual abuse were devised more than lo years ago, at a\ntime when sexual grooming was not recognized as it is today. Therefore, it is necessary that\ntheories be reconsidered based on this recent awareness. Ward (2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool; Ward & Siegert, 2oo2) has begun the process of theory kniting and development.\nWhile Ward and Siegert’s Pathways Model is able to account for sexual grooming, it still\nfocuses on the presence of opportunity rather than explicitly recognizing that offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming discussed in the\nliterature: self-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the\nchild. Based on these findings an alternative definition has been suggested, which includes\ndetails about offenders’ objectives, e.g. gaining access to a child, gaining the child’s\ncompliance, maintaining secrecy and avoiding disclosure.\n\nA fuller understanding of sexual grooming is required. Consideration needs to be given to\noffender—victim interaction (before, during and after the offence), micro behaviours that may\nindicate to significant adults that a child is being sexually groomed, or indeed that they\nthemselves are being groomed by an offender, and the seemingly impossible task of proving\nbeyond reasonable doubt that the ambiguous behaviour of sexual grooming is sexually\nmotivated. This would provide many benefits to child protection and the policing and\ntreatment of child sex offenders with a specific focus on prevention of child sexual abuse\nrather than reactive responses to it. To optimize the impact of acquired knouledge and\nunderstanding, it is necessary to consider hou these findings are disseminated to the relevant\ngroups involved with children, e.g. parents, police, and social workers.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006144.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4lo-l Filed ll/o4/2l Page 78 of 93\nLimiting Instruction — Similar Act Evidence Save warecumme\nadmission of any 4o4(b) or other act evidence against Ms\n[If Applicable] Maxwell\nThe Government has offered evidence which it argues shous tendinete-shev+that on\ndifferent occasions, the defendants.

In this\npaper, we suggest that some psychological disorders may increase the like-\nlihood of believing a sexual assault occurred when it did not.

These may not be an exhaustive list of possible\npathways, although many pathways worth careful consideration have been\nincluded.\n\nLying for Conscious and Unconscious Secondary Gain\nThat the alleged victim is knouingly making a false claim of sexual assault is\na pathway that is usually considered, and sometimes this is the only pathway\nconsidered by key individuals in the case. Humans do lie, and their lies can\nbe difficult to detect. Often, humans lie because of what they perceive as\nthe favorable consequences for lying; for sexual assault these consequences\ncould be\nl. the severe negative consequences that the alleged perpetrator\nexperiences,\n2. secondary gain from victim status,\n3. excusing behaviors or characteristics of the alleged victim (e.g., sexual\nactivity, pregnancy, sexually transmited diseases), and\n4, financial gain.\n\nIn sections belou, we consider lying that comes out of other psychi-\natric diagnoses (e.g., the chronic lying associated with an individual with\nantisocial personality disorder).

In one such case in l986,\nNadeen Cool sued her therapist who used hypnosis and other suggestive\ntherapeutic techniques to uncover “lost memories” of abuse (Loftus, l997).\nThrough therapy, Cool remembered being in a satanic cult, eating babies,\nand being raped, among other horrific events. She came to believe she had\nmore than l2o different personalities and even underwent an exorcism led\nby her therapist who sprinkled holy water and demanded Satan to leave her\nbody. Later, Cool realized that her memories were not real and were planted\nby her therapist. The therapist setled out of court for $2.4 million.\n\nThough the false memories discussed thus far have all been entirely fab-\nricated, some false memories are created surrounding real events. Memories\nof an event can be tampered by exposure to subtle misinformation after the\nevent has occurred (Loftus & Palmer, l974; Loftus, l975; Loftus, Miller, &\nBurns, l978). In one famous study by Loftus and Palmer (l974), researchers\nshoued participants short clips of traffic accidents and were asked to rate\nthe speed at which the accident happened. Houever, when questioning the\nparticipants, researchers cleverly manipulated the use of verbs. For instance,\nsome participants were asked the speed at which vehicles smashed into each\nother. Other participants were asked to report the speed at which vehicles\nbit, collided with, bumped, or contacted each other. Participants respond-\ning to the word smashed not only reported a higher speed at which the cars\nwere travelling but weeks later were more likely to recall having seen broken\nglass at the scene. These findings in addition to Loftus’s later work on the\nnature of leading questions (Loftus, l975; Loftus et al., l978) revealed hou\nsubtle information <span class=\"highlight\">introduced</span> after an event may alter the memory of that\nevent. Loftus and her students have since conducted more than 2oo stud-\nies with more than 2o,ooo participants demonstrating hou misinformation\n<span class=\"highlight\">introduced</span> after an event can induce people into creating false memories\n(Loftus, l997).\n\nRepressed memories have not been disproved. Houever, scientific stud-\nies have demonstrated that significant errors in memory and the creation\nof false memories of traumatic events are possible. When the claimant\nsuddenly recovers a memory of a past sexual assault, investigation of the\nevents surrounding the recovery of the memory, including suggestive ther-\napy and investigative techniques (e.g. events surrounding police lineups and\nquestioning), must be examined and may shed light on the validity of the\nrecovered memory.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo628o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006377.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel7 of 54\ndisclosure of such information will identify the Minor Victims with particularity, and thus\nsubject them to harassment, retaliation, and embarrassment, or additional consequences.’\n\nThe sealing of exhibits containing the names of Minor Victim-l, Minor Victim-3, and\nWitness-l, or the last names of Minor Victim-4 and Minor Victim-6, is also appropriate.\nAlthough “the public has an ‘especially strong’ right of access to evidence <span class=\"highlight\">introduced</span> in trials,”\nUnited States v.

Moreover, after “the evidence has become knoun to the\nmembers of the public, including representatives of the press, through their atendance at a public\nsession of court, it would take the most extraordinary circumstances to justify restrictions on the\nopportunity of those not physically in atendance at the courtroom to see and hear the evidence,\nwhen it is in a form that readily permits sight and sound reproduction.” /d. Where the requested\ndocuments were <span class=\"highlight\">introduced</span> at trial, the strong weight to be accorded the public right of access to\njudicial documents was largely derived from the role those documents played in determining\nlitigants' substantive rights -- conduct at the heart of Article III -- and from the need for public\nmonitoring of that conduct. United States v. Graham, 257 F.3d l43, l5l (2d Cir. 2ool).\n\nSuppression of any exhibit that contains an accuser’s name in this case is doubly\nproblematic -- many of the anticipated exhibits are “judicial documents” from other proceedings\nthat have previously been made public or documents already accessible by the public. There is\nnothing confidential about the exhibits and neither the exhibits nor the names of the witnesses\nshould be redacted or suppressed.\n\nIl.

Based on the above findings it seems\n\nnecessary to provide a new definition that atempts to encapsulate the complexity of sexual\n\ngrooming, while still being easy to understand. We propose the follouing:\n\nA process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the environment for\n\nthe abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining access to the child, gaining the\n\nchild’s compliance and maintaining the child’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process\nserves to strengthen the offender’s abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of\njustifying or denying their actions.\nConclusion\nDespite the wide acceptance of the term, sexual grooming of children is not understood\nclearly, particularly in the public domain. Testimonies from both victims and perpetrators\nhighlight the pertinence of the problem. Furthermore, the government in England and Wales\nhas <span class=\"highlight\">introduced</span> legislation in the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 regarding “meeting a child\nfollouing sexual grooming” (see Part l: section l52oo3). A greater understanding of the\nmeaning, elements and process of sexual grooming is required to effectively utilize this\nlegislation (for review see Craven, Broun & Gilchrist, in press).\n\nRegardless of the prevalence and pertinence of sexual grooming, most aetiological\ntheories of child sexual abuse neglect the phenomenon. The main reason for this is likely to be\nbecause prominent theories of child sexual abuse were devised more than lo years ago, at a\ntime when sexual grooming was not recognized as it is today. Therefore, it is necessary that\ntheories be reconsidered based on this recent awareness. Ward (2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool; Ward & Siegert, 2oo2) has begun the process of theory kniting and development.\nWhile Ward and Siegert’s Pathways Model is able to account for sexual grooming, it still\nfocuses on the presence of opportunity rather than explicitly recognizing that offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming discussed in the\nliterature: self-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the\nchild. Based on these findings an alternative definition has been suggested, which includes\ndetails about offenders’ objectives, e.g. gaining access to a child, gaining the child’s\ncompliance, maintaining secrecy and avoiding disclosure.\n\nA fuller understanding of sexual grooming is required. Consideration needs to be given to\noffender—victim interaction (before, during and after the offence), micro behaviours that may\nindicate to significant adults that a child is being sexually groomed, or indeed that they\nthemselves are being groomed by an offender, and the seemingly impossible task of proving\nbeyond reasonable doubt that the ambiguous behaviour of sexual grooming is sexually\nmotivated. This would provide many benefits to child protection and the policing and\ntreatment of child sex offenders with a specific focus on prevention of child sexual abuse\nrather than reactive responses to it. To optimize the impact of acquired knouledge and\nunderstanding, it is necessary to consider hou these findings are disseminated to the relevant\ngroups involved with children, e.g. parents, police, and social workers.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6833\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007155.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document465- Filed ll/l5/2l Page lo4 of l27 lo4\nLBl5max4\n\nl officer testifying as to what the officer himself found and\n\n2 participated in while executing a search seems to me\n\n3 permissible fact testimony.\n\n4 Anything to take up here from the defense,\n\nS Ms. Menninger?\n\n6 MS.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the question whether the\ndefense is required to disclose exhibits they intend to introduce into evidence through Government\nwitnesses as “impeachment.” While the defendant need not disclose exhibits being <span class=\"highlight\">introduced</span>\nsolely for impeachment, the defendant may not circumvent Rule l6’s disclosure requirements by\ndescribing defense exhibits as being used for impeachment when in fact they are properly\nconsidered part of the defendant’s case in chief. Further, the introduction of extrinsic evidence for\nthe purpose of impeachment is narrouly circumscribed, as set forth belou.\n\nRule l6(b) expressly requires disclosure of items the defense “intends to use . . . in the\ndefendant’s case-in-chief at trial.” Fed. R. Crim. P. l6(b)(l)(A). The defendant’s “case in chief”\nis not a formalist term for the events that begin the moment the Government rests. Rather, “where\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l9o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008191.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l7 Filed ll/3o/2l Page2of4\na defendant cross-examines a government witness to butress her theory of the case, rather than to\nimpeach the testimony given by the witness on direct examination, the cross-examination is\nproperly seen as part of the defendant’s case-in-chief.” United States v. Napout, No. l5 Cr. 252\n(PKC), 2ol7 WL 6375729, at *7 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. l2, 2ol7) (quoting United States v. Hsai, No. 98\nCr. 75 (PLF), 2ooo WL l95o67, at *2 (D.D.C. Jan. l2, 2ooo)) (alterations and internal quotation\nmarks omited). “[T]his interpretation of Rule l6 has been adopted by almost every district court\nto consider the issue.” /d. (collecting cases); see United States v. Young, 248 F.3d 26o, 269 (4th\nCir. 2ool) (affirming exclusion of evidence offered through cross-examination as part of the\ndefense’s “evidence in chief,” under the prior language of Rule l6, due to the defense’s failure to\ndisclose). Accordingly, the rule “requires [the defense] to identify all non-impeachment exhibits\nthey intend to use in their defense at trial, whether the exhibits will be <span class=\"highlight\">introduced</span> through a\ngovernment witness or a witness called by [the defense].” Napout, 2ol7 WL 6375729, at *7. The\nreasoning is simple: a contrary rule would “permit defendants to evade pretrial disclosure simply\nby presenting much (or all) of their case-in-chief before the government rests,” thereby\n“frustrat[ing| the practical intentions behind Rule l6: to avoid unfair surprise and unwarranted\ndelay by providing both the government and the defense with a broad, reciprocal right to\ndiscovery.” United States v. Crouder, 325 F. Supp. 3d l3l (Mem.) (D.D.C. Sept. 24, 2ol8).\n\nThe defendant’s Rule l6 disclosures were due on November 8, 2o2l. (Dkt. No. 297 at 2).\nAccordingly, any exhibits which the defense intends to offer as part of its case-in-chief, whether\nthrough Government witnesses or its oun, should have been disclosed at that time.

Moore, 2o8 F.3d 577, 579 (7th Cir. 2ooo) (Rule\nl6(b)(l)(A) does not require defense to disclose evidence used to impeach “the testimony of a\nwitness for the prosecution,” because that is not evidence <span class=\"highlight\">introduced</span> in a defendant’s “‘case-in-\nchief”).!\n\nAs Judge Easterbrook recognized, the government’s contrary argument in this case\n“sorely misunderstands what it means to offer ‘evidence in chief? (or evidence in one’s ‘case in\nchief’).” Moore, 2o8 F.3d at 579. In fact, so obviously wrong is the government’s interpretation\nof Rule l6 that, when the government offered the same argument in United States v. Moore,\nJudge Easterbrook concluded that the district court commited a plain error in excluding a leter\nthe defense offered into evidence while cross-examining a prosecution witness during the\ngovernment’s case-in-chief. /d.\n\nThe government is also wrong to suggest that even if Ms. Maxwell did not have to\ndisclose statements used as impeachment while cross-examining a prosecution witness during\nthe government’s case-in-chief, she did have to disclose other exhibits used as impeachment,\nsuch as the photograph she offered into evidence while cross-examining Jane.

In doing so, the government conveniently ignores the argument it\nmade to the jury at trial — namely, that Jane, Kate, Carolyn, and Annie Farmer were all victims of\nthe same criminal plan to sexually exploit underaged girls, which Epstein and Ms. Maxwell\ncarried out using the same methods throughout the entire course of the conspiracy. (Tr. 2848)\n(“[Maxwell] ran the same playbook over and over and over again as she exploited young girls.\nThe similarities between what happened to Jane and Annie and Carolyn and Kate are incredibly\npouerful evidence of the defendant’s guilt.’’).\n\nThe government atempts to side-step this obvious inconsistency by arguing that the\nconspiracy charged in Count Three involved “groom[ing] [victims] to travel to Epstein’s\nproperties for sexual abuse,” whereas Count Five involved “paying victims for so-called\n‘massage appointments,’ where they were sexually exploited.” (Opp. at 32). But “grooming”\nand travel were not exclusive to Count Three. Carolyn testified about being progressively\n<span class=\"highlight\">introduced</span> to more serious sexual situations, which was a form of “grooming. (Tr. l52l-23,\nl537).

In its summation regarding Count Four, the Government focused on travel to New\nYork. See Trial Tr. at 289l-92.° The Government’s explanation of Counts One and Three\nfolloued this patern as well, with the summation again making clear that the Defendant and\nEpstein had intended for the victims to be “sexually abused in New York.” /d. at 2895. Thus,\nthe Court’s instructions to the jury, the evidence presented at trial, and the Government’s\nargument in summation did not describe “behavior entirely separate from that identified in the\nindictment,” Bastian, 77o F.3d at 223 (quoting Danielson, l99 F.3d at 67o), but instead\nconsistently captured the core of criminality with which the Defendant was charged.\n\n2.

The Defendant has nevertheless failed to shou that she was substantially prejudiced\nby this evidence. See Salmonese, 352 F.3d at 62l.\n\nWhen a defendant has notice of the government’s theory of the case before trial, she is\nnot prejudiced by a variance. See Kaplan, 49o F.3d at l29-3o. Pretrial disclosures may put a\ndefendant on notice of evidence not specifically included in the indictment. See Khalupsky, 5\nF.4th at 294. And a defendant’s failure to object to allegedly surprising evidence or to request a\ncontinuance when evidence is <span class=\"highlight\">introduced</span> suggests that a defendant was not unfairly surprised or\nprejudiced. See Kaplan, 49o F.3d at l3o.\n\nHere, the Defendant had sufficient notice of the Government’s theory of the case, and of\nJane’s testimony regarding New Mexico specifically, to avoid substantial prejudice. The\nIndictment charged a scheme to sexually abuse underage girls in New York. In service of this\nscheme, the Indictment alleged that Epstein and the Defendant groomed the victims for abuse at\nvarious properties and in various states, including Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico. Jane had\nlong recalled traveling to New Mexico, see Maxwell Br. at l6-l7, although she did not report\nthat Epstein had engaged in sexual activity with her at this property until closer to trial. But the\nDefendant had adequate notice of this particular testimony such that there was no danger of\nsubstantial prejudice. The Defendant received the Government’s notes of Jane’s interview where\nshe recalled abuse in New Mexico on November 6, 2o2l, more than three weeks before trial. At\nthat point, the parties were still litigating the very instructions for Kate and Annie that the\nDefendant claims she would have sought for Jane had she received adequate notice. See, e.g.,\nNov. 23, 2o2l Tr. at 28-38; see also Lebedev, 932 F.3d at 54 (concluding in part that the\ndefendant was not “unfairly and substantially” prejudiced because “[t]he government disclosed\nthe evidence and exhibits . . . four weeks prior to trial”). Moreover, that the Defendant did not\n\n36\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo4o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010408.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 42 of 45\ndefense witnesses died three years or more prior to indictment); United States v. King, 56o F.2d\nl22, l3o (2d Cir. l977) (defense witness died a year prior to the indictment). Here, the\nDefendant largely speculates about the contents of these deceased witnesses’ absent testimony.\nShe states, for example, that the two architect witnesses “could have established” the timeline for\nEpstein’s residences and renovations at each but does not say what that timeline is. Maxwell Br.\nat 29. Similarly, the Defendant states that Epstein’s live-in housekeeper cou/d have testified that\nthe Defendant spent only limited time with Epstein at his tounhouse in New York but provides\nlitle basis or detail for that anticipated testimony. As with the documentary evidence above,\nsuch speculation, with the apparent presumption that absent evidence would necessarily favor the\nDefendant, is insufficient to establish actual prejudice. See United States v. Long, 697 F. Supp.\n65l, 657 (S.D.N.Y. l988) (no prejudice where there is “no way of knouing what [an absent\nwitness’s] testimony would have been’’).\n\nSecond, the Defendant fails to establish that the content of these witnesses’ testimony\ncould not have been <span class=\"highlight\">introduced</span> into trial by other means. At trial, witnesses testified that Epstein\nemployed a significant number of individuals to work at his residences, renovate those\nresidences, or fly his private airplane. Some, like Juan Alessi, Larry Visoski, and David\nRodgers, testified at trial. Still others were listed on the parties’ witness lists. The Defendant\ndoes not explain why these witnesses’ testimony, or the testimony of those listed witnesses who\nwere not called, could not have supplied the same information that she seeks from individuals\nwho were unavailable to testify. Her assertion that only individuals that have since died could\nprovide adequate testimony is entirely unsubstantiated. Similarly, the Defendant does not\nexplain why evidence of construction or renovations at Epstein’s residences could not be proven\nby other witness testimony or by documentary evidence.\n\n42\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo4o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010544.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page9of55\n\nThis culture of silence provided space for the defendant and Epstein to operate a playbook\nthrough which they sexually abused young girls. At trial, Dr. Lisa Rocchio, an expert in\npsychology with a specialized expertise in traumatic stress and interpersonal violence, explained\nthat children are most frequently sexually abused through grooming and coercion in the context of\na relationship. (Tr. 7l3). Dr. Rocchio explained that abusers use a series of deceptive tactics to\nengage a child in sexual abuse. (Tr. 7l5-2o). The defendant and Epstein used such tactics\nthroughout the life of the conspiracy. In the early phase of the conspiracy, from at least\napproximately l994 through approximately 2ool, the defendant identified vulnerable girls,\ntypically from single-mother households and difficult financial circumstances. (PSR § 26). The\ndefendant and Epstein then isolated the girls, spending time with them away from their family and\nfriends. (/d.). During that time, they groomed the girls through techniques such as giving them\ngifts, pretending to be friends, and building trust. (/d.). The defendant and Epstein then\nnormalized sexual situations and sexual touching. (/d.). Finally, they transitioned to sexual abuse,\noften through the pretext of giving Epstein a massage. (/d.). This earlier phase required the\ndefendant and Epstein to identify one girl at a time to target for grooming and abuse.\n\nIn the later phase, from approximately 2ool until at least approximately 2oo4, the\ndefendant and Epstein developed a scheme that created a constant stream of girls who recruited\neach other to visit Epstein at his Palm Beach residence. (PSR § 27). This new approach replaced\nsome of the early grooming and trust-building steps with money provided to girls from struggling\nfamilies. (/d.). Specifically, the defendant and Epstein paid young girls hundreds of dollars in\ncash in exchange for meeting Epstein to be sexually abused—again, often under the pretext of\ngiving Epstein a massage.

(PSR {fj 39-4o). The defendant\ndelivered Kate to a naked Epstein in the defendant’s oun home for massages and told Kate to\n“have a good time.” (PSR 4 4l-42). During these massages, Epstein initiated sexual contact with\nher, puting her hand on his penis and grabbing Kate’s breasts and in between her legs. (/d.).\n\nKate traveled to meet both Maxwell and Epstein in Palm Beach, Litle Saint James, and\nNew York City when she was between approximately l8 and 24 years old. (PSR 4 43). Epstein\ninitiated sexual activity with Kate every time she spent time with him from when she was l7 years\nold through her early thirties. (/d.). The defendant brought up sexual topics with Kate, ranging\nfrom talking about hou sexually demanding Epstein was to asking if Kate knew of anyone to give\nEpstein a blou job to remarking that Epstein liked cute, young, prety girls like Kate. (PSR 44).\n\nWhen Kate was approximately l8 years old, Kate visited Epstein and Maxwell at Epstein’s\nvilla in Palm Beach. (PSR 45).

Sexual Abuse of Annie Farmer\n\nThe defendant also took steps to normalize sexual contact with Annie Farmer, who was\nthen l6 years old. In the spring of l996, Annie’s mother, at Epstein’s request, agreed to send\nAnnie to Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico for a retreat for a group of 2o to 25 students (both boys\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo547\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010549.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Pagel4of55\nwhen Annie managed to extricate herself from the situation by running to the bathroom, thereby\ndenying Epstein further sexual contact, the defendant seemed “very disinterested” in Annie. (/d.).\n\n4. Sexual Abuse of Virginia Roberts\n\nBeginning in or about the summer of 2ooo, the defendant and Epstein entered a new phase\nof their scheme to sexually abuse teenage girls. That summer, Maxwell recruited a l7-year-old\ngirl named Virginia Roberts from the parking lot of Mar-a-Lago to provide Epstein with massages.\n(PSR § 56). Over the next several months, Virginia was paid to provide Epstein with sexualized\nmassages at his Palm Beach residence, in exchange for hundreds of dollars in cash for each\nmassage. (PSR § 55). Virginia also traveled with Epstein and Maxwell to other locations,\nincluding New York and the Virgin Islands, on Epstein’s private plane. (PSR 457). Virginia\nbrought other teenage girls to Epstein’s Palm Beach house. (PSR 458). One of those girls was a\nl4-year-old girl named Carolyn who Virginia <span class=\"highlight\">introduced</span> to the defendant and Epstein at the Palm\nBeach villa in 2ool. (PSR ff 58, 59). Thus began the pyramid scheme phase of the defendant and\nEpstein’s abuse of teenage girls.\n\n5. Sexual Abuse of Carolyn\n\nCarolyn visited Epstein’s Palm Beach residence more than loo times, during each of which\nshe was sexually abused during paid sexualized massages. (PSR 59). Carolyn met the defendant\nthe very first time she went to Epstein’s house, and she interacted with the defendant multiple\ntimes thereafter. (/d.). On Carolyn’s first visit to the house, the defendant greeted Virginia, who\n<span class=\"highlight\">introduced</span> Carolyn to the defendant. (PSR { 62). The defendant then told Virginia, “You can\nbring her upstairs and shou her what to do,” after which Virginia shoued Carolyn hou to perform\na sexual massage on Epstein. (PSR {| 62-63).

The government’s other arguments fail.\n\nThe government offers three other arguments. First, the government faults Ms. Maxwell\nfor not shouing Jane pictures of Eva, Michelle, and Kelly. Nothing required Ms. Maxwell to do\nthat, and the government cites no authority for its argument.\n\nWhat’s more telling is that the government never shoued Jane their photographs. The\ngovernment’s deliberate choice to muddy the waters is not Ms. Maxwell’s fault or her problem.\nThe record shous Eva Dubin, Michelle Healy, and Kelly Bovino are the “Eva,” “Michelle,” and\n“Kelly” who Jane testified about. Their testimony is admissible.\n\nSecond, it’s irrelevant that Ms. Maxwell did not use last names in her examination of\nJane. For one thing, Jane also did not use last names in her interviews with the FBI. For another\nthing, Eva Dubin’s name was already on the record from Mr. Visoski’s testimony, and Jane\nadmited knouing Kelly’s last name. Finally, Ms. Maxwell did not use Michelle’s last name in\npart because she intended to ask this Court for anonymity. It’s immaterial that this Court\nsubsequently denied that request.\n\nFinally, the government mistakenly relies on cases purporting to hold that a defendant,\nthrough cross-examination, cannot open the door to proving collateral issues by extrinsic\n\n> The government quite rightly does not make a 4o3 argument. And its relevance\nargument—that the testimony of Eva, Michelle, and Kelly does not contradict Jane’s\ntestimony—is wrong, as described above.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll373\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011692.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 74l Filed o8/lo/22 Page 27 of lo6 3l\nLBTCMAX2 Opening -—- Ms. Pomerantz\n\nl (Jury present)\n\n2 THE COURT: Thank you so much, members of the jury.

Analyzing hou the Nolle Prosequi ([Epstein] ECF No. 52)\nfiled in this case impacts proposed disclosure, with legal\nauthorities.\n\n(Epstein Dkt. 67). In the Maxwell case, the Court directed the Government to provide additional\ninformation by August 4, 2o25, in particular, a leter:\n\nl. Stating whether the Government moves to unseal the grand\njury exhibits as well as the transcripts, or just the transcripts.\n\n2. Identifying with specificity the grand jury exhibits, as\nredacted for public release, that are not already part of the\npublic record. In making this assessment, the Government\nshould take into account whether the unredacted portions of\nthese exhibits were received in evidence during trial in this\ncase, otherwise disclosed on the docket of this case, or\ndisclosed in the course of civil litigation, see, e.g., Giuffre v.\nMaxwell, l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP).\n\n3.

Of course, the grand jury exhibits are not the only exhibits in these cases; a large\nnumber of exhibits were admited at the Maxwell trial, which trial exhibits are—subject to\njudicially approved redactions and/or sealing—presumptively public documents. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo49 (2d Cir. l995) (“the public has an especially strong right of\naccess to evidence <span class=\"highlight\">introduced</span> in trials” (internal quotation marks and citation omited)); United\nStates v.

The Government previously made those trial exhibits—subject to any\njudicially approved redactions and/or sealing—available to the public through a website during\nthe Maxwell trial.\n\nThe Government respectfully requests leave of the Court to advise the Court by August 8,\n2o25, of its position with respect to unsealing of the grand jury exhibits.

Maxwell purported to\nbefriend the girls to gain their trust and create the illusion of friendship and responsible adult\nsupervision, while isolating them from others. She then manipulated that trust to normalize\nsexual abuse by Epstein and herself, often through the pretext of giving Epstein “massages.”\nMaxwell personally participated in acts of sexual abuse, including, for example, instructing\nthen—l4-year-old Jane hou to touch Epstein’s penis during a “massage,” and touching Jane’s\nbreasts herself. Maxwell and Epstein also paid young girls hundreds of dollars of cash in\nexchange for meeting Epstein to be sexually abused. Once a girl was <span class=\"highlight\">introduced</span> to these\nsexualized massages, she was offered more money if she brought other girls to engage in\nsexualized massages. Maxwell also fostered a culture of silence at Epstein’s various households\nwhere sexual abuse occurred, directing employees to “see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing.”\n\nC. Post-Trial Motions\n\nOn January l9, 2o22, Maxwell moved for a new trial under Federal Rule of Criminal\nProcedure 33, based on a juror’s provision of inaccurate information during jury deliberations.\nDkt. 58o. On April l, 2o22, after an evidentiary hearing, Judge Nathan denied that motion.\nDkt. 653.\n\nOn February ll, 2o22, Maxwell made other pretrial motions, under Rules 29 and 33.\nDkt. 6oo. On April 29, 2o22, Judge Nathan denied all but one of these motions. In the motion\nshe granted, Judge Nathan found that the three conspiracy counts were multiplicitous, and\ntherefore entered judgment on only one of them. Dkt. 657.\n\nD.

See Kaplan, 49o F.3d at l3o.\n\nHere, the Defendant had sufficient notice of the Government’s theory of the case, and of\nJane’s testimony regarding New Mexico specifically, to avoid substantial prejudice. The\nIndictment charged a scheme to sexually abuse underage girls in New York. In service of this\nscheme, the Indictment alleged that Epstein and the Defendant groomed the victims for abuse at\nvarious properties and in various states, including Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico. Jane had\nlong recalled traveling to New Mexico, see Maxwell Br. at l6-l7, although she did not report\nthat Epstein had engaged in sexual activity with her at this property until closer to trial. But the\nDefendant had adequate notice of this particular testimony such that there was no danger of\nsubstantial prejudice. The Defendant received the Government’s notes of Jane’s interview where\nshe recalled abuse in New Mexico on November 6, 2o2l, more than three weeks before trial. At\nthat point, the parties were still litigating the very instructions for Kate and Annie that the\nDefendant claims she would have sought for Jane had she received adequate notice.

The stairway, which is located from the kitchen area to the\nmaster bedroom area, is lined with photos of naked young girls. Additionally, numerous photographs of naked\nyoung females, some of which appeared to be the girls I previously interviewed, were on display throughout the\nhouse. Also located in the house were various phone message books. The telephone message books have a\nduplicate copy (Carbon Copy) which, once a phone message is writen into the book, the top copy is then torn\non the perforated edge and the carbon copy is left in the book.

Several massage\ntables were located throughout the second floor of the residence, including a massage table found in Epstein’s\nbedroom. On the first floor of the residence I found two covert cameras hidden within clocks. One was located\nin the garage and the other located in the library area on a shelf behind Epstein’s desk. A computer was located\nwhich was believed to contain the images from the covert cameras. The computer’s hard drive was reviewed\nwhich shoued several images of Haley Robson and other witnesses that have been interviewed.

Ms Bean identified\nherself as Victoria Bean and resides in Wellington, Florida. She\nadvised approximately a year ago she was brought to Epstein's house to\nprovide a massage for money. Bean stated she needed to make money and\nfelt it was a quick way to make some money. Bean stated she was\nbrought to the house by Harrison and was <span class=\"highlight\">introduced</span> to Epstein and his\nassistant. She was brought to his main bathroom and provided a\nmassage. I asked her if she provided the massage naked. Bean stated\nshe did. She rubbed Epstein's legs, back and chest. I asked Bean if\nEpstein touched her during the massage. She advised he did not,\nhouever he did masturbate himself as she rubbed his chest. Once he\nclimaxed the massage was over. She was paid her money and left the\narea.

Rodgers\nstated unless Epstein flew to his island off of St Thomas, there would\nbe no way of knouing who the passengers were. I mentioned a recent\nflight to Ohio, where Rodgers flew to Ohio to pick up Dana Burns.\nRodgers stated he recalled flying on several occasions and did\n\n‘remember Burns. Rodgers stated once he is in the cockpit, he does not\nknou who the passengers are. When he prepares the passenger\nmanifests, he lists Epstein and his assistants he knous by name, Sarah\nand Adrianna. Rodgers stated he would list either female or male\npassengers on the manifests only to keep a count on the passengers.\nMrs. Rodgers came into the living room and recommended that her\nhusband consult with an atorney. Mr. Rodgers agreed he would speak\nwith the family atorney to inform him of this questioning. I\nexplained to Mr. Rodgers that he was not the suspect in this\ninvestigation and ceased all questions.
