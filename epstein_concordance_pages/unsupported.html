On November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell filed a leter request seeking an in camera conference for the\npresentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the\nNovember 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the <span class=\"highlight\">unsupported</span> request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo II\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions.

The Court sought more information by ordering the\nGovernment to confer with legal counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to certain\nquestions. Dkt. No. 257. In response, the Government states that MDC staff conduct flashlight\nchecks of all inmates as a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As reported by the Government,\ninmates housed with cell mates in the Special Housing Unit are checked with flashlights every\n3o minutes. Inmates housed with others in the general population are checked multiple times per\nnight at regular intervals. The Government further reports that to conduct the checks, flashlights\nare pointed at the ceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present, breathing, and not in\ndistress. As the Government explains, there are a number of neutral reasons why BOP’s\nflashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those of other inmates, including\nthat Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the potential stress for inmates that\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooool427\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001428.jpg": "CaSede2oter-OF2ocAdNen DELament! 282 Filed OBADA 27 adeaigef ZOf 2\ncan arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has determined that these factors necessitate more\nfrequent safety and security checks. The Government also indicates that the prohibition on eye\nmasks is a generally applicable policy, but that Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other non-\ncontraband items to cover her eyes.\n\nTo the extent that Maxwell’s April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override BOP’s\ndetermination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check procedures, that\nrequest is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally <span class=\"highlight\">unsupported</span>.

Ironically, it is the MDC staff who leaked to the press that Ms. Maxwell had\nbeen vaccinated.\n\nFurther, in her desire to interact and be helpful with other inmates, Ms. Maxwell\ncompleted two programs to assist other inmates- (l) to qualify as a teacher aide and offered to\nhelp update MDC learning curriculum and (2) to qualify as companion for suicide watch. Her\nde facto solitary confinement prevents her from utilizing that training to assist others.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s segregation and surveillance go way beyond the concerns posited by the\nMDC. It is not only other inmates who may harm Ms. Maxwell, but also the very guards tasked\nto her security detail who have already done harm to her: failing to provide adequate food or feed\nher at all in a 2o-hour period, damaging her discovery hard drive, seizing her confidential legal\ndocuments, erasing her CorrLinks emails, physically abusing her. The list goes on and on. In an\neffort to advocate in compliance with BOP procedure, she has filed hundreds of BP-8s, BP-9s\nand BP-los only to receive a response that is less than helpful, or in the absence of any response\nwas told the form was either lost or never filed, Each and every day of her detention, she is\nguarded by at least three officers who watch and record, by writing and via a handheld camera,\nher every move: when she eats, shouers, cleans her clothes, brushes her teeth, etc. As the guards\nfeverishly write while observing Ms. Maxwell during videoconferencing with counsel, it appears\nthat they go beyond their routine continual l5-minute reporting.\n\nFurther, her non-legal phone calls are monitored in real time. It was the staff who\nconfronted Ms. Maxwell about the death of someone whom she was close to within hours on her\nlearning about it, information derived from her phone calls. Ms. Maxwell does not discuss\npersonal maters with MDC guards and did not provide information concerning the passing of\nsomeone quite dear to her.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in further support of its request to delay\ndisclosure to the defense of certain photographs of and documents (the “Materials”) regarding\nvictims of sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein. Contrary to the defense’s assertions, the Materials are\nnot exculpatory as to the charges contained in the Indictment. But in any event, the Government\nis not suggesting that the defense should never receive these Materials. The Government fully\nintends to provide the defense with these Materials, along with the statements of every witness it\nhas interviewed as part of its broader investigation, eight weeks in advance of trial. Because that\ninvestigation remains ongoing, houever, and because the Materials are unrelated to the charges\ncontained in the Indictment, production at this stage would be premature and would reveal the\nscope and focus of the Government’s ongoing investigation. Accordingly, the Government\nrespectfully requests that it be permited to produce the Materials eight weeks prior to trial.\n\nFirst, Maxwell’s opposition misconstrues the Government’s description of the Materials\nand conflates them with witness statements about the Materials. To be clear, the Materials at issue\nhere include documents regarding and photographs of victims of Jeffrey Epstein who were abused\nduring time periods that post-date the Indictment. These Materials do not include witness\nstatements from those victims, which, as the Government noted in its opening papers, the\nGovernment will produce eight weeks in advance of trial. The Materials in and of themselves thus\ndo not, as the defendant incorrectly suggests, make clear one way or the other whether the\ndefendant ever had any involvement in those victims’ abuse. Regardless, as detailed belou,\nwhether or not the defendant participated in any criminal activity that she is not charged with that\npostdates the time period in the Indictment is simply not relevant, much less exculpatory.\n\nSecond, even accepting the defendant’s mischaracterization, the Materials are not\nexculpatory as to Maxwell. At base, the defense opposition stretches the concept of exculpatory\nmaterial beyond recognition in a way that is wholly <span class=\"highlight\">unsupported</span> by the law of this Circuit. Under\nthe defense’s view, if Jeffrey Epstein ever sexually abused any victim after l997 without the\ndefendant’s involvement, that somehou exculpates her with respect to an Indictment charging her\nwith participating in Epstein’s abuse of minors between l994 and l997.

There is no\n“affirmative appearance” that the NPA binds other districts, and the motion should be denied.\nUnder Annabi and its progeny, the defendant has failed to establish that the NPA binds other\ndistricts. For this reason alone, the defendant’s motion should be dismissed, in keeping with the\nwell-established law in this Circuit.*\n8 In her motion, the defendant asks this Court to apply a bizarre and unprecedented choice-of-\nfederal-law doctrine, under which the defendant asks the Court to apply non-existent rulings from\nthe Eleventh Circuit on an issue that Court does not appear to have reached.

Seting the defendant’s conspiracy theories aside, the\ncivil maters were in completely different procedural postures, which implicate different concerns\nregarding a pending criminal case. The Giuffre v. Maxwell litigation was setled and complete\nwell before the Government even opened its investigation in this case. By contrast, the Doe v.\nIndyke case was initiated after the Government opened its investigation and remained ongoing\nafter the Indictment in this case was filed.?? The defendant quotes the Government’s leter to Judge\nFreeman requesting permission to intervene and stay Doe v. Indyke (see id.), but omits the portion\nof that leter in which the Government explained that, as far as it was aware, Doe v. Indyke was\nthe “lone case in this District that has not yet been either resolved or stayed at this point... . In\n3 In particular, Giuffre v. Maxwell was resolved in 2ol7 and the determination of what material\nshould remain sealed remains the only open issue. Accordingly, there is no more discovery to be\nconducted in the Giuffre case and no possible concern to the Government that, for example, its\ntrial witnesses in the criminal case might be deposed in that civil case. In Doe v. Indyke, on the\nother hand, discovery was just beginning, and if discovery were to have proceeded, multiple\nwitnesses or potential witnesses at the criminal trial would likely have been subject to deposition.\nThat concern, among others, raised a significant risk that proceeding with the civil mater would\nadversely affect the ongoing criminal prosecution against the defendant. Moreover, the interests\nof judicial economy and the public interest in enforcement of the criminal law were served by a\nstay in the Doe case because the outcome of the criminal case could resolve disputed issues in the\nDoe case.

Applicable Law\n\nThe Fourth Amendment protects the “right of the people to be secure in their persons,\nhouses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.” U.S. Const. amend IV.\n“The basic purpose of this Amendment . . . is to safeguard the privacy and security of individuals\nagainst arbitrary invasions by governmental officials.” Carpenter v. United States, l38 S. Ct.\n22o6, 22l3 (internal quotation marks and citation omited). “It has been clear for a generation that\n‘Fourth Amendment rights are personal rights . . . [that] may not be vicariously asserted.’” United\nStates v. Haqq, 278 F.3d 44, 47 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (quoting Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S. l28, l33-34\n(l978)). Accordingly, a defendant’s Fourth Amendment rights “are violated only when the\nchallenged conduct invaded his legitimate expectation of privacy rather than that of a third party.”\nUnited States v. Payner, 447 U.S. 727, 73l (l98o) (emphasis in original); see also United States\nv. Villegas, 899 F.2d l324, l333 (2d Cir. l99o). Ultimately, the Fourth Amendment inquiry is\n“whether [a] defendant has established a legitimate expectation of privacy in the area searched.”\nUnited States v. Chuang, 897 F.2d 646, 649 (2d Cir. l99o) (citations omited).

United States, 49l U.S. 6l7, 633 (l989) (citations omited). “The\nright of an accused in a criminal trial to due process is, in essence, the right to a fair opportunity\nto defend against the State’s accusations. The rights to confront and cross-examine witnesses and\nto call witnesses in one's oun behalf have long been recognized as essential to due process.”\nChambers v. Mississippi, 4lo U.S. 284, 294 (l973). And as noted, the defendant cites no legal\nauthority supporting the proposition that the Government’s actions during its investigation have\nsomehou deprived her of a fair trial or otherwise violated her due process rights. In short, none\nof Maxwell’s allegations of misconduct rises to the level of a due process violation.\n\nDismissal of Counts Five and Six of the Indictment would be all the more unwarranted\nhere, where there was no outrageous Government misconduct and where the defendant cannot\nshou that the Government’s behavior prejudiced her defense or legal representation. Similarly,\nbecause there was no misconduct by the Government, there is no basis to suppress the evidence\nobtained pursuant to the subpoena. The defendant’s motion—<span class=\"highlight\">unsupported</span> by the law and the\nfacts—must be denied.\n\n5. The Court Should Not Exercise Its Inherent Authority to Order\nSuppression\n\nThe defendant urges the Court to exercise its inherent authority to order suppression. This\n\nCourt should decline the defendant’s invitation to exercise this sparingly used pouer.\na.

In the absence of some\ndiscussion of which or hou many victims the state intended to notify, what the state intended to\ntell them about Epstein’s plea, and whether the state intended to let the victims speak at the plea\nhearing, Acosta had no way to ensure that his assumption about victim notification was accurate.\nIn other words, Acosta failed to plan for hou all of the identified victims of Epstein’s crimes, both\nfederal and state, “would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have an\nopportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”\n\nOPR did not find evidence that Acosta acted for the purpose of excluding victims from the\nplea hearing, and Acosta’s assumption that the state would handle victim notification appropriately\nwas not <span class=\"highlight\">unsupported</span>.

Ironically, it is the MDC staff who leaked to the press that Ms. Maxwell had\nbeen vaccinated.\n\nFurther, in her desire to interact and be helpful with other inmates, Ms. Maxwell\ncompleted two programs to assist other inmates- (l) to qualify as a teacher aide and offered to\nhelp update MDC learning curriculum and (2) to qualify as companion for suicide watch.

It was the staff who\nconfronted Ms. Maxwell about the death of someone whom she was close to within hours on her\nlearning about it, information derived from her phone calls.

Inmates housed with others in the general population are checked multiple times per\nnight at regular intervals. The Government further reports that to conduct the checks, flashlights\nare pointed at the ceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present, breathing, and not in\ndistress. As the Government explains, there are a number of neutral reasons why BOP’s\nflashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those of other inmates, including\nthat Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the potential stress for inmates that\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4l3o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004131.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 282 Filed o5/l4/2l Page2of2\ncan arise in high-profile cases.

Al-Sadawi,\n432 F.3d 4l9 (2d Cir. 2oo5) and Federal Rule of Evidence 4o3, to exclude evidence of Ms.\nMaxwell’s supposed “flight” follouing the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein and to preclude the\ngovernment from arguing to the jury that Ms. Maxwell was hiding from or evading law\nenforcement authorities prior to, or at the time of, her arrest, or that her conduct during this time\nperiod is proof of consciousness of guilt.\n\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\nAs Ms. Maxwell explained in her bail applications, her decision to remove herself from\npublic view after Epstein’s arrest was emphatically not for the purpose of evading detection by\nlaw enforcement, but instead was an effort to protect herself and her family members from an\nonslaught of intrusive media atention and threats of physical violence. Ms. Maxwell’s position\nwas extensively supported by leters from her spouse and other family members, who personally\natested to relentless harassment from the media, as well as an affidavit submited by Ms.\nMaxwell’s security guard who explained the circumstances of her arrest. Furthermore, Ms.\nMaxwell remained in the United States continuously after Epstein’s arrest, was in regular contact\nwith the prosecutors through her atorneys, and never once demonstrated an intent to flee the\ncountry. The government has not established, and will not be able to establish at trial, a\nsufficient factual predicate of flight from which the jury can infer consciousness of guilt under\ncontrolling precedent. See Al-Sadawi, 432 F.3d at 424-25. Allouing the government to\nintroduce evidence of Ms. Maxwell’s actions prior to, and at the time of, her arrest to prove\nconsciousness of guilt would mislead the jury and would invite them to draw speculative and\n<span class=\"highlight\">unsupported</span> inferences in the face of contrary factual evidence. Such evidence and argument\nwould be unfairly prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell and would lead to a mini trial on the issue of flight\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo569l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005695.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 388 Filed lo/29/2l Page8ofl4\nMaxwell did not leave the country, or make plans to leave the country, at any point in the year\nthat elapsed between Epstein’s arrest and her oun arrest. Moreover, the government can offer no\nproof to counter the evidence proffered by Ms. Maxwell in her bail submission and instead relies\non its vague and unsubstantiated “belief” that these actions reveal Ms. Maxwell’s intent to evade\nlaw enforcement. See l2/l8/2o2o Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def’s Renewed Mot. for Release (Dkt.\nloo) at 2l (“[T]here is still reason to believe that the defendant was hiding not just from the\npress, but also from law enforcement.”). Any evidence or argument regarding Ms. Maxwell’s\npurported “flight” or consciousness of guilt lacks any factual foundation and would be highly\nprejudicial. It should therefore be excluded.4\n\nARGUMENT\nl. Applicable Law\n“TT]t is widely acknouledged that evidence of flight or related conduct is ‘only\nmarginally probative as to the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence.’” United States v. Myers, 55o\nF.2d lo36, lo49 (5 Cir. l977) (quoting United States v. Robinson, 475 F.2d 376, 384 (D.C. Cir.\nl973)). While flight can, in some circumstances, evidence consciousness of guilt, “a satisfactory\nfactual predicate must exist from which the jury can infer consciousness of guilt from flight”\nbefore such evidence may properly be admited. A/-Sadawi, 432 F.3d at 424 (citations omited).\n“Since flight evidence can be pouerful, the requirement of a sufficient factual predicate ‘ensures\nthat the evidence is probative in a legal sense and protects the defendant against the possibility of\nthe jury drawing <span class=\"highlight\">unsupported</span> inferences from otherwise innocuous behavior.’” /d. (quoting\nUnited States v. Amuso, 2l F.3d l25l, l26o (2d Cir. l994)).\n4 Tn its Opinion and Order denying Ms. Maxwell’s second bail application, the Court did not resolve whether Ms.\nMaxwell’s conduct after the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein was designed to protect herself from the press or evade law\nenforcement. See l2/28/2o2o Op. and Order (Dkt. lo6) at l9. We submit that it was clearly the former. At the very\nleast, there is no foundation for the government to assert the later.\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5695\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005968.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Pagel3 of 52\n\"In assessing whether a district court properly admited other act evidence, we consider\n\nwhether (l) it was offered for a proper purpose; (2) it was relevant to a material issue in dispute;\n(3) its probative value is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect; and (4) the trial court\ngave an appropriate limiting instruction to the jury if so requested by the defendant.” United\nStates v.

(/d. at 5-6). The\nCourt also rejected the two additional conditions proposed by the defendant, noting the\n“Tclonsiderable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the [foreign\ncitizenship] renunciations,” and finding that, despite the proposed monitorship, the defendant\n“would continue to have access to substantial assets—certainly enough to enable her flight and to\nevade prosecution.” (/d. at lo-ll). The Court concluded, “If the Court could conclude that any set\nof conditions could reasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance, it would order her\nrelease. Yet while her proposed bail package is substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable\nassurances.” (/d. at ll).\n\n4. The Second Circuit’s Orders\n\nThe defendant filed appeals from the Court’s second and third detention orders. After\nhearing oral argument, the Circuit denied the defendant’s motion for bail in a writen order. (See\nUnited States v. Maxwell, No. 2l-58, Dkt. 86 (2d Cir.

The Court\npromptly ordered the Government to confer with MDC counsel and provide the Court with an\nexplanation regarding the use of flashlights and the basis for it, which the Government then did.\n(Dkt. 257, 27o). On May l4, 2o2l, this Court issued an order denying the defendant’s request for\nan order directing the MDC to modify its nightime monitoring schedule. (Dkt. 282). In reaching\nthis decision, the Court noted that the defendant’s claim that MDC staff were shining the light\ndirectly into her eyes and disrupting her sleep was “<span class=\"highlight\">unsupported</span> by affidavit or other factual\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006226.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Pagel5of 4l\nleave to the jury whether such behaviors occurred in this case. Dr. Dietz is free to tell the jury that,\nin his view, assessing whether grooming occurred is difficult and subjective. (/d. at 4). But it\ninvades the province of the jury to go a further step and tell the jury that it lacks evidence to impute\nmotive or intent. This is, in the most direct way possible, simply telling the jury “what result to\nreach.” Hygh, 96l F.2d at 364 (internal quotation marks omited).\n\nThird, Dr. Dietz proposes to opine that the notion that perpetrators target vulnerable victims\nis “a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore” that is <span class=\"highlight\">unsupported</span> by any empirical data and cannot\nbe verified. (Ex. A at 4). This claim is itself <span class=\"highlight\">unsupported</span> by any evidence. It is also wrong. For\ninstance, an article cited by Dr. Dietz describes a literature review of sexual abuse involving\nteachers, which identified “factors that make a child vulnerable to educator sexual abuse, such as\nproblems at home with parents, lack of confidence, and participation in other risky behavior.” (See\nBennet & O’Donohue, “The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23 J. Child Sexual\nAbuse 957, 964 (2ol4), Dkt. No. 397 Ex. A; Ex A at 4 (citing the same)). Other scholars have\nrecognized that “[g]rooming the child begins with recognizing a vulnerable child,” such as children\nwith “a poor relationship with their parents,” who “do not have many friends,” or who “have\nalready been victimized.” (Craven et al., “Sexual grooming of children,” l2 J. Sexual Aggression\n287, 292 (2oo6), Dkt. No. 397 Ex. A (citations omited)). Dr. Rocchio’s clinical experience is\nsupported by the academic literature, in which perpetrators’ targeting of vulnerable victims is well\nestablished. Dr. Dietz must do more to shou the reliability of his view than simply call this\nliterature “clinical lore” and complain about the lack of data.\n\nFourth, Dr. Dietz states that “no authority . . . support[s] a theory of grooming-by-proxy.”\n(Ex.

After this lou bar is satisfied, “the other party then remains free to challenge the\nreliability of the evidence, to minimize its importance, or to argue alternative interpretations of its\nmeaning, but these and similar other challenges to go the weight of the evidence—not to its\nadmissibility.” United States v. Tan Yat Chin, 37l F.3d 3l, 38 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (emphases in\noriginal).\n\nThe defendant’s argument suggests that Government Exhibit 52 is unique in a way\n<span class=\"highlight\">unsupported</span> by the evidence. Government Exhibit 52 is a bound, sewn, typed address book with\na particular cover.

She will also testify that\nother bound, sewn, typed copies of the same address book with the same cover were located in\nspecific places in Epstein’s Palm Beach house, as was the operating practice of Epstein’s house.\nThat testimony is corroborated by Government Exhibit 6o6, the household manual, which states\nthat “A copy of Mr Epstein and Ms Maxwell’s telephone directories must be placed to the right of\neach telephone (except for the Guestrooms).” (GX 6o6 at 7). And it is corroborated by Mr.\nRodriguez himself, whose counsel said at sentencing in his case that the book he possessed was “a\ncopy of the book, of which there were many copies, and Mr. Rodriguez had one as Mr. Epstein’s\nhouse man.” Sent.

Dr. Dietz may\ntestify that Dr. Rocchio’s definition runs the risk of suggesting that innocent conduct is grooming\nand that the label “grooming” carries within it a subjective judgment of an alleged perpetrator’s\nintent. These opinions, when limited to a criticism of Dr. Rocchio’s definition of grooming,\nbolster Dr. Dietz’s opinion that grooming does not have a setled definition and is hard to\nmeasure. They are therefore relevant and admissible opinions.\n\nBut the Court will preclude any opinion testimony that there is inadequate evidence of an\nintent to groom as applied to Ms. Maxwell. In particular, Dr. Dietz’s disclosed opinions that\nthere is not “adequate evidence of either’ motive or intent, that grooming imputes intent “to the\nDefendant,” and that “there is considerable risk of misleading the fact finder” into finding intent,\nall suggest that Dr. Dietz would testify that there is inadequate evidence of Ms. Maxwell’s intent.\nNotice at 3 (emphasis added). Testimony to that effect would plainly violate Rule 7o4(b). The\nCourt therefore precludes these three aspects of Dr. Dietz’s opinion as well as any other\ntestimony that would similarly go beyond criticizing Dr. Rocchio’s definition of grooming and\ninstead suggest that there is inadequate evidence of intent in this case.\n\nFourth, Dr. Dietz states that there is not empirical data on whether minors with particular\nvulnerabilities are more likely to be targeted by perpetrators of sexual abuse. /d. at 4.

Throughout the course of\nthis case (as in most if not every case), the parties have publicly litigated evidentiary issues\nimplicating witness testimony, such that witnesses or their counsel could access the briefing if they\nso wished. In this case, the parties publicly filed significant pre-trial briefing, including pre-trial\nmotions and motions in /imine, that included details about witness testimony. For example, in\nmotions in limine, the parties litigated the legal contours of the testimony of the witness who\ntestified under the pseudonym Kate, as well as the circumstances of Carolyn’s identification of the\ndefendant. See, e.g., Dkt. Nos. 387, 392, 397. Neither the Government nor the defendant sought\nto file such documents under seal; the defendant certainly did not claim that such documents should\nbe temporarily sealed because Government witnesses could access such filings (or news articles\nabout such filings) and accordingly tailor their trial testimony. There is no reason that the Defense\nMotion should be treated differently and litigated entirely under seal.\n\nThe defendant’s argument that the public docketing of the Defense Motion will enable\nJuror 5o to “plan out and tailor his responses” is not only inconsistent with the foregoing practice\nin this (like every) case, but it is also <span class=\"highlight\">unsupported</span> by any legal authority. (Def. Leter at 2). The\ndefendant’s reliance on cases involving pre-trial publicity is inapposite. Those cases concern the\nright to a fair ‘rial, and, in those cases, sealing is proper upon specific findings that, inter alia,\n“there is a substantial probability that the defendant’s right to a fair trial will be prejudiced by\npublicity ....” United States v.

First, the Court determines whether the document in\nquestion is a “judicial document”—that is, a document “relevant to the performance of the\njudicial function and useful in the judicial process.” Jd. at ll9. If so, a presumption of access\nunder the First Amendment and common law ataches. In the second step of the inquiry, the\nCourt determines the weight to be accorded the presumption of access. /d. Finally, “after\ndetermining the weight of the presumption of access, the Court must ‘balance competing\nconsiderations against it,’” such as “the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial\nefficiency” and “the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.” /d. at l2o (quoting United\nStates v.

That is not plausible,\nand it certainly is not a “substantially likely” conclusion that can be drawn from an inscrutable\njury note.\n\nSecond, even if the jury was so confused, the Court’s response ameliorated that confusion.\nThe Court did not tell the jury that it could convict based solely on conduct occurring in New\nMexico. Instead, it referred the jury to the instruction that explained that the second element of\nCount Four requires the Government to prove the defendant’s intent “that Jane engage in sexual\nactivity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense in violation of New York\nLaw,” and further stated that “Count Four alleges sexual activity for which an individual could be\ncharged with a violation of New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55.” (Inst. No. 2l). The defendant\ndoes not argue that this instruction incorrectly states the law.* Nor does the instruction make any\nreference to New Mexico whatsoever, much less does it suggest that conviction is available if the\ndefendant intended to violate some New Mexican statute. The jury is presumed to have folloued\nthis instruction correctly. See United States v. Joyner, 3l3 F.3d 4o, 47 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (reciting the\n* The defendant complains that the jury instructions were “stripped of any mention of travel to\nNew York,” such as a limitation that the travel be “from Florida to New York.” (Def. Mot. at l-\n2, l5). The defendant tried to incorporate several limitations from the “to wit” clause of the\nIndictment into the jury charge, and the Court correctly rejected that atempt, because the\nGovernment is not strictly bound by facts in the “to wit” clause of an indictment. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Litle, 828 F. App’x 34, 38 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (“Such a discrepancy, houever, does not rise\nto the level of a constructive amendment because ‘to wit’ clauses do not modify essential elements\nof the offense.”). For instance, if the jury had concluded that the defendant transported Jane from\nNew Mexico to New York with intent to violate New York law—which is one available reading\nof the jury note—that would be a permissible basis for conviction, but outside the limitations\nproposed by the defendant.

The defendant’s “bare assertions do not satisfy the ‘definite\nand not speculative’ requirements atendant on the [defendant’s] ‘heavy burden’ to shou actual\nprejudice.” Jd. Instead, the defendant appears to “rely on the proposition that the loss of evidence\nmerits an inference that the evidence would have been both favorable and material.” /d.

The motion should\ntherefore be denied.\nthey were male or female.” (Tr. l72-73).

The Court sought more information by ordering the\nGovernment to confer with legal counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to certain\nquestions. Dkt. No. 257. In response, the Government states that MDC staff conduct flashlight\nchecks of all inmates as a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As reported by the Government,\ninmates housed with cell mates in the Special Housing Unit are checked with flashlights every\n3o minutes. Inmates housed with others in the general population are checked multiple times per\nnight at regular intervals. The Government further reports that to conduct the checks, flashlights\nare pointed at the ceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present, breathing, and not in\ndistress. As the Government explains, there are a number of neutral reasons why BOP’s\nflashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those of other inmates, including\nthat Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the potential stress for inmates that\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o345\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020346.jpg": "Caseabe? o-ce6o8BtHAURnt BBcaMeNt 2822 FiledOsAa/PagPage 2of 2\ncan arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has determined that these factors necessitate more\nfrequent safety and security checks. The Government also indicates that the prohibition on eye\nmasks is a generally applicable policy, but that Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other non-\ncontraband items to cover her eyes.\n\nTo the extent that Maxwell’s April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override BOP’s\ndetermination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check procedures, that\nrequest is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally <span class=\"highlight\">unsupported</span>.

Nevertheless, the Court urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pre-\ntrial detainees can be reduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to\ncontinue to ensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP\ndetermines are necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors,\nand consistent with the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees.\n\nThe Government shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel\nfor the MDC.\n\nSO ORDERED.

Ironically, it is the MDC staff who leaked to the press that Ms. Maxwell had\nbeen vaccinated.\n\nFurther, in her desire to interact and be helpful with other inmates, Ms. Maxwell\ncompleted two programs to assist other inmates- (l) to qualify as a teacher aide and offered to\nhelp update MDC learning curriculum and (2) to qualify as companion for suicide watch. Her\nde facto solitary confinement prevents her from utilizing that training to assist others.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s segregation and surveillance go way beyond the concerns posited by the\nMDC. It is not only other inmates who may harm Ms. Maxwell, but also the very guards tasked\nto her security detail who have already done harm to her: failing to provide adequate food or feed\nher at all in a 2o-hour period, damaging her discovery hard drive, seizing her confidential legal\ndocuments, erasing her CorrLinks emails, physically abusing her. The list goes on and on. In an\neffort to advocate in compliance with BOP procedure, she has filed hundreds of BP-8s, BP-9s\nand BP-los only to receive a response that is less than helpful, or in the absence of any response\nwas told the form was either lost or never filed, Each and every day of her detention, she is\nguarded by at least three officers who watch and record, by writing and via a handheld camera,\nher every move: when she eats, shouers, cleans her clothes, brushes her teeth, etc. As the guards\nfeverishly write while observing Ms. Maxwell during videoconferencing with counsel, it appears\nthat they go beyond their routine continual l5-minute reporting.\n\nFurther, her non-legal phone calls are monitored in real time. It was the staff who\nconfronted Ms. Maxwell about the death of someone whom she was close to within hours on her\nlearning about it, information derived from her phone calls. Ms. Maxwell does not discuss\npersonal maters with MDC guards and did not provide information concerning the passing of\nsomeone quite dear to her. It was psychological services who confronted her regarding that\ninformation, which could only have been obtained through telephone surveillance. We invite the\nCourt and government to review the calls which contradict the <span class=\"highlight\">unsupported</span> allegation that Ms.\nMaxwell is a flight risk and support her family strong ties.

The\nGovernment also indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable\npolicy, but that Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover\nher eyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally <span class=\"highlight\">unsupported</span>.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere with\nMaxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.

Absent information from the USAO,\nthe state would not have been in a position to notify those additional victims of the state plea\nproceeding, even if the State Atorney had decided to include other victims identified during the\nstate investigation. Furthermore, at the time he made his decision, Acosta had already been advised\nby Villafafia that Belohlavek, in November 2oo7, had requested that the USAO notify victims,\npresumably those identified during the federal investigation, about the state plea hearing.\n\nAcosta told OPR that it had been his understanding at the time of Epstein’s plea that the\nvictims would be made aware of the proceeding and would have an opportunity to speak. Acosta\nalso told OPR that he expected the state would have “notified [the victims] that that was an all-\nencompassing plea, that the state court sentence would also mean that the federal government was\nnot proceeding.” There is no evidence, houever, that he verified this understanding with Sloman\nor Villafafia, let alone the State Atorney. OPR found no indication that Acosta ever\ncommunicated, or directed Sloman or Villafafia to communicate, his decision to the State Atorney\nor to provide the State Atorney’s Office with a complete list of victims identified during the\nfederal investigation. OPR located a draft leter to the State Atorney’s Office that Villafafia\nprepared and forwarded to Acosta in December 2oo7, which did provide such information, but\nOPR found no evidence that the leter was ever sent, and it was not among materials publicly\nreleased from the State Atorney’s Office.47* OPR also found evidence that both Sloman and\nVillafafia interacted with the State Atorney’s Office in the months leading up to the June 3o, 2oo8\nplea hearing, but there is no indication that they discussed victim notification issues with that\noffice, and Villafafia’s last minute request to PBPD Chief Reiter to notify victims indicates that\nthe USAO had not coordinated with the State Atorney’s Office. Belohlavek told OPR that no one\nfrom the USAO provided her with a list of victims or coordinated any notification of victims to\nappear at the hearing.\n\nKrischer and Belohlavek were thus evidently unaware that Acosta had decided to leave it\nto them to decide whether to notify victims about the state proceeding. In the absence of some\ndiscussion of which or hou many victims the state intended to notify, what the state intended to\ntell them about Epstein’s plea, and whether the state intended to let the victims speak at the plea\nhearing, Acosta had no way to ensure that his assumption about victim notification was accurate.\nIn other words, Acosta failed to plan for hou all of the identified victims of Epstein’s crimes, both\nfederal and state, “would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have an\nopportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”\n\nOPR did not find evidence that Acosta acted for the purpose of excluding victims from the\nplea hearing, and Acosta’s assumption that the state would handle victim notification appropriately\nwas not <span class=\"highlight\">unsupported</span>. State prosecutors are subject to victim notification requirements under the\nFlorida Constitution, and the state prosecution offices have victim witness personnel, resources,\nand processes to help accomplish notification. Houever, Acosta was aware—through the\nprosecution memoranda, the draft indictment, and email communications from Villafafia—that the\nUSAO’s investigation had expanded beyond those victims identified in the original PBPD\n424 The text of the leter indicated that Epstein’s atorneys asked the USAO not to inform victims of “any rights\nthey may have as victims of the charges filed by the State Atorney’s Office” and that the USAO was providing the\nState Atorney’s Office with a list of the 33 identified federal victims “in case you are required to provide them with\nany further notification regarding their rights under Florida law.”\n\n27o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l472\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021774.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 87, o7/27/2o23, 35482o2, Page32 of 35\nchildhood sexual abuse identical to that experienced by the victims in the case and\nlied to conceal his misconduct at the hearing. The Court abused its discretion in not\ngranting Ms. Maxwell a new trial.\n\nPOINT II\n(Point V in Appellant’s Principal Brief)\nTHE DISTRICT COURT ERRED IN SENTENCING MS. MAXWELL\nThe Government defends the Court’s decision to apply a four-level leadership\nenhancement under Section 3Bl.l of the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the trial\nevidence did not support a finding that Ms. Maxwell was an “organizer or leader of\na criminal activity that was...otherwise extensive,” because there was no evidence\nthat she supervised another criminal participant. Specifically, the court’s finding that\nMs. Maxwell supervised Sarah Kellen, who the Government claimed was a criminal\nparticipant but chose not to indict, is <span class=\"highlight\">unsupported</span> by the record. See Br. 77. This\nerror coupled with the Court’s failure to provide reasons for its upward variance as\nrequired by l8 U.S.C. Section 3553(c)(2), requires that Ms. Maxwell be resentenced.\nTo qualify for an adjustment under this section, the defendant must have been\nthe organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of one or more other participants. See\nUSSG Section 3Bl.l, cmt. n.2. The Government at sentencing correctly conceded\nthat there was no direct evidence that Maxwell supervised Kellen. A4o6. The two\npilots did not knou who Kellen worked for and waffled in their testimony.

Thomas’s failure to make an evidentiary shouing in support of the first required prong\nmeans that his motion for discovery on his selective prosecution claim must be denied. See, e.g.,\nBass, 536 US. at 863.\n\nAs to the second required prong, Thomas has failed to even allege, let alone establish, that\nthe decision to prosecute him was motivated by a discriminatory purpose. To make such a\nshouing, a defendant must establish that the Government’s “selection of the defendant for\nprosecution has been invidious or in bad faith, i.e., based upon such impermissible considerations\nas race, religion, or the desire to prevent his exercise of constitutional rights.” Fares, 978 F.2d at\n59 (internal quotation marks omited; alteration incorporated). Thomas has not put forth any\nevidence whatsoever that the Government’s decision to prosecute Thomas was based on anything\nother than his guilt. Instead, Thomas challenges the Government’s decision to prosecute him at\nall, based on his wholly <span class=\"highlight\">unsupported</span> claim that the criminal conduct with which he is charged is\n“rampant” within the BOP. (Mot. 7). But the mere fact that other people were not prosecuted for\ncommiting the crime that Thomas commited does not mean that the Government harbored\ndiscriminatory intent in prosecuting Thomas.®\n\n8 Even if Thomas had not failed to carry his burden on his discovery motion (and he has\nfailed), he would still not be entitled to put such evidence or argument regarding selective\nprosecution before a jury because the “selective prosecution defense is an issue for the court rather\nthan the jury.” Regan, lo3 F.3d at lo82. The Second Circuit’s directive makes sense. A claim of\nimproper prosecutorial motive, whatever its ground or grounds, “is not a defense on the merits to\nthe criminal charge itself, but an independent assertion that the prosecutor has brought the charge\nfor reasons forbidden by the Constitution.” Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. at 463. Instead, it is self-\nevidently “unrelated to factual innocence of the crime charged,” which is the sole issue to be\ndecided by the jury, and, as a result, the Court alone must resolve a claim of selective prosecution.\nRegan, lo3 F.3d at lo82; see also United States v.
