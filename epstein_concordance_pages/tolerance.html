Though Thomas claims that BOP supervisors may have acquiesced in his submission of\nfalse count slips in this case, and that other BOP employees have submited false documents in\nother circumstances, he has not presented any evidence that those officers differed from him in\nany protected characteristic—for example, that they were of a different race, sex, or ethnicity.\nSee Motion at lo. Nor has Thomas put forward any evidence of a discriminatory motive for his\nprosecution.\n\nAccordingly, Thomas’ motion to compel the Government to disclose evidence that the\nsubmission of false count slips was widespread and tolerated at the BOP, and for discovery\nrelated to selective prosecution, is DENIED.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons stated, Thomas’ motion to compel is DENIED. The Clerk of Court is\ndirected to terminate the motion at ECF No. 33.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nDated: June 9, 2o2o O}-\nNew York, New York ——XNALISA TORRES\n9 United States District Judge\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22lo5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023077.jpg": "I do think it’s important to look back on this, and try to be in the\nshoes of the thought process in 2oo6 and ’o7 when trafficking\nprosecutions were fairly new, when . . . more so than today, some\njurors may have looked at this as prostitution, and . . . [a] judge’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">tolerance</span> for victim shaming may have . . . caused more hesitation\non the part of victims... .&\nFinally, Acosta told OPR that a state-based resolution offered more flexibility in fashioning\na sentence, because he believed prosecutors would have difficulty persuading a federal district\ncourt in the Southern District of Florida to approve a federal plea for a stipulated binding sentence\nthat differed from the otherwise applicable federal sentencing guidelines range.°*\nIn summarizing his thinking at the time, Acosta told OPR,\nThe way the mater came to the office was, the state wasn’t doing\nenough. It didn’t provide for prison time. It didn’t provide for\nregistration, and then you had the restitution issue. There were legal\nissues .... There were witness issues. And... we could go to trial\n...and we may or may not prevail. Alternatively, we could look at\na pre-indictment resolution, and at various points, the office went\nback and forth between a federal pre-indictment resolution, and a\nstate pre-indictment resolution.\nAcosta told OPR that, in the end, “there was a preference for deferring to the state” because, in\npart, the facts of the Epstein case at the time appeared to constitute solicitation or prostitution\nrather than trafficking, and a federal prosecution would be “uncharted territory.” Acosta explained\nthat he did not view it as problematic to defer resolution of the case to the state, although as the\nEpstein case played out, the federal role became “more intrusive” than he had anticipated, because\nthe defense tried to get the state to “circumvent and undermine” the outcome.\nAtorney’s Office could have proceeded against Epstein by way of an information, but decided to go into the grand\njury because the State Atorney’s Office “didn’t like the case” and wanted “political cover” for declining the case or\nproceeding on a lesser charge.\n83 Menchel told OPR, houever, that the federal judges in West Palm Beach were highly regarded and were\ngenerally viewed as “pro-prosecution.”\nom Acosta said that “dismissing a number of counts and then doing a [R]ule ll is not something that [South\nFlorida federal district] judges tend to do.” Other subjects also told OPR that the federal judges in the Southern District\nof Florida were generally considered averse to pleas that bound them on sentencing, commonly referred to as “Rule\nll(c) pleas.”\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) allous the parties to agree on a specific sentence as part of\na plea agreement. The court is required to impose that sentence if the court accepts the plea agreement; if the court\ndoes not accept the agreed upon plea and sentence, the agreement is void. Villafafia told OPR that Rule ll(c) pleas\nwere “uncommon” in the Southern District of Florida, as the “judges do not like to be told . . . what sentence to\nimpose.” Menchel similarly told OPR that the USAO viewed federal judges in the Southern District of Florida as\naverse to Rule ll(c) pleas, although Menchel had negotiated such pleas. Villafafia told OPR that she had never offered\na Rule ll(c) plea in any of her cases and had no experience with such pleas.\n39\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o77", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032232.jpg": "Alprazolam, side effects, drug interactions, overdose, dosage Page l of 6\nExecutive Recovery Women Withdrawal Symptoms\nExecutive Treatment For Women Treatment Doctors, Nurses & Other Hee\nFor the Professional You Online ASAP!\nBeat dad FORTS » clinical tria ae\nsearch|\nBrand name:\nXanax &\nPronounced: ZAN-ax\nGeneric name: Alprazolam\nOther brand name: Xanax XR\n. .
