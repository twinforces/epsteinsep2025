As to “hindsight bias,” Dr. Dietz\nopines:\n\ne Hindsight bias, or “the tendency to overestimate hou predictable or foreseeable an\n\nevent is after being informed about the outcome of an event,” exists and has been found\nin various experiments.

A at l).!!\n\nMoreover, there is specific reason to doubt the reliability of Dr. Loftus’s opinions as to\nfalse memory formation. A number of Dr. Loftus’s opinions were tested and rejected in United\nStates v. Libby, 46l F. Supp. 2d at 8-l8. There, the defendant relied on Dr. Loftus’s research\nregarding alleged juror misperceptions of the reliability of eyewitness identifications, presented in\na 2oo6 article. See id. at lo-ll (citing, eg., R. Schmechel, T. O’Toole, C. Easterly, & E.\nLoftus, Beyond the Ken? Testing Jurors’ Understanding of Eyewitness Reliability Evidence, 46\nJurimetrics J. l77-2l4 (2oo6)). The district court rejected such research, concluding that “the\ndesign of these surveys demonstrates their limited value.” Libby, 46l F. Supp. 2d at ll. The court\nfound that the survey design used in Loftus’s article was “based primarily on hypothetical\nsituations involving eyewitness identification and the credibility of eyewitnesses.” Jd. The court\nalso found—and Dr. Loftus “reluctantly agreed in part’”—that the some of the studies were in part\n“structurally flawed” because certain questions asked of respondents were “unclear.” J/d. at l6.\nThe Government, moreover, understands that much of Dr. Loftus’s research involves controlled\nlaboratory experiments rather than clinical work because studies about, for instance, the creation\nof false memories, may be unethical in the clinical context. See, e.g. Elizabeth F. Loftus, UCI\n'l While the Government’s expert notice for Dr. Rocchio contained similar language, it also\nexplained that Dr. Rocchio was testifying based on her “extensive clinical experience treating\nindividuals who suffered s]exual abuse and trauma in childhood and adolescence, as well as Dr.\nRocchio’s experience conducting forensic psychological evaluations of people who have\nexperienced sexual abuse and trauma.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. A at 2). The Government also produced\nits notes from its interviews with Dr. Rocchio simultaneously with its expert notice. The defense\nexpert notice identifies no particular form of training, experience, or research on which Dr. Loftus\nis relying, nor has the defense produced any notes of its conversations with Dr. Loftus.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6246\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006247.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Page 36 of 4l\nSchool of Social Ecology, htps://faculty.sites.uci.edu/eloftus/ (“[Dr. Loftus’s] experiments reveal\nhou memories can be changed by things that we are told.”). Such research may thus be\ninapplicable to the facts of this case.\n\nTo the extent that the Court believes that the defense may have carried its burden of\nestablishing the reliability of Dr. Loftus’s opinions on false memory formation, the Government\nrespectfully requests a Daubert hearing to test the reliability of these opinions.”\n\nEven if any such opinions are reliable, houever, they should not be admited absent an\naffirmative shouing of “fit” for this case. See Fed. R. Evid. 7o2 advisory commitee n. (stating\nthat “generalized” expert testimony must “‘fit’ the facts of the case”). For example, testimony\nabout the ways in which “false and/or distorted memories can be created as a result of post-event\ninformation and occurrences, suggestion, influence, or the like” is irrelevant to this case. At that\nlevel of generality, it has no obvious “fit” to the facts of this case. There is no evidence that\nwhatever “occurrences, suggestion, influence, or the like” about which Dr. Loftus intends to testify\nhappened to any witness in this case, much less in a manner that reliably affects memory or would\nbe probative to the jury. Thus, as with Dr. Dietz, any reliable opinions Dr. Loftus seeks to offer\non false memory formation should be limited to those as to which there is a clear evidentiary\npredicate establishing their “fit” to the case.\n\nAs with Dr. Dietz, see footnote 9, supra, if a hearing is necessary, the Government similarly\nrequests that it be conducted after receiving the defense response and after all necessary Rule 26.2\ndisclosures have been made.\na2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6247\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006279.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page ll of 29\nPathways to False Allegations lo5\nIn this situation, the controversy is not whether sexual content occurred but\nwhether consent for this sexual content occurred.\n\nThe final level of complexity regarding this pathway occurs in the\natempt of professionals involved in the case to accurately understand after\nthe fact the details of whatever consent process did or did not take place.\nBy its nature, this will generally be a “he said, she said” mater in which it is\nvery difficult to resolve conflicting claims. Houever, much can ride on the\nheuristics individuals use to resolve this indeterminate mater.\n\nA False Memory\n\nThe theory of repression, according to Freud (l9lo), posits that traumatic\nmemories can be pushed out of conscious awareness and essentially forgot-\nten for long periods of time. Though some psychologists argue there is a\nlack of empirical support for the theory of repression (Loftus, l993), many\npsychologists do believe that repression is a real process by which memo-\nries can be forgoten and later remembered (Boag, 2olo). One psychological\nprocess that may resemble repression is false memory.\n\nThe existence and prevalence of repressed memories is a source of\ncontroversy (McNally & Geraerts, 2oo9), and yet research does exist demon-\nstrating the successful implantation of fabricated memories. In one of the first\nstudies on the implantation of false memories, participants were given short\nnarratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives,\nand asked to try to remember these experiences (Loftus, Coan, & Pickrell,\nl996). Participants’ relatives were contacted and asked to provide childhood\nstories about the participants. Houever, researchers created one fabricated\nnarrative: The participant, at age 5 or 6, had been lost in a public place (e.g.\na shopping mall) for an extended period of time and eventually rescued.\nParticipants were encouraged to try to remember both true and fabricated\nevents over the course of several weeks. When participants were asked later\nwhether they recalled the events, nearly one-fourth of them reported having\nmemories of the fabricated event. Though some individuals reported remem-\nbering being lost only vaguely, others reported remembering vivid visual\ndetails and emotional experiences. Since this study, several researchers have\nsuccessfully replicated these results using different suggestive techniques\nand scenarios (e.g. Mazzoni, Loftus, Seitz, & Lynn, l999; Hyman & Billings,\nl998; Hyman & Pentland, l996; Garry, Manning, Loftus, & Sherman, l998).\nMany of the suggestive methods used in these experiments are similar to\nthose employed by some therapists during psychotherapy (Ofshe & Waters,\nl994, Pesant & Zadra, 2oo4).\n\nIt has been argued that suggestive therapeutic techniques could cause a\nclient to create a false traumatic memory (Loftus, l993). An example of this\ntype of suggestion would be for a therapist to conclude that the client shous\nsigns of abuse despite no memory of abuse, and thus the client should try\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6279\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006614.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page4of4\nPage 3\n\nAdditionally, the Government reiterates its August 5, 2o2o request for reciprocal discovery\nunder Fed.

Well, let's just focus on a few of those, if we might.\n\n6 What stands out in your mind with regard to\n\n7 experiments that you have done that have impacted the science\n\n8 of memory?\n\n9 A. I would say that one of the major contributions is the work\nlo that I and my collaborators have done on the misinformation\n\nll effect on shouing that after people see, say, a simulated crime\nl2 or a simulated accident, and they are exposed to some\n\nl3 misinformation about the accident or the crime that they saw,\nl4 that many people will incorporate that misinformation into\n\nl5 their memory and it causes an impairment in memory. False\n\nl6 swayed of the misinformation. It becomes their memory and\n\nl7 their memory becomes inaccurate.\n\nl8 One -- I guess you could call it a classic study,\n\nl9 because it's in many of the textbooks in psychology today is\n2o one in which we shou people a simulated accident, maybe a car\n2l goes through a stop sign that's controlling the intersection.\n22 And later on we expose our witnesses to misinformation that it\n23 was a yield sign. Many people will nou claim that they saw a\n24 yield sign instead of a stop sign. So they have succumbed to\n25 the misinformation in that new information that was presented\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool3972\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00013973.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 76l Filed o8/lo/22 Page ll4 of 246 24o9\nLCGVMAX3 Loftus — direct\n\nl to them and adopted it as their oun memory. And that study was\n2 published in l978.\n\n3 Q. Have you conducted any studies that have to do with\n\n4 language and hou language might affect memory?\n\na A. Yes. An example of that would be -- again, this is alsoa\n6 fairly widely cited study.\n\n7 We shoued people a simulated accident. Afterwards, we\n8 asked people about the speed of the vehicles involved in the\n\n9 accident. But different witnesses are questioned in different\nlo ways. So some witnesses are asked a question like, Hou fast\n\nll were the cars going when they smashed into each other? And\n\nl2 others are asked, Hou fast were the cars going when they hit\n\nl3 each other?\n\nl4 And we found that people estimated the speed as\n\nl5 greater if you used the word \"smashed\" than if you used the\n\nl6 word \"hit.\" Also we had found that if we use the smash word,\nl7 this leading kind of biased word, it affected what other things\nl8 that people remembered. Our witnesses were more likely to\n\nl9 remember, for example, broken glass that didn't exist if we had\n2o used that word smashed in questioning them.\n2l So that's an example of what you're asking about, the\n22 connection between language and memory.\n23 Q. In the course of your research and experience, are you\n24 aware of any experiments that have actually measured emotion\n25 and its impact on memory?\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool3973\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00013974.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 76l _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page ll5 of 246 24lo\nLCGVMAX3 Loftus — direct\n\nl A. Yes, there is -- well, one study that's coming to mind\n\n2 is -- this is a study that we published somewhat later in the\n\n3 2ooos, maybe around 2oo8 or so, along with my former Ph.D.\n\n4 student who is nou professor of psychology, Dr. Laney. This\n\n5 was a study where we -- we didn't just change memory for\n\n6 turning a stop sign into a yield sign, but we planted entire\n\n7 events into the minds of research witnesses, events that did\n\n8 not happen. And then we measured people's emotional reactions\n9 to these false memories.\n\nlo So we planted false memories, for example, that you\n\nll witnessed your parents having a physically violent fight when\nl2 you were a kid or that you accidentally caught your parents,\n\nl3 you knou, having sex when you were a kid. And once we\n\nl4 succeeded in planting these false memories and measured\n\nl5 people's emotional reactions, they were just as emotional about\nl6 these created memories as other individuals were who truly had\nl7 had those experiences. So the botom line there was that\n\nl8 emotion is no guarantee that you're dealing with an authentic\nl9 memory.\n2o Q. Professor Loftus, in devising a research project, do you\n2l need to gain approval from any organization or from your\n22 university to permit you to engage in that <span class=\"highlight\">experiment</span>?\n23 A. Yes, we do. Colleges and universities have human subjects,\n24 review commitees. And when we want to propose to do a study\n25 with humans, there are separate groups that review studies with\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool3974\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00013975.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 76l Filed o8/lo/22 Page ll6 of 246 24ll\nLCGVMAX3 Loftus — direct\n\nl animals, but I am proposing studies with humans. It goes\n\n2 through a process of review on the campus. And sometimes they\n3 ask you to make modifications in your procedure; other times\n\n4 they just outright give you the blessing to go ahead and do the\n5 study.\n\n6 Q. Is there a standard requirement that the <span class=\"highlight\">experiment</span> that\n\n7 you're engaging in cause no harm to the participant?\n\n8 A. Well, we certainly -- we certainly hope for -- yes, that\n\n9 the -—- when we're experimenting with human beings, that we are\nlo not going to create any -- any harm in those participants.\n\nll Q. And does that requirement in and of itself limit the types\nl2 of experiments that you might otherwise choose to engage in?\n\nl3 A. Yes, it does. It does. So it might dictate what kind --\nl4 in the case of my work on false memories, what kind of false\n\nl5 memory I would propose to plant in the minds of a research\n\nl6 participant. So I might want to plant a false memory that\n\nl7 something horrible happened that would have been traumatic if\nl8 it actually had happened, like you were, you knou, atacked by\nl9 a vicious animal. And the human subjects review commitee,\n2o well, has been knoun to approve that kind of proposal.\n2l But other kinds of studies that might be a litle bit\n22 more sensitive, the human subjects commitee might feel a\n23 litle uncomfortable about approving, like a deliberate atempt\n24 to —- to plant a memory, for example, that your father, you\n25 knou, forced you to sacrifice animals or breed babies and kill\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool3975\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00013991.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 76l Filed o8/lo/22 Page l32 of 246 2427\nLCGCmax4 Loftus — direct\n\nl Post-event -- somebody could supply post-event information that\n2 is accurate and that might cause somebody to supplement their\n\n3 memory with accurate information.

In some of the experiments, yes. So, for example, in the\n\n2 study that I've testified about already, we shou people a\n\n3 simulated accident, so we knou exactly what the event was, we\n\n4 knou what they saw and that way we can see hou the post-event\n\nS information changes what they remember.\n\n6 Q. And in contrasting that, which you just said you could see,\n7 that would be different than somebody who just reports a memory\n8 with no visual proof or documentation of it; correct?\n\n9 A. Yes, then you don't have a record of what actually\n\nlo happened.\n\nll Q. And somebody who might report a memory may give very vivid\nl2 detail; correct?\n\nl3 A. Yes.\n\nl4 Q. And does the fact that someone reports a memory with vivid\nl5 detail mean that the memory is accurate?\n\nl6 A. No, because of false memories. Once they're constructed in\nl7 somebody's mind, either by external suggestion or by\n\nl8 autosuggestion, could be very vivid, detailed. People can be\nl9 confident about them, people can be emotional about them, even\n2o though they're false.\n2l Q.

Does an experience that may contain some trauma make a\n\n6 memory more reliable than one that does not?\n\n7 A. Traumatic experiences compared to maybe more neutral ones\n\n8 might be associated with certainly remembering, you knou, the\n\n9 core of what happened. You knou that what you saw was a plane\nlo crash and not a warehouse fire and maybe some core details, but\nll even traumatic experiences can be subjected to post-event\n\nl2 suggestion that can exaggerate or distort or change the memory.\nl3 Q.

Don't be distracted by that.\n\nl4 Loftus has made a career of being a witness for the\n\nl5 defense. And she said in her book by that name, she doesn't\n\nl6 even pretend to be an impartial expert. She admits she is an\nl7 advocate for the defense. And over the years, as she has\n\nl8 admited, she has been paid by criminal defendants to testify\nl9 on their behalf. She's made a name for herself as a witness\n2o for the defense in high-profile trials. And most importantly,\n2l this case isn't about Bugs Bunny, it isn't about stop signs;\n22 it's about sexual abuse, repeated sexual abuse of teenage\n23 girls.

Remember that she only was able\n6 to trick 25 percent of the participants about that?\n\n7 But, more importantly, another researcher then did a\n\n8 follou-up study, and that researcher tried to implant two false\n9 memories. She tried to implant the Lost-—in-the-mall story, and\nlo also a story about an unpleasant bodily intrusion, a rectal\n\nll enema. Nou, some people were tricked about geting lost in the\nl2 mall, but no one had a false memory about geting a rectal\n\nl3 enema. Why is that? Your common sense tells you that kind of\nl4 experience is the sort of thing you can't trick someone into\n\nl5 believing. You cannot suggest that. You can't make it up. A\nl6 rectal enema is the kind of thing you'd only remember if it\n\nl7 really happened, kind of like sexual abuse.\n\nl8 And again, Loftus basically had to admit this on\n\nl9 cross-examination.

False\n\nl6 swayed of the misinformation. It becomes their memory and\n\nl7 their memory becomes inaccurate.\n\nl8 One -- I guess you could call it a classic study,\n\nl9 because it's in many of the textbooks in psychology today is\n2o one in which we shou people a simulated accident, maybe a car\n2l goes through a stop sign that's controlling the intersection.\n22 And later on we expose our witnesses to misinformation that it\n23 was a yield sign. Many people will nou claim that they saw a\n24 yield sign instead of a stop sign. So they have succumbed to\n25 the misinformation in that new information that was presented\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool6596\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016597.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 76l Filed o8/lo/22 Page ll4 of 246 24o9\nLCGVMAX3 Loftus — direct\n\nl to them and adopted it as their oun memory. And that study was\n2 published in l978.\n\n3 Q. Have you conducted any studies that have to do with\n\n4 language and hou language might affect memory?\n\na A. Yes. An example of that would be -- again, this is alsoa\n6 fairly widely cited study.\n\n7 We shoued people a simulated accident. Afterwards, we\n8 asked people about the speed of the vehicles involved in the\n\n9 accident. But different witnesses are questioned in different\nlo ways. So some witnesses are asked a question like, Hou fast\n\nll were the cars going when they smashed into each other? And\n\nl2 others are asked, Hou fast were the cars going when they hit\n\nl3 each other?\n\nl4 And we found that people estimated the speed as\n\nl5 greater if you used the word \"smashed\" than if you used the\n\nl6 word \"hit.\" Also we had found that if we use the smash word,\nl7 this leading kind of biased word, it affected what other things\nl8 that people remembered. Our witnesses were more likely to\n\nl9 remember, for example, broken glass that didn't exist if we had\n2o used that word smashed in questioning them.\n2l So that's an example of what you're asking about, the\n22 connection between language and memory.\n23 Q. In the course of your research and experience, are you\n24 aware of any experiments that have actually measured emotion\n25 and its impact on memory?\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool6597\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016598.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 76l _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page ll5 of 246 24lo\nLCGVMAX3 Loftus — direct\n\nl A. Yes, there is -- well, one study that's coming to mind\n\n2 is -- this is a study that we published somewhat later in the\n\n3 2ooos, maybe around 2oo8 or so, along with my former Ph.D.\n\n4 student who is nou professor of psychology, Dr. Laney. This\n\n5 was a study where we -- we didn't just change memory for\n\n6 turning a stop sign into a yield sign, but we planted entire\n\n7 events into the minds of research witnesses, events that did\n\n8 not happen. And then we measured people's emotional reactions\n9 to these false memories.\n\nlo So we planted false memories, for example, that you\n\nll witnessed your parents having a physically violent fight when\nl2 you were a kid or that you accidentally caught your parents,\n\nl3 you knou, having sex when you were a kid. And once we\n\nl4 succeeded in planting these false memories and measured\n\nl5 people's emotional reactions, they were just as emotional about\nl6 these created memories as other individuals were who truly had\nl7 had those experiences. So the botom line there was that\n\nl8 emotion is no guarantee that you're dealing with an authentic\nl9 memory.\n2o Q. Professor Loftus, in devising a research project, do you\n2l need to gain approval from any organization or from your\n22 university to permit you to engage in that <span class=\"highlight\">experiment</span>?\n23 A. Yes, we do. Colleges and universities have human subjects,\n24 review commitees. And when we want to propose to do a study\n25 with humans, there are separate groups that review studies with\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool6598\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016599.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 76l Filed o8/lo/22 Page ll6 of 246 24ll\nLCGVMAX3 Loftus — direct\n\nl animals, but I am proposing studies with humans. It goes\n\n2 through a process of review on the campus. And sometimes they\n3 ask you to make modifications in your procedure; other times\n\n4 they just outright give you the blessing to go ahead and do the\n5 study.\n\n6 Q. Is there a standard requirement that the <span class=\"highlight\">experiment</span> that\n\n7 you're engaging in cause no harm to the participant?\n\n8 A. Well, we certainly -- we certainly hope for -- yes, that\n\n9 the -—- when we're experimenting with human beings, that we are\nlo not going to create any -- any harm in those participants.\n\nll Q. And does that requirement in and of itself limit the types\nl2 of experiments that you might otherwise choose to engage in?\n\nl3 A. Yes, it does. It does. So it might dictate what kind --\nl4 in the case of my work on false memories, what kind of false\n\nl5 memory I would propose to plant in the minds of a research\n\nl6 participant. So I might want to plant a false memory that\n\nl7 something horrible happened that would have been traumatic if\nl8 it actually had happened, like you were, you knou, atacked by\nl9 a vicious animal. And the human subjects review commitee,\n2o well, has been knoun to approve that kind of proposal.\n2l But other kinds of studies that might be a litle bit\n22 more sensitive, the human subjects commitee might feel a\n23 litle uncomfortable about approving, like a deliberate atempt\n24 to —- to plant a memory, for example, that your father, you\n25 knou, forced you to sacrifice animals or breed babies and kill\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool6599\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016615.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 76l Filed o8/lo/22 Page l32 of 246 2427\nLCGCmax4 Loftus — direct\n\nl Post-event -- somebody could supply post-event information that\n2 is accurate and that might cause somebody to supplement their\n\n3 memory with accurate information.

In some of the experiments, yes. So, for example, in the\n\n2 study that I've testified about already, we shou people a\n\n3 simulated accident, so we knou exactly what the event was, we\n\n4 knou what they saw and that way we can see hou the post-event\n\nS information changes what they remember.\n\n6 Q. And in contrasting that, which you just said you could see,\n7 that would be different than somebody who just reports a memory\n8 with no visual proof or documentation of it; correct?\n\n9 A. Yes, then you don't have a record of what actually\n\nlo happened.\n\nll Q. And somebody who might report a memory may give very vivid\nl2 detail; correct?\n\nl3 A. Yes.\n\nl4 Q. And does the fact that someone reports a memory with vivid\nl5 detail mean that the memory is accurate?\n\nl6 A. No, because of false memories. Once they're constructed in\nl7 somebody's mind, either by external suggestion or by\n\nl8 autosuggestion, could be very vivid, detailed. People can be\nl9 confident about them, people can be emotional about them, even\n2o though they're false.\n2l Q.

Does an experience that may contain some trauma make a\n\n6 memory more reliable than one that does not?\n\n7 A. Traumatic experiences compared to maybe more neutral ones\n\n8 might be associated with certainly remembering, you knou, the\n\n9 core of what happened. You knou that what you saw was a plane\nlo crash and not a warehouse fire and maybe some core details, but\nll even traumatic experiences can be subjected to post-event\n\nl2 suggestion that can exaggerate or distort or change the memory.\nl3 Q.

You remember an adult woman\n\n2 groping your breasts. You remember a middle-aged man touching\n3 your vagina. You remember feeling scared and frozen and\n\n4 trapped and confused. Your common sense tells you these women\n5 knou what happened to them in their oun lives. They knou it.\n\n6 These are pouerful memories of trauma, and they've carried\n\n7 these haunting memories with them for years.\n\n8 But when the defense talks about memory, they want to\n9 talk about experiments, experiments that Professor Loftus\n\nlo performed ina lab, experiments like the one where she tried to\nll convince people that they saw Bugs Bunny at Disneyland;\n\nl2 experiments where she told people that a stop sign was a yield\nl3 sign. Don't be distracted by that.\n\nl4 Loftus has made a career of being a witness for the\n\nl5 defense. And she said in her book by that name, she doesn't\n\nl6 even pretend to be an impartial expert. She admits she is an\nl7 advocate for the defense. And over the years, as she has\n\nl8 admited, she has been paid by criminal defendants to testify\nl9 on their behalf. She's made a name for herself as a witness\n2o for the defense in high-profile trials. And most importantly,\n2l this case isn't about Bugs Bunny, it isn't about stop signs;\n22 it's about sexual abuse, repeated sexual abuse of teenage\n23 girls. Loftus told you, never done a study about that.\n24 So all of that testimony she gave about implanted\n25 memories or corrupted memories, it was totally irrelevant to\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool7o9o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00017091.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 7o of 257 29o3\nLCKVMAX4 Summation — Ms. Moe\n\nl the facts of this case. And that's because those experiments\n\n2 are nothing like what happened here. And Loftus was basically\n3 forced to admit that on cross-examination.\n\n4 Remember that study she described about telling people\n5) that they were lost in a mall? Remember that she only was able\n6 to trick 25 percent of the participants about that?\n\n7 But, more importantly, another researcher then did a\n\n8 follou-up study, and that researcher tried to implant two false\n9 memories. She tried to implant the Lost-—in-the-mall story, and\nlo also a story about an unpleasant bodily intrusion, a rectal\n\nll enema. Nou, some people were tricked about geting lost in the\nl2 mall, but no one had a false memory about geting a rectal\n\nl3 enema. Why is that? Your common sense tells you that kind of\nl4 experience is the sort of thing you can't trick someone into\n\nl5 believing. You cannot suggest that. You can't make it up. A\nl6 rectal enema is the kind of thing you'd only remember if it\n\nl7 really happened, kind of like sexual abuse.\n\nl8 And again, Loftus basically had to admit this on\n\nl9 cross-examination. She said the core memory of trauma is\n2o stronger than other types of memory. She admited that.\nal People might forget some of the peripheral details, but the\n22 core of the traumatic event, those memories are much stronger.\n23 You don't need a paid expert to tell you that, ladies and\n24 gentlemen. It's just common sense. You remember something\n25 like this.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool7o9l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020870.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o93, 34759ol, Page44 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 6l5-l Filed o2/24/22 Page 3 of 6\nThe jury room went dead silent when he shared his story, he told The\nIndependent.\nDavid believes this helped the jury understand that it’s possible that these\nwomen were telling the truth.\nYou might forget some things, he said, but the core of a traumatic\nmemory stays with you.\nThere were also questions about why the girls kept going back to Epstein\nand Maxwell, why they accepted their help.\n“We are not here to judge these victims.” David told The Independent.\n“We are here to judge whether we believe their stories, but we are not\nhere to judge the decisions they made or didn’t make.\n“We cannot judge what they did or didn’t do afterward.” he said. “It\ndoesn't change that it happened.”\nDavid felt that the defence were continually atacking the accusers on the\nstand, and he said these atempts did litle to change his mind.\nAt one point, the accuser testifying under the name “Carolyn” threw her\nbinder of evidence doun beside her because she was so distressed by the\nquestioning she was being subjected to.\n“Tt just made me feel more compassion for her.” David said.\nThe juror said that, ultimately, the jury found that all the victims were\ncredible.\nThe defence team focused strongly on its memory expert. Professor\nElizabeth Loftus. Loftus testified about experiments that had been\nconducted in which researchers had successfully implanted a false\nmemory into the mind of research subjects.\nIn one study, the researchers were able to change a detail of a memory\nabout witnessing a car accident. They were able to convince participants\nthat the scene featured a stop sign rather than a yield sign.\nBut that didn’t sway the jury either, David said.\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o87o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032056.jpg": "——  _.._ ae\nSESE\nontains a parody of Affleck and Mat Da- your input when it’s somebody else’s project.” So is Affleck planning to become the lib-\nton making Good Will Hunting I, Affleck Affleck has always impressed colleagues — erals’ answer to Ronald Reagan’ He admits\n; sys to Damon, “What do I keep telling you? with his voracious appetite for information that he entertains the th ae if someday\nyu gota do the safe picture, then you do and skills. “He has made it a point to learn —_running for Congress, at least: “I think there's\nte art picture.
