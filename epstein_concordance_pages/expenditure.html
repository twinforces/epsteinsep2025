Ghislaine Maxwell’s net worth varied in the period under review.”\n\nl5. Ghislaine Maxwell and her spouse’s net worth at 3l October 2o2o is approximately\nUS$22,5oo,ooo. This is an estimate based on the 2ol9 tax filings to the end of\nDecember 2ol9 and review of bank statements and explanations provided by her\nspouse where bank statements are currently unavailable. This figure includes\napproximately $7.67m of advance legal retainer fees.\n\nl6.

In light of our inability to access all of the bank statements for the entire period for\nthe reasons already explained in paragraphs 3 and 4 above, we have not been able to\nreview every movement of cash from every account; we can, houever, deduce from\nstarting or opening balances and the closing balances that we have reviewed in each\nyear that no significant sum of cash has been transferred outside of the control of\nGhislaine Maxwell and or her spouse. All of the principal sources and uses of cash\nfrom 2ol5 through 2o2o are covered by this report of financial condition without\nexception.\n\nSummary of Specific Transfers and Accounts\n\nl8. We noted that accounts controlled either by Ghislaine Maxwell and/or her spouse,\neither directly or indirectly, maintained substantial cash and equity balances of\napproximately $l6 million during the period under review. The cash and equity\nbalances clearly increased from the time of the disposal of the New York property.\nThere are many examples of transfers between accounts, movements triggered by the\nclosure of one banking relationship and the opening of new relationship (examples\ninclude the movement of cash and assets from as well\nmovements of cash maturing on deposit and other financial investments.\n\nl9. In its initial bail submission, the Government referenced transfers totaling more than\n$2o million in the earlier period of 2oo7-2oll which the Government described as\ntransfers from Jeffrey Epstein’s accounts to Ghislaine Maxwell’s accounts and vice\nversa. We noted in our review of the financial disclosure materials, that during the\nperiod 2oo7-2oll Ghislaine Maxwell acted as an officer of various corporate entities\nrelated to aircraft and air travel associated with Jeffrey Epstein and we noted\nsubstantial transfers involving these corporate entities. We did not note any transfers\nof this nature or the nature described by the government in the 2ol5-2o2o period\nwhich forms the subject of our Financial Condition Report.\n\n> Macalvins prepared a report of financial condition for Ghislaine Maxwell dated April 3o\"\n2ol7 (see appendices to this report). The report recorded assets legally and beneficially\nouned by Ghislaine Maxwell on the balance sheet date. The specific liability recorded arose\nfrom a personal guarantee given by Ghislaine Maxwell. This mater was resolved by the year\nend of 2ol7 without diminution of assets.\n5|Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2o66", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002068.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-l5 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 8 of lo\n\n24.

During daytime hours she was isolated in a larger\nspace. Atno time did she have contact with any other inmate. She was watched round-the-clock\nby a security detail dedicated exclusively to guard her as she was consistently monitored by video\nsurveillance. Her security detail rotated every two weeks and consisted of high-level BOP staffers\nrecruited from facilities outside New York who were instructed to guard a high-profile, high-\nsecurity inmate on suicide watch.'* Ms. Maxwell was subject to constantly changing rules and\nwhims. Her only source of information was from the guards who controlled her. They became the\nsource of information regarding rules, regulations, and opportunities. If they chose not to dispense\ninformation or if they provided incorrect information, she had no basis to challenge them. She was\ninstructed not to speak to them lest she face disciplinary sanction. Such is not the case in general\npopulation, where inmates assist other inmates and bear witness to and identify inconsistent and\nimproper treatment.\n\nUnlike other inmates, Ms. Maxwell was subjected to various prohibitions and deprivations\nnot common to other inmates.

The procedures in place deprived\nMs. Maxwell of any privacy and prevented uninterrupted sleep. The constant illuminations during\nthe night disrupted her sleep, leaving her sleep deprived and causing exhaustion that affected her\nability to concentrate. Initially, she was denied adequate and restful sleep by bright lights left on\nin her cell for 24 hours a day coupled with a flashlight shining into her eyes or cell every l5 minutes\n'* The cost of her individualized detention should be of great concern to the taxpaying public and warrants\nan investigation into the propriety of this enormous <span class=\"highlight\">expenditure</span> for a single non-violent inmate.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo469", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020037.jpg": "Casast:2o-8oo8RoHAEN ISSCUMENT/OD2 FileebBA3o/ Pag Page eB26lo45\n2o2o, other than daily living expenditures for her family and for professional services in the\ndefense of Ms. Maxwell from the charges she faces. (/d. § l6).\n\nThe Macalvins report confirms that Ms. Maxwell disclosed all of her foreign bank\naccounts in FBAR filings and properly disclosed her bank accounts, investments and other\nassets in her U.S. tax filings at all times. (Ud. §] 25, 3o). The report also explains that the\ntransfers of funds between various accounts in the past few years, which the government\nhighlighted in their initial bail submission (Dkt. 22 at ll-l2), reflected movements between\nbanks triggered by the closure of one banking relationship and the opening of new\nrelationship, as well movements of cash maturing on deposit and other financial\ninvestments. (/d. § l8).\n\nAt the last bail hearing, the government suggested that Ms. Maxwell’s finances were\n“opaque” and that she potentially had “significant [] undetermined and undisclosed wealth.”\n(Tr. 27; Dkt. 22 at ll-l2). The Macalvins report lifts this cloud of unjustified intrigue and\nprovides a straightforward answer: Ms. Maxwell and her spouse currently have assets worth\napproximately $22.5 million.® Accordingly, the proposed bond amount of $22.5 million\nrepresents all of the couple’s current assets.\n\nThe report further shous that Ms. Maxwell has no undisclosed wealth and is not\nhiding assets overseas. To the contrary, for the past several years, Ms. Maxwell and her\nhusband have disclosed their foreign assets by submiting FBAR filings regarding their\n\nthough the\nalance of the account is Nu ' GISclOS im the Macalvins report. we felt it necessary to redact the name of the bank\nbecause\nguidance on hou to proceed and provide the name of the bank to the Court and the government, if required.

(See Dkt. lo6 at l3). Ms. Maxwell will have no ability to contest\nextradition from France or the United Kingdom on the basis of citizenship, which removes any\nincentive the Court and government believe she may have to seek refuge in those countries.\n\nB. Restraint and Monitoring of Assets\n\nIn denying bail, the Court noted that the bond was not fully secured, and that Ms.\nMaxwell and her spouse would still have several million dollars in unrestrained assets that could\nbe used to facilitate her flight from the country. (See id. at l7-l8). To assuage any concerns that\nthose assets would be available to finance flight to and shelter in a foreign country, Ms. Maxwell\nhas taken steps to create a monitorship that will place meaningful restraints on the assets that are\nnot used to secure the bond, while still allouing Ms. Maxwell to pay for her legal defense, for\nher spouse to pay for daily living expenditures and for payment of taxes.\n\nl. New Account\n\nAll assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse, with the exception of money currently held in\nescrou for legal fees and related defense expenses and the funds contained in the bank account in\nthe name of Ms. Maxwell’s spouse (“the Personal Account”)!, will be deposited in a newly\ncreated account (“the New Account”) to be overseen by an asset monitor appointed pursuant to\norder of the Court. The New Account will contain all of Ms. Maxwell’s and her spouse’s\nremaining cash and other liquid assets, including any proceeds that result from the pending sale\nl The Personal Account is identified as Account I on page 9 of the Financial Report annexed to Ms. Maxwell’s\nRenewed Bail Application. (See Dkt. 97, Exhibit O.)\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol55", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020156.jpg": "CaSesb: 2o-8o o88oHAEN ZetuPhent /LOO l FileasaesF2igePAge 66st 9\n\nof Ms. Maxwell’s London house and any other assets, excluding salary, hereinafter acquired.\nThe asset manager will approve the financial institution at which the New Account is created and\nmust approve and co-sign any <span class=\"highlight\">expenditure</span> from the New Account, with the exception of\ndisbursements for Ms. Maxwell’s legal fees in connection with the ongoing criminal and civil\nlitigation and for payment of taxes, which will not require authorization.

Rather than suggest conditions to satisfy its concerns, the\ngovernment urges the Court to summarily reject the proposed monitorship.\n\nWilliam S.

He has agreed to serve by appointment of\nthe Court in a capacity similar to other trustees and receivers who serve as officers of the Court\nand are entrusted, pursuant to court order, with oversight authority to restrain, monitor, and\napprove disbursement of assets requiring his signature. Similar to others who have been\nappointed by courts to oversee financial maters, Judge Duffey will be compensated at the same\nhourly rate billed for his services as an ADR panelist for Federal Arbitration (FedArb).\n\nThe proceeds from the sale of Ms. Maxwell’s London home will be restrained and\nmonitored by Judge Duffey. As required by court order, documentation concerning the\nproceeds of the sale will be provided to Judge Duffey and the funds will be deposited in the\nfinancial account approved by Judge Duffey.\n\nThe government tries to steer the Court’s atention to allegations of Ms. Maxwell’s lack\nof candor to dissuade the Court from considering the proposed monitorship as a meaningful\nrestraint on the assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse. As previously stated, despite being\nquestioned by Pretrial Services follouing a period of solitary confinement, suicide watch, sleep\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol78"};
